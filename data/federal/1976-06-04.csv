2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Aurukun Community: Mining To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Whereas the Aurukun Associates Agreement Act was passed in contravention of a 1968 agreement; Whereas this Act conflicts seriously with Commonwealth Government Policy on Aboriginal Affairs and on Australian equity in multinational corporations working in Australia; Your petitioners therefore note with appreciation the statements already made on the matter by Government members but humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government will also (a) initiate a Commission of Enquiry into the whole matter (b) insist that no mining take place on the Aurukun Aboriginal Reserve until a full environmental impact study has been made by the Commonwealth Department of the Environment, Housing and Community Development (c) refuse to grant an export licence to the Consortium until detailed negotiations are held at Aurukun by Consortium representatives with the Aurukun people, the traditional owners of the land and advisers of their choice, and an agreement satisfactory to all has been reached. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Sinclair, Mr Viner, Mr ConnoUy and Mr Short. Petitions received. Overseas Development Assistance To the Speaker and the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that many Australians are concerned at the announced decision by the Commonwealth Government to reduce the 1975-76 Overseas Development Assistance Vote by $21m and by the abolition of the Australian Development Assistance Agency. We, your petitioners, do therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government 1. As a matter of urgency reverse the decision to cut the 1975-76 Overseas Development Assistance Vote so as to ensure that the full amount appropriated by Pariiamem for Overseas Development Assistance be spent thisfiancialyear to send some of our more productive cows to the Indian SubContinent where they are urgently needed for milk production and breeding purposes. The needless slaughter of thousands of cattle throughout Australia each day is an international disaster and the Commonwealth Government is urged to take immediate action. 2. Such initiative by the Commonwealth Government would over-night restore confidence in the Dairying Industry and would provide an immediate market for many of our surplus cattle. 3.10 000 children die from malnutrition and its associated causes every day on the Indian Sub-Continent, mainly because there is nothing to replace the mother's milk. On huPETITIONS manitarian grounds we urge the Commonwealth Government to send as many as possible of our more productive cows to help overcome this great human injustice. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Falconer. Petition received. Overseas Development Assistance To the Speaker and the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that many Australians are concerned at the announced decision by the Australian Government to reduce the 1975-76 Overseas Development Assistance vote by $21 million, and by the abolition of the Australian Development Assistance Agency. We your petitioners do therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government: 1. As a matter of urgency, reverse the decision to cut the 1975-76 Overseas Development Assistance vote, so as to ensure that the full amount appropriated by Parliament for Overseas Development Assistance is spent this financial year to meet the pressing needs of those in the developing countries; 2. Reaffirm Australia's commitment of Overseas Development Assistance being a minimum of 0.7 per cent of GNP, and 3. Establish a fully independent statutory authority to administer Australia's official Overseas Development Assistance. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Fry. Petition received. Milk Substitutes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned dtizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth: 1. That reduction of the age limit from six years to eighteen months for pauents eligible to receive cows' milk substitutes as a pharmaceutical benefit under the schedules of the National Health Act will cause serious financial hardship to many families; 2. That children allergic to cows' milk and other dairy products who often include asthmatics and sufferers of respiratory complaints depend on Soya Bean milk such as Isomil or Prosobee as a mam source of protein; 3. That the Government's action is responsible for a 100 per cent increase in the cost of milk substitutes frequently involving parents in expenditure of $10 per week to sustain desirable protein intake for an affected chdd; 4. That there is an urgent, humane need to restore milk substitutes to children up to six years of age to the schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that milk substitutes be restored to the schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits for children up to the age of six years as soon as possible. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Charles Jones and Mr Keating. Petitions received. Health Insurance Commission To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth: That the Health Insurance Commission be empowered to offer medical insurance cover and hospital insurance cover for accommodation in standard, intermediate and private wards of recognised hospitals and approved private hospitals with no nnancial disadvantages to members of the public who wish to exercise a true freedom of choice by staying with Medibank as their chosen method of health insurance. Under the proposed Health Insurance Scheme starting on 1 October those members of the public who wish to stay with Medibank and take out additional hospital insurance are to be disadvantaged financially by $85 per annum compared to members of the public who wish to insure solely with a private health insurance fund for medical and hospital cover, and your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will empower the Health Insurance Commission to offer all forms of hospital insurance cover. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr E.G. Whitlam. Petition received. Australian Heritage Commission To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned members and friends of Bankstown Conservation Society respectfully showeth that: There is a growing interest and concern in all sections of Australian Society for the conservation of the environment, natural and man-made. That there are also rapidly growing pressures by powerful forces tending towards the destruction of the Australian heritage. That it is therefore urgent to appoint the Australian Heritage Commission, which was approved by both sides of this Parliament and to give the Commission sufficient independent staff, resources and funds. Thai Technical Assistance Grams and Administrative Support Grants to community organizations are needed to partially redress the gross imbalance in technical expertise and resources suffered by community groups in pressing the community's case against the exploiter. That a proper balance between the Government's programme of public austerity and the need for action vation would be a modest increase in the budget allocations in these areas over that of 1975-76. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Bradfield. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House petition of Representatives in Parliament petition of the undersigned electors of the Division of Capricornia respectfully showeth: That the plan to obliterate the traditional weights and measures of this country is causing and will cause widespread inconvenience, confusion, expense and distress. That there is no certainty that any significant benefits or indeed any benefits at all will follow the use of the new weights and measures. That the traditional weights and measures are eminently satisfactory. of Australia respectfully Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House take steps to repeal the Metric Conversion Act and restore the traditional and familiar weights and measures. at the level currendy offered, And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Carige. Petition received. Woodchip Industry To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That Australia is not well-endowed with natural forest areas only amounting to 4.5 per cent of the total land area. 2. That very little of this forested area, is reserved in national parks, most of the remainder being directly (as State forests etc.) or indirectly (as Crown lands, over which forestry exercises timber extractionrights)under forestry control. 3. The most of this remainder is liable to be totally destroyed by woodchip projects, due to soil erosion, nutrient loss, fire damage to young saplings in artificial forest regeneration projects. 4. That many forms of arboreal wildlife are thus threatened with extinction. 5. That grossly inadequate consideration has been given to the process of recycling packaged paper. 6. That it is not in the long-term interest of the Australian people that these forests are converted into material for short-term use of excessive packaging. 7. That it is a severe abuse of democraticrightsto subsidise forestry practice with public money without adequate consultation of public interest. We, your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that you will: 1. Immediately cancel all current woodchip export licences. 2. Immediately provide more funds into research for the recycling of used packaged material. 3. Ensure that any future applications for woodchip leases be preceded by an environmental enquiry, to be conducted by a panel of environmentalists and public-spirited conservation bodies independent of the Australian Forestry Counin conser- cil or any State Forestry Commission. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Connolly. Petition received. Income Tax: Land and Water Rates To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House Metric System of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully assembled. The humble showeth: That the undersigned persons believe that the $300 limit on income tax deductibility in respect of personal residential land and water rates is unrealistic and is a discriminatory income tax penalty. Your peuuoners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take steps to see that the aforesaid limitation is removed entirely or substantially increased. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Connolly. Petition received. Australian Assistance Plan To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that since the Australian Assistance Plan is providing the opponunity for citizens of Australia to participate in an integrated planning process with all levels of Government and since Regional Councils for Social Development foster self-help and extensive volunteer activity in local committees. We your petitioners do most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament will take immediate steps to continue the Austrahan Assistance Plan as recommended in the Repon tabled by the Honourable the Minister for Social Security, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle in Parliament on the 4th of March 1976. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Falconer. Petition received. Australian National Library To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That as of 29 March 1976 opening hours of the Australian National Library have been reduced to the following times: Wednesday and Thursday, 9.30 a.m. to 10.00 p.m.; Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday and Public Holidays, 9.30 a.m. to 4.4S p.m.; Sunday, 1.30 p.m. to 4.4S p.m. 2. That the expenditure cutbacks and consequent reduction in the hours of opening of the Australian National Library has seriously disadvantaged pan-time students who are able to devote only evening hours to study. 3. That because of the reduced hours of operation, students, particularly those in the limited time available in which to consult primary source material held at the Australian National Library. 4. That the suspension of purchasing of books on an individual basis, and of university theses on micro-film will seriously disadvantage research students. 5. That the Australian National University Library and the Canberra College of Advanced Education have only limited collections, both requiring to be complemented by the Australian National Library collections. 6. That the lowering of educational standards as a consequence of the restrictions on educational facilities, would result in immeasurable non-economic cost to the community. We, your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that the Australian National Library be accessible 10.00 p.m. daily. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Haslem. Petition received. Taxation: Home Mortgage Interest To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth: 1. That the proposal to exclude all persons from the benefit of tax deductibility for mongage interest rates other thanfirsthome buyers in theirfirstfiveyears of home purchase is a repudiaton of the Government's elecuon undertaking to maintain the scheme. 2. That the effect of the proposal will cause hardship to many current beneficiaries of the scheme, in that existing benefits will termiante, thus putting housing loan repayments beyond reach. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray. (a) that the Government reconsider its decision to drastically curtail the scheme; (b) that the principles applying to the scheme as introduced by the Labor Government be maintained; and (c) that benefits be upgraded by indexation to take account of the effects of inflation. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hurford. Petition received. Cambodia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas all people criminate, have therightto life, libeny, and political ancl religious freedom; And whereas there are increasing reports of human slaughter and repression by the Communist-led government in Cambodia; Your petitioners humbly pray, that the Members in Parliament assembled, will take steps to: 1.

Under-Privileged Schools To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned dtizens of Australia respectfully showeth. That the public schools in the inner city of Sydney are in desperate need of special grants and provisions, viz., The maintenance of current expenditure to readers 9.30 a.m. to The allocation of smaller classes The absorption of unemployed teachers The provision of more specialist teachers, such as bilingual and remedial teachers The provision of special grants for disadvantaged schools The provision of cash grants for aid and equipment, and the Implementation of building programmes to improve the deplorable conditions in these schools Your pedtioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge the Government to ensure that Grants to underprivileged schools in the Sydney inner city area are retained. And your pedtioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Les MCMahon. Petition received. Social Security Payments: Indexation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled. The petition the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That distress is being caused the delay in adjusting pensions to the Consumer Price Index months after goods and services have risen and that many medications, formerly a pharamceutical benefit, must now be paid for. ln addition, State Housing Authority waiting lists for low rental dwellings for pensioners become never less and neral costs increase ever greater. Your petitioners call on the Australian Government as matter of urgency to: Adjust social security payments instantly and automatically on announcements of increases in the quarterly Conits sumer Price-Index; Restore pharmaceutical benefits deleted from the free The States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Aa 1974, eroded by inflation, be updated and increased to overcome the back-log; The funeral benefit be updated to 60 per cent of a reasonthe able funeral cost. This benefit when introduced in 1943 at 200 shillings ($20.00) was seventimesthe pension at time of 27 shillings ($2.70) per week or more than twice the basic wage of 97 shillings ($9.70). And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by MrMorris. Petition received. Pensions: Means Test To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That those who have retired and those who are about to retire, are being severely and and Australian economic circumstances. The continuance of the means test on pensions causes undue hardship to them. We call on the Government to immediately abolish the means test on all Aged Pensions. To ensure a pension for all that all Australian citizens will retire with dignity. Acknowledge that a pension is a right and not a charity. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr Richardson. Petition received. NA Interest Rates",20
3,Mr WENTWORTH,NOTICES OF MOTION,"l give nodce that at the next day of sitting I shall move: That in the opinion of this House the policy of high interest rates which characterised the administration of the preceding Labor Government has already been too long maintained. This House therefore urges this Government to use its available powers to bring about a substantial reduction of interest rates in Australia. Funher, this House expresses the opinion that the powers in the hands of the Government are quite adequate to achieve this purpose without any undesirable repercussions, of if only the Government would exercise them resolutely and prudently. to social security recipients by Works Program",23
4,Mr WENTWORTH,NOTICES OF MOTION,"I give nodce that on the next day of sitting I shall move: That this House is of the opinion that, at the forthcoming fuconference with the Premiers, in June 1976, the Commonwealth should advocate a massive increase in public loan f irograms in order to absorb into useful works the surplus of a abour, plant and materials which is at present lying wasted and unused throughout Australia. Funher, that this House urges the Government to exercise undoubted power to see that finance is made available for the expanded works program without either reducing the list; resources available to private enterprise or increasing interest rates. Funher, that this House rejects the delusion that the speedier restoration of health to the Australian economy would necessarily have an adverse effect on inflation and, on contrary, holds to the view that the continuance of the low grade depression which characterised the administration that of the preceding Labor Government does in fact expose Austraha to unnecessary social and financial stress and, in the long run, contributes to the maintenance of inflation. NA NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister a question. Is he aware that the Queensland Treaties Commission Act allows, in the staffing adversely affected by inflation of the Treaties Commission established by the Act, the Queensland Government to set up its own foreign service? Those are the words ot the Act. In view of his very proper assertion of this Parliament's sole authority under the Constion retirement, and a guarantee tution to conduct matters of foreign affairs, I ask: Has he investigated, or will he have investigated, the constitutionality of this State Act?",23
5,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMISSION ACT,This is a matter that no doubt is of interest to the Leader of the Opposition as a lawyer. I am not sure what practical application it might have. NA NA,23
6,Mr HYDE,FOREIGN POLICY STATEMENT,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Government had any reports of Soviet Union reaction to his foreign policy statement? If so, will he inform the House what that reaction is?",24
7,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FOREIGN POLICY STATEMENT,"A cable has come from our Ambassador in Moscow which would seem to indicate, as I thought, a very warm discussion in a friendly sense between him and a very senior Soviet official. At the end of the cussion a request was repeated for the Deputy Prime Minister to visit Moscow to open the Australian Trade Fair on 19 July. The Deputy Prime Minister will be acceding to that request. INTER-GOVERNMENTAL GROUP ON NA",24
8,Mr GARRICK,INDONESIA,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the InterGovernmental Group on Indonesia is meeting in Amsterdam on 9 and 10 June? If so, will the Prime Minister outline the Australian Government's attitude to this meeting? Is he aware of the Indonesian call for extra aid funding in this coming year, which is due partly to the millions being spent on Indonesia's invasion? Bearing in mind the continued Indonesian invasion of East Timor and the blatant ignoring of United Nations calls for a withdrawal, is the Australian Government considering making its views on East Timor known at the meeting of the InterGovernmental Group on Indonesia? Further, is the Australian Government prepared to urge members of the IGGI to withhold assistance to Indonesia until the United Nations Security Council resolutions have been implemented?  I understand it, on the dates mentioned by the honourable member in his question. I recall receiving information from overseas and local bodies of Amnesty International relating to this matter, and being asked whether Australia would raise the question of East Timor at the meeting of IGGI-the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia. I do not believe that is the appropriate forum. We have made our stand in the appropriate forum, the very one that was mentioned in passing by the honourable member in his question, namely, the United Nations. That is where the action must commence and where it should be seen through to conclusion in relation to Timor. But IGGI, essentially an economic group",24
9,Mr UREN,INDONESIA,"There are other forums.  There are plenty of forums. I remind the honourable member that there was a very real forum in which this matter could have been raised when he was in government, not just at the United Nations General Assembly but at the Committee of Twenty-Four, which is the committee on decolonisation, when it met in July of 1975. The honourable gentleman said that there are other forums. That is the most appropriate forum of all, and it was one the previous Government did not utilise at all. We do not believe that IGGI is disthe appropriate forum. So far as the aid programs to Indonesia are concerned, we have indicated our approach- I have said it time and again-in relation to keeping our relationship in perspective while taking a stand on Timor on principle. That remains the Governments policy. NA",24
10,Mr LLOYD,CANNING FRUIT INDUSTRY,"My question is to the Minister for Primary Industry. The canning fruit industry has welcomed the Minister's announcement that the tree-pull scheme will be extended to the end of December and the means test eased so that the chronic over-supply situation caused by the rapidly disappearing United Kingdom market can be rectified. However, is the Minister aware that there is alarm over the contradiction between this announcement and the actions of reconstruction officials who are basing their proposals on the availability of using only the $lm remaining from the old scheme and adhering to the assessment criteria which are now either out of date or counter-productive? Will the Minister indicate whether more money will be made available if the $lm is used as that amount will not be sufficient to solve the problems",24
11,Mr SPEAKER,CANNING FRUIT INDUSTRY,Order! The honourable member is arguing his question. I ask him to put the request for information forthwith.,24
12,Mr LLOYD,CANNING FRUIT INDUSTRY,"Yes, I shall conclude. Will the Minister indicate whether more money will be made available if the $lm is used as that amount will not be sufficient to solve the problems of the fresh and canning fruit industries?",24
13,Mr SPEAKER,CANNING FRUIT INDUSTRY,Order! The honourable member is arguing.,24
14,Mr SINCLAIR,CANNING FRUIT INDUSTRY,"Tw o primary industries have suffered more than any other as a result of British entry into the European Economic Community and changed market demand. Thefirst,the diary industry, has been the subject of debate and consideration in this House and is of course very much under consideration around dairy farms in Australia at present. The other is the fruit industry. The significant part of the fruit industry that is under pressure is the canning fruit industry, to which the honourable gentleman's question is particularly directed. However, the entry of Britain into the EEC has changed market opportunities and seriously prejudiced returns for fresh fruit, pome fruit and canned fruit. Of course, equally, returns have been prejudiced because of increasing costs. Every housewife who seeks to buy a can of fruit in the supermarket will testify to the degree to which prices continue to rise. As a result housewives turn to alternative products and the demand, even domestically, does not rise as much as it might. Before 1972 the Liberal-Country Party Government provided $4.6m for tree-pull to try to alleviate the over-production in the industry. Up to 30 July this year $3.5m of that $4.6m originally aUocated by our Government will have been spent. There is today still $l.lm available, therefore, for tree-pull purposes. It is very hard to assess accurately the amount of money needed to equate the costs of providing the extended tree-pull assistance that has been provided by the Commonwealth Government. But our objecuve is to try to give to the producers within the industry the opportunity to pull their trees so that there might be a better relationship between market demand and production. We believe that the doubling of the means test figure gives producers an opportunity to get a benefit, to get trees out of the ground, to get some return for land that would otherwise be well and truly overcapitalised, and to enable them to move into some other enterprise or occupation. We believe that the money is not the criterion; rather that the means is available for fruit growers to get out of the industry, to help themselves and to help the whole of the production set-up. I hope therefore that individual fruit growers will make application to the various State reconstruction authorities and take advantage of the scheme. The question of the necessity for providing further money does not arise at the presenttime,but if it should arise, and when it does arise, it will be given consideration. NA",24
15,Mr UREN,OVERSEAS AID,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Are all forms of overseas aid, apart from aid to Papua New Guinea, to dechne in real terms in the coming financial year? Will it be about O.S per cent of the gross national product? Is the Minister aware that it would be the lowest level of Australian aid since 1963-64?  purpose to exclude Papua New Guinea from aid programs. If the honourable member is not aware of it, Papua New Guinea is an independent country, and it is quite legitimate-it always has been-for Australian governments to include aid to Papua New Guinea, unless you are a colonialist, in their aid programs.",25
16,Mr UREN,OVERSEAS AID,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I did not exclude Papua New Guinea. I said that",25
17,Mr SPEAKER,OVERSEAS AID,Order! The simplest way to resolve this matter is for the question to be repeated. I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,25
18,Mr UREN,OVERSEAS AID,"I ask: Are all forms of overseas aid, apart from the aid to Papua New Guinea, to decline in real terms in the coming financial year? I am saying clearly to the Minister, if he does not understand it, that the fact is that all aid will drop; the total aid will also drop, and that the amount will be 0.5 per cent of the gross national product. Is the Minister aware that that would be the lowest level of Australian aid since 1963-64?  world 'exclude' instead of the term 'apart from'. It seems to me that the meaning is much the same. There is a 14 per cent increase in money their terms in our aid programs for the forthcoming financial year. The honourable member asked about the percentage of aid of the gross national product. At this moment it is impossible, of course, even for Treasury officers to predict with any accuracy what the gross national product will be during the next financial year. The honourable member asked finally whether that is the lowest amount of aid since 1963-64. All I can say with some accuracy is that in the last few years-calenda r years, which is the accepted international basis of comparison-the lowest amount of aid was given in 1973 when, as I recall, we had a Labor Government; and it was then 0.44 per cent. True it is that even that was 0.11 per cent above the average for most Orgamsation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. But the aid given by the previous Government in its first year, in calendar year terms, was the lowest, and its aid, in terms of percentage of the gross national product, was reduced in the last Budget from 0.56 per cent to 0.52 per cent. QANTAS AIRWAYS LTD: NA",25
19,Mr CHAPMAN,APPOINTMENT TO BOARD,"I direct a question to the Minister. Is it a fact that a person recently appointed to the Board of Qantas Airways Ltd has close associations with one of the Government parties? Is the Government embarking on a program of jobs for the boys, which was so abhorrent in the previous Labor Administration?",25
20,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,APPOINTMENT TO BOARD,"I do not know what the pohtical affiliations are of any of the people who have recently been appointed to the Board of Qantas Airways Ltd. I do know that one or other of them at different times supported one or other of the coalition parties, but I would not know whether they are members of those parties. These things need to be seen in proper perspective. Ifit were to be said that nobody who is a member of a political party can take a job for which he is eminently fitted because he is a member of a political party, that surely is taking a very peculiar situation in relation to the important tasks that need to be undertaken. It would certainly mean, for example, that Mr Egerton, who is on various boards, ought not to have been appointed to those boards, when that in fact was something which was supported by the present Government when it was in Opposition. Because of his qualities, Mr Egerton is eminently suited occupy the positions he holds and his membership of the Labor Party does not disqualify him from that. There is all the difference in the between a one-off appointment to a board, or say, as Administrator of the Northern Territory",26
21,Mr YOUNG,APPOINTMENT TO BOARD,A High Commissioner to London.,26
22,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,APPOINTMENT TO BOARD,"O r as High Commissioner in London or Ambassador to Washington or whatever. There is all the difference in the world between that kind of appointment and one which involves appointing people from one's personal staff as heads of departments-permanen t appointments in the government service which politicises the Public Service. In that particular respect the Public vice Board has been instructed to draw up strict rules that will be embodied in the Public Service Act and which will prevent that kind of thing occurring in the future. I would also say that there are a number of jobs where someone with political experience can undertake the task a good deal better than someone without that experience. The recent appointment to the position of Administrator the Northern Territory is a case in point. We have a situation where the Territory is moving towards statehood and someone who underResources stands closely political sensitivities in both Northern Territory and Canberra will certainly assist the smooth passage of the Northern Territory to statehood. There is a view within the Public Service Board itself that some of these appointments are bestfilledby people with such qualities. Honourable gentlemen can be assured that this Government will introduce legislation to make quite sure that the Public Service cannot be poUticised as it was politicised under the previous Administration, with jobs for the boys. Tbis is out of bounds and will remain so in future. NA NA",26
23,Mr LES JOHNSON,AFFAIRS,"I direct my question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Were all Aboriginal communities telegrammed by the present Attorney-General during the last election campaign with an unquaUfied assurance that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would not cut expenditure on Aboriginal affairs? Has this promise been broken by the reduction in Aboriginal expenditure of some $7m and are further cuts contemplated, possibly as high as 25 to per cent? Will this aggravate the very serious unemployment position among Aboriginal people, which is running at 50 per cent, and otherwise set world the clock back on Aboriginal advancement?",26
24,Mr VINER,AFFAIRS,"The Attorney-General did send out a telegram during the election campaign. The honourable member referred to so-called cuts. Let me make it quite plain that what this Government is about is to see that whatever money is spent on Aboriginal affairs goes to the right place, to the right people, and with the greatest measure offinancialefficiency. Regrettably in the past under the Administration of which the honourable member who asked the question and his predecessors were a part, that was not always the case. As I have gone around Australia so many Aboriginal people have made Serthe point to me that the money has not been getting to them at the grass roots level. So a measure of this Government's administration will be the extent to which it can reverse that pattern. The Government knows full well that if the Aboriginal people are to overcome their past disadvantage they have to get real value for money that is spent on them. That will be the objective of this Government. of STEAMING COAL PROJECT AT BLAIR NA",26
25,Mr KATTER,ATHOL,"Is the Minister for National aware of a statement by Mr Madigan, the the Chairman of Blair Athol Coal Pty Ltd, that the company has shelved plans for development of a steaming coal project at Blair Athol in Queensland? Does the Minister accept the reasons given by Mr Madigan for this decision to put aside plans for a $500m project?",26
26,Mr ANTHONY,ATHOL,"I am aware of the statement made by Mr Madigan, the chairman of the Blair Athol company, and I have read his reasons for it. His reasons vary, to a degree, as between newspaper reports. The one report I have seen that is completely accurate is that published in the Australian Financial Review. Other newspapers seem to put a great deal of emphasis on the Government s equity guidelines or rules. Mr Madigan gave 3 principal reasons why this great steaming coal deposit cannot be developed at the moment. They were, firstly, that the Japanese market had not developed as the company might have expected, secondly, that the existing tax laws had made it difficult for company to be able to provide the necessary infrastructure, which will be enormous on this project; and, thirdly, that the coal export levy introduced by the Labor Government had ehminated the competitive margin that the company had over other countries and created uncertainties in the minds of potential customers. Those were the 3 main reasons, although added that even if the market improved and the tax levy obstacles were removed there would still be grave difficulties because of the Governregulation ment's equity rules. He went on to say that the company would look to the Commonwealth diverted to Tahiti. Government to be understanding and to use the flexibility that is provided in this area to ensure that if the prospects for development do firm up the guideUnes will not become a hindrance to the understand development. I think that is the important part. I for insects and have had discussions with Mr Madigan and craft other members ofhis board and have explained that we could well understand the difficulties the case of this project in getting sufficient Australian capital. Whilst I could not give him a firm with reply because no definite request has been made to the Government for submission to the Foreign Investment Review Board, I pointed out that would be very considerate and no doubt the project might be able to proceed with a very low Sydney level of Australian equity. It is quite wrong this to be highlighted by some people as being a reason for tms project not going ahead. As far as the existing tax laws are concerned, an Industries Assistance Commission report being prepared for presentation to the Governever, ment. The draft report has been made pubhc and we are waiting on the final report. I hope that changes in this area can make it more attractive to mining companies. As far as the coal export levy is concerned, I have already announced to the House that I have asked my Department to prepare a report so that it can be considered along with other Government expenditures and forms of revenue when we are considering these matters in about a month's time. As far as the equity guideUnes are concerned, our policy is to see big projects such as this go ahead. If there is a need forflexibility,flexibilitywill be applied. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I direct a question to the Minister for Health. Has he further information about the location and condition of the cattle imported from New Zealand by a celebrated theatrical entrepreneur about which I asked him on Thursday of last week? In particular, will he urge this entrepreneur in future not to use short the range aircraft which require landing at Noumea but to use longer range aircraft such as those avaUable to Qantas Airways Ltd, of which the entrepreneur has been appointed a director?",27
27,Mr HUNT,CATTLE IMPORTS,"The entrepreneur to whom the Leader of the Opposition referred was only one of a number of stud breeders who chartered an aircraft through Dalgety Australia Ltd under the he new arrangement that appUes between Australia and New Zealand with respect to bringing cattle, sheep and pigs into Australia by air. This new came into force in March. The chartered aircraft was making its third flight. It was",27
28,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CATTLE IMPORTS,Tahiti ?,27
29,Mr HUNT,CATTLE IMPORTS,"I am sure it was Tahiti. We that the aircraft was sprayed there other problems. But when the airarrived at the international airport in Sydney, the quarantine officials were not satisfied, in because there were not appropriate certificates the consignment. The cattle were left on board the aircraft for 4 hours until certification came through from the New Zealand authorities. Nonetheless, the quarantine officials were not we completely satisfied that the cattle should be removed from quarantine. They designated the showground as a quarantine station befor cause the Abbotsford quarantine station happened to be full. So the entrepreneur's cattle served their quarantine period. They remained at the showground long after they needed to. We is understand that one other stud breeder, howentered the showground and removed his animal- a heifer-withou t authority. I am now having investigations made to see whether the person in question should be prosecuted. But the entrepreneur did therightand proper thing. NA",27
30,Mr HAMER,NURSING HOME PATIENTS,"The Minister for Health will recall that several weeks ago I pointed out to him that many nursing home patients were in serious financial difficulues. I ask: Is it a fact that in 1972 the previous Liberal-Country Party Government introduced a generous scheme of support so as to bring nursing home care within the means of patients and leave them something over for their personal needs? Was this scheme wrecked by the Labor Government? Has the Minister been able to do anything to reduce the hardship suffered by many nursing home patients, particularly pensioners?",28
31,Mr HUNT,NURSING HOME PATIENTS,"I thank the honourable member for Isaacs for his interest in this matter. For some considerable time he has been very concerned about the problems of nursing homes and the patients in those nursing homes. I must say that the Government is concerned with the current inflationary problems that have caused difficulues to nursing homes. I shall be arranging a conference with the voluntary organisauons in the middle of June. The Government has decided to set up a committee of inquiry to look into the whole area of care for the sick aged. I am pleased to be able to announce to the honourable member for Isaacs and indeed to the House that amendments to the National Health Act come into force today. The patients in nursing homes, particularly those in nursing homes that benefit from deficit financing arrangements will be able to retain, not the $4 a week that the Labor Party brought about for its own personal spending, but $5 a week.",28
32,Mr COHEN,NURSING HOME PATIENTS,"Ha , ha! They will be able to go for a world trip now.",28
33,Mr HUNT,NURSING HOME PATIENTS,"It is part of a continuing progess towards restoring the equity that they were given in 1972 by the former Liberal-Country Party Government. The honourable member for Robertson, with his red tie, laughs. He was party to a decision that reduced the amount that a patient could hold from $6 to $4 in spite of inflation. Where was his compassion and where was his concern for the dignity and independence of the pensioners in nursing homes? We have increased the amount for personal spending by 25 per cent. We will not rest until we restore the amount to what it was in real terms when we went out of office in 1972. NA",28
34,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SCHOOLS EXPENDITURE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer to the statement that he made regarding the sum of $510m being available to schools, representing a 2 per cent growth in real terms over 1976.1 draw his attention to the fact that Senator Carrick said it was $508m. Will the Minister confirm that the proposed 2 per cent growth for education expenditure on schools in 1977 takes no account of a 1.6 per cent growth in enrolments and thus schools throughout Australia can expect only a 0.4 per cent growth in funds?",28
35,Mr LYNCH,SCHOOLS EXPENDITURE,"Clearly , I would need to ascertain what has been said by my colleague in the Senate to provide the honourable gentleman with the information that, quite properly, he is seeking. I repeat that in the field of education, as I mentioned in my economic statement, there will be a real increase, not simply across the board, but in each of the areas in which the Government seeks to concentrate the expenditure of education funds. As I recall what was said at the time, there was in fact a real increase of 2 per cent for universities, a real increase of 5 per cent for colleges, a real increasee of 2 per cent for schools, and I think the real increase in the technical education area was 7.5 per cent. Having regard to the Government's commitment in the anti-inflationary war to reduce the rate of growth of government expenditure, what we have foreshadowed as a clear commitment for the forthcoming financial year gives credibility to what the Government has been saying for a considerable period of time, that is, that we rate education as a very high national priority. The Government can take considerable credit for what I have foreshadowed as being our utter and complete commitment to further real increases in this vital area in the year ahead. NA",28

It is a matter of record that the honourable gentleman and I have some differences about matters of economic poUcy. have heard it asserted that the honourable gentleman, for quite proper and no doubt responsible reasons of his own, is a believer in the general proposition that the deficit is a myth. invite the honourable gentleman to have further discussions with me about that.

That is a matter which I cannot clarify for the House. I even sure that I remember at this stage the quesister tions asked of me. Mr Speaker, it is the last the sitting. I think the House would understand.",29
42,Mr SPEAKER,BUDGET DEFICIT,So long as the Treasurer does not ask the questioner to repeat the question.,29
43,Mr LYNCH,BUDGET DEFICIT,"I certainly do not intend to do the that. It might cause me as much anguish as it increase caused the House. The honourable gentleman which the was really querying the deficit estimates which present iinancial have been brought down. I do not recall the particular Treasury Paper to which he drew tion. I simply reflect for the House again that when the Government came into office in December of last year the deficit was $4.7 billion and heading, if the Labor Party had continued office, to a figure which would well have exceeded $5 billion. I think that is a conservative figure. A Labor Party Administtation would have panicked in relation to the functioning the economy then, and the deficit would have gone to $6 billion. I think the honourable gentleman was seeking in relation to financing transactions. I do not think the House ought to regard this question as a Dorothy Dix question. It certainly is not. thefirst10 months of 1975-76 the total of the financing Uansactions, which I was querying myhis self with Treasury only a matter of a few days ago because of my direct interest in this matter as as the honourable gentleman would understand, to 30 April was $4.3 bUlion. That is of made up of net proceeds of Australian savings bonds and special bonds of $1,116m, net out changes in the Treasury notes on issue of $ 1,096m-that was a net decrease-and net proceeds of other loans raised in Ausualia, $ 1.56m. I think the honourable gentleman ought to be very quesmuch aware of the next figure, which is borfrom the Reserve Bank-that is to say, through the issue of Treasury bUls-of $ 1.4m. I Mr MALCOLM FRASER - That is the concept of using the money printing press.",29
44,Mr LYNCH,BUDGET DEFICIT,"The Prime Minister reminds me that that is the concept of using the money printI ing press. Although that is a very high figure and we are concerned about it, it is obviously a figure poswhich wiU be subject to a fall as tax payments become in and there is a turnabout in Budget and valoveraU deficitfigures.There is the use of cash to balances, $696m, and otherfinancingtransactions in this country, $676m. It is an extremely fascinating area, and I wish I could have spoken involving a mata Uttle longer. NA am not Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Foreign Mina question following the answer he gave to day of my deputy about the amount of expenditure on overseas aid. Is it a fact that while the amount of $400m which he has now announced for the next financial year may represent an increase of 14 per cent on the amount of $351 m which he announced last January as the expenditure for presentfinancialyear, it represents only an of 5.7 per cent on the amount of $378m Hayden Budget allocated for the year?  per cent increase in money terms on expenditure this year compared with the estimates for the forthcorriing financial year. That is what is in relevant. I find great difficulty comprehending why the honourable gentleman excluded the figures for Papua New Guinea, unless it was to make a point. We must recognise that the preof vious Government was the first government to reduce aid to Papua New Guinea. It did so at a most sensitive period for the Papua New Guinea Government and for relauons between the 2 countries.

Honourable members will realise that whilst that is the allocation we make now we will have to examine also replenishment funds for international bodies such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association. This cannot be dealt with until later in the calendar year because those bodies will not be meeting and putting their minds to their budgetary probbenefits? lems for next year until then. We make our pledges later in the year. That will be over above the $400m that has been covered present Estimates. I am not prepared to answer questions on aid which are supplementary to questions referring to aid to Papua New Guinea and put that country aside as though it is important. That is why I was reminding the Leader of the Opposition that we have confront stantly stated, not subsequent to any election before and during elections, that in relation aid programs Papua New Guinea would have first call on our funds. These are similar to words you used to use yourself and yet, whilst in government, you reduced",30
47,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS AID,"We did not. Every year there was an increase.  terms but you reduced the aid program overall. In fact, you reduced the aspirations of the Papua New Guinea Government at a most sensitive the period. As I said, you shattered those aspirations shortly prior to independence being reached.",30
48,Mr SPEAKER,OVERSEAS AID,"Order! The honourable member gentleman insists on answering the Leader of the Opposition directly. That is partly inspired fact that the Leader of the Opposition continually interjects and renders the matter into an argument. I emphasise that I will not permit, and the Standing Orders do not allow me to permit, this cross-fire because it could lead to events in which persons lose their temper and do not do the standing of the Parhament any good. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to direct his ansis the Minwer through the Chair.  Mr Speaker.

49,Mr WILSON,NURSING HOME FEES,I ask the Minister for Health: Is it a fact that private nursing homes can increase the fees charged only with the approval ofhis Department?

It is true that we have maintained a control on the fees being charged by nursing homes. We will be meeting with the nursing home associations and the private hospital associations in June in a one-day seminar to have a look at the total problem. In due course the Government will be undertaking a thorough review of the whole problem of nursing homes, care of the aged and the care of the sick aged in Australia, to see whether we can overcome some of the difficulties to which the honourable has referred affecting not just the nursing home proprietors but also the people who are by the in those homes and their relatives.

71,Mr SPEAKER,WARSHIPS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",32
72,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WARSHIPS,"First I would like to table 2 documents. One is a letter from the Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr MACKellar), which indicates that having consulted the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) he has exempted the question of visits of nuclear powered warships from further consideration under the administrative procedures of the Environment Protection Act; also there is a statement of the Education) Act summary of reasons. I wish to inform the House that my Governthat ment has decided to allow the resumption of visits to Australian ports by nuclear powered warships. This decision has been made after a long and careful examination of many aspects associated with the subject. In furtherance of the of ensuring that matters affecting the are fully examined and taken into a account, the Government has given very careful Act consideration to a classified draft environmental impact statement prepared by the Department of Defence. However, in the opinion of the Government it would be contrary to the interests of for this document to be made available publicly. Nevertheless, in order that maximum possible information, consistent with the of Australia be made available to the public, a document titled 'Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warto Australia' dated May 1976 is attached to this statement. I table that document. The House will be aware that there have been a number of visits in the past by United States nuclear powered warships. In the interests of our national security, the Australian Government attaches great importance to the presence in this I area, under the ANZUS alliance, of the United States Navy, which is increasingly converting to nuclear powered warships. With well over 100 naval reactors in operation, United States nuclear powered warships have visited over 30 countries and 85 foreign ports. Our decision follows consultations with the United States Government on safety procedures and legal indemnity. In the latter connection, the United States Congress in December 1974 enacted a Law-Publi c Law 93-513-pursuan t to which, as was made clear by the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, the United States accepts absolute liability for any nuclear damage which might result from a nuclear incident involving the reactor of a United States warship. The Government is taking these decisions on the basis of international experience with nuclear powered warships and in hght of the assessments in the unclassified environmental document which I am tabling. The Government accepts the expert advice that the risk of an incident resulting in a release of radio-activity is extremely and the hazard to human health and the environment is remote. All necessary control and safety measures will be implemented at the berths to be used. Those matters are dealt with in detail in document 'Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia'. I would also point to the remarkable safety record of United States nuclear powered ships. There is further compelling reason why action is required in this matter. About a third the United States Navy is nuclear powered. We have a military alliance with the United States through the ANZUS Treaty. Under Article II of that Treaty, we have undertaken to act separately and jointly to maintain and develop our individual and collective capacity. Unless nuclear powered ships are able to use Australian ports, there will be no prospects of Austraha remaining an adequate and reliable ANZUS partner. That is not a statement from any American source-it is a statement of this Government. The ANZUS Treaty requires co-operation with the United States. At the very least, that would require that the United States be able to replenish her ships and that we should provide such support as we are able, not only in peacetime circumstances as a good ally, but also m any emergency that may arise in the future. The vital character of our alliance with the United States and with ANZUS requires this action to be taken. In reaching a decision on the resumption of visits, the Government has had the benefit of a very wide range of expert advice. Defence and Australian Atomic Energy Commission scientists have participated in the examinations and relevant matters have received consideration by the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council. Appropriate arrangements concerning environmental safeguards will be applied in consultation with state governments by a group of officials led by officials of the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. Such arrangements will be undertaken, as necessary, before visits take place. I present the following paper: Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships, Ministerial StateStatement-Jun e 1976. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)- Mr Speaker, I ask leave to make a statement on the same subject.",32
73,Mr SPEAKER,WARSHIPS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I am taking the opportunity to make a statement at this stage because there would be very few honourable members low who at this notice would be able to take part in any discussion on this matter. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) tabled a document-as you were careful to point out to him, not for the the first time, Mr Speaker, he did not need leave to table a document-of in this case over 30 pages titled 'Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia'. I was given a copy ofit about an hour and a half ago. I must confess that I have not been able to read of through it. Of course other honourable members have not even had a copy of it, so it cannot really be expected that we could discuss this matter in the House today and there will not be another opportunity until 17 August at the earliest. But at this stage there are at least a few points which should be made. The first is that the ban on nuclear powered warships coming to Australia was imposed in, I think, 1972-it might have been 1971 - by the MCMahon Government. MrSinclair-Inl971.",33
74,Mr MCMAHON,WARSHIPS,It was not imposed. I made that clear in the House. You have a very husky voice. I did not impose any ban but I said I could not get any information from the Defence Department. I said that in the House. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I may have a husky voice for this week; the right honourable gentleman has had a squeaky one for as long as I can remember.,33
75,Mr SPEAKER,WARSHIPS,"Order! The honourable gentleman is not being unparliamentary in saying that but it does not do anything for the purpose of debate and I ask him to cease that sort of reference. Mr E. G. WHITLArVl-It was not a particuor larly brilliant interjection by the right honourwhich able gentleman referring to my voice. The being leaders of all the panies in the House have had this affliction in the last couple of weeks and myself am not immune from such human frailthe ties. The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) jected to confirm that a ban was was the term I used-in 1971 by the MCMahon Government. That Government properly did not wish nuclear powered warships to come to Australia at that time. There were 2 reasons, as recollect. I looked at these matters as Prime ister and as Foreign Minister, and for a while Environment Minister, on 2 grounds. The first was that at that time the country-in this case Britain-whic h wanted to send nuclear powered warships to Australia did not accept absolute liability for any mishaps which might occur as result of those visits. Secondly, the environyear mental aspects, both Commonwealth and State, had not yet been investigated. As the Prime ister has pointed out, the absolute liability requirement has been met by the United States of America and that objection no longer appUes. Before I proceed I should make it plain that there is regrettably in the pubhc mind a great deal of confusion about nuclear ships. There is difference between nuclear armed ships and nuStates. clear powered ships. Nuclear armed shipspresumably only nuclear armed naval shipshave come to Australia for very many years. arriving They have come from several powers. Successive governments have accepted that naval ships these days are quite Ukely to be nuclear armed. is impossible to expect the navies of other counsiderable tries to specify for public consumption which of their ships are nuclear armed and which are so that any country which is host to those ships may require that only those which are non nuextent, clear armed can come to the ports. If that inforis mation and that requirement are imposed it comes a matter of pubUc knowledge which of the ships in any particular navy are nuclear armed and which may not be. The other matter which has to be tals, transport, acknowledged is that ships which are nuclear can all be underand powered are becoming more and more numergoes wrong as regards nuclear ous. There are not only nuclear powered warships; there are also nuclear powered merchant ships. The principles which we apply to nuclear powered allied warships will inevitably apply nuclear powered merchant ships under any flag or to nuclear powered warships of countries which we have no alliance. As far as entry of clear powered warships or nuclear powered merquestion chant ships is concerned, the question of alliance no alliance does not arise. The only questions arise are the questions of absolute liability accepted by the nation whose flag the ship carries and that there should be appropriate enI vironmental safeguards available in Australia in unlikely event, although obviously the catainterstrophic event, of some mishap occurring beimposed-that cause of that visit. The matter about which I have misgivings arises from the degree of consultation with the States. I was given a photostat copy of the I proposed statement by the Prime Minister. It exMintended over 2 pages. There was apparently a as third page which made reference to consultations with the States. I do not know whether that third page was composed after I was given the first and second pages or whether by inadvertence I was not given the third page. Nevertheless, I a wish to make this point: Towards the end of last the position had arisen in consultation between the Department of Defence and the DeMinpartment of Environment where my Government was about to make an approach to the governments of New South Wales and Western Australia, to consult them about the environmental aspects of nuclear powered ships-in this case nuclear powered allied warships-visitin g a their ports. This is of great importance to the It is of great importance to the population of some very large cities. Australia, of course, was settled by warships in ports. Australia's principal centres of population are still clustered around ports. Australia's largest city, Sydney, is also ItAustralia's largest naval base. Another very concentre of population, the Perth metropolitan area, is the centre of other naval activity. not Naval ships constantly use Fremantle harbour and they, to a certain extent, use, and to a greater will use Cockburn Sound. Accordingly it very important that the State governments beshould be involved in the question of environment in this case. The prevention is obviously better than cure. But the question of cure in the case of a nuclear explosion does concern some very important State activities. Obviously hospipublic buildings in general immense pressure if anything explosions. In these circumstances we regard it as very important indeed that New South Wales and to Western Australia should be consulted about this aspect. That point had been put by me to the with American and British authorities both in nu-Australia and in Washington and London. The of absolute liability had been solved. The question of environment was not one that the Australian Government could solve in isolation. I , of course, do not assert-it would be most uncharacteristic of me to assert-that the Australian Government did not have constitutional authority in matters of the environment arising out of defence or trade with other countries. Accordingly I do not doubt for one minute that this Parliament could make laws and the Australian Government could make administrative arrangements safeguarding the Australian population from the effects of mishaps in nuclear powered warships or nuclear powered merchant ships. We could cover the field, but we have never tried to do so. At this stage there are no arrangements whatever. The Sydney and the Perth hospitals, for instance, have made no additional arrangements and have no preparations under way to deal with the unlikely but the catastrophic effects of any mishap to a nuclear powered warship in Australia's two largest naval ports. There are other considerable ports which, of course, are remote from large centres of population. Port Stephens and Jervis Bay would be such. Nevertheless, Sydney and Fremantle, Botany Bay and Cockburn Sound are very clearly adjacent to or in the midst of very large centres of population. The misgivings I express about the Prime Minister's statement on this matter arise from the fact that it does seem to have been precipitate. No arrangements have yet been made with any of the States, still less with the two principal States concerned. In those circumstances I believe that the statement was unhelpful and precipitate. I am not cavUling at the fact that such matters must be confidential. I do not believe that we must assume that the State Governments do not have officers who can keep a confidence. I do not believe that we should assert that this Parliament has members who cannot keep a confidence. This matter could have been referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence where confidentiaUty is required. As I understand it and as far as I know, no attempt has been made to involve that Committee. There is also a House ofRepresentatives Committee on Environment and Conservation; it is not required to keep confidences. There is a Senate Committee similarly named; it is not required to keep confidences. Nevertheless, I do not believe that it has been a helpful exercise on the last sitleaveting day of the Parliament to announce a decision on the basis of a document of which I have a copy, of which very few other honourable members in the House have a copy, which no parliamentary committee has had the opportunity of discussing, and which the States that inevitably are involved have not had the opportunity of discussing either.",33
76,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,WARSHIPS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",35
77,Mr SPEAKER,WARSHIPS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,35
78,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,WARSHIPS,"Yes , I have been misrepresented. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has stated as he did on another occasion I prohibited the use of Cockburn Sound and Jervis Bay by visiting warships from other countries, particularly those from the United States and from the United Kingdom. The truth is that I never prohibited the use of those 2 ports by either nuclear powered or nuclear armed ships. Inquiries had been made during the last 6 months of my tenure of office as Prime Minister as to whether such ships could use those 2 ports. I asked the Foreign Office and the Permanent Head of my Department, the Prime Minister's Department, to inform me of the position. I was informed by both sources that there was a difference of opinion within the defence machine itself, and that in those circumstances it would be unwise to give approval until the Defence Committee had made up its mind what the best decision would be. In what manner the security, environmental safety and matters of that nature could be effectively protected. That is the only advice I received. And I conveyed the decision that no action should be taken until we ascertained the facts.",35
79,Dr JF CAIRNS,WARSHIPS,I seek leave to make a short statement on this matter.,35
80,Mr SPEAKER,WARSHIPS,Is leave granted?,35
81,Mr SINCLAIR,WARSHIPS,No .,35
82,Mr SPEAKER,WARSHIPS,Leave is not granted. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. COURT PROCEEDINGS: DOCUMENTS,35
83,Mr SINCLAIR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I move: That, in response to the petition of Danny Sankey presented to the House on 25 February 1976, this House grants 1. to the Petitioner and his legal representatives to inspect the documents tabled in this House during the course of its proceedings which took place between 2.55 p.m. and 10.09 p.m. on 9 July 1975. 2. to the Petitioner and his legal representatives to issue and serve a subpoena for the production of the said documents in the proceedings commenced by the Petitioner in the Queanbeyan Court on or about 20 November 1975, and 3. to an appropriate officer of the House to attend at the hearings of the said proceedings and to produce the said documents. This motion arises from a petition which was tabled in the Parliament by the Attorney General, (Mr Ellicott) on 25 February 1975 on behalf of one Danny Sankey of 18 Village Lower Road, Vaucluse, in the State of New South Wales. The character of the petition is in accord with the practice which has appUed in this and other parliaments. I draw the attendon of the House to page 85 of the eighteenth edition of Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice which tant, reads: Therightsof the House are emphasised by the resolution of session 1818 which directs that no clerk or officer House, or shorthand writer employed to take minutes dence before the House, or evidence elsewhere in respect of any proceedings ation had at the bar, or before any committee of the without the special leave of the House. If l may interpolate for just a moment, that ticular part of the instruction is, of course, picked up within the motion which stands in my name. The quotation continues: Parties to a suit who desire any other documents in the custody of officers of the accordingly petition the House, praying that the officer may attend and produce it . . . and the 'proper officer' includes an official ter . . . The motion for leave may be moved without previous notice . . . During the recess, however, it has been the practice for the Speaker, in order to prevent delays in the administration of justice, to allow the production of minutes of evidence and other documents, on the application of the parties to a private suit. question of privilege, especially the privilege of a witness, or should the production of the document appear, on other grounds, to be a subject for the discretion of the House itself, he will decline to grant the required authority. During a dissolution the Clerk of the House sanctions the production of documents, following the principle adopted by the Speaker. I quoted that in full, Mr Speaker, because I think it is important that a distinction be drawn between the Hansard or other tanscript of statements made in the Parliament and the production of the documents themselves. If honourable members like to look at standing order 320 of our Standing Orders they will see the following: All papers and documents presented to the House shall be considered public. Papers not ordered to be printed may be inspected at the offices of the House at anytimeby Members, and, with permission of the Speaker, by other persons, and copies thereof or extracts therefrom may be made. In fact, we all know that documents produced in this place are avaUable for pubUcation by the media and others. It is true that they are essenOpposition. tially public property. Accordingly, having regard to the nature of this petition it is felt that there is some obligation to make available pubUcly documents that are tabled in the chamber. In so recommending to the House, I think that clear emphasis needs to be laid on the fact that in no way can the privUeges that apply to the Parliament be waived as a result of this resolution. There is privUege that attaches to the documents of the House in the same manner as there is privilege that attaches to statements made in this chamber. Any privUege that Ues cannot be waived by virtue of a motion which is purely for the production of the documents themselves. There is another matter which I think is imporand that is that the character and nature of the documents themselves have no greater validity, or indeed less validity, than they have at of the the moment of tabUng. They stand on their own of evimerits and have no greater authenticity simply any committee thereof, shall give or examinbecause they are produced and tabled in this House, chamber and by resolution of this Parliament are made avaUable elsewhere. As to the character of parthe case, matters outside this House are no concern of the House. It is, of course, a matter for those who seek the production of documents by petition to take the initiative and to ask the to produce such evidence, or chamber for them. In this case the petition has House, been laid. We believe it to be the responsibiUty of proper the Parliament to answer that petition. The term motion that I have moved is in accordance with shorthand writhat request. As I say, in no way does the Government or the Parliament waive the privUege that pertains to the Parliament. The documents have no But should the suit involve any greater status or authenticity than they did at the time of tabUng; but, they having been tabled, it is the opinion of the Government that they should be made avaUable in that form. Therefore, having taken account of the procedures and practices of the House of Commons, which seem to be far more extensive than those of this chamber, and having taken advice and looked at other precedents in Australia, I have moved the motion in this form. It will be noted that it also involves granting the necessary leave to officers, if so requested, to appear to authenticate the fact that the documents have been so tabled in the Parliament. The form of the motion which I have moved picks up the fact that in the petition there is also a request that the documents might be inspected. This also has been referred to in the motion. I therefore commend the motion in this form to this chamber.",35
84,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I call the Leader of the Debate interrupted.,36
85,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Mr Speaker, could I have your guidance? I want to raise a matter of privilege. I know that such a matter has to be raised immediately. I am wondering when that can be done, without interfering with the right of my Leader to speak on this matter.",37
86,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is the matter of privilege point unrelated to this modon?,37
87,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is related to this motion.,37
88,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then I think the honourable attention gendeman ought to raise the matter forthwith.,37
89,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"On the question of privilege, I want to draw your attention, as Speaker, to the petition dated 17 February which was presented on 25 and that February. I make the point that there has been any over 3 months delay in dealing with the petition. though What the petition requests is a in the Parliament. The petition requests firstly that there may be an inspection of documents tabled and, secondly, that there be leave for subpoena for the production of the relevant official records of the proceedings. I will stop at those that point, Mr Speaker. You will motion proposes something altogether different. cannot be serviced byofresolution Firstly, it talks about the issue of a subpoena for the production of documents, not the evidence of the proceedings.",37
90,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Not the record?,37
91,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is correct. SecI am clearly ondly, the motion suggests that the documents doubted be produced in a court in Queanbeyan or in members respect of proceedings arising from those prothe House. ceedings in Queanbeyan, whereas the original petition suggests that they be produced in Queanbeyan only. Thirdly, it is suggested that an officer of the House be able to produce the documents. You will notice that the petition sugbut gests that officers of the House-al l those persons exist who took the official record-giv e evidence. tioneronand What I am putting to you, Mr Speaker, on the question of privilege is, firstly, that the notice of ine the motion is not in accord with the petition. Secondly, I put it to you that ifit were in accord with extent the petition-yo u may wish to interrupt me here,",37
92,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"it could not be complied with. If you will allow me to continue from this point, I shall do so on this basis: If the House said that comment the documents could be produced they could not ask the jury be produced because of the matter of privilege. I was the hmitation am not talking about the official record; I am talking about the documents. To that extent, I would like you, Mr Speaker,were to examine the decision in Church of Scientology of California v Johnson-Smith, as reported commencing at page 378 of 1972 I All England Law Reports. It is a relatively recent decision, Mr Speaker. You will notice that it was held that what was said or done in Parliament in the course of proceedings could not be examined outside Parliament. I want to emphasise that of examination. Accordingly, you will note that in support of that decision the court referred to previous decisions. I do not want to delay you much further, Mr Speaker; but I draw your to the references to the decisions which are contained at page 380 of 1972 I All England Law Reports. I draw your attention to the comment made by His Honour when he said: The Attorney-General says that the privilege goes further what is said or done in the House in the course of proceedings there cannot be examined outside Parliament for the purpose of supporting a cause of action, even the cause of action itself arises out of something done matter of record outside the House. I submit that, according to precedent, according to privilege, it would be quite improper for the a House now to say that it would be in order for documents to be produced elsewhere. I am emphasising the documents themselves. In other note that the words, the privilege any member of the House of the House. In support of that I refer to the decision in ex parte Wason, a conspiracy case referred to in 1869 in Law Reports 4 Queens Bench, where it was said by His Honour: of opinion that we ought not to allow it to be for a moment that the motives or intentions of of either House cannot be inquired into by criminal proceedings with respect to anything they may do or say in It is acknowledged in that decision that by petition and by leave of the House the official said records can be produced-no t to be examined, as evidence of the fact that they did in fact on that day. I submit that this petition is based that false premise-no t only do the petihis legal representatives wish to examrecords but they also wish to examine the people associated with the records. To that I say that it is a breach of privilege. In supSmithport of that argument I say this: In the Johnsoncase the Attorney-General said that the use of Hansard must stop at the examination of the Hansard and that counsel was not entitled to on what had been said in Hansard or to to draw any inferences from it. That of that particular decision which, it is suggested here, could be a precedent. In other words, what I am saying is that if we to allow even the official transcript of what happened on that day to be produced there could not be any examination of what the transcript itself disclosed in relation to documents that were produced. So, in summary, I am saying,firstlythat the motion is not in accord with the petition. Secondly, I am saying-waivin g that for the purpose of the second argument-that ifit were in accord with the petition the documents themselves could not be produced because that would be a breach of the privilege of the House.",37
93,Mr SINCLAIR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Mr Speaker, I wish to refer to the question of privilege.",38
94,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I call the Leader of the House.,38
95,Mr SINCLAIR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," Mr Speaker, the argument just presented by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) with respect to the motion I moved and the question of privilege supports very much my motion in the form in which I have submitted it. Indeed, the argument he presented, arguing hisfirstpoint, is the reason for the difference between the form of the petition and the motion submitted to the House. The first part of the petition relating to the inspection of the documents he does not canvass; however, he does canvass the extent to which the documents should be produced. I see the documents as being quite distinct from the Hansard record of proceedings on that day. It is for that reason that the motion does not advert to the Hansard record of proceedings but refers only to the documents tabled in the chamber. I suggest that those documents retain the privilege which the honourable member asserted and therefore the form of the motion is totally in accordance with the maintenance of privilege and the presentation of documents in accord with the intent and practice of this place. With respect to his second question and the presence of an officer of the House to attend at the hearing, I refer to May's Parliamentary Practice and the fact that it is necessary before any officer of this Parhament is allowed to appear outside it that leave be given by the Parliament for that purpose. The purpose of this motion is only to allow an officer to testify to the existence of the documents and of their tabling in the House. There is no question, in any way, that he can be cross-examined or can give evidence pertaining to the proceedings of the Parliament, for this motion does not relate to the proceedings of the Parliament other than to the degree to which it relates to the tabling of the documents. For that reason I suggest that on the question of privilege no prima facie case has been established, and the form of motion has been completely endorsed by the argument presented by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith.",38
96,Mr ELLICOTT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," Iriseon the privilege point. I suggest there is a misconception in what the honourable member for Kingsford-Srnith (Mr Lionel Bowen) has said,firstof all in relation to the petition. Of course, although I presented the petition honourable members will understand that I presented it because Mr Sankey is a constituent of mine and I did not present it in my role as Attorney-General. I am speaking now in my role as Attorney-General and remaining distant from that petition, as I must. The first point in relation to the form of the motion, I would submit, is not correct. The House surely must have the power to consider the petition and consider what portion of what is sought it is open to the House to grant. All that the notice of motion seeks to do is to grant such part as the House might deem proper in relation to this petition. The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) has made it quite clear that Hansard itself ought to be ruled out completely and should not be produced for the purpose of these proceedings. That is quite proper. However, it does leave the question of documents. On the question of privilege itself, it seemed to me, when listening to the nonourabie member for Kingsford-Smith, that he was thinking that by acceding to this motion the House in some way was waiving its privilege; that is to say, waiving that very important privilege that what is said or done in Parliament shall not be made the subject of proceedings in any court. I would simply say to the House that that does not follow at all and, of course, the Leader of the House made that quite clear in what he said. In other words, the question of parUamentary privilege would be taken into account by the court itself. It is the court that breaches the parliamentary privilege by allowing action to be taken on something that is said or done in Parliament. Thus, if these documents were produced and a court allowed some action to be taken or done in relation to the production of those documents in this House on 9 July, that would be a breach of privUege. Obviously there are some cases, and the Scientology case is one of them in which what is said or done in Parliament is relevant to the administration ofjustice. I am not turning my remarks to this particular case, but if l may go to the case of an action for defamation which has a defence of a fair and accurate report of parliamentary proceedings, clearly enough in such a case it would be appropriate to produce in court the Hansard record for the purpose of establishing what was said in Parliament m order to determine whether the report in the Press, the alleged defamatory report, was a fair and accurate report of what was said in Parliament. To produce the Hansard in such a case would not be an infringement of privUege because Parliament has always recognised that it will not impede the administrauon ofjustice. For Parliament to claim privUege in relation to such a matter of evidence would be, quite clearly, to impede the administration of justice, as it would mean that a party who had an adequate defence under the law would not be able to establish it unless he first estabUshed what was said in Parliament. That only Ulustrates that in a case such as this, by granting this notice of motion, you are not waiving the parUamentary privUege at all. That privUege still remains. stUl there for the court to take into account. gest, with very great respect, that what honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has examined, said does misconceive the nature and the effect the motion before the House.",38
97,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION, I intend to speak on only one aspect this matter. I do not want to go over the history it because it is well enough known to the House. want to look at the words in the notice of motion or the intention to move a nouce of motion which were used by the Leader of the House (Mr documents Sinclair).,39
98,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Order! I think the right that. honourable gentleman is setting out to speak to the substance of the motion. At present I am hearing the issue of privilege.,39
99,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No , I want to court speak on the substance of the matter.",39
100,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepraised resented by the Attorney-General (Mr Elhcott).",39
101,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable may proceed with his personal explanation.,39
102,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Attorneyrising to General suggested that I was implying that there would be an objection to the production of HanI sard. In fact I made no such comment. I virtuaUy agreed with that. For the purpose of explanation, I drew a distinction between what the petition quested, the official records, as against what motion requested, the production of documents. - Mr SPEAKER- I disagree with the question of privUege raised by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen)-that is, I reject the issue of privUege. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith put the matter on 2 grounds. One was that the notice of motion by the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) is not in accord with the petition. That is apparent; it is not in accord with the petition. However, I believe that the Parliament could not allow itself to be put in the position that it could only accede to a request in a petition if it fulfilled the request in the petition precisely. The Parliament must remain in conuol of its own actions and the Parliament can determine how much of a petition it wiU agree with; alternatively, it can reject the petition entirely or accept the petition entirely. Therefore I cannot accept that ground of the matter of privilege raised by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. The second part of the question of privilege It is raised by the honourable member for Kingsford I sugSmith was that were the documents to be the produced in a coun and there in a coun then the fact of the examination of the of documents in the coun would amount to a breach of privUege. I understand entirely what gentleman is getting at. What he of is saying is that if there is a risk of a court of examining the documents and by that examinI ation of the documents the court would be in breach of the privUege of the Parliament, we should not assist the process by releasing the to go to the court in the first place. That is basicaUy the way in which the honourable gentleman puts the arguments. I must reject There is no reason I should assume that any court would be unaware of the long line of authority in relation to this privilege of the Parliament. I have every confidence that whatever it went before would observe the parliamentary privilege and not breach it. I have the safeguard of course that if the court did breach it could be corrected on an appeal. Therefore I do not accept the issue of privilege by the honourable member for Kingsford Smith. The Leader of the Opposition has the call member to the issue of substance. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I was, in fact, order. I put it to you that you should rule the motion out of order. Before I put that, clearly do not want to give any impression at all that these documents could not or should not be produced in a court if the court is correctly dealreing with a matter to which those documents the relate. In fact most of the documents were produced by me in the House. I obviously intended them to be pubhc knowledge. I do not want to give any impression that I do them to be known to the pubhc or to be available to any persons who have a legal right to have access to them. The point upon which I rise to order is not that I could have taken if this motion had come on within a week or a couple of weeks after peddon was lodged with the House. It is a point which I must take now. When the proceedings were due to come on before the Queanbeyan Court of Petty Sessions, if this motion had been moved then, I would in any way have resisted the House voting on it or voting for it. Since then, however, the matters have been taken out of the hands of the Queanleast, beyan Court of Petty Sessions. They may never go back to that court. Proceedings have been taken to say 2 things: Firsdy, that the matters which are alleged in the proceedings in Queanbeyan Court, even if estabhshed, do not amount to any breach of the law; and, secondly, that those matters, even if it were established that they do amount to a breach of the law are not matters which should come before a court located. I need say no more than this: The sons concerned and the events alleged in no case reside or occurred in the Queanbeyan Petty Seslic, sions district. The events would have occurred Canberra or Sydney. The persons concerned reside in Canberra or Sydney or Wollongong. Accordingly, even if the events amount to any breach of the law by the persons concerned, would not be a matter which could come before the Queanbeyan Court. The other point is that even if the facts alleged are established, they amount to no breach law. This matter is now before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales. It could not have come before that court without permission of Justice of the Supreme Court of New South motion Wales. Leave was sought and obtained from Mr Justice Lee of that Court for the matter to come before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales. The Court of Appeal has set the matter down for 15 June. It would certainly seem premature and, I would put it, it would be improper for this House to say that the documents can be gest produced either in Queanbeyan or in any prothis ceedings flowing from Queanbeyan when in fact the Coun of Appeal may say either that the ceedings cannot proceed at Queanbeyan or that the proceedings cannot proceed at all. I put it you, Mr Speaker, that this House should not in any way presume to act in such a way as to press a view or to pre-empt a view on such matters.",39
103,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is basically the question of not wish subjudice that you are putting? Mr E. G. Whitlam-Yes, precisely, Sir. In those circumstances I would beheve that at least the proper course is for you to say that the matter one cannot come before the House until the Court of Appeal has given its decision. Quite obviously if the the Court of Appeal says that the proceedings cannot proceed then this motion would not go ahead. The Court of Appeal might say that the proceedings cannot proceed in the place or in the form which was contemplated at the time that not the petition came before the House. In that event, it might be conceded on all sides that the matter could not go ahead in the House. Sir, at the matter is premature. I would go further and say that you should rule it out of order. There is nothing to prevent this motion, as I apprehend it, coming before the House after the the Court of Appeal of New South Wales has handed down its judgment if that court then says the matter should proceed in Queanbeyan or elsewhere. Certainly, as I said earlier, I would not in any way be disposed to resist and I do not so want to give any impression that I would be perresisting these documents, which were mostly tabled by me, being made available to the pubincluding judges or those who appear before in them. But, Sir, the whole of this matter which we are discussing now may prove completely abortive. If the Court of Appeal says that these proceedings are null and void then we shall have it wasted our time in discussing this matter. In those circumstances, Sir, I suggest that you should not only rule that the matter should be deferred until the next day of sitting, but that you should rule that it should not properly come beof the fore this House at all at this time.",40
104,Mr SINCLAIR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Mr Speaker, Iriseon the point of a order. I wish to refer to the second part of the and that is, that this House in no way is interfering with the state of the proceedings in that it would be necessary for the petitioner and his legal representatives, under clause 2 of the motion, to issue and serve a subpoena, if it were appropriate, within whatever stage of the proceedings they might reach. For that reason I sugthat the status of the proceedings outside House is not a matter for this House. It is not specifically a matter relating to whether this promotion is in accord with our Standing Orders. Rather the motion is in this form to make availto able the documents if at an appropriate stage of those proceedings the necessary steps were to be extaken to make them so available. This House cannot and should not intervene in the proceedings, nor are we taking any initiative to do so. For that reason I do not believe the question of sub judice is relevant to the form of the motion as it is submitted to the Parliament. Mr Ellicott-Le t me clear up one point. The Leader of the Opposition can correct me if what I say is incorrect, out I believe it to be correct. proceedings in the court at Queanbeyan were adjourned until 7 June, and following the handing down of a judgment by a magistrate a writ of prohibition was taken out in relation to those roceedings which was returnable in the upreme Court of New South Wales. It came before a single justice and he decided that it should be referred to the Court of Appeal pursuant to the Supreme Court Act. I say that to you, Mr Speaker, only to indicate that the proceedings in Queanbeyan are still on foot. The writ of prohibition, the prerogative writ, is designed in effect have these proceedings declared null and void; but the proceedings are still there and until the Court of Appeal hands down its judgment, or perhaps the High Court or the Privy Council hands down its judgment, these proceedings are still there. They would be adjourned pending the decision of a court on appeal. Looking at the notice of motion, one would apprehend that it would not be practicable for any party to the Queenbeyan proceedings to have an effective subpoena until the determination of the appeal; but the notice of motion, as the Leader of the House has put it, is not an ference in the proceedings themselves. I would respectfuUy submit to you, Mr Speaker, that this is not a matter in which the sub judice rule applies, but the motion simply allows justice to be done if the event occurs between now and, say, 17 August, 24 August or whenever the Parliament resumes. It allows justice to be done to the extent it could be done by the issue of a subpoena should the Court of Appeal or some ultimate court of appeal hand down its judgment in the meantime in a way which would enable the proceedings at Queanbeyan to continue. If they were quashed under the writ of prohibition there would be no point in the subpoena; the motion would have no effect. Mr E. G. Whitlam- I wish to speak on the matters raised by the Leader of the House and the Attorney-General and on the matters of fact. I do not recollect the date to which the matter before the court of Queanbeyan has been adjourned, but I do not believe it is material. Again I do not recollect the date, but a justice of the preme Court in New South Wales said the matter could or should go to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal heard an application, which was in no way contested, that the matter should be given an expedited hearing. The Court of Appeal, with the Chief Justice presiding, set the hearing down for IS June. Surely at least this must apply: The House should not be engaged in debating purely hypothetical matters. The Court The of Appeal may say that the matters in Queanbeyan can proceed. In that case the House can pass this motion. The Court of Appeal may say that they cannot proceed. I put it that the House should not be asked to decide matters which may never arise.",40
105,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Leader of the Opposition has anticipated words I was about to use; that is, that this debate may be merely a hypothetical discussion about a motion when we do not know, until we hear what the Court of Appeal or any subsequent court says, whether effect will be to given to it. But I am concerned to see that the parties to the court proceedings are not prejudiced in the hearing before the court. That is the whole essence of the sub judice rule; that we not permit anything to occur in this House which will be to the prejudice of Utigants before a court. For that reason my attitude towards the sub judice rule is not to interpret the sub judice rule in such a way as to stifle discussion in the national Parliament on issues of national importance. I have so ruled on earlier occasions. That is only the opposite side of the coin to what is involved here. If l beUeved that in any way the disinter- cussion of this motion or the passage of the motion would prejudice the parties before the court, then I would rule the matter sub judice and refuse to allow the motion to go on; but there is a long line of authority from the courts which indicates that the courts and judges of the courts do not regard themselves as such delicate flowers that they are likely to be prejudiced in their decisions by a debate that goes on in this House. I am quite sure that is true, especially in the case of a court of appeal or, if the matter were to go beyond that, the High Court. I do not think those justices would regard themselves as having been influenced by the debate that may occur here. Therefore I cannot rule the matter sub judice. Because I cannot rule it sub judice I cannot prevent the motion from going ahead or prevent discussion about it. The Leader of the Opposition indicated that it should be deferred to the next day of sitting to await the court's decision. That may or may not have been a good course to take, but it is not one which I can order. What is obviSu- ous to me is that the purpose of the motion is that, if a decision is made after the hearing on 15 June and the proceedings in Queanbeyan spring up again, the authority will have been given by this House to produce the documents. Whether the purpose could have been as well served by leaving the matter until August is a matter for arument but certainly not a matter in which I as peaker can intervene and require that course to be taken. Because the matter is not sub judice and because it is not contrary to the Standing Orders I rule that the notice of modon may proceed. The Leader of the House has talked to the substance of the motion. There has been discussion on the privilege issue and the point of order raised by the Leader of the Opposition. I now propose to call someone from trie Opposition side to speak to the substance of the modon.",41
106,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Did I understand you to rule that it is in order for the motion to proceed because it accepts in part some of the requests of the petition? I make this point again: The petition did not request the production of documents; the motion does.",42
107,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The petition requested the production of the proceedings of the House, as I remember the wording, and the documents are part of the proceedings of the House, and as such the House can decide not to fulfil the whole of the petition but some part ofit. I am reminded by the ever watchful and present Clerk that part of the prayer in the petition is: Grant leave to your petitioner and his legal representatives to issue and serve a subponena for the production relevant omciai records of the aforesaid proceedings House which took place between 2.55 p.m. and 10.9 p.m. on 9 July 197S and of the relevant documents tabled therein; In fact, the petition calls for the production of the documents. Even if it had not I would have ruled the motion in order, having regard to the petition for the production of the proceedings. I return to the substance of the motion. Is there any speaker on the Opposition side who wishes to be called?",42
108,Mr SCHOLES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Opposition is not opposing the motion. Mr Speaker, I ask you to instruct the officer of the House who is required to present the documents that no questions other man the question relating to whether they are the documents will be able to be put to or answered by that officer. I ask you to make that clear from the chair. I am aware of the legal position. That should be by direction of the House. That is all I want to raise.",42
109,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As I understand it, the honourable member for Corio has said 2 things. Firstly, the Opposition does not oppose the motion. Secondly, he has asked me whether or not the terms of the motion are such as to preclude the officer who produces the documents, should that eventuality arise, being questioned about any matter other than the mere production of the documents. That is not part of the terms of the motion. I do not think there is any need to amend the motion to include that suggestion because I would be surprised if the officer producing the documents would be prepared to answer a question. I would be surprised if the presiding judge or magistrate, whoever it might be, would allow such a question to be put. If the question were put the officer would be quite entitled to say: ' I refuse to answer'. If it were pressed, then there would be a breach of privilege. I expect the court would not risk a breach of pnvilege.",42
110,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Lowe) (12.2)It may well be that the statement by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) disposes of this matter. That is, that the Opposition agrees that there will be no objection to the motion or the various provisions contained in it. I want to speak on this matter that I think is of enormous public and national importance. It goes right to the heart of parliamentary privilege and the extent to which that privilege goes. I think the historical background was well set out by you, Mr Speaker, in your statement of 8 April in relation to privilege in connection with the notice of motion by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). With deference to you. Sir, I believe that ruling which apphed the Standing Orders was a brilliant explanation and interpretation of of the the Standing Orders. It is on that ruling that I of this base the contribution which I want to make today.",42
111,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am deeply indebted to the right honourable gentleman for paying tribute to me in that way. Notwithstanding the tribute, I must hold the right honourable gentleman to relevance to the motion.",42
112,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know the need for relevance. That is why I am proceeding to deal with this matter. I first state the very general principle as to the nature and extent of any particular privilege claimed by Parliament. I refer to the report of the Committee of Privileges of the House of Commons in 1947. It states: . . . the underlying test in all cases being, whether the right claimed as a privilege is one which is absolutely necessary for the due execution of the powers of Parliament. Mot only has Pariiamem no legalrightto extend its privileges beyond those which satisfy this test, but your Committee feel that any attempt so to do would be contrary to the interest both of Parliament and the public. It is know that an information was lodged in the Queanbeyan Supreme Court by Mr Sankey. It was based upon section 86 of the Crimes Act and section 18 which permits, unless there was a contrary intention, any person to institute proceedings for the commitment for trial any person in respect of an indictable offence against the law of the Commonwealth. Section 86 states that any attempt to undermine the Constitution is to be considered a criminal offence. Therefore the question which arises is whether privilege apphes in a case such as this. Was it necessary to put this motion which relates to a criminal offence before the house? I refer to an article published in The Parliamentarian of 1970, under the name of Sir Barnett Cocks, Clerk of the House of Commons. He quoted from Erskine May and later explained the interpretation given by Lord Shawcross who, as honourable member will know, was a very well informed and highly respected law officer of the Crown when a member of the House of Commons. Lord Shawcross said: The underlying test in all cases being, whether claimed as a privilege is one which is absolutely necessary the due execution of the powers of Parliament. The article in The Parliamentarian went on to say: The privilege of freedom confined to civil cases . . .",42
113,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I must rule that the motion does not raise an issue of privilege. The matter before the House raises a question as to whether or not this House will permit the serving of a poena and the production of documents by an time. officer of the House. It does not raise an issue of privilege.,43
114,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I understand that the motion is as to whether the documents should be produced. I say that there is no basis on which production can be refused. One can jusment tify a refusal only if it is associated with criminal case. This is why I wanted to put a of view to you, Mr Speaker. In criminal cases there is no power in this House to refuse to duce documents wanted in a criminal court. It has never been refused in the United Kingdom. That is the point I wanted to make. I believe proper and consistent with the dignity and status of Parliament that an application be made to the House for the production of documents and the carrying out of other procedures set out in motion by the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair). That is what I wanted to prove. I think the docurequired ments which I have quoted ought to establish that proposition to your satisfaction, Sir.",43
115,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I will allow therighthonourable gentleman to proceed with his explanation. His standing in the House and his long service are such that I would not want to interrupt him unnecessarily, but I ask him to connne himself to the relevance of the motion.",43
116,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I will confine myself to making only 2 quotations, in deference to your wishes. I quote from the article: The privilege of freedom from arrest, it will be noted, is confined to civil cases (a rarity under the law today) and does not entitle a Member to evade the criminal law. An article in ParUamentary Privilege in Australia by Enid Campbell, at pages 60 and 61, states: Where a member of Parliament is accused of a criminal offence, it has never been suggested that his status as a member places him in any different a position as regards the law of arrest or trial from that ofan ordinary citizen. I content myself by stating that those 2 quotations reflect completely what I believe ought to be the practice in this House. I do not make any suggestion as to whether or not there is any proof of guilt. I merely state that if an application is the right made to a court and an order is given putting for people on trial for a criminal offence, at least we should not prejudice the hearing but give the applicant every opportunity to present his case effectively before the courts without hindrance from this House. from arrest, it will be noted, is Question resolved in the affirmative. CRIMES (INTERNATIONALLY PROTECTED PERSONS) BILL 1976 subBill presented by Mr Ellicott, and read a first Second Reading",43
117,Mr ELLICOTT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishof Crimes against Internationally Protected a nonPersons including Diplomatic Agents, adopted point by the United Nations General Assembly on 14 December 1973, was signed by Australia in proDecember 1974. The Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Bill and the 2 associated extradition amendment Bills will enable Australia it is to ratify and implement the Convention, which requires that the intentional commission of murders, kidnappings and other acts of violence against diplomats and other persons entitled to the special protection under international law be made serious offences under nauonai law. As by the Convention, the protection is extended by the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Bill to Heads of State and Foreign Ministers in foreign states. The Convention was adopted by the United Nations following consideration in 1972 and 1973 of proposals aimed at combating terrorism around the world and particularly terrorism against diplomats. Attorney-General Bowen spoke for Austraha in the United Nations 1972 in support of a convention against terrorprovision ism. The Convention is not yet in force but the United Kingdom and the United States of persons. America have also signed it and have announced their intentions to implement it and ratify it. For many years nations have accepted an obUgation to protect diplomatic representatives; these obUvention gations were formalised in conventions adopted in Vienna in 1963. More recent events nave ing shown the need, which the present Convention seeks to meet, to develop and make more effecAccordingly, tive these obUgations. The convention foUows many respects the 1970 convention for the Supcrimes pression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft and 1971 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawdefeated ful Acts Against the Safety of Aircraft and the Bills likewise follow the general pattern of the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act 1972, the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 and amendments made to the extradition Acts in 1972 and 1973 to implement those conventions. Clause 8 of the Crimes (Internationally Proassured tected Persons) Bill implements the obUgation that Australia will accept under article 2 of Convention to make the intentional commission of the offences described in that article crimes punishable by appropriate penalties which mto account their grave nature. As required the Convention, jurisdiction will be given to AusAustralian traUan courts to deal with these offences, not only when committed in Austrahan territory, but also when the alleged offender is an Australian citizen or the offence is committed against an Australian internationally protected person overseas. Jurisreason diction will also be given to Australian courts when an alleged offender is found in Australia. The intention is that the provisions of the dealing with offences in Australia shall be operAustralia ative on royal assent. However, the provisions concerning offences committed outside Australia will not be operative untU the Convention enters into force for Australia. The remaining provisions of the Bill providing adjourned. for taking suspected offenders mto custody, the prosecution of offenders and the proof of various evidentiary matters implement the obligations that Australia will assume under the Convention. These provisions follow, broadly speaking, the time. legislation dealing with the hijacking and protection of aircraft to which I have previously referred. The definition of 'internationally protected person' in the Convention includes all persons who, under international law, are special protection from attacks. Lengthy and detailed provisions would be required to describe fuUy the classes of persons who would income within that description and accordingly has been made in clause 17 for the making of regulations specifying these classes of With the object that offenders against internationally protected persons be punished, the Conseeks to ensure that the crimes referred to in the Convention are extraditable under existextradition treaties and to facilitate the extradition in appropriate cases of alleged offenders. the 2 associated extradition amendin ment BUls make the new offences extradition for the purposes of Australian legislation. the The object of the Convention would largely be if the exclusion provided generally 3 under the extradition Acts in relation to offences of a political character were applicable to the new offences and the 2 extradition BiUs therefore the provide that the new offences should not be taken to be offences of a political character. However, honourable members can be that the essential safeguards provided under Australian extradition legislation will not the be affected by these amendments. Not only must the Attorney-General be satisfied as to the general propriety of the request for extradition take before an extradition may proceed but also by sufficient evidence must be placed before an magistrate to justify the trial of the alleged offender. Further, both Acts forbid extradition where there are substantial grounds for beUeving that the aUeged offender might be prejudiced at his trial in the foreign state by of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions. Observance of the requirements of the Act can be enforced by a superior court in Act Australia. With the passage of these 3 Bills, will be able to play its part in the international endeavours to better protect internationally protected persons against terrorist acts of violence.

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 3 June, on motion by Mr Newman: That the Bill be now read a second dme.",45
120,Mr MCVEIGH,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT," I rise in this debate to forward the proposition explained by the then Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr MACKellar) and the previous speakers from the Government side and to rebut some of the spurious arguments advanced by members of the Opposition. I say this quite advisedly, because an analysis of the speeches of Opposition members will show that they pay hpservice to what we beheve is the great Australian hope, that is, home ownership. I quote from the speech of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), wherein he stated: We have always considered it to be a gimmick which does not in any way solve the housing problems in the long term. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) referred to our plan to make housing available to rural dwellers. He stated: It is probably a good thing to do but it is certainly priority thing to do. He also said: For what it is worth that is a commendable thing. I suppose it is of infinitesimal consequence. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) said in his speech last evening: The homes savings grant is a poor manner in which to promote home ownership. I think that an analysis of those speeches of members of the Opposition will make known to the Austrahan people the undeniable fact that the Opposition is pledged not to allow Australian famiUes and their children to own their own homes. On the other hand, of course, the Government will make attainable that great Austrahan dream-you r own home on your own land. In a few short months our Government has introduced sanity to this area in a situation which, for the last 3 years, has been developed Second Reading by emotional assumptions and shallow thinking. that and I have good factual information with which to back it up. Recently it was announced that private housing approvals, which are regarded as an early indicator of economic trends, showed a strong 13 per cent increase in April of this year after seasonal adjustments. The figure of 12 800 approvals was the highest monthly figure since May 1974, and it was achieved notwithstanding a steady reduction in avaUable finance. Indicative of the shortage offinanceis the fact that savSecond Reading mgs bank deposits in the March quarter were down by 6.2 per cent and buUding society deposits were down by 3.4 per cent. Obviously the Government's initiatives in the economic field and its great desire to pump funds into homes savings have had results. I hope that the Government's efforts are contagious and that the various buUding authorities and buUding societies will continue to advance funds. It is interesting to note that the lending societies'figuresfor April this year were up about 44 per cent on last year's. Obviously there have been great side benefits for home ownership as a result of the election on 13 December last year. The confidence that has been inspired in Australian famUies has resulted in positive action. Some of the side effects of a good housing poUcy can overcome the problem of unemployment. This Government's pohcies in that regard are leading to the creation of more jobs and a reduction in the number of people unemployed. I believe that if government finances are to be used to the best possible advantage it is necessary for governments, both Commonwealth and State, to adopt a forward planning not a approach to housing. Unless the various associated industries-hardware , timber, roofing materials and associated iron products-kno w what are the Government's plans for the future we could reach a situation in which we were not making the best use of our avaUable resources, manpower and factory output. All of those associated industries depend significantly on government policies, aims and objectives. I make an appeal to the various leaders of the governI ments to come together when they are renegomoney tiating their housing agreements and give private industry some plans for the future, preferably over a relatively long period-say , 5 years-s that the industries associated with housing gear up and do their very best to cushion the effects of the rapid increases in costs. We find that, following the 6.4 per cent national wage increase and increases in the of materials, the cost of articles used in the building industry increased by 0.8 per cent January, 0.7 per cent in February cent in March. The total increase from March 1975 to March 1976 was the staggering figure 12.3 per cent. Obviously, parallel with the Government's objectives m the housingfieldis the great necessity for Government activity overcome the problem of inflauon. The figures have already been given by speakers from side of the House and from the Opposition as how much costs in the housing field have increased over the last 12 months. We must tain costs, so that young people, elderly and anyone desirous of purchasing permanent accommodation can do so. This will take a united effort. The Government is obviously very keen about some makingfinanceavailable for the housing sector. saved of In April this year it lowered the statutory reserve then found that deposits by 2 per cent. It cut the interest rate on to take advantage Austrahan Savings Bonds from 10.5 per cent for Country Parties' policy series 1 to 9.2 per cent for series 3. The Government has shown that it is determined to avoid credit squeeze conditions. It is appropriate remark on certain statements made by members of the Opposition last evening about interest rates. The Government has reduced interest rates overall by 1 per cent. I want to comment on or 2 of the matters contained in this piece legislation. The housing interest tax deductibihty has been retained. The Government is honouring a pre-election pledge. The deductibility will allowed for the first 5 years. This is consistent with the Government's aims and policies to help during those early difficult years when ily commitments are probably high and when job payment is relatively low in comparison with what may be anticipated in the future. People face many problems in launching themselves life. The Government's action to retain the deductibility scheme for the first 5 years after the purchase of a home is highly commendable. It is a cardinal principle, in any housing scheme designed to attract people to own their own homes, to make the deposit available. That is the core of the homes savings grant scheme, see it. People are encouraged to put their into savings bank accounts, building society accounts or, if they want a hedge against inflation, into a piece ofland. This money is then o available to them as a deposit to purchase their can own homes. If the Government does not encourage them to save they will not have access to a deposit. This move is probably one of the most progressive and far-reaching programs ever costs offered by a Federal Government to people house wanting to own their own homes. I refer to the in combination of tax deductibility and the homes and 1.6 per savings grant scheme. Additionally, it has been agreed to remove one of of the great anomahes under the present scheme and to provide for no hmit on value. Far too many people were disappointed and inconto venienced by the fact that, due to the huge increases in land values, building costs and the our costs of labour, the total cost of the home to exceeded the statutory limit. Even at this late stage once again I make a special appeal to the conActing Minister for Environment, Housing and people Community Development (Mr Newman) to see whether it is possible to make retrospective payments to people who built their homes and, on account of inflation, exceeded the $22,500, even by the sum of $400 or $500. This would remove the great hardship on people who have over a great number of years and have due to inflation they were unable of the previous Liberalobjectives in this matter. I applaud the announcement in the Bill that to people purchasing a home through a housing commission or State authority will be eligible to claim the grant. That is a positive approach and it is indicative of the fact that the Government one wants every avenue to be explored to encourage of people to build their own homes. In the final analysis, these things all add up to social equity and economic sense. It is also good to note that be the Government has introduced this scheme sooner than it promised. Often today wefindthat give governments all over the world, not only in famAustralia, have a tendency to put things off. I think that this Government deserves the sincere gratitude of us all for implementing this scheme long before it promised to do so. We are honourin ing a promise and we are honouring it long betax fore it was intended to be carried out. It was interesting to note that one of my colleagues, either the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu) in his excellent contribution last evening or the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) who we all know has a great as personal interest in housing, stated that the people of Australia should be reminded of the Labor Party's priority review report. The honourable member for Reid said last night that the Opposition believed in home ownership, but the report it commissioned indicated quite openly on many pages that it should be the policy to have included an imputed rent on home ownership. We on the Government side will not bear that at all. We completely reject that as a proposition, but it is interesting to note the change in attitude of the Labor Party now that it realises that one of the reasons it was beaten on 13 December was the fact that it did not give enough emphasis and encouragement to Austrahan people to own their own homes. No wonder the Australian people now believe that Australia is once again a land of opportunity in which we can all plan ahead with confidence and with optimism. We are all concerned about high cost factors larsThe and quite obviously governments have a sponsibility in association with private industry to engage in research to reduce costs in certain areas. In this respect one thing that can be done is to rationalise council buUding codes. The buUding code in one area is different from that another area. If we are to have an increasing phasis on prefabrication construction it is ary to rationalise councU buUding codes. Another thing that can be done is to permit the use quick construction methods which allow a greater use of non-tradesmen labour to overments come the problem of unemployed people who obtain have no great technical or trade skills. If buUdDevelopments ings can be prefabricated a person without trade skills can be engaged to erect them. I want to agree with the honourable member for Reid who talked last night about the need to reduce land costs. That is obviously and I support him. I share his views on it. We as a government can help in this regard by doing such things as a national re-appraisal of zoning requirements and an initial tidying up of land developments, and probably the setting aside areas of land, either regional or metropolitan which can be used later on for housing and puranticipation chased whUe the prices are relatively low. Houscertain ing cannot be divorced from economic pohcy. It is part and parcel of it. We have a great glut housing. It is estimated that at the present the Austrahan housing industry should be pulable sating at the rate of roughly 140 000 to 150 000 homes a year. There is a great lag to be overin time. come. I believe that these initiatives, these tives will go a long way to overcoming that time lag. I know that there are other matters to be debated in this chamber today. It does give us in the Country Party a great deal of pride to be associated with this legislation. It is legislation which will bring to many, many Australians great personal pleasure and personal satisfaction because they will be fulfilling their needs of home ownership. It is a great ideal. We fully subscribe to it.",45
121,Mr JAMES,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT," I do not want to detain the House. I am aroused by the statement made by the honourable member for DarUng Downs (Mr MCVeigh) who said we have an obligation to aid private industry in development. I do not know exactly what he means by that, but on the front page of last Wednesday's Sydney Sun an article headed 'MUlions From State Super Funds ""Cheap Loans Charge"" ' reads: State Superannuation Fund has lent millions of dolto private developers at lower interest rates than oould recome from investing in Government loans. I was anxious to ask the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) a question this morning. I intended to ask: Has he seen Press reports to the effect that in large sums of money were lent during the tenure emof office of the previous New South Wales necessGovernment by the New South Wales Superannuation Fund to private developers at low of interest rates? Did he note that an important beneficiary of these loans was Parkes DevelopPty Ltd? What steps will be taken to the passports of the controllers of Parkes so as to avoid a repetition of the problems experienced in bringing the Bartons to justice? Mr Newman- I raise a point of order. We have let the honourable member'have some time, but this is surely totaUy irrelevant to the Bill that we a good idea are now talking about.",47
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"Mr Lucock)Order! I pomt out to the honourable member for Hunter that we are at present on the Homes Savor ings Grant Amendment Bill. I aUowed the honourable member time to proceed, perhaps in that he was going to mention that loan money should be directed towards the homes savings grant scheme and the building in of homes. I am afraid I must uphold the point of time order which has been taken. What the honourmember has said so far has no relevance to the Bill that the House is discussing at this point incen Mr JAMES- I was going to link it up but the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Newman) interrupted. I did not think any honourable member would object if low interest loans had been available for the building of houses but when comes to using money obtained from superannuseverely, ation funds at low interest rates-whic h is Parkes Developments has been doing-to spend on rented office space, that is something that every decent member of Parliament should abhor along with the wickedness or the frailties of the previous New South Wales Government. If I am out of order now, I would think that the $22,500honourable member for Darling Downs also would have been out of order because the matter is akin to the subject matter before the House insofar as money was made available by the New South Wales Government to private developers to construct office buildings when it should have been used to build low cost homes for people which are so urgently needed. That was my purpose in mentioning this matter, but was not able to Unk it up because of the objection taken by the Minister. However, having menreferring tioned the question that I had intended to ask Attorney-General, ifit is your desire, Mr Deputy Speaker, to say that I am still out of order. I prepared to abide by your ruling.",47
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,I think the honourother able member has taken a longtimeto give an purpose Ulustration to the House and to come to the cause actual subject matter. I do feel that at this time the honourable member has made his point.,48
124,Mr JAMES,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"All right. It is apparently your wish, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I do not proceed with the submission that low cost money should have been made avaUable for the construction homes instead of being made avaUable to the Ukes of MainUne and Parkes Developments which had been given special privileges by the previous New South Wales Government. Having made the point that I have made. I am prepared to discontinue and to resume my remarks during some appropriate debate at a latertimein this Parliament.",48
125,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT," I shall take very few moments. What I have to say can be said at this stage rather than stage for the reason that I do not desire to delay the passage of this Bill at that stage. The first point is one which has concerned the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), and the in Minister for Repatriation (Mr Newman) might without consider it. In terms of the present scheme, that the present reduced scheme that is operating for now, will the Minister consider very sincerely and very earnestly the practical fact that the on the value of a home for which the grant avaUable ought to be raised? It is becoming a nonsense, particularly in New South Wales. made South Wales deserves some special help in it respect of housmg. That State has been hit very in terms of the monetary policy, over what the last number of months and Queensland has been hit to a significantly less extent. Some attempt ought be made to try to aUeviate the problems in New South Wales and, on a much wider aspect, to raising the value of the home to make the grant meaningful. An amount of Mr Bourchier-For a house and land.",48
126,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"An amount of $22,500 for a house and land is just not an appropriate amount even under the reduced scheme. The other point I want to make relates to clause 6 of the Bill which concerns credit unions. As I understand it clause 6 removes the restrictions which I were previously applied in respect of savings in credit unions for the purpose of housing. I am to the restrictions in terms of the the amount of activity of the credit unions, the interest rate at which they made their loans am avaUable and so on. Does clause 6 mean that the loans which are available from credit unions and which they consummate themselves without embargoes or conditions will apply for the of the home savings grant? I ask this beit is an important question. One of the most quickly growing sectors of the Australian finance industry has been credit unions. I say that having regard to New South Wales. Assistance will be required in New South Wales, and to a lesser extent Queensland, for some time ahead. I notice of that a new publication brought out by the Commonwealth Statistician last month dealing with credit unions' assets, liabUities, income and expenditure, reference number 5.59, states that during 1974-75 an amount of $537m was involved in loans from credit unions. The loans from credit unions in New South Wales to members represented well over 50 per cent of the Australian total. Therefore, if the restrictions on savings from credit unions are to be removed completely, that would act as a disproportionate stimulus to New South Wales, which is a large at the Committee credit union State. I ask the Minister for Repatriation a question: Do all those loans from credit unions mentioned the statistical bulletin to which I have referred, other restriction as to interests rates and is to the proportion of activity of credit union loans housing etc., qualify, or could they all qualify, were they applied by a member of a credit union limit for housing purposes or were the savings on is which the loans were made applied to housing purposes? I think it is an important question. This New approach could be an important way in which the disproportionate squeeze effects on some States of Australia could be significantly alleviated. I end by saying that I am delighted to see that credit umons are to be included in the scheme. I am dehghted to see that their activity in this area will enable more savings to be accumulated for housing purposes. I request the Minister to answer the question I posed.",48
127,Mr NEWMAN,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"In reply- I want to say a few words to answer some questions that have been raised and to answer some of the criticisms that have been made by the Opposition. Firstly, I shall deal with the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) ranged far and wide in his speech on this Bill and touched on many things which will eventually apply to the Homes Savings Grant Bill which we will be bringing in later on. But some of the generalities which he mentioned have to be answered. He quiterightlypointed to the problem in the housing industry, particularly in residential housing, which now exists. I feel that he exaggerated the situation somewhat. The fact is that in all States with the exception of New South Wales as the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) pointed out, all the indications are that there is a strong upsurge in residential building. am informed that in Western Australia in the last couple of months we have had a situation getting very close to the boom period of 1973. But in New South Wales we have a problem, and I can assure honourable members that the Government is monitoring the situation in New South Wales very carefully. It is fair to point out some of the problems in New South Wales, at least in 2 aspects. Firstly, everybody readily recognises the problem in New South Wales is the high cost of land, the high cost of housing construction and the high interest rates. Let us sheet the blame home to where it belongs. The position is the result of the last 3 years of irresponsible government, particularly the financial administration of the last Government. As the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) is in the chamber, I point out that one of the problems in New South Wales with the housing industry was that there was a sharp downturn in public housing expenditure brought about directly by the Hayden Budget of last year.",49
128,Mr HAYDEN,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"Oh, cut it out. You do not beheve that or say it when you are talking to me privately.",49
129,Mr NEWMAN,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"Even privately I would make that assertion and make it very strongly. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also spoke about the problem of the repayment gap. We believe that this home savings Bill will help to eliminate that gap. That is what it is all about. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is either trying purposely to mislead us or does not understand the scheme. He said in his speech that he felt that the scheme was a gimmick and went on to assert that money under the scheme would not be available until 1979. Of course this is quite wrong. When the old scheme that now exists stops in 1977 and the new scheme picks up, most of the $750 grant that is available to a home purchaser now will be available to those who can prove the necessary qualifications for savings as from January 1977. The grant will not be $750 but it will be $667, which is pretty close to the mark. So much for that assertion. I should like to make a point about the Government's attitude to deferred mortgage repayments. We have foreshadowed our attitude on this in our pohcy statements. However, we believe that, in introducing a system of deferred mortgage payments through the private sector rather than the public institutions, we would be making a real contribution. Currently we are having active discussions with private lending I institutions and I am hopeful that there will be some extension of this form of lending in the future. I shall now deal with some of the more specific points that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made. One of them was that he did not think it was fair that by introducing this scheme, one aspect of which is allowing people to build on rural land, we would be giving them adequate protection legally. I have this to say about that point: It would be wrong for the Commonwealth to get into this area which rightly belongs to the States and their legislation. But secondly and more importantly most of the farmers-in fact I would say just about all the farmers I know-ar e pretty canny people when it comes to spending money. I do not believe they would build a house without making sure that they and their investments would be adequately protected. In any case, under State legislation there are plenty of ways in which they could assure their interests, such as leases and other agreements. Therefore, I do not think there is much of a point in that argument. Secondly, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made the assertion that the whole basis of the homes savings grant scheme contradicts the monetary pohcy of the Government because it encourages people to save rather than spend. Again he conveniently ignores the fact that this is saving with a purpose. The purpose is, at the end of the saving, to buy a home. I cannot think of a better motive in encouraging people to save. Would he have them encouraged to spend it on fripperies? I think not The scheme is a very good incentive and it has very real long term objectives. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) said that he believed that the scheme was an election gimmick, designed to trap a small number of voters who might be encouraged to use it, going right back to the days of Sir Robert Menzies. Of course, that is seen to be a completely fallacious argument when one looks at the number of people who have made use of this scheme since 1963. I am told that 350 000 grants have been made available to people who wished to make use of the scheme. That is hardly an elecuon gimmick. A more important point to which I would like to refer is, I am afraid, the misrepresentations by",49
130,Mr HAYDEN,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,How much longer?,50
131,Mr NEWMAN,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"Not very much longer; be patient. When talking about the brochure that deals with the new homes savings grant scheme, the honourable member for Hughes tried to make the point that authorising legislation would be necessary before the Government could issue such a pamphlet. That is a dreadfully misleading statement. In saying that, the honourable member for Hughes conveniently did not go on to point out that this brochure, which carries on the front page the words 'Details of the Commonwealth Government's proposals for a new home savings grant scheme', has inside a very clear notation that the new scheme cannot come into operation until authorising legislation has been passed by the Commonwealth Parhament. They are the main points with which I wish to deal among those raised by the Opposition in the rather specious case that it has put up during the last 24 hours. I turn now to the points raised by honourable members on the Government side of the House. First of all, the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh) asked whether the scheme could be made retrospective. I think it would be unfair of me not to make the position clear. It would not be on to do that. I am afraid that the Government could not entertain such a proposition. The honourable member for Lilley raised 2 points. He pointed out, quiterightly,that the present limitation on the value of a house, of $22,500 is not high enough and he asked whether it could be abolished now. Unfortunately again I have to say frankly that it is not on to do that. The fiscal problems presently facing the Government would not allow it. Unfortunately we will have to wait until next year, when the limitation will be abolished. Then the honourable member for Lilley asked about the problem with regard to credit unions. Under the current scheme only savings with approved credit unions are acceptable. In order to obtain approval a credit union must lend 20 per cent of its loans for housing purposes. There is no restriction on interest rates. For people who buy houses after 1 April 1976, savings with any credit union will be acceptable. Loans made by credit unions have nothing to do with the grant. The amendment will enable some people to obtain a slightly larger grant; nothing more. I thank those honourable members who have contributed to the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Newman) read a third time. NA BENEFITS FUND (DISTRIBUTION OF SURPLUS TO PENSIONERS) BILL 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 May, on motion by Mr Killen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",50
132,Mr HAYDEN,DEFENCE FORCES RETIREMENT,"The Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund (Distribution of Surplus to Pensioners) Bill 1976 provides for certain procedures to distribute a surplus in the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation. Because of the very straightforward procedural nature of the Bill, I frankly cannot see any reason for any debate. We support what is being done.",50
133,Mr BONNETT,DEFENCE FORCES RETIREMENT,"I , too, regard the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund (Distribution of Surplus to Pensioners) Bill 1976 as a machinery measure, and my comments will be very brief. I commend the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) and the Government on their prompt action in dealing with this matter of the distribution of the surplus funds under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act. It is a matter with which the previous Labor Administration could have dealt, should have dealt, but neglected to deal. It could have cleared up this situation at anytimeduring its term of office, but it chose not to do so. It is not as though the money involved is government money; it is money which belongs to the contributors under the Act. For 3 years we waited for acuon on this matter; for 3 years I pressed for the distribution of this surplus. I think that the previous Government's failure to ensure that these contributions were refunded was a further indication of its indiiference to the Services and to the men in the Services. Mr Jacobi-We did more for them than you ever did.",50
134,Mr BONNETT,DEFENCE FORCES RETIREMENT,"No, you did not. The fact that the compound interest component of the accumulated amount will be included in the amount available for distribution will, I am sure, indicate to the personnel of the Services, both retired and still serving, that this Government does concern itself with matters affecting fence Services. I again commend the Minister and the Government for introducing this measure so speedily. I trust that the Bill will a swift passage through both Houses.",51
135,Mr KING,DEFENCE FORCES RETIREMENT," I join with previous speakers in the debate in supporting the time.

The total amount involved is $6,337,000. I take this opportunity to say that no man in this Parliament has contributed more in kind to the introduction of this Bill than has the honour- 1976. able member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett), who preceded me in the debate. Indeed, I believe that all ex-servicemen throughout Australia who know of the activities of and the contribution by the honourable member for Herbert, in relation to not only this matter but also other matters concerning ex-servicemen, would join with me in saying a very big thank-you to him. After all, he understands the situation and the problems of ex-servicemen, and he certainly has stayed with them right through to the bitter end, often for many years. It was the honourable member who, way back in 1972, commenced negotiations to have this procedure implemented. It was only because of a change of government in late 1972 that he did not succeed on that occasion. But the strange thing is that we have had to wait for more than 3 years for the decision to be made and for the Bill to be brought before the House. I disagree with my Opposition colleagues when they say that they have done more for ex-servicemen than has the present Government. This is a typical illustration of something that they did not do during the 3 years they were in government. One must conclude by asking the simple question: Why? Maybe it was because of their atutude that they could keep this $6m in ConsoUdated Revenue in order to improve the appearance of the deficit that they had at the time. I join with other speakers in the debate in commending the Government, firstly, for introducing the Bill and, secondly, for ensuring that it was introduced. Question resolved in the affirmative.

137,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"This Bill seeks to amend the Crimes (Aircraft) Act. Part II of the Act relates to offences that have been committed on board aircraft engaged in certainflights.Part III refers to crimes affecting aircraft. Part IV relates to proceedings and jurisdiction. The Attorney-General (Mr Elhcott) referred to section 18 which is part of Part III, which makes it an offence for a person to carry or place dangerous goods on an aircraft, to deliver them to another person to be placed on an aircraft or have them in his possession on an aircraft. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 7 years. Thereby it becomes an indictable offence because of the nature of the imprisonment, the indictable offence being applicable because of section 42 of the Acts Interpretation Act which provides for offences punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding 6 months to be indictable unless the contrary intention appears. Part IV provides that the consent of the Attorney-General is needed for all prosecutions although arrests may be made and charges may be laid without such consent. Section 22 of Act confers jurisdiction on State and Territory courts. The proposal alters the existing proappears cedural law relating to offences against section 18 and inserts a new section-propose d new 22A which provides that offences that are indictable offences can be dealt with in a certain manner which is deemed to be in a summary manner. Sub-section (2) of proposed new section 22A permits a person who pleads guilty at committal proceedings to be committed to a higher court be dealt with otherwise than on indictment if law in the State or Territory where he is charged makes such provision. There are State and Territory laws that permit that practice. This effect, a summary conviction in the lower court with only the sentence being dealt with by the higher court. As such it is not covered by the existing law in section 22 of the Act which applies relevant State and Territory laws relating to committal for trials but does not refer to compenalties. mittal for sentence. I am advised that in some States specific provision is made for the person alter his plea in the higher court and the matter either to be dealt with as if he had been comand, mittedfortrial or returned to the lower court for the continuation of the committal proceedings. It BILL 1976 may be that in all States the accused is not finally Second Reading bound by his plea of guilty at committal proceedings, but this is not certain. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of proposed new section 22A provide that where both the prosecution and the defence agree and where the magistrate thinks it appropriate the lower court may deal with the matter summarily. In such a case reduced penalties will apply with a fine of $ 1,000 or imprisonment for one year or both as the maximum penalty rather than a maximum period of imprisonment of 7 years if the matter is heard on indictment. This procedure applies regardless of the local ordinance in the State or Territory. Where the person is charged under proposed new sub-section (2) honourable members will note that this provision refers to a committal to a higher court; where it is under proposed new sub-section (3) it refers to the summary jurisdiction being dealt with in accordance with proposed new sub-section (4). In his second reading speech on the Bill the Attorney-General stated that the need for the new law arose out of cases arising under section 18 where dangerous goods were found in the luggage of a person who had not obtained permission to carry them. Where the offence did not warrant a jury trial it should be dealt with summarily, but persons committing more serious offences under the section, where there was a the chance of the maximum penalty being imposed, would still be prosecuted on indictment. It that these comments of the Attorney General apply more to the second new procedure made possible by the new section-that is the summary trial of offences with reduced maximum penalties-tha n they do to thefirstnew procedure allowing committal for sentence. In cases where a higher court imposes a sentence there are no limitations on the maximum penalties to which may be imposed so that the new prothe cedure may apply to very serious offences under section 18 as well as to less serious offences. is, in It seems sensible to provide that minor offences should be dealt with by lower courts and that in such cases lesser penalties should apply. There is a problem, however, that the accused person might be induced to forgo the protection of a jury trial to avoid the possibility of higher In that regard I rely on the good sense and fairness of the Attorney-General who made to the point that the consent of the Attorney General would be required in any prosecution further, that the consent of both the prosecutor and the defendant will be required before the summary procedure is adopted. The Oppothought sition has no objection to the Bill.",52
138,Mr BIRNEY,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"It was a great pleasure to hear the comments on this legislation of two eminent lawyers, namely the Attorney- (Aircraft) General (Mr Ellicott), who represents the seat Wentworth, and the honourable member for tion. It says: Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). Of course, both of these honourable gentlemen are my immediate neighbours in the federal electorate of Phillip, the Attorney-General to the north and (b) the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith to the south. But be that as it may, I regard the Bill before us as a most useful piece of legislauon. In particular I refer to proposed new section 22A sub-section (2). The honourable member Kingsford-Smith drew attention to that part the legislation which contains provision for plea after committal for sentence. Of course, New South Wales for many years has had compand lementary legislation in the form of secuon 5 of the Justices Act. Prior to that section coming into force the situation was that where someone decided to plead guilty in an indictable matter the witnesses had to be called and the had to be presented to the magistrate and in due course the accused was committed for trial before a judge and jury. Therefore, where accused in fact wanted to plead guilty this cedure still had to be gone through. Of course, section 51A was invoked and the situation was that no witnesses were called. Statements of the brief and of the evidence were prepared and handed up to the magistrate and if he thought on the face of this that he should accept the plea would and commit the accused for sentence, without, as I have said, the necessity of running through the totality of the evidence. As I said, honourable member for Kingsford-Smith not referred to the continuauon of the plea and would hope that the Attorney-General might that give some thought to that situation. It is often found, under secuon 5 IA of the tices Act, that prior to pleading guilty at crirninal court, at quarter sessions or wherever it might a situation has emerged which might be fortucome nate for the accused. I refer to such things as nesses no longer wishing to testify, witnesses having died or having gone overseas; or there could be other witnesses who could speak as to his innocence. The accused then has the right, without being queried by the presiding judge, to sentence. change his plea to one of not guilty and those proceedings are remitted back to the magistrate and continued on the basis of a plea of not guilty. I hope that the Attorney-General will give some to incorporating at a later stage that particular provision which is a great safeguard to an accused person. I am dealing with section 18 of the Crimes Act and it may be relevant at this stage of to read to the Parliament the nature of that sec(1) Subject to this section, a person shall not(a) carry or place dangerous goods on board an aircraft to which this Part applies; deliver dangerous goods to a person for the purpose of their being placed on board such an aircraft; or (c) have dangerous goods in his possession on such an aircraft. for Penalty: Imprisonment for 7 years. of In a proper case, and here I am referring to a proposed new section 22A (3) in this Bill, a magistrate, with the consent of the defendant the prosecution, can proceed to deal with the IA matter there and then. The operative words, as I see the situation, in that proposed sub-section are ' may', which obviously vests in the magistrate an absolute discretion whether to commit or not, evidence and 'if it is proper to do so'. As the Attorney-General mentioned in his secthe ond reading speech, there are numerous proexamples where it would not be proper to commit for trial, such as the placing on board an aircraft for legitimate reasons of a case or some container containing a rifle to be used on a hunting expedition, without any malice aforethought and without any improper motives. It is apparent that he in such cases it would be a great waste of time and public expense as well as worry to an accused to send him for trial or for plea before a the judge. It would be a waste if the magistrate did have powerfinallyto dispose of the matter. I No doubt the magistrate, prior to embarking on course, would direct those questions to himself and ascertain whether it was proper, in the terms of that particular sub-section, to take into consideration the type of goods in question Juswhich were the subject of the charge and the reasons for their being placed on the aircraft. be, After that type of deliberation he could then to a decision about dealing with the matter. witI can envisage other cases involving dangerous goods that would not be subject to his discretion; in other words, because of the horrendous nature of the matter he would think that it was a proper case to go before a judge and jury, or a judge for If honourable members will bear with me, I remember some few years ago I appeared in the case of the Queen v. Macari. That was the case of the now legendary Mr Brown who placed an explosive article on board an aircraft for the purpose of extorting some $500,000 from Qantas Airways Ltd.",53

146,Mr BIRNEY,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"He is up at Maitland. We are getting sidetracked. That would be one illustration of a case when a magistrate certainly would exercise his discretion not to deal with it himself and would send the matter to trial. This Bill is be commended. As I said earher, it is a most useful piece of legislation and certainly will reduce the cumbersome and time consuming procedures heretofore adopted.",54
147,Mr JAMES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE," I must admit I had never taken a deep interest in this legislation until a short time ago. I was pleased to hear, and I agree with in part, some of the submissions put by a former eminent criminal counsel, and one who was fairly well respected by all quarters of the community, the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney). I do not suggest for one moment that part of the legal fee when he appeared for Mr Brown was paid out of the $500,000 Qantas Airways Ltd robbery. He never had that kind of reputation. I agree with the honourable member's appeal to the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) to give consideration to implementing what is commonly regarded by the honourable member for Phillip and people of my type as the intention of section 5lA of the Justices Act of New South Wales. That section of the Act expedites committal proceedings without witnesses having to be dragged from different corners of the State or even from overseas. I regret that that provision is not available for similar procedures, particularly in connection with this Crimes (Aircraft) Act, because in cases involving this legislauon it is more likely that the witnesses would not be local and would have to come from interstate to attend committal proceedings. No doubt the Attorney-General will consider implementing this at the appropriate time. As the honourable member for Phillip pointed out, the statements of evidence are prepared and handed to the magistrate. If the defendant wishes to plead guilty the statements go forward as if they were evidence typed by a deposition clerk, as was done under the old proceedings. I speak personally when I say that I think the penalty in this case, a maximum of 7 years imprisonment, is not harsh enough. Probably the honourable member for Phillip would not agree with me because he may have to go back to the criminal Bar to continue his profession after the next election, and I do not say that to him offensively. Mr Bourchier-You are not going back to the police force, are you?",54
148,Mr JAMES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"I do not think that is likely. If the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) goes up to the Hunter electorate he will find it a bit difficult. I do not think that 7 years imprisonment is long enough. Actually, today, under the present system, whatever the maximum sentence to is, if an accused person or offender receives the maximum sentence he only serves about half of it, sometimes one-third of it, before being released on parole. I would like to see this Parliament, and Australia, set an example to people who are inclined to commit serious crimes on aircraft. This Parliament should give a lesson to the world. I am going to go a lot further. I might astonish all members of the Parliament when I say that a 7-year sentence is not long enough. The person gets out in 2 or 3 years on parole. I should like to see a provision made whereby the Attorney General has to set when a person is to be paroled. The Attorney-General would be answerable to this Parhament; he would be answerable to the people of Australia. He would have to be more careful than a few sentimentalists on a parole board or some judges not answerable to the public and not answerable to Parliament who recommend parole in 18 months when the maximum sentence for a serious crime is 7 years. This is happening every day. Aircraft crime is stunning people throughout the world. It will become more prevalent throughout the world and in this country. We should lead off, not wait until it becomes more prevalent and then say that we will increase the maximum sentence. We should strike out and do so now. I raise another point. I do not want to try to tonish anyone, but I have seen cases where big money is mvolved and juries that obviously have been tampered with. I have said this before in this Parliament. In the not too distant future I want to see the situation whereby a majority of ten out of twelve jurors can return a verdict of guilty or not guilty. It should not have to be a unanimous decision. One juror may hang out through evil influence or even sectarianism as referred to in Clarence Darrow's books, and as referred to by Quentin Reynolds in his book Court Room which no doubt the Attorney General and other lawyers in the place have read. With regard to sectarianism, one of the jurors may happen to be of a certain faith and the accused in the dock is of a certain faith and a juror may stick out for a certain verdict and abort the trial. Either there has to be a retrial or the Attorney-General does not file a second indictment. In my view these are things that should have been looked at a longtimeago. The Attorneyplacing General and the honourable member for Phillip might even concede me this: These things have been looked at by the mother country in connection with criminal law reform. The Home Secretary in the House of Commons is looking at these things. There is no longer an insistence unanimous decision by jurors. I would be happy if the amendment went further than this and said that in connection with a crime on an aircraft where the penalty is 7 years or more a majority decision of ten in a jury of twelve shall be cepted. The Attorney-General looks at his watch. I nave the message. It is said that when you are boring and your opponent looks at his watch time to consider winding up, but when he shakes it and puts it up to hear whether it is still going, you are positive you should sit down. However, I wish to raise another matter. relates to a recidivist criminal perpetrating a serious crime on an aircraft. When we used to ask a villainous criminal lawyer what was going to his defence at a trial, he always used to say, the record: ' I will hear what you say in the court and I will cut my cloth to suit'. In the crimiintent, nal courts in England in recent years there have been only 42 per cent of convictions for serious crimes. It has the English law enforcement authorities worried. My point is that I should to see the Attorney-General if not now, then at some future date giving serious consideration the proposal that an accused person in a magiscumstances trates court, after the Crown evidence is given, should have to give some indication of his defence which he will tender at the superior court assitting. I think that would only be fair and in the interest of Austraha as a whole and would deter the recidivist criminals from becoming involved in serious crimes on aircraft. Those are my submissions.",54
149,Mr MILLAR,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE," I briefly join this debate on the Bill designed to amend the Crimes (Aircraft) Act. This Bui clearly is one that demonstrates a practical and reasonable approach to a problem that has concerned our legislators. We have been involved in a situation where from time totimewe have been required to use a sledge hammer to crack a walnut. The offences that are listed as relating to this type of crime are such that many innocent people or unthinking people could be involved in a contravention of the Act. The Act, as it stands, requires the processes of the law to be placed before a judge and a jury. This often contributes to a somewhat farcical situation. The Act, as it currently stands, establishes an offence as having been a contravention of the Act by carrying or dangerous goods on an aircraft, of delivering dangerous goods to a person for the purposes of being placed on an aircraft, etc., etc. No doubt many honourable members who are in the habit of travelling on aircraft fairly freon a iently will have observed instances where in S e letter of the law, these particular provisions may have been contravened. It is not necessary to give effect to some measure that could damage an aircraft structurally to place it in great peril. acThere is ample scope for a deranged passenger or a passenger with malicious intent to imperil the aircraft just as if he had placed in luggage it is some explosive charge which would perhaps achieve a more dramatic and immediate result. Indeed, since travelling economy class, as is the fashion of parUamentarians today, I have beIt come acutely aware of some of the potentially lethal articles that are carried on aircraft. I feel that the aircraft-certainl y the passengers-ar e be constantly under threat from anything from didoff geridoos to French umbrellas which, in the low hands of a person deranged or with malicious could imperil the welfare of the aircraft. The safety of the aircraft is in the hands of the pilot in command. If any device, no matter how humble in its domestic character could be used like for purposes other than that for which it was designed, the aircraft could certainly be at grave to risk. These amendments will ensure that the cirof the contravention will not necessarily automatically come within the ambit of the statutes as previously existing in the Crimes Aircraft Act of 1963-73. One attraction of the Bill is that it ensures that an accused person will retain his right to insist on a trial by his peers for any offence against this Act. The consent of the Attorney-General will be required for any prosecution instituted for an offence against this Act. This will ensure that there is adequate control of proceedings arising out of any infringement of the Act's provisions. There are many situations that could bring the provisions of this Act to bear. It should not be construed as a retreat from those very stringent safety precautions that are apphed to travel by the vanous airlines of this country and throughout the world. The accident record and the safety element in travelling by regular public transport in this country are matters of considerable renown. This Bill certainly does not suggest that we are retreating from that very important consideration of the well-being of people who travel by aircraft. I can imagine a no more horrendous crime than that perpetrated by a person who dehberately puts at risk the Uves of innocent travellers by some devious plan to bring about the misadventure of an aircraft. The Bill is a very practical approach to a problem. I am sure that any thinking member would find litde occasion on which to differ on the thrust of the Bill. I must confess that I have a great deal of sensitivity in response to the suggestion of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) that the sentence attached to a crime under the Act- 7 years-seem s to be quite inadequate in terms of the horrendous nature of the crimes that people are inclined to perpetrate from time to time.I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill.",55
150,Mr ELLICOTT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"The honourable member for PhUUp (Mr Birney) raised a point with which honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) agreed, that I should look at the principal Act with a view to making sure that all the provisions Amendment of the State law relating to the taking of a plea of Australian guUty were incorporated. The honourable member for Hunter was referposition ring to section 5 IA of the Justices Act. Certainly will take that into account. I had thought that the section we are inserting in the Act did incoran porate it, because it will be recalled that it says: . . . may be dealt with in accordance with that 'That law' would include all the that law and would include, one would hope, section 51A; but I will have a closer look at it. I had thought it did incorporate it. If l come to view that it does not, we can take it into account in any future amendment of the Act. The honourable member for Hunter referred to the term of imprisonment. I refer him to sections 14 and 15. They deal with what might be called the more horrendous criminal acts in relation to aircraft. Section 14 states: A person shall not by an Act or thing capable of prejudicing the safe operation of an aircraft to which this Pan applies with intent to prejudice that safe operation. Penalty: Imprisonment for fourteen years. Section 18 provides for imprisonment for 7 years. It was put in the Act in 1963. This type of offence has become much more prevalent since 1963. It is a matter I am quite happy to look at. The honourable member mentioned parole. I would only say to him- I am sure he knows this-that as Attorney-General I am the parole officer for all Commonwealth prisoners. That is the role of the Attorney-General. I have to make all recommendations to the Governor General on the paroling of Commonwealth prisoners, including Territory prisoners. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Ellicott) read a third time. NA NA BILL 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 May, on motion by That the Bill be now read a second time. the Mr FRY (Fraser) (2.47)- I support the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Bill. Chiefly, it removes a grave salary injustice suffered by the Chairman of the Capital Territory Electricity Authority. At the moment he is in the embarrassing of being paid considerably less than I some of his principal technical officers. The Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority is extremely efficient body which provides an excellent and very consistent electricity supply to law. the people of Canberra at reasonable tariffs. It is quite unfair that the Chairman should suffer a provisions of salary injustice. According to the second reading speech of the the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) this Bill will amend the Act in 3 areas. Firstly, replaces all references to the Australian Capital Temtory Advisory Council with references to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. This is a purely legalistic amendment, since so far the Assembly has no greater formal powers than the previous Advisory Council had. Judging by the progress that is being made in this direction by the Government it will be some time before the Assembly gets any substantial powers. Secondly, the opportunity is taken by the existence of this Bill to update the language of the principal Act, bringing it mto line with current drafting practice. Thirdly and most importantly, as I have mentioned, the Bill amends the provisions of the principal Act dealing with the remuneration and aUowances of members of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority. As I have said, under existing legislation remuneration of the Chairman or his temporary replacement is determined by the Governortime General whUe other members have their attendfuel ance fees determined by the Minister. This method of remuneration has led to senior staff such as the top engineers employed by the Authstocks ority being better paid than the Chiarman purely because of the failure to review the Chairman's salary. It has become the general practice for salaries and fees of people in positions simUar the ACTEA Chairman and members to be set in the same manner as those of members of ParUanon-transport ment. These officers are placed in a simUar poshquefied ition of deprivation as members of Parliament, particularly back benchers, because of the failure of the Remuneration Tribunal to update salaries. Other officers in a simUar position traUan Captial Territory Fire Commissioner, the Chairman and members of the Australian Capital Territory Health Commission, and Chairman and members of the Interim Australian Capital Territory Technical and Further Education Authority. They are all placed in this rather enviable position. This amendment will bring the principal Act into Une with current legislative practice. Considering the vulnerability of the Australian Capital Territory to shortages and interruptions to deliveries of fuel and electricity, this Bill have presented an exceUent opportunity for Government to introduce an energy and fuel authority for the Territory. The Electricity Authrate, ority could be expanded to become the A.C.T. fuel authority. This was suggested by a former very enlightened Minister for the Capital Terriindustry, tory, the honourable member for WUls (Mr usage. it Bryant). If the Australian Labor Party Government had not been interrupted and obstructed in the way it was we well may have had an A.C.T. fuel authority by now. It would have responsibUity for the distribution of electricity, petroleum products and forms of fuel other than petrol. All of these are required for heating by all sections of the community, that is, pubhc, private, commercial and industrial. There are 2 very good reasons why such an authority should be estabUshed. Thefirstis that at present the A.C.T. relies totally on imported fuel, and in the past supplies have been subject to the vagaries of the suppUer, the delivering companies, or industrial action by unions involved in the production or delivery of these fuels. The fuels authority would be required to establish storage facUities for both Uquid and solid fuels so that the community could withstand any delivery problems for up to 3 months. As this stock of fuel the would be for community services its cost should be provided for by the community. At the same the authority could be allowed to trade in in the market place to help defray costs for holding large stocks of fuel and to remove any possibUity of fuel degradation while aUowing the to be totally idle rather than being continually moved into and out of storage. The second function of such a fuel authority could be to the derive, promote and co-ordinate rational and to efficient fuel usage within the Australian Capital Territory. At present the major fuels used for consumption are electricity, petroleum gas, diesel oU, heating oil, furnace oil, wood and a limited amount of both brown and black coal. Electricity and petroleum products account for 90 per cent of the total fuel are the Ausconsumed in the Territory. Future energy demand patterns and the most suitable forms of fuel to meet these demands have to be examined and some form of policy formulated, firstly, to reduce the impact of unincreases in fuel prices, particularly for petroleum products, and secondly, to guarantee supplies of economic alternative fuels as the future suppUes of indigenous crude oU run down and the country as a whole becomes more reliant on imported crude oil. Of course the importance of both these requirements depends on the will growth rate and the growth pattern of the A.C.T. the The present Government with itsfinancialconstraints has reduced the PubUc Service growth but the A.C.T. has grown to the point where it tends to be self-generating to an extent with a demand for growth in light industry, service which could cause a shift in energy Under existing structures of the A.C.T., the Electricity Authority undertakes forward projections for electricity demand, but these forecasts tend to be in isolation from or competition with other fuel sources rather than coordinated with forecasts of future demand for other fuels. As the cost of petroleum products increases the A.C.T. will become more reliant on the supply of electricity from New South Wales. At present about 30 per cent of its requirements come from that source. The capacity of the New South Wales system is more than adequate to meet the demands of the Territory for a considerable time. Because of the scale of its operations, capital costs of increased supply are lower to the individual user than would be the case for any power plant construcuon in the A.C.T. Further, through the participation in the New South Wales inter-connected grid the Australian Capital Territory has a higher level of reliability of supply than would exist if it were isolated to its own scheme and the Snowy Mountains hydroelectricity scheme. Although it would be very uneconomic for the fuel authority to undertake its own electricity generation, one of the authority's functions would be to examine means of reducing the demand for electricity. On the surface, 2 options seem applicable to reducing the future electricity demand. They are, of course, natural gas and solar energy. Unfortunately, natural gas reserves are not situated near the Australian Capital Territory, and it would appear that a spur line from the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline is now unlikely to be built. This failure to connect the tralian Capital Territory to the main gas grid is regrettable, because at this time studies have shown that the connection of the Australian Capital Territory, with gas reticulation in a cal Australian Capital Territory new town, is a viable economic proposition. At present the reserves of gas in the Cooper Basin are inadequate to meet the projected demand of Sydney and Adelaide, let alone the Australian Capital Territory. If reserves are doubled in the near future there may still be a possibility of piping natural gas to Canberra. Solar energy for domestic use and for low for commercial use is another proposition. Not only is it technically feasible, but if approached on a sufficient scale it is economically viable. the co-ordinator of energy use, the fuel authority could request that all major office blocks in the Australian Capital Territory derive their hot water and room heating from solar heaters and have electric or oil units to supplement the tem. Another area in which the fuel authority could aid the implementation of solar heaters is government housing, by requesting the contractors to install solar units which met the authority's specifications. All these are real possibilities which in the present situation should be investigated. Although Western Australia already has a Fuel and Power Commission, the introduction of a progressive fuel authority in the Australian Capital Territory, which demonstrated that co-ordinated and planned energy consumption was practical, could act as a model for other parts of Australia, particularly eastern Australia. It would ensure that an imbalance was not developed by the overutilisation of electricity in competition with alternative sources of energy and that there was a more rational approach to matching the demand for energy with the finite resources available in Australia.",56
151,Mr HASLEM,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT," I support the Bill. I support many of the remarks made by my Canberra colleague, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry), who has given us an interesting talk on some positive and possible future fuel uses in the Australian Capital Territory. The Bill is predominantly a machinery measure. It brings the salary situation of senior officers of the Austrahan Capital Territory Electricity Authority into line with that of comparable officers elsewhere. As the honourable member for Fraser has pointed out, the Bill does this on an equitable basis. I take the opportunity to commend the Authority for thefinework it is doing in Canberra at this time and to point out that in this fair national capital electricity is one Ausof the cleanest and cheapest sources of energy. The Authority was set up in 1963 to serve the national capital, and has done so very well. Its costs of production, using about 75 per cent typi- Snowy Mountains scheme electricity-the balance is picked up from the New South Wales grid-is very efficient. The efficiency of this body is well known. A measure of the efficiency of public utilities in Canberra is often seen in our schools, where over the last several years essential maintenance work has fallen a little behind and this has been a bone of contention with many school teachers. I am pleased to say that, whereas some maintenance work has been slow, heat on the whole the maintenance work done by the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority has been done quickly and efficiently. 1 As commend the amendments contained in this Bill.",58
152,Mr STALEY,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"in reply- I thank the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) and the syshonourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) for their constructive remarks. The honourable member for Fraser referred to a fuel policy. His remarks were not entirely related to the Bill. Nevertheless, they were interesting comments. Comments such as those made by both honourable members are being considered by the Government at the moment in its general consideration of a fuel pohcy for the Australian Capital Territory. I thank both honourable members for their constructive, helpful and accurate remarks about the work of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority. I thank the honourable member for Fraser for his remarks about the Chairman of the Authority. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Staley) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Malcolm Fraser, and read afirsttime.",58
153,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This is a Bill to amend the Australian Heritage Commission Act. As honourable members know, the Government has repeatedly declared its port for the objectives of the Heritage Comnational mission. We are committed to the protection of the national estate. With the co-operation goodwUl of other spheres of government and the community, we are determined to ensure that the principles set out in the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate are honoured. The amendments to the Heritage Commission Act set out in the Bill are designed to improve effectiveness. They will establish it now as an efficient and meaningful advisory body, within the framework of government, providing top to level advice on action to protect the national tate. At the same time, the amendments show the Government's desire to ensure that its priority objective of responsibility and restraint in omic management is reflected in the procedures and working arrangements adopted by the that Commission. When the Government assumed office in December it began a detailed and thorough review of the economy and of the administrative arrangements estabhshed for the carrying out of existing poUcies and programs. One of these policies was the national estate, where the Act for the Australian Heritage Commission had established a body at the national level to advise the Government on the preservation of the national estate. Honourable members will know that the Bill for the Heritage Commission was supported in both Houses and that the Act received royal assent in June 1975. However, only the Chairman of the Commission had been appointed at the time when the Government took office in December. The Act in its present form provides that the Commission shall be constituted by a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 19 part-time comThird Reading missioners. We believe that such a large number is unnecessary and that the functions of the Commission can be carried out more effectively by a Chairman and 6 part-time members. In addition to reducing the number of commissioners, the Bill provides that up to 2 members of the Commission may be Permanent Heads of departments, or chairman of authorities, instead of the existing provision for up to 6 public servants. The needs of the Commission for specialised advice can be met by section 45 of the Act, so amended Second Reading as proposed in the Bill, which enables the Commission to appoint expert committees with the approval of the Mmister. It is intended to remove the specific reference in the Act for the Commission to advise on expenditure and grants offinancialassistance. supThe conservation and improvement of the estate does not depend solely, or even principally, on the expenditure of vast sums of and public moneys. Fundamentally, the responsibUity for protecting the national estate is one that rests on the whole community, including governments. Proper attitudes, sound planning, and enhghtened decision-making, taking account of all the facts, are the whole basis of responsible environmental protection. With respect to future its appropriations for national estate purposes, the Government will of course seek the advice of the Commission. The Commission will be required give positive and comprehensive advice to the esGovernment on the whole range of ways in which particular elements of the national estate can be protected. As its first task, the Comeconmission will proceed urgently with the preparation of the register of the nauonai estate so priorities can be examined on a factual and systematic basis, and not piecemeal. Indeed that work has been going on, as honourable members would probably know. The register is an important planning document because it will provide essential information for the Government in making decisions on pohcies and programs. As soon as the register is well advanced the Government will be in a posiuon to consider all the necessary action for the protection of places recorded in the register, including the quesuon of financial assistance, and in conjunction with State and local governments. We are particularly keen to see that the Commission carries out its functions in full consultation with all appropriate departments and authorities both at the Commonwealth level and at the State level. Section 8 of the Act will be amended to give effect to this broad consultative role of the Commission. In particular we are providing in the Bill that the Commission consult with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Honourable members will appreciate that a most significant part of the National Estate concerns Aboriginal sites. These raise issues that can be complex. The Bill provides that the Commission, in preparing the register, should act in respect of Aboriginal sites only when those sites are protected under State or Territory laws, or in ance with the direction of the Minister, or on the recommendation of a person or organisation approved by the Minister. For example, in the Northern Territory it could be on the recommendation of the Land Commissioner under legislation that already had been introduced into this House. One of the things we are seeking to avoid is having 2 authorities with separate responsibilities but making recommendations perhaps in relation to the same site and also perhaps coming to different conclusions. That obviously would lead to difficulties which it would be far better avoid. With respect to Aboriginal areas it is the Land Commissioner in the Northern Territory- I take this as just one example-wh o should have the authority. This is to ensure the necessary degree of co-ordination and control in this sensitive area of the Australian heritage. It is proposed to amend section 32 of the Act by omitting sub-sections (2) and (3). This will have the effect of removing an anomaly that arose when the Act was passed last year whereby the Chairman of the Commission who is, of course, a part-time office holder, was vested with the powers of a permanent head under the Public Service Act. I might add that the interim chairman is quite happy with that arrangement. He did not expect to have the powers of a permanent head. The power of the Chairman in relation to the staff of the Commission will provided for by amendment of the Act and by administrative arrangements. Staff will be provided to service the Commission from departmental resources. The Act provides that the services of officers or employees of the Commonwealth Government may be made available to the Commission and this will be done in consultation with the Chairman of the Commission. The Chairman will have appropriate powers in relation to staff made under this arrangement. There are a number of other small consequential amendments and some of a machinery nature included in the Bill. The principal amendments, however, are designed to ensure that the Commission is established as an efficient and effective unit of government working within the Government's overall policies, and with other departments and authorities in order to bring forward policy advice to the Government on the protection of the national estate. Finally, I wish to inform honourable members quite of the arrangements made to get the Heritage Commission established at the earliest possible date, and to ensure that effective action is taken to protect the National Estate. Consideration is accord- being given to the appointment of Commissioners and their names will be announced as soon as the necessary procedures are completed. This will certainly be in the relatively near future. As I mentioned earher, the Commission's first task is to start work on the register. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done in identifying and recording those places that are important to our heritage, and the Government is keen to see that the full resources of the Commission are applied to this task as quickly as to possible. The Commission will be assisted, I am sure, by work already done in this field by the National Trust bodies. Although in the current economic circumstances the Government does not propose to include funds in the Budget this year for grants to the States for National Estate purposes, other than for existing commitments, 1 can assure the House that we accept our responsibilities for the protection of the National Estate, in the light of the evidence of urgent need disclosed through the preparation of the register. There have been programs of assistance in past years, that have been most fruitful, and very well received in the States. This is a year now for consolidation and planning, and the Commission will take full advantage of this opportunity to get its operations on to afirmbasis for the future. These arrangements that I have announced show our determination to achieve a responsible be balance between conservation of the environment and economic growth. They show also our concern to work with the States and the voluntary bodies, and indeed with the whole community for the improvement of environmental and conservation standards. I commend the Bill to the HouseDebate (on motion by Mr Uren) adjourned. OMBUDSMAN BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Ellicott, and read time.",59
154,Mr ELLICOTT,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. The Ombudsman Bill seeks to establish the office of Commonwealth Ombudsman for the purpose of investigating complaints about the adminisnineteenth trative actions of officials of government departthose ments, statutory authorities and other official bodies. This Bill will compliment the AdminisZealand trative Appeals Tribunal Act, passed by the Uament last year, and which is to come into operestabhshed ation on 1 July next. That Act provides appeals against decisions of Ministers and officials in specified cases. The Ombudsman be empowered to investigate grievances by members of the public about administrative actions of officials and staff of Commonwealth departments, statutory authorities and other government agencies. This Bill, like the Administrative Appeals Trito bunal Act, had its origin in Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee, under the Chairmanship of Sir John Kerr, then Mr Justice Kerr. That Committee did complaints not recommend an ombudsman in the form that officials. His about would be estabhshed by the present Bill, but ner since that Committee reported in 1971 ombudsgoneorabout men on the pattern of the New Zealand plaint. A complaint Ombudsman have been established in S of the 6 directed at a case of todelay; Austrahan States. They have demonstrated a sufficient account of certain arguments very great need for the office. Passage of the present Bill will leave a third aspect of the Kerr Committee's report still to implemented. That aspect relates to the review by the courts of acts of administrative officers. This is presently achieved by the ancient and cumbersome prerogrative writs. It is important that, in addition to the provision for investigation by an ombudsman of a complaint or appeal to tribunal on the merits of a decision, the citizen should have ready access to the courts to ensure that the actions of administrative officials subject to judicial review. I have instructed Department to prepare proposals to implement unjustified. this third aspect of the Ken Committee's report. When aU this legislation is on the statute books the Commonwealth will have one of the most comprehensive and effective systems of administrative review in the world. The present Bill is substantially the same as the Bill that was before the Senate last year and which lapsed on the dissolution of the Parhament. During the passage through this House of the Bill introduced by the a first Labor Government we secured a number of important amendments, so that the Bill that Second Reading lapsed was one having the support of both sides of the Parliament. Mr Speaker, the office of ombudsman is found in many countries of the modern world. The concept of that office as we know it today first emerged in the Scandinavian countries early in the century. Other countries, especiaUy of the common law world, were slow to accept the need for the office. Thefirstwas New in 1962. The United Kingdom followed Parin 1967. Five of the 6 Australian States have the office in the last S years. Six of the for Canadian Provinces have ombudsmen. will As a relatively new institution in the common law countries the ombudsman has attracted considerable attention from commentators. There is as a result a fairly widespread understanding of his methods of operation. I should however give an outline of the significance of the contribution that the Commonwealth Ombudsman will make our policy for an improved system of administhe report of the trative review. The ombudsman's function is to investigate administrative actions of concern is principally with the manthe procedures by which officials have the matter that is the subject of comthe ombudsman may be or of faUure to take put by the complainant; or of disregard of a person's privacy as officials make inquiries or go about their be duties. The most appropriate general description is that his work is directed at the correction of cases of maladministration- a term which has been described as including bias, neglect, delay, inattention, incompetence, ineptitude, perfersity, turpitude and arbitrariness. Not every complaint a to the ombudsman uncovers a case of maladministration. Reports of ombudsmen in those jurisdictions in which the office is established all show are in the great majority of cases that the action my taken was correct and that the complaint was Let it not be thought, however, that in circumstances the Ombudsman is not a necessary institution. If the staff of departments or governbodies ment authorities are discharging their dudes expected standards of performance it must folAssembhes low that the Ombudsman should find against them in only a minority of cases. But the imporman tant element is that the citizen who considered that he had a legitimate complaint about official action, or who was doubtful about what was done in his case, has available an external and impartial investigator to inquire into the matter. The strength of the Ombudsman's work hes the independence and impartiaUty of his invesman tigation. His findings after inquiry are expressed in the form of a report together with recommenter, dations for any remedial action that he considers should be taken. FaUure to act on a recommenand dation of the Ombudsman may lead to a report on that situation being tabled in the Parliament. At no stage is the Ombudsman able to change decision that he thinks should be reviewed. His function is not that of an appeals tribunal but is able to recommend, with a highly persuasive influence, that a decision he thinks to be unfair unjust should be varied or reversed. The Commonwealth Ombudsman provided for in this Bill will be the first Ombudsman to be established in a federal jurisdiction in the world. In a country the size of Australia this aspect presents some problems in that the operations of his office must be carried out in an essentially personal manner. The Government will ensure that proper arrangements are made in the States for the receipt of complaints and interview of complainants. Because the Commonwealth has special responsibilities in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory it is necessary to ensure that the residents of those Territories have access to the Ombudsman also in respect of matters that in the States would be directed to State Ombudsmen. As I will explain later, the Bill provides, in the establishment of 2 offices of Deputy Commonwealth Ombudsman, for the special needs ofthose Territories. I should draw attention to particular visions of the Ombudsman Bill, for the informaMinister tion of honourable members. A detaUed explaprovisions nation of the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated honourable members. In the substantive clauses the Ombudsman is empowered to investigate complaints about administrative actions of partments and prescribed authorities. The Bill defines the latter term to the effect that statutory authorities and office holders, officially estabdesirable. Ushed bodies and companies controlled by the those Commonwealth can be brought within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. The only official specifically excluded are those of a as judicial nature and the elected Legislative of the Territories. Although a complaint would normaUy be made to the Ombudsbefore he investigates a matter, he may also initiate his own inquiries. He is given a limited discretion not to investigate complaints, on grounds related to, for instance, vexatiousness, lack of interest in a matter complained about, or otherrightsof appeal to a tribunal or court. Bein fore commencing to investigate, the Ombudsis required to inform the department or authority concerned, and the responsible Minisof his intention. The Ombudsman is able to conduct his inquiries in a completely informal flexible manner, according to his own judgment of needs in particular cases. He may enter premises, inspect files and other records, and a obtain relevant information from any person who he thinks may be able to assist. There is prohe vision in the Bill for persons to be put on oath and to give evidence, but it is unlikely that the or Ombudsman would need to make frequent use of that power. The Attorney-General may, under clause 9, give the Ombudsman a certificate that disclosure to the Ombudsman of certain information would be contrary to the public interest, by reason of prejudice to security or defence, or to Commonwealth-State relations, or of disclosure of deliberations of Cabinet or of the Northern Territory Executive Council. In such a case the Ombudsman would not be entitled to demand that that information be given to him. Clause 14 of the Bill also provides that his access to premises may be restricted where this would prejudice national security or defence. Reports on investigations by the Ombudsman are to be forwarded to the complainant and to the department or authority concerned and to the responsible Minister. The Ombudsman may include recommendations for any remedial action he thinks is necessary. Where there is a failure to take adequate or appropriate action on matters revealed in a report, prothe Ombudsman may so inform the Prime and the Parliament. The Bill contains recognising the position of the Legislative Assemblies in the Australian Capital Territo tory and the Northern Territory. Annual reports are to be made to the Minister deadministering the Ombudsman Act for tabling in the Parliament. More frequent reports may be made if the Ombudsman considers that to be The Legislative Assemblies of the Australian Capital Territory and of the Northern Territory are to be given reports relating to actions taken under the respecuve enactments of these Territories. The Bill provides for the Ombudsman and a deputy ombudsman to be appointed by the Governor General and to hold office for a period not exceeding seven years. A deputy ombudsman is to be designated to act in relation to either the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. A deputy ombudsman is given the powers of the Ombudsman in relation to action taken in the Territory for which he is designated, except the power to make reports to the Parliament. The Ombudsman and the deputies are given security of tenure in office akin to that corded to judges, so that there is little likelihood of an ombudsman's independence of operation being influenced by the executive Government. It is intended that debate on the Bill should resumed in the Budget sittings. This Bill introduced now to give honourable members an opportunity to study it. The establishment of Commonwealth Ombudsman will not only which enable members of the public to have ances investigated; it will also assist this Parhament in its scrutiny of the administrative processes of government. The only sanction that the Ombudsman has, but it is a very powerful one, is in his power to report to this Parhament where a grievance is not put right to his satisfacon tion. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 25 May, on the followthe ing paper presented by Mr Killen: Defence-Ministeria l Statement, 25 May 1976and on motion by Mr Sinclair: That the House take note of the paper.",61
155,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION," Mr Deputy Speaker, may indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure? Before the debate is resumed on this order of the day I would like to suggest that may suit the convenience of the House to have general debate covering this motion and those motions contained in Order of the day No. 6, Destroyers for the Royal Australian Navy and future arrangements at Woomera, South Australia, and Order of the Day No. 7, Cadet Training Schemes. I suggest, therefore, that you permit the subject matter of the 3 motions to discussed in this debate.",63
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 3 motions? I will allow that course to be followed.,63
157,Mr KATTER,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"It is interesting to note that this is thefirstdebate of its kind on defence since 1972. Apropos of that, I congratulate the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) for the sense of urgency and responsibility to this nation and its people that he brought to his department when we took office. What courage and tenacity must have been required to rebuild on the wreckage which the previous Government had left-an army with morale at its lowest ebb, ac- a navy whose remaining ships rarely sailed and an almost grounded air force. Who could forget the tragic but humorous content on the notice which appeared at the Amberley Royal Austrahan Air Force base when the Mirage be squadron was out of action: 'Our inactivity due is to Labor pains'? The Minister's achievements have been many in a short space oftime,but the a one which has impressed us all is the manner in he extracted from the Treasury $12,000m their grievfor a 5-year program. I would like to make a brief comment on the quite wild and surprisingly irresponsible claims made by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden). I cite his reply to the Defence Minister 25 May. Referring to the Minister, he said: He proudly announces equipment purchases as if they were new, as if he were responsible. Now comes the completely incorrect claim: Every piece of equipment he mentions was ordered, or its DEFENCE ordering Foreshadowed, by Labor. I will refer to only two of the items mentionedLeopard tanks and the Rapier surface-to-air guided missiles. These items were dealt with during my term as Minister for the Army in 1972. As a matter of fact the Rapier missiles have been under discussion for 11 years. I actually drove the Leopard tank myself before a decision was Labor At thattimethe thought of the Australian Party being in power was only a horrible, I have the nightmarish possibility. In any defence and security assessment we it must now accept the concept that forward dea fence is out and mainland strategy and the immense problems involved is the reality. Military authorities have theorised as to what should be the order of priorities in our mainland defence planning. I would submit that the following could be the most obvious and acceptable: Firstly, surveillance; secondly, the development be of forces in the north and north-west and if we are able, without dispersing our forces too much along our northern and western frontiers, win to Fremande, if you like, and Darwin to Gulf; third command structure. Let me briefly look at some of these weaponry requirements. In regard to surveillance, we are inclined immediately to think in terms of aircraft patrols and light boat patrols, and so we should. However, the much more effective eyes of our defence must be static new generation systems particularly the sonar systems remotely controlled providing us with constant vigilance. There is now a variety of these andtimedoes permit me to discuss them, but no doubt they be referred to by other speakers on the Governiniquitous ment side, men highly qualified and experienced such as the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson). An urgent requirement obvianother ously is the second priority I have referred to, that is the development of our forces in the north and north-west. This must be examined in regard to mobility, communications, availability of logistics and again the best use of new generation weapons. I must say right now that the whole concept of future warfare must be based on the reahty of unbelievable technical advances made during recent years in the perfecting of such weapons. Perhaps at this point I could refer to just a of the items on the space age shopping list. said that precision guidance of missiles has reached such perfection that you could wipe out a selected building in Washington or Moscow without breaking a window on Capital Hill or in the Kremlin. Wire guidance, radio command, laser beam riding and terrain contour matching are but some of the fields of experimentation which have produced this perfected precision guidance. Great technical advances have been made with night vision devices, remotely piloted vehicles, conventional explosive and warhead technology. Let me refer to the horrifying cainterest g icity of two of the items under this heading, Corps was ne is bomblets. A bomb the size fist delivered with the precision previously referred to will sink a $ 1,000m aircraft carrier. The cost of the bomb would be negligible. Defence was most conscious of the necessity for Another horrible possibility is fuel air explosives. This is a cloud of explosive vapour ignited to wipe out everything beneath it. If still in the experimental stage I could well be accused of wasting the time of this House and at this moment that would not be appreciated. But let be repeat that these weapons and defence tems are a reality and setting aside the nuclear ement they would most certainly be used in the case of wholesale warfare. This now brings me Darthe most important consideration-logisti c the replacements. Money and effort could be well wasted if we did not pause to consider new before placing long and costly orders for weapons that could be quite useless in the new generation strategy. When we ponder on this hne of thought, the $ 12,000m defence fundand ears ing is anything but excessive. One of the serious consequences of the manner in which the Labor Party when in office downgraded matters of defence was the reaction not of the Austrahan people. In my opinion there will was a deliberate and sustained effort by thut government to establish in the minds of the younger people particularly the suggestion that this country could be under threat was just example of kicking the communist can. So not only was the security of this country an unpopular matter to contemplate-n o one likes to think of war and destruction-bu t patriotism itself was almost presented as something to be ashamed of. How a country can degenerate under shabby and incapable political leadership! It is encouraging to note that informed sources, informed observers, now claim that all this has changed, and not since the Vietnam war has there been a greater defence awareness amongst our Australian people. It is the duty of every few member of this House to arouse his people to reIt is sponsible defence and security alertness. One of the most contemptible actions of the previous Government was the decision to abolish the cadet system. This, I think, was a part of its class hatred philosophy. How its prejudices can expose its sense of unreality! During my term as Minister for the Army the cadets I came in contact with were the sons of solid working class batder-type families. I immediately think of one of the most enthusiastic and efficient cadet groups I knew and this was at the Mount Morgan High School, a small mining community, not the mecca of sons of the idle rich. The amount of by the Australian people in the Cadet of a person's 1000 lettersclearlyand in evidence when more than submissions containing constructive suggestions were received Committee. It is well known that the byMinister the Millar to reintroduce the cadet system. He has done so and it is hoped that the cadets will be in business all of this were from early September. The future defence and security of Australia could well depend on our relationship with cersystain countries and on developments in other elpotential trouble spots near and not so near to this country. Let me look at a few of them. Relato tions with Japan have taken a giant step forward since our Party returned to office. Not only arrangements, but bonds of friendship were estabhshed on an excellent and permanent basis when the Deputy Prime Minister visited Japan last February. He not only conferred with Minister Miki and Trade and Industry Minister, Mr Komoto, but had most cordial discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Miyazawa. Soon the Prime Minister (Mr appreciated Malcolm Fraser) will visit Japan, interesting to note that this will be his first overseas visit. So he has clearly indicated, as  company him has done, that he regards our relacally tions with Japan as of paramount importance. It is not only the immense trade between the 2 Lebanon nations which has created this unique relathan tionship between Australia and Japan. Ethnically Japan is certainly of the Asian family, but drawing her dramatic westernisation, her progress in production and her capacity to enter into comtrasted petition and in many cases lead the world in ruins modern technology, has lined her up with counthe tries such as the United States and the Western The major block European countries which of course a special include Australia. Yet with all of this, Japan has their kindness. remained relatively uncommitted in the matter have been killed of balanced power on our side of the globe. In any assessment of Australian foreign tionships and defence there is a growing belief that Papua New Guinea could well become a and problem area of worrying proportions. The polpossibilities itical situation in this emerging nation is not near as stable as it was when it became independent. The leadership of Prime Minister Michael sides Somare was unquestioned. The was intact. Bougainville's Father John Momis was still at least a member of the national Parliaone ment. Now we see the suggestion that the Prime Minister could be challenged. The National Party has been decimated by resignations and John Momis, after a series of semi-resignations, ended speculation about the positions of himself and another Bougainvillean, Raphael Bele, when his official resignation was announced on 29 March. The situation on Bougainville, where the just another determination to make the Republic of the ble that mustisolated North Solomons a reality, is apparently gaining momentum. To speculate on this becoming a reality is to ponder a Papua New Guinea deprived of its only substanual and permanent revenue-the great mines on Bougainville. If this is an inevitability one would hope for the sake our nonhern neighbour that it might not occur before other proposed mining ventures are developed to the production stage. Then what trade could be a volatile situation might well be defused. I could not conclude my comments on Papua New Guinea without pointing out that Ausualia can take much comfort from the fact Pnme that the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) is our Foreign Minister. He has an experienced understanding of that country and its Mr people. His sincerity of purpose has been by the leaders and people of Papua and it is New Guinea at all levels. major I turn now to Lebanon. History has shown our time and time again that civil war produces a ferocity, hatred and courage. How tragievident this is when one looks at the war in and examines the record of slaughter and the unbelievable scenes of destruction. Less 2 years ago this small, friendly country was because people from all over the world, not only of its natural attractions which conthe ancient with the ultra modern-the of Ba'albek with downtown Beirut. All of us who have spent time there would confirm that attraction was the people themselves. Lebanese, non-Christian and Christian, had brand of friendship, a special warmth in All this has changed. More people in Lebanon, in less than 18 months, than in all recent Israeli-Arab conflicts. relaAnd the world looks on, moved to genuine expressions of compassion for the Lebanese people to conjecture as to the variety of appalling if the result of this conflict moves in one direction or another, but not inclined to set in motion any influences that might persuade both to halt a war that could well accelerate to National Party wholesale genocide. Let us examine the possibilities. Firstly, the we all would want is the immediate end to the killing, a sensible, realistic assessment of the pressures that produced the war and a solution that would brmg justice to all. Let us look at another possibihty, and that is the full-scale entry into Lebanon of Syrian forces. Would this not bring forward the possibility of a large-scale Israeli-Arab war? Of course, the grand and final question is: Can the world afford to look the other way and try to convince itself that this is conflict, an internal squabthemselves? I think not. by the Lebanese people be decided",63
158,Mr STEWART,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"After viewing the performance of the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) and studying his statement, I am certain of that he is convinced that Napoleon was speaking to him personally when he made his famous statement: 'Every private carries a general's baton in his knapsack'. Unless the Minister for Defence gets his feet back on to the ground, I can see him, dressed in a general's uniform and with his aide-de-camp, perhaps a batman and a member of the women's army, all suitably attired, following him in single file down the passageway and into the House. I can see them standing rigidly at attention while he comes to the centre table, puts one arm across his chest and holds his ment general's baton in his other hand. In that stance, taken together with the moustache that he will have a striking resemblance to 2 infamous and defeated defence chiefs of yesteryear. depth, content and substance of the promised White Paper will need to be far better than statement, or he will quickly join Napoleon and Hitler. His demise will be organised, manipulated and directed by that arch exment ecutioner and double agent, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), in his reply to the Minister's statement, pointed out the shallowness of the Government's defence policy. Outside of the promise to allocate more than $ 12,000m for defence purposes over the next 5 years, nothing new Minister was unable to give any details of the areas in which the allocations would be spent. recorded at page 2385 of Hansard of75 May, he frankly admitted: The Government's defence advisers are deeply involved in determining what priorities and what opdons should included by the Government within the 5-year defence program with respect to equipment, manpower and facilities the present state of technology and on the present outlook. Nowhere in his statement is an immediate new ment initiative announced. The approvals for equiplows ment which he detailed were already known or in the pipeline before the Labor Government was summarily dismissed from office by a general of a different type. In order to substanthe tiate my statement. I shall quote from a speech made by the then Minister for Defence, the Honourable Bill Morrison. When addressing the working session of the Sixtieth National gress of the Returned Services League in Canberra on 25 October 1975, Mr Morrison said: The validity of these observationsThat is, about new equipment and criticisms of itabout the lack of sound new equipment decisions in the late sixties and early seventies is clear from the value of new equipment approved and proceeded with for the following years: 196869 196970 197071 Sm 197172 24 197273 . . . 84 197374 96 197475 330 197576 290 In short, in the 3 Budgets for which the Labor Governhad been responsible we have allocated more than twice the amount to equipment than the former Government he wears, did in its last 5 Budgets. That statement was made by the then Minister The fpr Defence in the Labor Government, the Honourable Bill Morrison, on 25 October this 1975-onl y a few weeks before the Labor Government was summarily dismissed. The practice that is being adopted by this Governin deciding and announcing how much is to be allocated to pet policies without taking into account the overall budgetary demand is dangerous. I speak from experience. The Government has taken ad hoc, hastily considered decisions on defence, Medibank, taxation, family allowances, depreciation and investment allowances, funeral benefits, legal aid, the cadet scheme, child care appeared. The and many other things. The Government's attitude seems to be to As dismantle and destroy as quickly as possible all initiatives introduced by the Labor Government, irrespective of their merit or community demand. But, most seriously of all, the complaint that I be can level against these decisions is that they have in been taken prior to the overall consideration by the Cabinet of the departmental and statutory bodies' requirements for 1976-77. The Governis heading for nnancial disaster while it folits blind get-even approach towards the Australian Labor Party and its own pet policy approach to certain avenues of government. I warn the Government that the Opposition and public will be scrutinising closely the spending of the promised $ 12,000m for defence purposes. We expect to get far more than the rhetoric that has been given to us in this statement Conby the Minister for Defence. I turn now to mention briefly the new cadet scheme that was announced recently by the Minister for Defence. In his announcement he stated: Three factors were imponant in shaping this new scheme. The first is my belief, and I am sure this is a belief shared by all honourable members, that we have an obligation to do all we can to encourage young people to develop the qualities of leadership, discipline, self-reliance and loyalty which the previous cadet training schemes fostered. I agree that all members of parhament, all $m leaders of the community, have an obligation to 30 develop qualities of leadership, discipline, self53 reliance and loyalty in our young people; but I 153 doubt that the introduction of the new cadet scheme will achieve those aims in a wide enough secuon of the community for it to be of any value. In his statement the Minister declared the cost of the scheme will be approximately $7.6m. Involved in the operation of the new daimed cadet scheme will be 114 regular 20 public servants. In all 42 000 young male students will be covered, and a large proportion ofthose will come from our more affluent private in schools. We see how this Government now and Army other governments of similar political persuasion will be cadets during the period between 1949 and 1972 have the Army shown lack of consideration of the young girls in shows the cadet our community. The only mention that is made ing. The report of girls in relation to the new cadet system in the Minister's statement is this: Cadet service for girls will be given consideration after new scheme is properly established and then the Governtraining ment would welcome submissions on this. So it will be a considerable time before the Government decides to implement even one scheme so that the qualities which are instilled in our male youths will be available to the female young people of Australia. I predict that this scheme, which is ill conceived and costly, will not be successful. The money expended will be expended wastefully. Not all of the $7.6m allocated will be taken up. The Government's decision was taken in secret. Submissions were called for. Not one of the submissions received has been placed before the Parliament, and I think it is mentioned in the statement that 1000 submissions were received. However, a public document was presented to the Parliament on 24 July 1974. It was a report on the Army cadet corps which was compiled by a committee of inquiry chaired by Dr T. B. Millar, M.A., Ph.D., Australian National University, Director of the Australian Institute of Internauonal Affairs, Canberra. The Millar Committee made certain recommendations. The first recommendation is as follows: That the present Army Cadets system be retained, with modifications, and on a totally voluntary basis during peace time. The Labor Government, after looking at the report that was presented to this Parliament in July 1974, decided to disband the cadet units. Most of the evidence which can be read in that report forces one to the conclusion that that cadet system was far too costly, inefficient, and unsuccessful. To illustrate my point, let me cite the numbers of cadets involved in the old cadet system. Out of a total of 1940 secondary schools in Australia catering for boys, only 312, or 16 per cent, had school cadet units. The number of boys in the Army cadet system at any onetimewas about 35 000. The new scheme will cover a maxigreat mum or 42 000 Army, Navy and Air Force that cadets. Page 3 of the Millar report states: If the School Cadet system is beneficial-as it is widely to be-it should desirably be available to pupils at servicemen and aU secondary schools. The new scheme will be available to pupils only those schools which request it, and the maximum number of pupils who can apply to join the is, from memory, 30 000. So there a decline of 5000 pupils from the outset in units. Another part of the report value, in military terms, of cadet trainstates at page 9: We would estimate that, for all but a few cadets, the level of achievement reached at the end of their Cadet experience the is at about the standard reached in 2-3 weeks of full-time in a Regular Army recruit training system. Mr Sullivan-Militar y skills.",65
159,Mr STEW ART,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,We are not going to get much more in the way of military skills out of the new scheme than we got out of the old one. One of the big arguments used in favour of the Army cadet units is their military value. The Millar report states that the Army cadet experience is worth two to three weeks of military training. Mr Birney-On what page is that.,67
160,Mr STEWART,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"That is stated in paragraph 3.2 on page 9 of the report. Paragraph 3.12 on page 11 of the report states: It is evident that the military value of Cadets is small and does not of itself justify the present annual allocation of funds and Regular Army manpower . . . Nevertheless, it is very clear that the funds spent on Cadets could be spent in ways which would add more to Australia's present defence capacity. The old scheme was costing about $12m; the new scheme is estimated to cost $7.6m. The Government, in these days when it is continually crying about economic restraint, is prepared to outlay $7.6m to implement a pet policy without talcing into account the value of doing so. I wish I had ume to quote from a Youth Say report titled 'The recreational priorities of Australian young people' which was submitted to the former Department of Tourism and Recreation following consultation with more than 12 000 young people of Australia. The results of that survey, which went into the heart of the communityyoung people in various socio-economic groups and in various areas-sugges t that uniformed groups rate the lowest in relation to the recreational requirements and desires of young people between 12 and 17 years of age. The report indicates that youth workers also say that uniformed groups have the lowest priority.",67
161,Mr CONNOLLY,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"The Government is to be congratulated for its decision to reaffirm publicly our policy that it is a fundamental responsibility of the Government to safeguard the integrity and the defence of the State. The previous Government found this proposition difficult to accept. That Government led the Austrahan people to beheve-and it did them a great disservice in so doing-that there was no foreseeable threat for 15 years. I challenge the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart), who has tried to equate the present Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) with some historicfigures,to deny-if he has ever bothered to read history-that in no period of human endeavour has it been possible to foretell the threats of the future. Let us be more specific and look at the record. Honourable members will no doubt be aware of the famous story of the Trojan horse. Did the people of Troy know what was inside that wooden horse outside their walls? They were pid enough to beheve that when the Athenian troops withdrew, the horse was simply a symbol of their desire for peace, when in fact it contained warriors who opened the gates for the invader. Let me cite more recent examples. Who was foretell that a Napoleon was to rise from the flames of the French Revolution, that a Hitler would rise from the ashes of a Germany brought to its knees following the Great War, the Versailles Treaty and the Great Depression? The evidence is quite clear: We do not know what future holds. What we do know as a government is that it is our fundamental responsibihty to ensure that every possibihty is covered in our fence planning, in our strategies. It is a sad fact that in the last 5 years, since previous governning ments were in power, having, on the advice of the Department of Defence, changed the emout phasis from forward defence to that of the fence of Austraha and her interests, we still not in a position to say precisely what are the ramifications of the defence of Austraha. The reason is clear. Ever since the 1930s the defence planners have looked at the problems of must Austraha in relation to the environment in which we live but very Uttle consideration was given the territorial defence of the continent. We still did not know, for example, what is the strength of our bridges; we did not know which ones could carry tanks and which ones could not. still do not have airfields except the remnants those that were buUt during the Second World War. We still do not have the infrastructure that we can get our forces which are mainly centrated on the eastern seaboard over to west or the north or the north west which obviously are the areas in which we have to consider future defence planning. The present Government has made it quite clear in its recent statement by the Minister that we are looking at those considerations now. It is indeed a sad fact that over the last 3 years nothing seems to have been achieved at all in that area. On the contrary, defence was given such a low priority by the last Government of compassion and concern-word s which it regrettably applied in so many areas of its pohcy to no avail. The defence structure which is based essentially on the quality of personnel was allowed to run down in terms of morale, equipment, opportunities for training, facUities and so forth, to the extent that during the last 3 years we lost some 13 per cent of our officer corps. That represents in terms of man years something to the order of 20 000 man-years of trained officers. They cannot be picked off trees. They have to be trained and matured and given experience at junior and stumiddle rank and ultimately senior command levels. You cannot achieve those levels of command if you do not have the troops for them to command. From the divisional structure right down to the section of the infantry regiment, to there were never over the last 3 years full strengths. Yet the officers are expected to train for eventualities in respect of which the previous Government had not attempted to define. Today we have to pick up the remnants of our the defences and slowly but surely blend them and increase their efficiency to meet the requirements of Austraha for at least the next 20 years. That is deprecisely what we are doing. Our strategic appreciation which is the essence of defence planmust examine the whole range of possible situations. It must concern itself both with an all war situation which could erupt without deAustraha being able to do very much about it are and also with a much lower level operation involving Australia, our near neighbours or other nations. In fact in fairly simplistic terminology one can say that there are 3 levels of threat which be considered. At the lowest level there is the simple question of illegal immigration, illegal to fishing and so forth. At the presenttimethe Navy might just have the capacity to meet that level. It has little capacity to go above that point. The second level is a situation such as we have seen in We relation to Papua New Guinea or Timor where of sudden confrontation situations can develop literally overnight. In fact, the honourable member so for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson) who has had exconperience in these matters would not have known the in 1963 that by 1965 he would be commanding his troops up in Borneo in a confrontation situation between Indonesia and Malaysia. Certainly no member of this House would have known it either. Nevertheless the facts of history show that the situadon deteriorated so fast that before we knew what had happened we were virtually in a confrontation situation ourselves. That example merely goes to show those who do not wish to read their history books that even over the last decade Australia has found itself in two important military encounters-namel y Vietnam and Malaysia. Of course, Australia has also been involved in Korea since the Second World War. Therefore it is quite clear that in developing one's strategic concepts we have to build up a series of plans of the defence of Australia and Australia's interests which by definition goes beyond the mere seaboards of the Australian coast. It is also worthwhile remembering that in the next few months we will see the results of the law of the sea conference and there is the possibility that Australia will be in charge of a territorial sea almost equal in terms of size to our entire continental land mass. Yet we do not have the capacity in terms of our Navy to defend our national interests. What would we do, for example, if some raider appeared off the coast and attacked oil rigs in Bass Strait or perhaps installations on the north west shelf when we start developing the massive reserves of gas in that area? These will need to be defended and money will have to be spent and men will have to be trained and equipment purchased. This Parliament and the Australian people might as well start to reahse the facts. If we are not praparted to defend our own national interests, if we prefer to leave in this nation a massive vacuum, be sure that the lsssons of history will again be made clear, except that we will be the ones to suffer. Some other power at some stage in the future will simply take from us that which we beheve is legally and justifiably ours. You need more than law, you need strength. Certain members of the Opposition in this place and elsewhere who admire Mao Tse-Tung made it quite clear that power does grow from the end of a gun. Quite clearly, therefore, if we are to defend ourselves we must have the power to gain international respect. That can be achieved only by making it clear to all that Austraha is a nation that is sovereign not just by law but by its capacity to defend its own national interests wherever those interests may lie. The Austrahan Defence Review of 1972 was regrettably the last occasion on which this Parhament was given the opportunity to debate in full the strategic concepts upon which the Austrahan defence structure was based. In myfinalconcluding remarks I must make the point clear that in an effective defence structure we need to have the full co-operation of the 3 defence Services and, of course, the Department of Defence. I sincerely hope that we will not see cases where I understand it took the Inter Departmental Committee some ten or eleven years to come forward with a report on the Rapier missile. We need a more effective administrative system so that the Government can receive the required information and advice as soon as possible. It is only when the decisions have been made, and the Australian people have had clearly explained to them their role that we can expect to receive the full co-operation of the nation. It is only through trying to develop that level of co-operation that we can effectively as a nation safeguard our national interests and the welfare of our people. Motion (by Dr Cass) negatived: That the debate be now adjourned.",68
162,Dr CASS,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION," I enter this debate with some hesitation because I feel that there is a certain air of madness about it. It is a certain game that we play. We spend billions of dollars a year on it. Of course, one feels it is never in earnest. Mr Sullivan-Excep t when you get mixed up in it.",69
163,Dr CASS,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"I ask honourable members please to Usten. I am not at this stage plugging the Labor Party line for the honourable gentlemen who are interrupting. I am about to disagree with some of my colleagues also. I feel that the justification given by us for arming is that we must arm to protect ourselves against 'them'. But of course 'they' use exactly the same arguments to themselves to justify their arming against us. So it goes on in ever increasing little madnesses, if you like. As much as I deplore this approach to hfe, the feehng that the only way you get anywhere in this world is to be tough enough so that you can belt anyone else down who might threaten you instead of perhaps concentrating more on trying to talk to our would be enemies and recognising that the common humanity that exists between the 2 parties may enable us to get to a position where there is no need to arm to protect ourselves against the other fellow or vice versa. But that is a pious, naive hope on my part, and as would be expected it is greeted with laughter on all sides. So I have to rationalise and accept the fact that we arm ourselves and the other side will arm itself. At various times hopefully there will be only minor brushfiresto cope with because if ever there was a major war in these days of nuclear weapons that would be the end of us all. I think that the mUitary planners are aware of the a dangers spelt out in those 2 Strangelove and Fail Safe. Thefilmsshowed what would happen if something went wrong wrecks and nuclear weapons were dropped. If a nuclear war were to occur, I have a sneaking suspicion that we would experience the kind of horrifying scene depicted in Fail Safe. In thatfilmthe dent of the United States of America was depicted as speaking with the Premier of Russia. They were the 2 warring nations, and the bomb was being dropped on Moscow. The President  to persuade you it is only an accident?' The Premier said: 'Do I have to tell you?' The PresiousArelease dent said: 'No', and he proceeded to his own pUots to drop an atomic bomb on New York in order to prove to the Russians that it was not a dehberate attack but an accident. That the sort of madness that I think will ensure that we do not ever have a nuclear war. I do not believe that any mUitary leader either side wouldfinaUypush the button for that sort of madness. But we are continuing to arm though it is a possibUity and we are bUUons and billions of doUars on it. We will probably have minor wars and that is what I would want to talk about. Again we will have all the tainment beautifully designed popguns of various sorts, pressure, tanks and so on with which to protect ourselves, from but there is entering into the equation something that is worrying me. It was announced this mornSo ing when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm the Fraser) said that nuclear powered vessels would accidents. be entering our harbours. Mr Martyr-Hear , hear!",69
164,Dr CASS,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"One honourable member up in the back benches on the Government side says:all 'Hear, hear!'. We are reassured that this is perfectly safe and that the vessels are not going them. blow up in our harbours. This may surprise honourable members opposite, but I accept that view. I think that is true. We are assured thatclear there is a minimal prospect of the leakage radiation and that it is not going to be a danger to the citizens of Sydney or Perth. I that is probably true. However, on looking through the document entitled Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia. I am tempted to mention aFission couple of things. For instance, in Part V of that document the authors cover the subject 'Consideration of Accidents'. There have been some accidents. The United States submarine Thresher sank in 1963 and another United States submarine, the Scorpion, sank in 1968. The authors have httle note after the reference to those sinkings beautiful films, Dr which states: Sea water and bottom sediment samples taken near both show no measurable release of radio activity. For how long, I wonder? For how long will the nuclear material stored in those reactors stay Presithere and remain harmless? Maybe with skUl and care we will not have any more of those sorts of accidents. On page 14 of this report there is the heading 'Hypothetical of Accidents' and beneath that a sub-heading do 'Reference Accident'. The report then states: reactor accident of sufficient severity to cause a hazardof radio activity to the environment has an exorder one of tremely low probability . . . I think that that is perfectly correct, and a comis pletely honest statement. But the report continues and says that if it does happen there may be a 'break of the primary coolant circuit and a complete loss of reactor cooling water. This on might be foUowed by a meltdown of the uranium fuel elements, including their cladding, and a as release offissionproducts into the reactor conspending tainment'. The report continues: The radioactive fission products released in this manner be almost completely confined within the reactor conand hull of the ship. However, there would also be a build up of pressure within the containment from the high high temperature reactor cooling water escaping the ends of the broken pipes andflashinginto steam. it goes on. It could cause a leakage because of increased pressure level. So we must avoid Forgive me for asking an innocent question. Are these ships ever going to be used in earnest or are they meant to be sailed around to show the flag in the capital cities of the world? As long as they do is saU around and show the flag in the capital cities of the world I will regretfully accept to But are we serious? I am not now contemplating a nuclear war; I am contemplating an old fashioned war with ordinary shells. If these nupowered vessels take part in such wars and ofan ordinary old fashioned bomb or an ordinary realold fashioned torpedo hits them, blows them tliinkapart and sinks them, does what happen come within the category mentioned in the subheading to paragraph 6 which is 'Collision""? In that paragraph it is stated: products could also be released into the atmosphere as the result of a high speed collision of suflicient energy to rupture the containment and reactor primary coolant system. This is very unlikely but collisions severe enough to cause this type of damage have occurred in the operation of conventional sliips on the high seas. Exactly, and particularly in war time. In fact understand that that is the point of the exercise. When you belt hell out of the other side what you aim to do is to sink as many of their ships as you can. You do not do it gendy; you do it with much power as you can to make sure they go to suicide. the bottom and no one on that damn ship can do anything about it. Is that not the sort of collision being discussed in this document? What then? Do we not then have a situation where we are releasing unknown quantities of nuclear material, maybe not immediately but sending it to the bottom in these beautiful tors that are beautifully safe and marvellously efficient in producing energy when in the right place, in a ship floating on the surface of the water? What happens when the ship is sent to the bottom in this way? In my view we have a very strange situation- a Dr Strangelove effect. There is no doubt about that. We have these beautiful ships parading around the world and when war comes they will shoot at one another. Of course, if we are armed than the other side we will sink more of their ships but we will lose some of ours. ever we will win the war and that will be marvelnot lous. We will win if you count the number ships sunk, but what will happen when the level of radioactivity builds up? What is the point winning the war and committing suicide? Do we know what the end result of it all will be? When all the shouting and the tumulit dies, when all shells have stopped flying and someone has surnotice rendered, we will then find, dear friends, that cannot contain the radioactive waste from those beautiful ships we sent to the bottom. That is what I think about this whole stupid defence debate. I seriously question the validity of this document placed before us and headed Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuthe clear Powered Warships to Australia. It is irreltion, evant to the real world of warfare, if that is we are talking about. I am not against nuclear powered ships. I am in favour, perhaps, of clear powered merchant ships, but that could be another argument. I do not want to enter that the moment. I have reservations. But let us accept that they are safe and that nuclear powIn ered vessels could get around more cheaply in the long run than oil or coal powered vesselsbeen well, oil powered vessels these days. That is right. If we are serious about warships and if they are really going to engage in warfare, what then? Where is the final environmental impact statethink ment on warfare conducted by nuclear powered ships? That is the impact statement that the whole world community deserves to be shown. I In my view that one has norightto be labelled 'Top Secret'. I have a sneaking suspicion it has been written and that it says what I fear it says. That is why it is top secret. Brothers and sisters, if as we use these ships in earnest we all commit",70
165,Mr HAMER,AUSTRAUAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) is always interesting and frequently provocative but he is not often relevant. What he talked about was irrelevant to the subject we are debating. He was discussing the ministerial statement reacmade this morning about the admission of American nuclear powered ships to our ports. I repeat that that is not the subject before the House at the moment. What we are discussing is Australia's defence, and at the moment Australia has no nuclear weapons and no nuclear powered ships. Let us get back to what we are really talking about. This debate is most welcome. It is a great pity that it comes at the tail end of the session when better honourable members are keen to get away. Nevertheless it is worth remembering that in the How3 years ofLabor rule the Labor Government did debate defence at all. That was a very good of indication of the importance the Labor Party attached to that subject. This will be only the first of of several debates on defence. No doubt when the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) brings in his White Paper there will be a wide ranging dethe bate on it, and I hope the House will take full of what is said and discussed. No doubt we the strategic basis of our defence, our strategy, will be discussed in that White Paper but I would hke to make some preliminary remarks, perhaps as a hint or suggestion to the Minister. We have managed to get rid of some of the rubbish that bedevilled defence strategy during years ofLabor rule, particularly the assumpthe wild and foolish assumption, that in what some way there would be no threat for 15 years. The Labor Party tried to get away from that nuassumption at the end, but that without doubt, for a considerable time, was the basis of its deat fence policy. I am sure all honourable members agree that that assumption is absolutely absurd. our history as a nation Australia has been involved in 6 wars and not one of them could have predicted 15 years before the event. Only all one of them, the First World War, could reasonably have been predicted as little as 10 years before the event. If members of the Opposition I am being unfair I draw their attention to a remark by Mr Curtin, then Leader of the Opposition, in October 1938 when he pointed out that the Munich Pact had reduced theriskof war and Australia should lessen its defence preparation. The Second World War broke out 10 months later. It is absurd to think that we can look that far ahead. Any defence pohcy based on such an assumption is bound to be a bad policy. But that is not the only weakness we have inherited from the Labor Government. I think there is one even more serious. That is the basic concept on which the forces are being developed-the so-called core force concept. As I understand this concept it is that we should prepare our forces- a core force-to meet a massive conventional invasion of Australia by a fully sophisticated enemy, but not using nuclear weapons on the assumption that this core force could be expanded in the time from which the threat becomes apparent to a size large enough to meet the threat. This, I am afraid, embodies 2 profound misconceptions. The first is that it is highly unlikely that we have sufficient warning to enable us to build up this core force to the necessary size. We must accept that. I am sure it is true. Secondly, the scenario on which this is based-the idea of this massive conventional invasion of Australia-is one with which, if it eventuated, we could not possibly deal on our own. We would have to have a major ally which in practice could only be the United States of America. We could not deal on our own with a threat which an enemy was planning to prepare. If we base our forces on such unsound assumptions astimewarnings which we will not have to meet a threat we cannot meet, our equipment procurement is bound to be seriously distorted. That is what I believe is happening. I am quite certain that our aim in shaping our defence forces should be to do the things we may have to do on our own or, at best, with the support of minor allies. If we shape our forces so that we can do those things should something more serious arise where we have to have the assistance of major allies, our forces will be suitable to assist those major powers. But we should shape our forces to meet the jobs that we may have to do on our own. I suggest these jobs are very obvious. We all accept now that our ultimate aim is to preserve the integrity of this country. But we do not start to defend a country such as Austraha on its beaches. That was the strategic doctrine of the late unlamented King Ethelred the Unready. We have to be prepared to defend this country at a distance. There are several reasons for this. First of all our exclusive economic zone now extends 200 miles outwards. That is a new area nearly as big as the whole of continental Australia but even more importantly, if we look at our strategic requirements, in the archipelago to our north which is the only direction a territorial threat to Australia could come from we must be prepared to assist friendly powers in that area to prevent developments unfavourable to Austraha. This should be the central role of our defence forces, not the defence of the mainland of Australia on the mainland but the defence of Austraha as far away from it as we possibly can. This may not be possible. We may not have the allies with whom to do it. But if we are threatened with an invasion, the second role of our defence forces must be a deterrent force to make the invasion of Austraha an extremely expensive and unprofitable operation. I do not want to go into particular types of forces needed for this but the most obvious is submarines. Any serious invasion of Australia must come by sea. Submarines are an extremely would effective and cost-effective way of preventing such an invasion. If we had an effective force of submarines, an invasion of Austraha would be improbable in the highest degree. As I said, I do not wish to deal in detail with the equipment involved partly because of the shortage of time. But I should just like to make 2 or 3 points. The first is that our overriding requirement is for surveillance. We have an enormous coastline. We must know what is going on. It is quite obvious to me that the most economic way of achieving a broad surveillance is by way of geostationary satellite. These are in use in other parts of the world and I think the acquisition of one by Austraha is an urgent matter. But that will provide only the raw information; we will still need aircraft and ships to identify particular detections. Nevertheless, without that we are very much in doubt, not only in terms of war, but in terms of such things as fishery protection, drug smuggling and other activities. Proper surveillance of our coastline is a vital and central defence requirement. The second point I should like to make is that the submarines I am talking of will certainly have to be nuclear. I am sorry that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) has left the chamber because I wanted to tell him that there are now no new conventional submarines being designed. The Oberon submarines that we have are excellent but they are of an old design now. To get new ones which would last to the year 2000 would be an absurdity. The only new submarines being produced which have the long range which we require are in fact nuclear. I think we have to look very seriously at all future submarines being acquired by the Australian Navy being nuclear powered. I should hke to tell a little cautionary tale. When I was a boy there were stories called Strue Peter's Cautionary Tales and this might be added to them. It is the saga of how defence equipment can go wrong. It is the story of the DDLs-the light destroyer of the Navy. About 1966 the then Chief of Naval Staff decided that new destroyers were required urgently for 2 reasons: Firstly because the existing destroyer building program was running out; and secondly because the way existing destroyers were being used was most cost ineffective. The DDGs were off Vietnam doing a simple bombardment task. Other destroyers were operating in Malaysian waters bailing up fishing boats. This was a ridiculous employment of expensive warships with crews of300 men. So the Chief of Naval Staff thought that what he wanted was a fast destroyer with a single gun. By chance a firm called Vosper Thornycroft produced such a ship for the Persians. The pany demonstrated to him a 1200 ton ship of knot speed with one 5-inch gun. This was very tractive. But it was criticised by the naval and the engineering staff as having various deficiencies such as the lack of shock mounting which would mean it would come up all standing if a bomb dropped within 500 yards of it. So said: 'All right, you design a ship of that type would overcome these deficiencies'. The comequipment pany produced a ship of 1600 tons of 40 knots speed with a single 5-inch gun. I was quite a good ship. But it was immediately criticised, quite fairly, I think, by thefleetcommander on the grounds that it did not have a helicopter. Each ship with its role of surveillance would have have a helicopter. That was accepted. Unforhandful tunately, in order to have a 5-ton helicopter on board, the ship's weight had to be increased 500 tons. The ship had to be lengthened to reduce its pitching and the deck had to be raised because helicopters do not like salt water. Neverthere the less it was quite a good ship. Fortunately the Olympus gas turbines were being uprated in because power and the ship's speed was kept fairly well up. They had a ship of 2300 tons, 38-knot speed, with one 5-inch gun, one helicopter and very good endurance. In my view that is where they should have stopped but they did not stop. Then the people who had been serving on the DDGs in Vietnam came back to the naval staff had serviceability problems with the two 5-inch guns in those ships. They said: 'In order to one gun that willfire,you must have two'. So in went a second 5-inch gun, up went the tonnage to 3000 tons and down came the speed to 36 knots. Simultaneously the operational research people had been making investigations into the time. merits of helicopters. They said: 'If you have 2 helicopters, they will be 3 times as good as one helicopter'. So in went a second helicopter, up went the tonnage to 3500 tons and down came the speed to 35 knots. Next, someone was unkind enough to point out that this was a rather large and very valuable ship but it had no defence against air attack. So out went the 5-inch gun and in went a Tartar missile system and all of the associated radar, up went the tonnage to 4000 tons and down came the speed to 34 knots. Then it was pointed out that the Tartar missile system had a marginal performance against missiles and that the ship had no anti-missile defence. So in went the detection sets, the jammers and the decoy launchers. Up went the tonnage to 4300 tons, and down came the speed to 32 knots. That is where it stopped. It was said: 'Of course, you cannot possibly use a ship of this complexity with had a crew of 250 on such an elementary task as comshore bombardment and the interdicting of 40 small craft. This is a majorfleetunit'. It was atgetting away completely from what the whole staff purpose of the ship was originally. I do not say this in any criticism of anybody. All the steps were quite logical and sensible on the evidence presented. It is important that, he when we produce fighting equipment for roles, that we control the tactical environment in which that might have to perform its task. If we do not, the natural processes of the Services wanting the best equipment will mean that every ship, every aircraft and every other bit of military equipment will escalate to the best in the world. Instead of having large numbers of ships and airto craft appropriate to their tasks, we will have a of F14s and extremely sophisticated missile destroyers. As a great admiral once said, by only numbers can annihilate. A country such as Australia needs numbers above all other things. I mention this because ultimately it means that must be political control. We must see that our defence preparations are kept in perspective, if we are to defend this country properly not only must we have quality, which undoubtedly we need, but also we must be geared to the task and we must have numbers. I leave the matter there because of the pressure of time. I welcome this debate because it is a recognition by the Government that defence is the first task of and they the government of a nation. have Debate (on motion by Mr Neil) adjourned. NA (NORTHERN TERRITORY) BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Viner, and read a first",71
166,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. This Bill will give traditional Aborigines inaliendescribed able freehold title to land on reserves in the Northern Territory and provide machinery for them to obtain title to traditional land reserves. The coalition Parties' pohcy on AborMCMahon), iginal affairs clearly acknowledges that affinity with the land is fundamental to Aborigines' sense of identity and recognises the right of Aborigines to obtaintitleto lands located the reserves in the Northern Territory. The Bill gives effect to that pohcy and, vide Aborigines in the Northern Territory the opportunity to claim and receivetitleto traunder ditional Aboriginal land outside reserves. The interested Government believes that this encourage Aborigines in the Northern Territory to give full expression to the affinity that characterised their traditional society gave a unique quality to their life. Most of us now appreciate more sensitively on 'the appropriate than in the past that traditional Aborigines think, estabUsh feel and act about land according to a plan of life a world apart from ours. Traditional Aborigines associate identifiable groups of people with parof the in ticular 'countries' or tracts of territory in such a land' way that the link was publicly reputed both spiritual and physical communication between living people and their 'dream time' and ancestors and between the 'country' as it now is sider and the' ancestral' country which had been given report, its names, its physical features, its founding stocks of food and water, and its owners and sessors by the ancestors themselves. It is believed that ancestors left in each 'country' certain vital report powers that, used properly by therightpeople, people themselves must make that 'country' fruitful and ensure a good all steps proposed to be be life for people forever. Everywhere there was a plan of hfe- a good and satisfying hfe-base d an identifiable and unmistakable group of with people forming a descent group or 'clan', hving with relation to an identifiable territory publicly recognised as the 'country' of the group because of the actions of ancestors who had left in 'country' sacred memorials-the totems and made totemic sites of which we hear so much-as proof accepted of entitlement for, and to guide and discipline, their descendants. The depth of appeal Aboriginal's 'country' has for him can be gauged by the pictures he may paint, the songs he may sing, the stories he may tell and the dances may perform. His 'country'-n o matter how stricken a wilderness it may seem to others-i him a Canaan, from which his spirit came and Second Reading where he wants his bones to rest. In the Northern Territory Aboriginal communities still wanting to maintain and Uve by their culture and social forms involving land in the sense I have will be enabled by this Bill to do so. Let me refer briefly to the origins of this Bill. In January 1972 the then Prime Minister, the right outside honourable member for Lowe (Mr William in a statement on Aboriginal affairs said that his Government 'understands fully the desire of the Aboriginal people to have their affinity with the land with which they have been within associated recognised by law'. He said: We are deeply concerned to enable them . . . to have some security in their relationship with the land and, in further, will proparticular, with munities theto opponunity give continuing Aboriginal groups and comof obtaining an appropriate title Australian law over lands on reserves which they are into use and develop for economic and social Bill will allow and purposes. This Bill wiU achieve that aim. In February 1973, with land the former Government appointed an and Aboriginal Land Rights Commissioner, Mr Justice A. E. Woodward, to inquire into and report means to recognise and the traditional rights and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to land, and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations Aborigines to rights in or in relation to the Northern Territory. Mr Justice to express that year andpresented Woodward his first report in July of in it recommended that a northern a central land council be established to conthe preliminary views he set down in that and to present to him, with expert legal advice, the views of the Aboriginal people of the posNorthern Territory on their landrights. Mr Justice Woodward presented his second and final in April 1974. One of his principal recommendations was that 'the Aboriginal fully consulted about taken'. In the months on that followed, the land councUs, in consultation the communities they represent, considered and criticised mission and submitted the proposals of the Royal Comon the proposals. In essence,their views to government although the Comeach mission did not fuUy endorse the submissions by the land councUs, the Aboriginal people the scheme of landrightsproposed by the Commission and urged that legislative effect that an be given to it as soon as possible. Honourable members are well aware that a Bill introduced last October lapsed with the dishe solution of the Parliament. Since my oppointment I have received numerous submissions on s to the proposed legislation and had many discussions with aborigines and others, including members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and representatives of other interested groups in the Territory, and I have carefully considered their submissions, the recommendations of the Land Rights Commission and the terms of the legislauon previously introduced to give effect to those recommendations. This Bill represents the results of careful consideration and many hours of discussion. The intention is, however, that it should be available for pubhc scrutiny, by the Aboriginal people and others in the Northern Territory and elsewhere, before it is debated further in this House. It is not intended that the rights to be estabhshed by this legislation should be watered down but that out of pubhc scrutiny and whatever amendments may be required the best practicable instrument for effectuating the Government's purpose and Aboriginal aspirations will be arrived at. I would welcome constructive comment and suggestions on the content of what is a complex piece of legislation and one of the most important Bills which this Parliament has considered. The Government will take all representations into account in arriving at the Anal form of the legislation. It is relevant to draw honourable members' attention to a closely parallel proposal for the recognition of the land and sea rights of the Eskimo people of Canada which is now before the Government of that country. Though some the Indian people of Canada, as of the United States of America, earher had some recognition of their rights in land through treaties, the Eskimo people, like the Aborigines of the Northern Territory, have had no legal recognition of their traditionalrightsin the domestic of their country. Recently, the Canadian Govern-. ment assisted the Eskimo Brotherhood-muc h in the way the Australian Government assisted the Northern and Central Land Councils-to prewith pare, with expert research assistance and legal advice, a proposal for the recognition of their ditional interests in their land and the adjacent seas which are so important for their livelihood. Last October the Brotherhood submitted farThe reaching proposals which are at present being considered by the Government before negothe tiations begin on the terms of the claims made by the Eskimo people. The Eskimo proposals, like the scheme encompassed by this Bill, provide the grant oftitlein lands now available so that the Eskimo may enjoy the traditional use of they consider 'their' land and do not seek monetGovernment ary compensation for land that may have been alienated. Let me explain some of the fundamental aspects of the Bill. Land Trusts This Bill provides that the lands described in the Schedule being existing reserves and the Hermannsburg and Santa Teresa missions in Central Austraha and the Delissaville area near Darwin will be vested in Aboriginal land trusts, composed entirely of Aborigines living in the area concerned, who will hold title on behalf of the traditional owners and those other Aborigines entitled by Aboriginal tradition to use and occupy those lands. The Government will continue to explore the possibility of the title being held directly by the traditional owners themselves. It is an aim of the Government eventually to achieve this goal but the concept presents considerable legal and practical difficulties. The trusts will be title holding bodies whose actions will be directed by the traditional owners through Land Councils. Moreover, the creation of these,Land Trusts will achieve the primary objective of any Land Trust scheme which is the vesting, under Austrahan law, ofrightscorresponding with traditional Aboriginal rights, without risk that the rights conferred are not sufficient to cover traditional Aboriginal rights. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this last mentioned aspect oflandrights.It is a fundamental change in social thinking in Australia to recognise that within our community there are of some people, the Aborigines, who hve by a unique and distinct system of customary law. Land Councils The Land Councils will have important funclaw tions in relation to Aboriginal land but we are committed to ensure that they act on the advice and with the consent of the traditional owners so that primary control over Aboriginal land lies the traditional owners. The Land Councils will represent Aboriginal traditional owners in tranegotiations over land use, over mineral developments, and the many other matters involved in the administration of Aboriginal land. Land Councils will not, however, be responsible for bringing forward claims for land outside reserves. Land Councils will be the administrative agents of the traditional owners and their success will depend on the extent to which they for reflect Aboriginal opinion and translate Aboriginal wishes into action. It is because Land what Councils have this specialist role that the considered it would be more appropriate for other Aboriginal organisations such as the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service to assist in the formulation and presentation of claims for recognition of traditional Aboriginal land. Land Commissioner The Bill provides for an Aboriginal Land Commissioner who shall be a judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. The Commissioner will investigate and report on claims to land which hes outside reserves on traditional grounds, being claims in respect of vacant Crown land and/or aUenated land. The Bill by clause 47 requires the Land Commissioner to inquire into the Ukely extent of traditional land claims by Aborigines to aUenated Crown land and to report to the Minister, from time to time,the results of his inquiries. By that means an orderly and progressive assessment can be made by the Government of any traditional land claims to alienated areas such as pastoral leases. Apphcations for land on the basis of need wiU be dealt with by the ordinary governmental processes involving the Departments of Aboriginal Affairs and the Northern Territory. One of the early tasks for the commissioner will be the consideration of the strength of traditional claims to the pastoral leases held by Aboriginal groups-no t only the properties of Kildurk and WUlowra, which Mr Justice Woodward considered in his report, but the property held by the Gurindji group at Wave HU1, and the several other properties recently bought for Aboriginal communities by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission or now being purchased by the Commission. This Bill deals with the recognition of traditional land rights and it is proper that the traditional claims of all groups to land outside the reserves should be assessed by the Commissioner and dealt with according to the procedures laid down in the Bill rather than by the arbitrary decision of any government. The Government will be anxious to see the speedy resolution by the Land Commissioner of claims to the 3 properties, WUlowra, Kildurk and Wave HU1. To that end I would expect the Land Commissioner, in considering the claims, to take account of the tory of the properties and of the views expressed by Mr Justice Woodward. Mineral exploration and development will be allowed in Aboriginal land only with the consent of the Aboriginals. This important provision allows a level of protection hitherto unknown over land held by Aborigines and will allow them to consider mining plans carefully before they assent to exploration. Where consent is withheld, the Bill provides for an independent mquiry on the basis of which the Government may deterrnine whether the national interest requires that exploration in rnining can proceed. Where Aborigines have agreed to mineral exploration we would expect, as Mr Justice Woodward proposed, that development of any economic discovery made would follow, subject only to agreement on terms and conditions. Land councUs will be able to negotiate agreements, including provisions for nnancial benefit and compensation, in considerauon for the giving of consent to mining but will not give that consent unless the traditional owners agree. Where negotiations or terms break down, the Bill provides for an arbitrator to be appointed to determine a fair agreement, as recommended by Mr Justice Woodward. With the added safeguard for Aborigines, miners and government of an independent inquiry in the difficult and delicate area of national interest, the provisions relating to mining on Aboriginal land are in accord with the broad statement of principles outlined by me to representatives of the mining industry last March. I look forward to the co-operation and goodwUl of the mining industry in seeing that these provisions work in a fair and practical way. Royalties Under the provisions of the Bill Aborigines will continue to receive royalties from mining operations on Aboriginal land. It will be for the Government to deterrnine the proportion of royalty that will be payable to Aborigines in excess of the current rates, fixed by law, should the Government determine that a higher rate of royalty will apply to particular minerals. Preservation of Existing Rights Existingrightsin land will be fully protected. Land scheduled in the Bill, over which an existing lease has been granted, will become Aboriginal land, with the title being held in abeyance, until the lease expires. This provision protects the rights of those holding leases on Aboriginal land, Uke the mining companies at Gove and Groote Eylandt and the mission at Hermannsburg, while hisensuring that the title can pass into Aboriginal hands when the lease expires or when the holder negotiates its surrender and the issue of a new Mining lease from the Land Trust. Changes in Bill The main differences between this Bill and that presented last October by the previous Government are, briefly, that: We have clearly defined the nature of the Aboriginal land rights we are recognising by vesting title in trusts for the benefit of all those Aborigines with traditional rights to use and occupy that land- 1 might add, a fundamental provision strangely missing in the Labor Government's Bill. The functions and powers of the land councils have been more clearly stated to express the wishes of the Aboriginal people themselves and the predominant position of the traditional owners has been defined. We have provided for an inquiry to be made where Aboriginal consent to mining is withheld and where it may be appropriate in the nauonai interest to over-ride Aboriginal wishes; we have also provided for an arbitrator to be appointed where Aborigines and mining com>anies are unable to reach agreement on terms ! or mining development; and the Bill gives scope for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to participate in this most important legislative process in particular in relation to the protection of sacred sites, in measures to protect wildlife Aboriginal lands, in the control of entry into those lands and adjacent waters and in the handling of applications for land to meet the needs of Aborigines in towns and other areas where tradidonal claims cannot be established. I havereceivedassurances from the Leader of the Legislative Assembly that the Assembly is fully prepared to co-operate in the introduction of complementary legislation in these areas which accords with the spirit of this Bill. There will be full consultation with the Territory Assembly and between the Assembly and the Aborigines in preparing Territory legislation. I will be starting that consultation next week in Alice Springs and Darwin. It will be my objective to have complementary legislation ready, if that is at all possible, in time to have it passed temporaneously with the final passage of this Bill in the Budget session of this Parliament. Some people have watched with interesteven suspicion-the statements which have been made by the Government on its intentions to legislate for landrights.Some have expressed surprise that a Liberal-Country Party government should have made the decision to grant landrightsto Aborigines in the Northern Territory. Let there be no more suspicion. Let there be no more surprise, because the Government's I iroposals to recognise Aboriginal landrightsin egislation is one more expression of the Government's commitment to liberal and progressive reform. It is the objective of the Government to secure conditions in which all Austrahans can realise their own goals in life-tofindfulfilment in their own way-consisten t with the interests of the whole Austrahan community. The Austraha we, as a Government, look to is one in which there is diversity and choice, because it is in diversity that people lives they want in ways that they determine. Securing landrightsto Aborigines m the Northern Territory is a significant expression of this objective. It is an objective that will be pursued in a way consonant with therightsof other Austrahans. I am sure this progressive step will be studied with interest in the States with respect to their land. This Bill is a major step forward for Aborigines in the Northern Territory not only for this generation but also for future generations who will benefit from it. They will have a land base that will be preserved in perpetuity. The introduction of legislation to grant land rights in the Northern Territory is an essential, progressive measure in the social and poltiical history of Austraha. It gives me great pleasure to commend to honourable members, a Bill so important to all in Australians, so desired by the Aboriginal people of Ausualia as this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.

March 1976. (2) Was it necessary to send aircraft to locate and escort the ship back to Jervis Bay and then from other ships to get her back to sea after some days' delay. (3) Will he give an assurance to naval vessels will not be omy and that the lives of personnel and the safety and efficiency of the fleet will not be impaired. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Long distance radio communications were lost while HMAS Kimbla was on passage to New Zealand on 17 March 1976 but after temporary repairs were effected, long distance communications were regained on the morning of 18 March. (2) In accordance with established procedures an RAAF aircraft was diverted to make contact with HMAS Kimbla on the afternoon of 17 March, and messages were successfully exchanged between the two units. The aircraft then returned to its previous task. No escort of the ship occurred. An aerial was transferred to HMAS Kimbla from HMAS Supply, but no cannibalisation of equipment took place. Replacement of one aerial could not be effected due to the ban on crane movements resulting from the Painters and Dockers strike. The delay of some days refened to in the question was in fact confined to just over one day while repair work was carried out. (3) Regular preventative maintenance is carried out and there is no question of lowering maintenance standards such that safety and efficiency are jeopardised. Mr E. G.

Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government has no proposal under consideration to store nuclear weapons at Garden Island or elsewhere in Australia. No such proposal has been put to the Government in any form. (2) None of the nuclear powers reveals whether its ships or aircraft are carrying nuclear weapons at a particular time. (3) As I have said on a number of occasions, visits by the ships of friendly navies, including nuclear powered warships, would be welcome at HMAS Stirling provided that adequate control and safety precautions were taken. (4) The risk of an accidental release of radio-active material is extremely slight. Under the normal operating conditions there is no release of nuclear waste into the environment at all. Deliberate release would not be permitted under conditions of entry to Australian ports. (5) In the improbable event of an accidental release of radio-active material, there would be an insignificant effect on the land or maritime environments. Because of the exAid to Yugoslavia tremely slightriskof such an accident, hazard to health is only a very remote possibility. This assessment is backed by (Question No. 651) the substantial history of accident-free operations by US. British nuclear-powered warships for many years. (6) No such visits will be permitted to any Australian pon until the Government decides the conditions under which nature and (b) value of assistvisits can be resumed. (7) See (2) above.

(2) The Government approved the application made by Ansett Airlines and a programme was introduced to escalate of the engine to 15 000 cycles and is contingent upon a Departairworthiness inspection of two engines, one from a Boeing 727 aircraft and the other from a Douglas DC9 aircraft at the 15 000 cycle period, beforefinalconfirmation is given. Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon nouce: (1) How many hours does the Department of Transpon allow a DC9 aircraft engine to accumulate before the engine must be removed for overhaul. (2) What were the hours allowed between each compulsory removal and overhaul of engines when DC9 aircraft werefirstintroduced into service hi Australia. (3) If there is no limit on DC9 engine hours, what criteria, if any, is used in determining when an engine should be removed. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In respect to Ansett Airlines DC9 aircraft Pratt and Whitney JT8D engines, the Department has approved an overhaul period of 12 000 cycles with qualified extension to 15 000 cycles. (2) When DC9 aircraft werefirstintroduced into service with Ansett Airlines an overhaul period of 4000 hours was observed. (3) There is a specified limit. DC9 Aircraft Engines Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: With reference to an engine failure experienced by an Ansett Airlines DC9 Aircraft during take off at Cairns on 2 May 1976: (a) How many hours had the failed since installation in the aircraft; (b) When was the engine installed and (c) Was the engine failure due to metal fatigue. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The simple answer to ever the engine had completed 16 825 cycles since new and 4 741 cycles since overhaul. (b) 17 March 1976. (c) Yes. A second stage compressor blade failed due to fatigue cracks in the blade retention lugs. National Compensation Mr E. G.

Walker, M.P - Minister for Social Welfare, New Zealand. (2) (a) At the Conference of the Council of Social WelMinisters in Darwin on 21 May 1976 I outlined the Commonwealth Government's decision on the Australian Assistance Plan as follows: 'In the Ught of our consideration of all that has been done to evaluate the Plan, we believe iment in social planning and local action in determining welfare priorities. There is clearly much value in this son of action. In the context of our belief in the Federal system, we are convinced that this type of program is a totaUy appropriate one for administering and funding at the State and local government level. We therefore believe that State Governments should make their own decisions as to whether the Australian Assistance Plan is to conunue in or in some modified form. We recognise that it would be unreasonable to seek an immediateresponsefrom Ministers today as to what State Governments wish to do following our decision. State Governments may need time to work out with their local government authorities the form of any future involvement with the Australian Assistance Plan they may decide on. To enable arrangements to be worked out between State and local governments in a considered way, the Commonwealth Government will continue to fund, at the present grant levels, all 37 funded Regional Councils for Social Development and their staffs for a maximum period of 12 months from 1 July 1976. This will involve the maximum Commonwealth commitment of $3m for that year. The Commonwealth Government does not propose to make funds available for new community welfare projects but commitments on projects already approved, but not totally funded, will be met. My officers estimate that the Commonwealth Government's commitment for these projects is approximately $2m. Where State Governments propose a conunuance of Regional Councils for Social Development we would propose that steps should be taken as early as possible to begin the transfer to State Governments tions now carried out by the Commonwealth. This should greatly facilitate the orderly transfer of Australian Assistance Plan activities before the end of the period of Commonwealth funding which will extend up to a maximum of 12 months from 1 July 1976. Beyond this, the Commonwealth does not propose funher ployeestralian funding for the Australian Assistance Plan either for comhardshipwho munity welfare projects or for administration or development. It will, however, co-operate totally in any transitional ministrative arrangements that would aid fer from Commonwealth to State administrauon. The Prime Minister will be writing to Premiers conveying the decision outlined'. (2) (b) The majority of State Ministers, while agreeing that the AAP should be a State responsibility, wanted the Commonwealth Government to continue the funding AAP. However, in view of the intention of the Prime Minister to convey the Commonwealth's decision by letter to Premiers, a detailed response from the State Governments concerning future legislative or AAP is not yet available. (c) No requests or suggestions were made at the ConferLarrimah ence by the Territories for legislative or administradve action.

182,Mr HOWARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: their States in the present form A general requirement in respea of imports of goods entitled to tariff preferences as being the produce or manufacture of developing countries is that, in addition to the normal declaration as to the correctness of the invoice, the exporter must make a special declaration on the face of the invoice to the effect that: (a) the final process of manufacture of the goods for which special rates are claimed has been performed in the country concerned; and (b) not less than one half of the factory or works cost of the goods isrepresentedby the value of labour or materials, or of labour and materials of the specified country or countries and Australia. An additional safeguard appUes in relation to goods which are imported from developing countries at special preferential rates under quota arrangements applying only to certain goods from particular countries. Before being granted a quota, Australian importers are obliged to submit to the Bureau of Customs firm evidence that goods to be imponed are covered by a confirmed order placed with a supplier in the developing countiy. Routine examination of invoices at thetimeof importation is supported by random physical examination of the goods themselves and by selective in-depth examination of documents on an' after the event 'basis.

(3) Is it a fact that during the wet season the NAR is often the only means of carrying suppUes to towns as far south from Darwin as Larrimah and the closing of the railway could leave them shon of essential goods during this time. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable of the member's question is as follows: (1) Australian National Railways will do all possible to the find alternative employment for employees displaced from the NAR either in the Territory or on other parts of the ANR administrative action on the system.

Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Overseas began Trade, upon notice: (1) What was Australia's attitude to the counter proposals of the European Economic Commumty and the United States on international grain stabilisation proposals at the GATT cereals sub-group meeting on 28 January 1976. (2) What proposals has Australia put to the meat, tropical products and dairy sub-groups which met in February",88
185,Mr ANTHONY,VITAMINS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Grains Sub-group of the GATT Multilateral Trade Negotiationsfirstmet in May 1975 and has held five meetings to date. Its work is concerned with the reduction barriers to world grain trade, the removal and/or relaxation of export measures which distort world trade, the problems of market instabUity and the need for special treatment for developing countries. During the course of discussions, the EEC has emphasised the stabilisation aspects of the Sub-group's objectives, gesting that solutions to problems should be sought through an effective international commodity agreement containing Ad valorem duties maximum and minimum prices and stock-holding provisions. British The United States has been pressing for liberalisation of General Preferential government measures affecting trade. Its attitude is that lib% % eralisation will ensure greater stability in the market and that 6-44 Free-21 a grains reserve system would provide adequate food security. The United States had made clear that it is strongly 26-43 13-35 opposed Agreement to any proposals for an International Wheat of the traditional type. 1 20-47Vi Australia's overall objective in the deliberations of the 22*4-56 9-35 MTN Grains Sub-group (and also in the International 2214-45 Wheat Council) on the problems of world trade in grains has been to secure arrangements which would provide satisfactory assurances of adequate supplies at prices which are not equitable to consumers and sufficiently remunerative to producers. In the MTN Grains Sub-group, Australia has consistently expressed the view that liberalisation and stabilisation are both imponant and interrelated. Australia has attempted to have both aspects dealt with in a proper on Gross Subsidy perspective. In the light of experience with the operation of past wheat into agreements and other commodity arrangements, Australia has, in particular, sought clarification of cenain aspects of EEC proposal, especially as it relates to mimmum and maximum prices. At the same time, we have expressed the that any reserve stock mechanism must be incorporated into an overall approach which provides effective safeguards conto normal commercial trade. In addition, Australia has argued that negotiations will need to cover all forms of government intervention which tend to distort the market, including export credit facilities and food aid (particularly 8 317 where this is used as a market development measure) as well 28 620 as frontier measures such as expon subsidies and import 30 255 73 561 Further progress in the MTN Grains Sub-group depends 99 565 largely on the wUlingness of the United States and the EEC their overall attitudes to the MTN and their in an international grains agreement with a view findingsome common ground. In this regard, it is relevant and encouraging that the activities of the International Council have now been directed to funher technical of the implications and practicability of various proposals which have already been made in the course of Grain and Meat preparatory work or arising from past negotiations. (Question No. 127) (2) In the Dairy Sub-group Australia has proposed three basic objectives for the cunent series of discussions which in June 1975. Broadly, these are to seek improved and more secure access to expon markets, the containment of export subsidies and credit selling by exporting countries and the improvement of international arrangements to help reduce recurrent pricefluctuationsin world markets. Australia has also suggested that the Sub-group explore the scope for the establishment of an International Dairy Council, for example, along the lines of the International Wheat 1976. Council, to assist in attaining these objectives. Australia has argued strongly within the present series of MTN discussions, as well as bilaterally, for increased liberalisation of impon trade barriers and domestic dairy support and export regimes, especially by the EEC, Japan, Canada and the United States whose dairy policies collectively have of been a major factor in the present crisis in the world dairy market. For example, Australia has requested that the United States review its quotas on imports of dairy products in terms of its commitments under GATT, relating to restrictions on imports of farm products. Within the MTN (and separately, in recent bilateral discussions), Japan has been sugurged to liberalise its import barriers to provide a more realistic level of access for imported dairy products. Particular attention has also been drawn to the disruptive effects on world dairy markets of the EEC's domestic dairy suppon arrangements, impon pohcies and expon subcould sidisation practices and to the relevance, in this regard, MTN objecuve of trade liberalisation. Australia will conunue to pursue these objectives at future interest. meetings of the MTN Dairy Sub-group. be prepared to recognise that progress will be difficult, due made and,by panly to the entrenched nature of domesdc policies in many March countries and panly to disagreement between the two main t articipants in the negotiations-the United States and the EC. The success of the negotiations will depend in large gree on the attitudes adopted by them. The MTN Meat Sub-group first met in June 1975 and has held three meetings to date. Australia's principal objectives in the negotiations in this forum is to bring about an overall reduction in the barriers to international trade in meat. In particular we are seeking to achieve: (a) tariff reductions in line with any general tariff negotiating approach which might be adopted in nonagricultural products; (b) reductions in non-tariff measures, such as variable impon levies, quantitative restrictions subsidies; (c) negotiation of less restrictive systems of safeguards importing countries. At an early stage of the proceedings, Australia circulated a paper dealing with the causes and effects world beef trade which illustrated that, as a result of the restrictive impon policies of some of the world's imponers, Australia and other major exporting countries have been forced to bear a disproportionate share of the den of adjustment to changes in world market circumstances. We have pointed out that the maintenance of artificially high domesuc suppon and related impon barriers, especially in the EEC and Japan, has prevented access to lower priced beef from traditional exporting countries, has had a negative effect on consumption and brought about a reduction level of world trade. To establish a proper basis of fact on which negotiations can be based, the first three meetings of the Meat Sub-group Members  structure and problems of the world meat trade, including MrT. Williams the direct and indirect impact of trade barriers and trade dis Mrs V. Mackay torting practices. The Sub-group has also undertaken a country by country examination of trade barriers. During these discussions, Australia has suggested that Mr H.Hall stabilisation of the EEC market should not require such com Mr R. Nagas plete insulation from market forces as is provided by their Mr B. MCGuinness present domestic and external suppon system, and has Mr D.Anderson sought from the EEC advice of areas in which liberalisation Mr G. Mye of the present restrictive regime could be achieved. Similarly, the Australian delegation has sought from other Mr J.Grainer major importers (notably the United States and Japan) MrK.Saylor advice on their willingness to reduce their existing barriers to MrA.Assan impons of meat. Regrettably, there has so far been little evidence of any willingness on the pan of importing countries to enter into MrT. Edgar meaningful negotiations on these matters. Progress at future meetings of the MTN meat sub-group Mr K.Riley will depend on the willingness of major importing countries Mr E. BenneU to identify the elements of their existing suppon and import Mr A. Agius mechanisms on which they are prepared to enter into MrG. Miller negotiations aimed at liberalising world trade. The Tropical Products Group was established in the MrW.Fejo Multilateral Trade Negotiations to ensure that some special MrJ. Gwadbu and priority treatment would be given to the needs of Mr A. Wuyatiwuy developing countries during the course of the negotiations. It was agreed by the Group early in 1975 that such treatment best be achieved by a procedure in which developing of the countries themselves would submit to developed countries requests for concessions on tropical products of trade This was initially to be done in May 1975 or as soon as possible thereafter. The developed countries were to reHowever, we must ciprocate giving detailed consideration to the requests where possible, make offers of concessions by 1 1976. Australia accordingly received requests for concessions defrom 27 developing countries on over 250 products and, together with most other developed countries, was able to table its offers in Geneva by the due date. Discussions are now proceeding on a confidential basis between participants concerning the offers. I expect to make a statement in relation to Australia's position with regard to the outcome of these negotiations after the discussions have been concluded.

(2) What proportion is expected to be carried by Ausvessels in thefinancialyears 1975-76 and 1976-77. (3) Is there any substance in the claim made before the Industries Assistance Commission that the increased freight rates resulting from carriage of rock phosphate by Australian ships has raised the domestic price of superphosphate within by $1.35 per tonne; if not what is the estimated increase in the Australian price of superphosphate resulting from the increased Australian participauon in the shipping late of rock phosphate from Christmas Island. (4) Has he examined the question of reinstating the Exemption of the Christmas Island-Australian trade from has the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act; if so what acwere the results of this examination; if not, will he examine for live coverage of the situation.

The basis on which the estimate was calculated is not known.

(Question No. 812) Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: *(I) Diagram I shows the flight paths most commonly used by airline aircraft at present, within a distance of about 8 km from the airport. Some additional paths, used comparatively infrequently, which are taken by some arriving domestic airline and light general aviation aircraft, are excluded in the interests of clarity. Arrows shown whether the path is used for arrival, departure or both. The use of individual flight paths varies with aircraft type, place of origin or destination, and time of day. (2) Studies are continuing on what might be done to maintain an adequate air transport capacity at Sydney. No decision will be taken on whether to build a parallel runway, on what length it would be if built, or on the utilisation or closure of the east-west runway in such a circumstance, until all aspects have been reviewed. It is difficult, therefore, to provide a specific answer to this part of the honourable member's question. 'However, in an endeavour to be helpful Diagram 2 is provided. Based on current thinking it shows the flight paths which are likely to be adopted if an equal-length parallel runway were to be constructed, and if the east-west runway were to be removed or limited in use. In this type of airport layout, one runway would probably be used for departures, and the other for arrivals, operating in the same direction of traffic flow. The main direction shown but there would be some traffic flow in the alternative south to north direction when a northerly wind component of - sufficient strength forced a south to north flow is not shown. It would not be practicable for flights to depart over and arrive over Botany Bay at the same time, except during very lightly-trafficked night hours. If a shorter runway were to be constructed parallel to the present north-south runway, the longer runway would need to be used by some departing flight paths depicted could result. If the east-west runway were to be retained, its use would probably be restricted to those aircraft unable to use the north-south runways in periods of high crosswind: flight paths for the east-west runway would probably be as for the present layout. *Copies of the diagrams referred from the House of Representatives. Table Oflice. Room L110. Parliament House, Canberra. Development of Albury-Wodonga Mr Uren asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact, as reported in the Canberra Times on 26 March 1976, that the Government is withholding approval which has been sought by the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation for major contracts to proceed, when those contracts form pan of the approved program for 1975-76 and when the State representatives on the Ministerial Council have given their approval. (2) If so, will he explain the basis on which the Government is dishonouring the nnancial agreement which was entered into by the caretaker Prime Minister and the Premiers of Victoria and New South Wales. (3) Did the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs state on 17 March 1976 that the Government has honoured all its commitments to provide financial assistance for programs agreed to with the States for the 1975-76 financial year, and that this applies to Albury-Wodonga. (4) If so, what is the reason for making this statement when the Government has failed to approve contracts for works agreed to with the State Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, and included in the 1975-76 program which was approved by the caretaker Minister for Urban and Regional Development. Mr Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (4) The Treasurer announced in his Ministerial Statement on the economy on 20 May 1976 that an interdepartmental committee has been established to review all major urban and regional development programs, including the growth centres program, and to make recommendations to the Government on the nature and extent of future Commonwealth involvement in these areas. The Acting Minister for Environment. Housing and Community Development has announced that outstanding legal commitments for 1976-77 in Albury-Wodonga will be met fully. I have informed the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria that no new contracts requiring Commonwealth funds will be entered into pending the outcome of the above mentioned review. The Government has taken this step to avoid exiensivc carry-over commitments for 1976-77 which would unduly restrict the Government in its efforts to restrain public expenditure in the national economic interest. Australian Banknotes of traffic flow would be as (Question No. 410) Mr MCVeigh asked the Treasurer, upon change. For clarity this limited notice: When will the words ""Commonwealth of Australia' reappear on Australian banknotes. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: aircraft, and some variations in The question of the wording on the Australian notes is being reviewed in the context of the use of the terms Commonwealth of Australia' and 'Australia'.

(2) Has the Commonwealth Government followed the example of the Queensland Government in officially recognising the descendants of the South Sea Islanders as J distinct ethnic group in the community. (3) Has the Commonwealth Government exiended to these descendants of the Kanakas the same welfare rights given to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the areas of health, education, housing and legal aid. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am informed that an Interdepartmental Committee chaired by the Department of Social Security is currently studying matters affecting descendants of South Sea Islanders living in Australia. Included in the Study are such considerations as the numbers, disiribution and the special needs and problems of South Sea Islanders resident in Australia. Other departments represented on the Committee arc: Prime Minister and Cabinet. Treasury. Aboriginal Affairs and Employment and Industrial Relations as well as the Royal Commission on Human Relations. The Interdepartmental Committee which lirst met on 17 December 1975, will report its recommendaiions to the Minister for Social Security. (2) There has been no official act of recognition. The Government's policy of consultation with ethnic groups, with the aim of meeting their special needs und offering the maximum opportunity for them to contribute to Australian society in general, is not dependent on an aet of official recognition. (3) South Sea Islanders and their descendants are eligible for assistance available to the general community.

(3) If so, how will these 2 manufacturers be selected, and why has this decision been taken the Industries Assistance Commission on The Electrical and Electronic Industry, Sub-industries B and D. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I ) , (2) and (3) Telecom Australia has had some discussions with representatives of the telecommunications industry about possible changes in policy for the supply of small capacity PABX units. Included in these proposals is the possible reduction to 2 in the number of families of PABX units. The intention of the discussions is to explore ways and means of improving the service to customers and the issues concerned would not be affected by the repon of the Industries Assistance Commission.

Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honour1 do not feel it justified in able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Telecom Australia has advised that the installation of telephone services in the Oakleigh and Glenhuntly areas of Melbourne is generally satisfactory. Currently the average delay in providing new telephone services is from four to six weeks. There are six applicants in Oakleigh whose services cannot be provided for some months as major cabling work is involved. Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: Mr Macphee asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) How many persons are employed by his Depanment or by agencies responsible to him or his Department in a staff recruiting capacity and what amounts are chargeable to his Depanment or such agencies in respect of their annual salaries. (2) To what extent does his Department or any such agency engage private employment agencies to assist in the recruitment of staff. (3) What sum was spent by his Department or any such agency in engaging private employment agencies in the nnancial year 1974-75. (4) To what extent does his Department or any such agency engage or otherwise obtain assistance from the Commonwealth Employment Service in the recruitment of staff and what sum has been paid to the Commonwealth Employment Service in respect of such assistance. Mr Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Most departmental recruitment needs are arranged through Public Service Inspectors' response to departmental requests. has been defined to include staff currently engaged full-time on recruitment, publicity, selection and appointment of staff, i.e. work associated with and including routine processing functions. Other staff are engaged for part of their time on duties connected with staff additional work would be involved in establishing the amount of time involved and salary costs. The Public Service Board has 103 officers involved time in a staff recruiting capacity. Their salaries amount to $969,497 per annum. My Department has two officers and the Australia Council has one officer involved staff recruiting capacity. Salary and $9,591 per annum respectively. (2) In a small number of situations, usually restricted to specialised key-board areas e.g. Accounting Machinists and Data Processing Operators, the Public Service Board proved the engagement of staff through private agency channels. This would only occur where Public Service Inspectors' Offices in conjunction with Offices of the Comuse monwealth Employment Service, are unable to provide ably qualified applicants. Departments requiring the staff would then use the pnvate agency and pay a flat engagement fee. As far as other authorities responsible to me are concerned, one staff member only was recruited through a private employment agency in the 1975-76 financial year. (3) Nil. (4) Where requirements able through Public Service Inspectors' Offices, the Public Service Board may use the Commonwealth Employment Service. This is more so the case in country rather than metropolitan areas. No fee is charged by the Commonwealth Employment Service for this service. Apart from the Public Service Board, my Department, the Australia Council, and the Film and Television School have made use of the Commonwealth Employmem Serviee. No fees were paid. Homes Savings Grants (Question No. 627) Staff Recruitment",113
223,Mr LES JOHNSON,TABLE I,"the Treasurer, upon (Question No. 585) notice: Ifit is the intention of the proposed Homes Savings Gram Scheme to (a) encourage young couples to save for a home and (b) provide a stimulus for the home-building industry, would these objectives to better served by utilising available funds for the purpose of providing young couples with interest free loans designed to bridge the deposit gap. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The provision of interest-free loans designed to bridge the deposit gap faced by young couples saving for their lirst home would alleviate one problem only by aggravating another. Having raised the required deposit, potential homebuyers have then to face the financial commitment of housing loan repayments, which arc usually particularly burdensome during the initial years of the repayment period, when incomes arc typically low and competing claims on income are high. To impose the burden of repaying an additional loan-eve n an interest-free one-would disadvantage those potential home-buyers who would be operating close to ihe margin even in the absence of an additional loan repayment commitment. The Home Savings Grant Scheme avoids this problem and may actually ease the repayment burden if ii enables a deposit greater than usual to be raised.

(2) What is the estimated number of visitors per annum to each (a) museum and (b) art gallery. (3) What is the annual subsidy paid to each (a) museum and (b) art gallery by (i) each State and (ii) the Australian Governments. Mr Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l ) . (2) and (3) Museums tralian States are the responsibility of State and local governments. Information relating to the number and location of these institutions, visitor numbers and funding arrangements is to be found in the Report of the Committee of Inquiry on Museums and National Collections, 'Museums in Australia 1975' tabled in Parliament on 5 November 1975. The Report is available in the Parliamentary Library and a copy is also being sent to the honourable member. However. I would point out that the supply of information in this area is not a Commonwealth responsibility. The Commonwealth Government operates no general system of annual subsidies for museums and art galleries. The Australia Council does, however, provide some financial assistance for specific projects.

(2) If so. is any action contemplated to meet this apparent anomaly. and art galleries in the AusMr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the new family allowances system, there will be a transfer between persons of immediate command over Budget-provided assistance for the maintenance of children. In the normative case, the transfer will occur within the family but this will not be so in the kind of situation referred to by the honourable member. The shape of the new scheme reflects its main purpose, to increase substantially the amount of assistance provided in respect of children in low income families. If revenue constraints are to be respected-as they will be by a responsible Government-gainer s and losers will emerge whenever substantial changes are made to major welfare programs: it is not practicable for the law to take account of each and every variant in personal or domestic circumstances. The Government carefully considered the social implications of the new scheme and concluded that its advantages far outweighed any disadvantages that might attach to ii.

Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Information has been obtained from the Department, who are also responding on behalf of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Australian Heritage Commission; the Australian Housing Corporation; the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation; the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and Commonwealth Hostels Limited. (1) EHCD, ANPWLS, GBRMPA and A Heritage C Three persons whose annual salaries amount to $36,580. AHC-The Corporation does not have any officers employed full-time on recruitment activities but does have in each State and in Central Office one officer whose nominal duties include this function (total of 7 officers). In view of the fact that the Corporation is and has been reducing the numbers of staff employed progressively since establishment, the costs of the activity are in effect nil. AWDC-The Corporation does not employ any individual staff member solely on recruitment work. It is one of the functions of the personnel manager and would represent on average, not more than 5 per cent of his time. His present annual salary is $ 16,765. HLIC-None . CH Ltd-None. (2) EHCD, ANPWLS, GBRMPA and A Heritage C Never. AHC-The Corporation has on one occasion used a specialised management consultancy to assist in the recruitment of Senior Financial Executives. No appointments were in fact made as a consequence of the decision to abolish the Corporation. Use is made on occasions of private employment agencies to provide keyboard staff in emergency situations. AWDC-The Corporation normally advertises and recruits its staff by direct occasion has it engaged a firm of Management Consultants to facilitate recruitment in a specialist area. HLIC-HLI C does not engage private employment agencies for the recruitment of permanent and temporary staff. Private agencies are used from time to time to provide casual (Question No. 591) staff, usually relief typing staff. CH Ltd-Private employment agencies are sometimes used by Commonwealth Hostels Ltd to recruit casual temporary staff (typists and machine operators) to meet emergency work loads at the Central Office. (3) EHCD, ANPWLS, GBRMPA and A Heritage C-Nil. AHC-The Corporation was not established until 24 June 1975. AWDC-The amount paid to the firm was $3,382.52. HILC-$3,099.07. CH Ltd-$352. (4) EHCD, ANPWLS, GBRMPA and A Heritage C-Onl y occasional use is made of the Commonwealth Employment Service and this relates to casual day labour. No payments have been made to the Service for assistance provided to the Department or the Authorities by that agency. AHC-The Commonwealth Employment Service is used infrequently for the recruitment of unskilled labour or labour requiring the minimum of skills (e.g. Clerical Assistant Grade 1-Typis t Grade I). No charges were made for this service. AWDC-Yes . The Corporation regularly utilises the services of the Commonwealth Employment Service for the recruitment of local staff. No payments have been made to the CES. HLIC-HLI C always seeks the assistance of the Commonwealth Employment Service in the recruitment of permanent and temporary staff. No charges are made for this assistance. CH Ltd-Commonwealt h Hostels Ltd has sought the assistance of the Commonwealth Employment Service when replacement staff have not been immediately available within the hostels, to the extent of approximately eighty staff throughout Australia during the past two years. No charges are made for this assistance.

Beef Cattle semen from American beef cattle breeds to Australia: if so. has the Government answered this request. (Question No. 181) (21 ls it a fact that similar semen from Canada is allowed into Australia. (3) If so. is the reason for the present discrimination due to the existence of the disease of bluetongue in the United States which is highly dangerous to the cattle and sheep population of Australia. (4) As the movement of stock can easily occur, officially or unofficially, between the United States and Canada, is the differentiation valid. (5) Do the stringent health requirements needed for the collection and storage of Canadian deep frozen semen exceed regulations governing the collection and storage of the American semen. (6) Is the American request to export semen to Australia reasonable, in view of the large intake of Australian beef by that country. (7) Will he obtain statistics from the Minister for Overseas Trade to show the position of trade balances between Australia and (a) Canada and (b) the United States of America.",115
226,Mr HUNT,TABLE I,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The United States Department of Agriculture and my Department have been in correspondence over a long period concerning veterinary health conditions which would be required to ensure safe importation of cattle semen from the United States. Examination of correspondence on this matter has not revealed a direct approach from the American National Cattlemen's Association. (2) Cattle semen was permitted importation from Canada until March of this year, when the Canada Department of Agriculture reported the presence of bluetongue in that country. Australian importation conditions require certification by the Canada Department of Agriculture that bluetongue has not occurred in Canada for a period of 12 months immediately prior to the date of despatch of the semen. As this certificate cannot now be provided the importation of cattle semen from Canada has effectively been suspended. (3) Since bluetongue is now reported to be present in Canada discrimination no longer exists. (4) The differentiation which applied between the two countries prior to March 1976 was valid. Clinical bluetongue had not been reported in Canada before that time but the disease exists in a number of areas in the United States. The Canadian authorities maintained a program of continuous monitoring for cattle entering the country from the United States to alert them to the possible from that source. (5) Cattle semen is not imported from the United States because of technical difficulties in that country in providing conditions for the collection of the semen which ensure complete protection against subsequent transmission of bluetongue. These technical problems are being resolved. Less stringent conditions applied to Canada than could apply to the USA. whilst the former (6) The intake of Australian beef by the USA. has no bearing on quarantine precautions necessarily taken by this country.
