3,Mr GOODLUCK,NEW SOUTH WALES OIL INDUSTRY,"I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: That this House deeply regrets the great inconvenience and hardship caused to the people of New South Wales as a result of the recent N.S.W. oil industry dispute and resultant bans which have denied the people of that State a vital commodity namely, petrol, and further, the immense public anxiety people have been subjected to, having to line up in queues for petrol, as well as the hospitals and other essential services and the significant loss of revenue suffered by petrol station proprietors and others employed within the industry together with the overall dampening effect on the economy and morale of the nation, and therefore this House, without desiring to recriminate or to aUot blame to any individuals or organisations, considers that the time has now arrived for an urgent and rational restructuring of the Australian oil industry in the interest of the consumers, oil companies, service station proprietors, those employed within the industry and, indeed, in the interests of the total Australian community. Uranium NA citizens of Australia respectfully NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Minister for as it presents problems including environDefence a question.

May I take the honourable gendeman's questions seriatim? The first question relates to replacement of the airDISPUTE craft. The honourable gentleman will be aware Notice of Motion of the fact that the White Paper discloses that 6 Tracker aircraft-that is 6 aircraft in addition to those which we had-were to be delivered in June or July of this year. I am under heavy obligation to His Excellency the United States Ambassador who rang this morning to say that the United States Administration would do whatever it could with all possible haste to replace the expresses its concern at aircraft. I observe in passing that the aircraft is a effects on type of aircraft which is now being phased out by the United States authorities.

I asked the simple question and I got the simple reply, $73,000fora second hand aircraft-on e that had been used. Nevertheless, to put my honourable friend's mind at rest I will make a further inquiry. I accepted, the information on the basis on which it was given to me. I assure the House that surveillance of Australian waters will continue. Regrettably, long range maritime patrol aircraft, the P3C Orion, will have to be used as well as the Neptune aircraft. This is not a role for which either aircraft is peculiarly designed. They are anti-submarine aircraft and not surveillance aircraft simplicita. It may be appropriate if I were to take leave of the House for a moment to announce that a Board of Inquiry has been convened. Its president will be Commodore Rourke, the General Manager of the Garden Island Dockyard. Its members will be Captain Wickett, Commander Callins and Lieutenant-Commander Horne. The Board will be assisted by a Royal Australian Air Force officer, Wing Commander Brazier, who has special experience in this field.

8,Mr DOBIE,FLEET AIR ARM FIRE,"I refer the Minister for Health to reports that at least 30 people were admitted to a major hospital in Sydney over the weekend suffering from severe gastro-enteritis after travelling on British Airways Flight BA888 from Hong Kong. As this follows the outbreak of typhoid fever among travellers on another flight by this airline into Australia earlier in the same week, I ask the Minister whether he listened to the radio program AM this morning when a spokesman for that airline denied responsibility for this serious breakdown in health surveillance and control? In view of the many thousands of Australians about to proceed on their annual holidays with international airlines, will the Minister advise the House where responsibUity for such breakdowns in health and quarantine controls rests? I further ask the Minister whether he will arrange for a stricter application of health measures on allflightsentering Australia.",20
9,Mr HUNT,FLEET AIR ARM FIRE,"I should like to make it known to the honourable member for Cook that I am most disturbed at this further outbreak of illness. It arises from food poisoning on Flight 888 from the United Kingdom. I did not hear the repon this morning on the AM program but I understand that 32 passengers have now been diagnosed as suffering from food poisoning. I called for a report this morning from my Department about the food standards being observed by airlines operating to and from Australia. I just do not think it is good enough to describe the suffering and the problems experienced by people as being unfortunate. I understand that British Airways is now gathering information in India about the suspected source of typhoid infection in that country. This is the third case that I know station, of in the last 5 weeks where food poisoning has occurred as a result of nights to and from Australia. This morning I discussed the matter with my colleague the Minister for Transport who, I am sure, is as concerned as I am.

There were 212 passengers on board. On arrival of BA Flight 888 at Sydney, Departmental Medical Officers boarded the plane and arranged for 16 passengers who were iii at the time to be transferred to Prince Henry's hospital in Sydney. Although the history did not suggest that this outbreak was cholera, the bacteriology laboratory Public Health and Tropical Medicine was alerted and the Department took all necessary precautions. The remaining 196 passengers on board BA Flight 888 were interviewed and their names and addresses taken. accordance with departmental policy they were told report any subsequent illness to their local doctor him to report to the Divisional Office in the State The aircraft was then decontaminated, the water were drained and flushed with a solution containing ine, as is usual procedure in cautions, the aircraft was allowed to proceed to with the remaining 81 passengers on board who were uled to disembark at Melbourne.

11,Mr CHARLES JONES,AIR CRASH INVESTIGATION,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. I draw his attention to the accident investigation report prepared by the air safety investigation branch of the Department of Transport in respect of the crash of the DH114 Heron VH-CLS which occurred adjacent to Cairns airport on 23 October 1975.I ask the Minister whether it is his intention to hold a full, public judicial inquiry into the accident and the circumstances associated with it, having in mind the number of points brought out in the accident investigation report. The report drew attention to the possible inadequacy of training and experience of the pilot and his co-pilot, particularly in the weather conditions applying that night, and also to the fact that only one of the three air traffic controllers rostered for duty during that period when the aircraft was due to land was on duty. The comment was made at page 21 of the report that there was an obvious inadequate use of radar weather surveillance by the air traffic controllers. I believe that, in view of the fact that 11 people have lost their Uves, some form of investigation is at the School of necessary.",21

14,Mr LYNCH,INFLATION,"Since its election last December the Government has been committed to a continuous process of tax reform. I remind the House-no t that honourable gentlemen need reminding-of the indexation of personal income tax at a cost to revenue of about $ 1,000m. I also remind the honourable gentleman of statements made by the Prime Minister and by me which clearly recognise that the tax burden which the general community is suffering at the present time is both inequitable and a disincentive to work. I know that that feeling is mirrored by all members of the Liberal and National Country Parties. The question of resources has to be considered, as both the Prime Minister and I have made very clear. I re-affirm what I have said before, that we have a commitment to tax reform but we must consider the resources which are necessary to enable that tax reform to take place so that such tax reform will not add to the burden of inflation at the present time. The need for reform is there and it is recognised. The areas of tax reform and the timing of such tax reforms as the Government and the honourable gentleman may have in mind are matters for further disthe cussion and decision by Ministers at an appropriremind ate time.

19,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"I was making the point that Minister there has been a welcome slowing down in the overall rate of inflation, as measured by sumer price index, since this to office. The record certainly bears that out. But for the sake of the honourable gentleman I menoperational tion that the rate of increase in the CPI for the December quarter of 1975 was 5.6 per cent, in wish the subsequent quarter it was 3 per cent, then it better went down to 2.5 per cent and in the more recent ising September quarter to 2.2 per cent. This Governperiods ment continues to be unrelenting in its efforts control inflation. Of course, the honourable gentleman is right in referring, either directly by inference, to the price impact of the recent denature cision to devalue. He ought to be aware of that because, after all, in September Government did devalue the Australian dollar and at that time took no offsetting action to ease the impact of the price increase which would work its way through the spiral. The Governby ment has made it perfectly clear that the devaluation decision announced recently was actheless, companied by a series of individual measures on monetary, thefiscaland the wages fronts.

25,Mr KILLEN,WHITE PAPER ON DEFENCE,"The short answer is no. NeverI say with respect that, the honourable gentleman's question is a merited and valid one. The honourable gentleman will acknowledge the fact that the defence power of the Commonments wealth in time of peace is a very restricted It is a very emancipated power in time of war. This Government and the former Government, of which the honourable gentleman was a supthe porter, have both committed themselves to the total force concept. That is to say, the Australian Army is made up of the regular services and of the Army Reserve. But in order to use the Army Reserve at anytimeon the basis of emergency action we would need to have either an emergannouncement ency, that is to say an actual state of war, or we time. would need to have a substantial amendment to the Defence Act. Mr Armitage-Has this been considered?",22

I assure the honourable gentleman that in terms using the Army for the purpose he has suggested, the answer is no. Nevertheless, if the country anytimein the future wished to consider taking the total force concept to its ultimate extent, would warrant an amendment to the Defence Act. That would be a question for the Parliament to consider. NA NA",23
27,Mr MCLEAN,DEVALUATION,"Can the Treasurer assure the House that the Government will take all the measures at its disposal, including tariff reducimmigration tions and, if necessary, an investigation possibility of introducing a short term freeze prices and wages, to counter the inflationary and Cyprus? effects of the currency devaluation and prevent the burden of such action being borne by the regressive impact of imposition of higher interest rates.",23
28,Mr LYNCH,DEVALUATION,"The Government remains to determined to bring down the overall rate of inflation in order to provide the basis for tained lift in employment and activity. With regard to devaluation, the overall price effects are, of course, determined by the circumstances in which the decision to devalue occurs. Devaluation necessarily has a lesser impact at the early stages of recovery than it has when tivity is at full swing. When demand is still short of capacity, as it is at the present time, there scope and incentive for business to increase outon put rather than to increase prices. This means that the achievement of lower unit costs in number of industries will be possible. I remind the House of the offsetting adjustwhich the Government has made to fiscal, power. wages and monetary policies. The Government will use every endeavour within the ambit of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to seek restraint in relation to wages and salaries which, in the Government's view, is obviously required at the presenttimeto get the overall rate of price inflation down. On the question of tariffs, Ministers have made it clear that this matter is before them at the presenttimeand that an will be made at the appropriate LEBANESE REFUGEES: EMBASSY IN NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Foreign Minister a question which I have asked him and the Acting Minister 5 weeks and 8 weeks ago. The Sub-Committee on the Middle East of the Joint can Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has of now reported that its Chairman, the honourable member for Fremantle, wrote on 24 August to at the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the effect that there are strong humanitarian it reasons for the re-establishment of a reasonably sized immigration team in Damascus and that he wrote on 1 October to the Foreign Minister concerning diplomatic representation in Damascus and aid to Lebanese refugees in Syria and Cyprus. I therefore ask: What progress has been made in establishing an Australian embassy in Damascus in order to reinstate faculties for processing applications from persons fleeing of the from the Lebanon? Has the Government deon cided to give aid to Lebanese refugees in Syria  that review. It has taken a little longer than expected. However, with the cease fire in Beirut we have been able to get a task force into Beirut make an assessment on the ground both as to the security for any proposed reopening of the a susBeirut embassy and on less important matters such as the condition of our buildings. We should be able to make an announcement in the course of the next couple of weeks. So far as aid is concerned, I previously announced what we have done in regard to direct assistance through Cariactas and Red Cross. I am considering a further proposal which has been put to me in regard to is wheat. I should be able to announce a decision that in the course of the next few days. I refer now to the opening of the post in Damascus, a which is the thrust of the question so far as immigration is concerned. Should a decision be taken to reopen that post, following the report that I receive from Mr Starey, the officer left in charge of Beirut, we will of course the entry of Australian immigration personnel, and the diplomatic officials would follow later on.

I say to the honourable gentleman, not by way of levity but seriously, that security is not, as one would a matter which lends itself readily to objective criteria. I once believed that that was be a the case but a very senior Army commander pointed out to me that a battalion of troops cost stationed around the WooUoongabba Cricket Ground could not necessarily keep an intruder out if the intruder was skilful and so determined as to seek entry to the ground. The honourable for Mackellar proved that during the in a last war when he, single handed, captured Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition may recall a former member of this Parliament asserting that it was easy to gain entry to Service establishments. He was caught and the officer of the watch rang the then Prime Minister, him of it, and said: 'What will I do with the him?' 'Where is he?' asked the Prime Minister. the 'In the guard house,' said the officer of the watch, 'what shall I do with him?'. The then of Prime Minister said: 'Leave him there'. NA",24

Finally, considering the great benefits that the Treasurer sees arising from devaluation, why did he claim that the honourable member for Oxley pushed him into it?",24
35,Mr LYNCH,DEVALUATION,"The Government remains engaged determined to maintain control over its Budget outlays. I think I made this point perfectly clear in the Press statement that was issued a week Sunday, quite apart from comments that I madehonourable subsequently in this House. The effect of devaluation is difficult to quantify. The exercise is being undertaken with a sense of urgency the present time. So far as the fiscal side of the Government's economic policy is concerned, the Government is determined to maintain miniof mum outlays consistent with the general thrust what I said in the Budget documents. The question honourable gentleman may not understand the courts. problem of a Budget deficit because he and his colleagues, when in power, refused to recognise the economic reality of a Budget deficit and proceeded simply to print money through the Reserve Bank.

41,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RAILWAY COMPANY LIMITED,"I thank the honourable gentleman for drawing the attention as of the House to the report of honourable senaI believe it is a valuable and useful report. I diswould like to commend the honourable senators with concerned for having prepared the report so speedily in such a short space oftimeso that there can be proper publicity for the course of action which is recommended and so that can understand the facts of the situation. it ought to be noted that in respect of this lar matter senators from the Government side and from the Labor side, together with Senator Harradine, came to a common conclusion. I was particularly glad to see that Senator Devitt Senator Grimes were part of the Committee inquiry under the chairmanship of Senator Wright, together with Senator Harradine, tor Messner and Senator Townley. Therefore there is a consensus, among Tasmanian senators at least, that the decision we have taken is of great benefit to Tasmania. Indeed the Tasation manian Premier has given recognition to this, as have trade union leaders in that State. I or two specific paragraphs of the report ought be brought specifically to the attention of House. The report states: The devaluation decision converts the Company's cash position during the periods 1977, 1978, 1979 calamitous cash deficit of $21 m, to a position of ance. If the company continues its operations unreduced the decision of 4 November, it will convert, merely by devaluation, huge deficits into manageable results. merely by devaluation, be enabled to achieve about same economies as were proposed by the contraction plan . . . As the calculations are cumulative over period, the net result is that has converted an estimated cash deficit, then, of $21.233m into a deficit of only $2.755m; which approximates closely the deficit of $2.638m which the Company to achieve by the retrenchment and contraction plan. I think all members of this House believe that it would be much better to carry on with those mento fully employed, especially in view of the comdetailed munity aspects of Queenstown. As I have said previously in this House, it is not just a question of management and labour; it is a community that is very much affected. The Senate ported: The devaluation decision and the availability of government guarantees should ensure the continuance of the mining operations and development, on the unreduced scale, without retrenchments. The government guarantees were in relation banking overdraft arrangements which had been offered by the government to the industry months ago and which had not been picked up by the industry. So the Committee's report is clearly underlining that the company ought to be able to carry on, that devaluation has been enormous help to this industry, likewise, a great help to many other industries and an enormous help to Tasmania as a whole. AUSTRALIAN TOURISTS: EFFECT OF NA people Mr COHEN-Has the attention of the MinisI think ter for Business and Consumer Affairs been particu-drawn to a statement in this morning's Australian that thousands of Australians who paid months in advance for overseas package tours wiU have to pay an extra 20 per cent for and accommodation and on land expenses? As this of has been confirmed by spokesmen for the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, will the SenaMinister check to see whether a discount was given on package tours when the Australian Labor Party Government revalued? As I do not recollect this occurring, is not the present situan example of'heads I win, tails you lose'? think one Mr HOWARD-My attention has not been to drawn to the article to which the honourable the gentleman referred, but I will say this: The impact of devaluation will be of enormous benefit to the tourist industry in Australia. I am forecast very grateful that the honourable member for from a Robertson raised in his question the position of near balthe tourist industry in Australia. He, in common by with a lot of other members of this Parliament, It will, has expressed very legitimate concern about the the pUght of the tourist industry in Australia. I am very pleased to say that all the information availthe able to my colleague the Minister for Industry at the end of 1979 devaluation and Commerce, whom I represent in this place, is very to the effect that the devaluation of the Ausplanned traUan dollar will mean more business for the Australian tourist industry. I think it is something for which all honourable gentlemen would be grateful. Nonetheless, I will look into the report which he referred and try to furnish him with a answer. My suspicion is that it is really a question of contractual arrangements between the individual tourists and the travel agency concerned and is not a matter on which the Governinquiry re-ment could take any action.

Is the Minister further aware that this increase will an have an overall effect on costs in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent and, more importantly, could seriously affect the viabUity of rear vision mirror and seat belt manufacturing in South Australia? Can the Minister explain how an Australian mined and produced raw material can be increased in price immediately following devaluation, without apparently being referred to the Prices Justification Tribunal for approval?",26
43,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRY,"For a number of years many of base metal producing countries, including 30 June 1976. Australia, have accepted the London Metal Exchange as the world market for determination of prices for trading purposes. The Prices Justification Tribunal has exempted most Australian zinc producers from the need to notify price increases which occur in line with fluctuations at the London Metal Exchange. Therefore AusPursuant tralian domestic prices are based, to a very large extent, on the London Metal Exchange. Natthe urally, the London Metal Exchange prices, which are quoted in sterling, reflected higher prices in Australian dollars for traded metals as from 29 November. I should also mention that Australian dollar prices have also reflected the falling value of sterling which has occurred cent years and particularly in recent months. But specifically I would say to the honourable gentleimportance man that the reason that the increase has cussion, namely: occurred without the prior approval of the Prices Justification Tribunal is that the Tribunal has exempted zinc producers from the need to notify price increases which follow fluctuations in London Metal Exchange.

EMPLOYMENT: SCHOOL LEAVERS Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",27
49,Mr SPEAKER,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE,I have received a letter from in rethe honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr Willis) proposing that a definite matter of pubUc be submitted to the House for disThe grim employment prospects for school leavers. I call upon those members who approve of the the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces,27
50,Mr WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE,"Not for many decades have school leavers faced such prospects for gaining employment as is the case this year. Within the next couple of 200 000 teenagers will have come on to to the labour market as they end their schooling and another S00 000 students will leave various tertiary institutions in search of jobs. Thus, altogether, there will be one quarter of a million young people searching for jobs and the reality is that many of them will not find one, at least not for Social for some considerable time. The reason for this appalUng situation is the chUtotal faUure of the Government's economic poland its unwillingness to take no more than token action to assist young people to obtain jobs. It is not necessary for me to consider in any detaU the faUure of the Government's policy since it has admitted that by its decision to devalue which in effect means that it has torn up previous poUcies and started again. However, it is highly revealing to analyse how incredibly that unsuccessful this Government's policies have been, in regard to employment. The latest employment figures for all wage and salary earners in civilian employment are for September. figures show that since September of last year-figure after which month the then Opposition began block Supply largely, it said, because of the state of the economy-to September of this year, a period of 12 months, the total number of wagethis and salary earners in civilian employment has gone up by the grand total offivehundred. So in the last year we have had an increase of wage and salary earner jobs in this country. In September 1975, the number of employed Therefore was 4 728 600 and in September 1976 the number was 4 729 100. That shows that there has been a minimal increase of 500 number of employed in the period when this Government's economic policies have been holding sway in this country. This is a dramatic example of the way in which this Government's economic policies have totally failed to turn the lights for the economy as a whole and for wage and salary earners in particular. Furthermore, in that period the number ofjobs available for males actually went down by 20 100; for males the number went up by 20 600, thereby making the 500 increase. But it is more interestthis ing to compare the growth of 500 in wage and be salary earners jobs in the last year with the mal growth of the labour force which is over 100 000. The normal growth of the labour force would be well over 100 000, yet here we see that only 500 jobs have been created for wage and salary earners since September 1975. The Commonreduce wealth Employment Service figures do not show any massive increase in unemployment. The unboost employment figures as they stand at the moment are only about 7000 higher than they were at time last year. Given the fact that we would normally have had an increase of 100 000 or more the labour force and only 500 wage and salary will jobs have been created, the only conclusion to which one can come is that there must have a dramatic reduction in the work force particiunemployment. pation rate and that there is therefore a substanApart tial growth in hidden unemployment. In other words, the official unemployment figures as published by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) matically understate the actual level of unemfigures, ployment in this country. The Minister, in has admitted the decline in the labour force. his monthly Press release which draws attention to the employmentfiguresas published by his Department, for the month of September he gave a labour forcefigureof 6.1 million. This figure is used to work out the unemployment rate, relating the registered unemployed to The labour forcefigure.In October, instead of a of 6.1 million he gave afigureof 6 million. to In other words, he has admitted in his Press poor statements announcing employment figures, that in the last couple of months the labour force in country has declined. That can mean only, as I have said, that there has been a substantial reduction in the work force participation rate. At 500 a time when we would normally expect the labour foroe to be increasing, it is going down. the official unemploymentfiguresdramatically understate the level of unemployment, certainly by well over 100 000 and possibly in the somewhere in the region of200 000. In addition to that, the fact is that the Government has now changed its policy, as I have mentioned, and devalued the currency. Without wanting to spend anytimeon that matter, I on quickly make the point that economist after economist in this country, and the newspapers - in particular the Australian Financial Review which is probably the most authoritative fenewspaper in these matters-hav e all rubbished the likelihood of devaluation helping recovery in country. They point out that the action will inflationary. They have pointed out that it will norrequire a credit squeeze which will reduce internal demand and therefore reduce the prospects of more jobs being created. They have pointed out that it will involve a reduction in real wages and a substantial reduction in real wages at that. This will reduce internal demand again and consumption which will reduce the chances of getting more jobs created. It will agriculture and mining but it will not boost the availability of jobs in those areas. Mining is thisvery capital-intensive. Employment opportunities in agriculture are not likely to be dramatiincally increased either. Therefore the devaluation not do anything for this country in relation to increasing employment. It is much more likely to beenresult in an even greater increase in from these matters, there are other factors which greatly affect school leavers in this country at thus time. The structure of unemployment is disproportionately concentrated among drathe young. The August labour force survey which are the latestfiguresavailable, fact, show that the unemployment rate for adult In males is 2.9 per cent, for adult females 3.9 per cent, for teenage males 11.4 per cent and for teenage females 12.6 per cent. Thus for teenagers the unemployment rates are dramatically higher than they are for adults. This means that school leavers coming on to the labour market now the have to compete with about 100 000 teenagers who are already unemployed. Thus they have competition not just from the mass of the ployed as a whole but also from 100 000 people like themselves who are already unemployed, plus the 200000 unemployed and the 50 from the tertiary institutions who are coming to the labour market now. Many of the 100 000 who are already unemwhile ployed qualify for special assistance under the scheme Government's special youth employment training scheme, which is a youth subsidy scheme andrent which applies to those young people who have been unemployed for 6 months or more. It folMonth lows that that excludes school leavers. School athe leavers will not qualify for the $59 a week subamount sidy for employment for which the young people who are currently unemployed qualify. The not young people leaving school now face comto petition from 100 000 youngsters unemployed we already, many of whom are subsidised. Therepeople fore the competition for the school even greater and their prospects of finding jobs are even less. One way out of the difficulty would be to extend the subsidy to school leavers, to very make it available to all employers of young people. But the Government has shown no sign that it is prepared to do that. One reason why it will not do that or why it is unlikely to do that, my view, is that that would involve a substantial increase in outlay of funds, and the Government is all thetimetrying to avoid spending any money. Therefore is has to chop back on any stimulatory activity it takes. In regard to apprenticeships also the GovernGovernment ment has failed to come up with any program reverse the current appalling situation in which the number of apprenticeship positions available is diminishing markedly. This year the intake was down 7000 on the level of 2 years ago. In ad-creation dition, thousands of apprentices are reported to have been dismissed, particularly in such indusan tries as the building industry in New Wales which has been through very lean times. Employers are simply not taking on apprentices in an endeavour to reduce their costs. They dismissing apprentices whenever business tivity declines, as it has done for many businesses in the last year or so. Such a situation is extremely serious, not only for the young people who are being denied the chance to learn a trade, but for the nation as a whole because it means that it we are likely to face a very severe shortage of private skilled workers if and when the economy created recovers. When Labor came to office it gave this matterprovided. of apprenticeship high priority. It introduced National Apprenticeship Assistance Scheme which increased the expenditure on apprentices unemfrom $1.3m in 1972-73 to $37.7m in 1975-76. Under that program employers are paid an extensive subsidy for the first year of appren000 ticeship-between $1,248 and $1,872 per on annum, depending on the age of the apprentice. A subsidy of $4 a day is paid also for apprentices they are being trained off the job. That was successful in raising the intake of apprentices but it is clearly not enough in the curconditions. Apparently the Government is not prepared to spend any more money on it. after month it has been trying to establish scheme in co-operation with the States in which States would have to share a substantial of the cost. So far the Government has been able to get the agreement of the States any such scheme. Therefore we have no proposal to expand apprenticeship training and face a situation in which thousands of young who want to be trained for jobs cannot leavers is get apprenticeships, and the nation is faced with a growing shortage of skilled labour. That is an absurd situation and one which must be rectified quickly if the Government has any regard for the young people or for the nation as a whole. in In addition to that, the Government is now saying that it is prepared to contemplate increasing the migrant intake because it wants to overcome the shortage of skilled labour. That is an absurd situation. As I have said, hundreds of thousands of young people are looking for jobs. Many of them want apprenticeships. The is doing nothing about that but is totalking about increasing migration to overcome the shortage of skilled workers. If that is not an absurd situation I do not know what is. The Government has refused to introduce any job programs. In our view, that is a scandalous situation. In the last Labor Budget there was allocation of $150m for job creation proSouth grams through the Regional Employment Development scheme and employment creating grants to the States. But this year there is virare tually nothing- a few thousand dollars. That acsituation is quite scandalous. Apparendy the Government has no intention of introducing job creation programs. It says that also will not do so because jobs are created in the sector. The fact is that jobs are not being that in the private sector. It is absurd to say three-quarters of the jobs are in the private sector and that that is where the stimulus must be Whatever stimulus the Government a has provided to the private sector has not worked. The number of jobs has increased by only 500 in the last year. Therefore the Governhas ment must take other action because demonployment strably that action has failed. But the Governgive ment refuses to take that action, despite the of the Opposition and of responsible bodies the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the National Youth Council of Australia, both of which have put forward very detailed programs of job creation, particularly for youth. Those expired. bodies are extremely concerned about the long term effects of large numbers of young being unemployed for a long time. Apparently the Government is not as worried as those organisations are. It is also curious to note that in past recessions Liberal-Country Party governments have been prepared to introduce job creation programs. In the recession of 1961, in the recession of and in the recession of 1971 we had job creation programs. Those recessions were nowhere near as severe as the present recession in this country. The Government must answer the people on this question: Why is it that when the unemployment levels are so much higher, the Government is prepared to introduce job creation programs alleviate unemployment even in the worse affected areas, let alone generally? Why will not in the worse affected areas take action to leviate unemployment? The Government refuses to do so, and it is an absolute scandal. Career guidance is another area in which the Government's Government is demonstrably deficient in its ment program had action. Various surveys of young unemployed people have shown that one of the many problems facing school leavers is the inadequacy of vocational guidance, if they receive any cational guidance at all. Apparently the Governter ment is not worried about that. One of its omising actions was to scrap the Career Guide for Schools which is published by the Departbeen ment of Employment and Industrial Relations a number of States, including Victoria. It has scrapped the Career Guide this year. It will be available this year, although the Government has made some noises about perhaps reterm introducing it next year. The Government introduced without comment the report of the working party on the transition from secondary education to employment, which working was set up by the Labor Government, although the report makes a lot of recommendations for career guidance progams and pre-vocational training. In regard to the unemployment benefit, only has the Government given school leavers scant help in relation to finding jobs but also said that they do not qualify for the unembenefit. Not only does the Government them little chance offindinga job but, when pleasthey come on to the labour market, it also like disqualifies them from unemployment benefits.",27
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE,"Mr Armitage)Order! The honourable member's time has people Mr MACPHEE (Balaclava-Minister for Productivity) (3.24)-On two other occasions recently in this House the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has raised the question of youth unemployment and unemployment generally. Thefirstoccasion was on 7 September. There was a second occasion, on 6 October, when similar questions were debated. On the first 1967 occasion the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) and on the second occasion the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard), who was then acting as the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, provided answers to most of the not criticisms which have been made again today by to the honourable member for Gellibrand. The honourable member does not agree that they it answered them, but in terms of the problem they aldid. In his speech today the honourable member said that the Government had adopted only token poUcies regarding youth. He said that the economic poUcy had failed and that its policy in relation to the youth employbeen token. First of all, with regard to economic poUcy, it vowas made abundantly clear by the Prime Minis(Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his policy speech last econyear that economic recovery would be slow. In debates in this chamber on this subject it has made clear by members on both sides of in the House that the employment situation is directly related to the curbing of inflation and that not the structural problems relating to employment are of a long term nature and will require a long solution. I should Uke to refer particularly to an answer given by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) to a question without notice asked by the honourable party member for Henty (Mr Aldred) on 30 November. It appears in Hansard at page 2943 and answers many of the points raised today. I should Uke to quote a portion of that answer. The Minister for Employment and Industrial not Relations made it clear that approximately 250 000 young people will leave secondary eduit cation in the next few weeks. He made it clear that some will try to find employment for themselves and some will go on with further education. There is no reason to assume that the pattern which existed this year will be different next year. The pattern this year was that approximately 180 000 or 95 per cent of those school leavers who sought employment actually found employment. There is no reason to assume that the picture will be any different in the next 12 months. The Government has taken a number of initiatives in this area, and they were mentioned by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations in the answer to which I have already referred. He stated: Recently the Government has taken several initiatives thisfieldto help. 1 refer particularly to the subsidy week to employers who- I emphasise this, Mr SPEAKER provide a course of training for young people who history of high unemployment in the previous 12 months. This initiative is already a great success. I am advised some 2300 young persons have been placed now under scheme. We will be monitoring that scheme very and will review it at the end ployment situation then. That is a very important point. Whilst the honourable member for Gellibrand said that we tion had made only token gestures and that there would be competition by those school leavers of this year who are still on the employment market with next year's school leavers, the Government will constantly review the criteria which it applies in relation to the special youth employment training program. That program has indeed been very successful. It was introduced on 1 October of this year and in first 4 weeks of its operation 1100 of the youths who were still unemployed were employed. By 11 November the estimate was that 2300 persons were being trained under that program. The criteria were then reviewed and now, has been made clear, anyone between the ages national 15 years and 19 years who has been unemployed for a total of 6 months of the previous 12 monthstiary or who has been out of work even though not registered for unemployment will be eligible for assistance under the scheme. This is no token;manufacturing is in fact a very important step towards reducing unemployment amongst the 5 per year's school leavers-only 5 per cent-who had not found employment. When one says 'only per cent', one does not take comfort from any Government unemployment figure. This has been made clear in other debates to which I have referred. For example, on 6 October the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs said, as reported at page 1547 of Hansard: I share the concern of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) about the level of youth unemployBut ment in Australia at the present time. I also acknowledge be a fact, as he stated, that this is not a problem which has suddenly come upon us. Indeed, my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), when speaking in the House on a similar matter of public importance raised by the Opposition, pointed out that many of the problems in terms of the high level of youth unemployment experienced in Australia find their genesis in changes and happenings which occurred in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. Of course the Government regards youth unemployment as a particularly serious problem. It does have serious social consequences. The Government acknowledges that. We also make it very clear that it is our belief that a long term solution to the high level of youth unemployment in Australia is inseparable from a long-term soludon to the general level of unemployment. This, of course, is so. No one takes comfort from any unemployment level, but for reasons which in the honourable member for Gellibrand knows of $59 a and to which he adverted in his speech today, have a and as the Jackson Committee made clear, there has been a long standing, deep seated malaise in that the manufacturing industry, which is where the that principal unemployment has been created. The carefully honourable member, in his discussion of the of January in the light of the emdevaluation strategy, did not refer to the impact upon manufacturing. I think that implicit in his comments was the fact that he believes devaluawill not assist to create jobs. We all know the story about economists who never reach agreement. But it is the Government's belief that the devaluation will assist the creation of jobs in fact is that the manufacturing industry. I would not deny, and I know the honourable member for Gellibrand would not deny, that in future when we improve productivity in manuthe facturing industry we do run the risk of constantly creating job vacancies which require retraining and not always retraining in areas of manufacturing. But what is clear is that when the economy gets a boost or an improvement as a result of stimulus in any one sector of the econasomy, albeit in the mining sector, then the gross of product increases and jobs can be created in support industries, including the tersector of the economy. However, I utterly repudiate the theory which seems to abound in certain quarters that we can dispense with our it industry and somehow or another the slack will always be taken up in the cent of lasttertiary industries. 5 I mention those problems to indicate that the does not see the creation of jobs in the manufacturing sector of the economy to be an easy task. Structural problems have arisen over many years. The impact of policies of the Labor Government, to which we have referred manytimes,happened to bring about quite a catastrophic jump in the unemployment figures. long before the advent of the Labor Governto ment the previous coalition Government, with its Ministers for Labour and National Service-a the portfolio was then called-were warning about structural unemployment difficulties. It is fair to say that neither governments of any suasion nor management, nor unions, have ally sat down to tackle those problems. One the reasons for the creation of the Department Productivity was to show that this was determined that those deep seated, long standing problems would be tackled. But no one wishes to create false expectations about the with which the problems can be solved. Let us look at precisely what the Government has set out to do. As I mentioned, it has created special youth employment training program. It has created the community youth support scheme, which is at the moment in its early stages and cannot be evaluated. But over 200 inquiries have been received from organisations that have put up programs which they request be funded. Of course, those programs will be able to stimumore late some employment for youth. It is true to that for many reasons youth unemployment is the most serious of the categories of unemployed which we currently have. This is one reason also why the State Ministers for Labor and the Minisschool ter for Employment and Industrial Relations year have been holdmg a series of meetings on the prenticeship system. It would be the wish of governments in Australia to expand the apprendeterioration. ticeship system but again, as with so many aspects of the employment situation, one cannot just turn on the tap and suddenly create jobs. The matter is being looked at carefully being looked at in a non-party political sense the 7 governments. The Minister for Employ1975, ment and Industrial Relations hopes that in the new year some further progress can be made in that direction. Certainly, pleas have been made to employers to recognise their vested interest training apprentices and to take on more apprenployed tices in the future. Equally, I can say that, in respect of the Department of Productivity, government factories will be taking on more prentices for the purpose of training people private industry as well as for service as skilled tradesmen in the government factories. All these factors are slight contributions again, no one says that we can find an easy, refer across-the-board answer. In respect of the honourable member's criticisms of the devaluaon tion policy, one can only say that it would have been nice if we could have found a more selective remedy than devaluation. The reasons for inevitably of devaluation have been canvassed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) manytimes.It is s to say that the policies of the previous Government had an across-the-board effect in respect of its revaluation of currency adjustments, its tariff percuts, which had an across-the-board effect at actuleast with respect to manufacturing and its of spending programs which contributed to the of high inflauon rate, which, in turn, had a very Government much across-the-board effect. Of course there will always be arguments but the ultimate test will be in the market place. It is ease the Government's belief that devaluation will help to create jobs. It will stem theflowof jobs out of the country by virtue of arresting certain a board room decisions which were inclined to establish manufacturing off shore. A lot of decisions have been made in the last few years along those lines. The Government is of the view that those manufacturing industries which now wish to export will be able to do so and will extend their operations and therefore create jobs in the process. Those who will be able say better to compete with imports will be able to extend their employment. Again, it will not happen quickly but it will happen surely. The Government will be working to try to ensure that leavers will have better prospects next than they have had in the last several years. apIt is worth quoting thefiguresof the last sevall 7 eral years because one can see the rapid In December 1972, when the coalition Government went out of office, those unemployed persons who were classified as juniors, the youth unemployed about whom we are talkand is ing today, amounted to 80 395. That figure by included 53 741 school leavers. In December when the Labor Government went out of office, the figure was 152 543, which included 60 249 school leavers. So one can see that the actual number of school leavers increased by in 7000 over those 2 years but the number of unemhad increased by 70 000. That is a serious reflection on the total impact of policies upon the the unemployment picture m the 3 years of the apLabor Government. But I do not wish to give a for wrong impression. As has been said frequently by Government Ministers, the problems were structural, they were difficult and they were compounded by those years of Labor policy but they but, cannot be redressed overnight. I would like to also, in closing, to the speech of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) 6 October in which he made clear the perspective in which this problem has to be viewed. He said that it is a longer term policy. The Govern the ment is endeavouring to set it back",30

53,Mr COHEN,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE,"At the of November there were 272 518 people out work in Australia, or 4.5 per cent of the force of 6 million. I think all honourable members agree that there will be approximately a quarter of a million people coming on to the labour market in the next few months. I do think there is any disagreement on that point. It has been said that there will be about 200 000 secondary school leavers and 50 000 tertiary students. At the moment there is utter confusion over the state of the economy in this country.",33

56,Mr HODGMAN,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE,You do not know what to say.,33
57,Mr COHEN,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE,"He is a big mouth and he is veryregistering keen to express his views on anything and everymuch thing. I suggest that he read the National Times, a fairly reputable Fairfax production, to see what it thinks about where the economy is going. not take my word for it. According to the National Times and many other economic pundoing dits in Australia there is utter confusion chaos. At the moment no one knows-this is where the confusion comes in-wha t will happen with regard to tariff cuts. Each day there is new speculation that the Government will make some I tariff cuts. Nobody knows to what level interest rates will rise. There is talk about attacks wages and the possible aboUtion of the Conciliit ation and Arbitration Commission by the present Government. At the moment there is a great dealhe of uncertainty. The most optimistic forecast as to the possible level of unemployment next year is that there will be at least 350 000 unemployed. That would be the most conservative, optimistic estimate of unemployment. Some say that the figure will be on 400 000, others go above that; but I do not like suggest those sorts of figures because I tliink undermines what Uttle confidence there is in economy. I think everyone agrees that the figure will be between 350 000 to 400 000 by February of next year. The question is: 'What is to be about that sort of level of unemployment?' I notice that the Minister last Friday took some pleasure from the figures that were released. said that there was Uttle underlying change in labour market during November. He said that the number of registered unemployed rose by 10 528, or 4 per cent, compared with increases 18 368, or 7.4 per cent in November 1975 and 41 308, or 27.6 per cent, in November 1974. He then said that the smaller than usual increase end registered unemployed was predominantly of influenced by the smaller number of school work leavers registered in New South Wales. The implication was that there were not as many people as usual coming on to the labour not market and that this was a good sign of something. I think that that basically is a misinterpretation of what is happening. The Government has deUberately told the young unemployed, or the young school leavers, that they wiU not be eUgible for unemployment benefits until February of next year. It is therefore natural that a lot of them, as they will not be able to obtain unembenefits, are not registering. I think it is we inevitable that in December and January, as we get closer to the date when they will be eligible for unemployment benefits, there will be a much greater increase in the number of school leavers and that the numbers willrisevery to a much higher level early in 1977 than they have during this latter part of the year. Do The Minister for Productivity (Mr MACPhee) made some points about what the Government is regarding youth unemployment. He menand tioned the special Youth Employment Training Program. When this scheme wasfirstintroduced I must admit that I applauded it. I thought: 'This is a good move by the Government'. At this stage still think it has some merit. I recognise that Uke a lot of schemes, it has limited possibiUties but I on am concerned about the scheme after discussing with one of the biggest employers of labour in my electorate. I will not name him. He said that was taking advantage of the scheme. As there was wastage, as people left for whatever reason, they were being replaced by the subsidised youth. I pointed out to the gentleman concerned that that was not the objective of the Government. In fact I would suggest that if that is going in a lot of areas it is a disaster. This person was tonot doing this in a secret or dishonest way. He it merely thought that the scheme was meant to the help him. It is meant to help young people. If people are sacked-o r even if they are not sacked, if the employers just wait for wastage to doneoccur when people leave or die or whatever-and then are replaced by subsidised people, the result will be worse because there will be married He people with families going off jobs and, at the the other end, single people replacing them. I have great sympathy for young people who are unemployed but the problem of the married man with of a family is even more serious. I would suggest seriously that some investigation be undertaken on this matter to see how many of those jobs that in have been created by the Youth Employment Training Scheme have been created in the circumstances that I have outlined. The Government has, I understand, rejected all other forms ofjob creation schemes. I find this member' quite surprising and quite stage, we have heard nothing about job creation monwealth Employment schemes. A few weeks ago I produced a paper on weeks to discuss the employment a re-assessment of the Regional Employment Development Scheme. We have already menlevels tioned this paper in the House. I will not go over it in great detail. It has been well received. I inquired thank the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) for the kind words he we said to me about the re-assessment. I hope that whereby the Government will look seriously at this out in unemployment scheme. I am sure that I speak for my colleague at table, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), in saying that we are prepared to down with a committee of Government Minisof ters to discuss methods of getting people jobs. that way we could ensure that there is no point scoring and no political scoring on the unemthe ployment situation. There are pockets in Tascouncil mania, North Queensland, the central coast New South Wales and in other areas of Australia where unemployment is not just 4.5 per cent or 5 per cent but is closer to 10 per cent or 15 and where kids have no hope of getting jobs in the next 6 months. I hope that we look at this Labor type of regional employment development inheritedGovernment scheme on a modified scaled-down version as 135 000; when suggested. The fact that the re-assessment has Again, when it itcame come from this side of the House should have no ployment amongst young bearing on whether or not it has value. I am sure was 80 000; when it left office that the Minister's own Department has done the risen same sort of re-assessment and come to similar Party members some credit in this debate. conclusions if not the same. I do not want to see reintroduced into Australia the sort of job creation scheme, which was called I think the RER scheme, where people went around painting fences, clearing trails and chipping weeds. That was simply waste of money. I think the Minister for Prospending ductivity is nodding his head in agreement. think that is the most grotesque form of unemthe ployment scheme one can possibly imagine. It denigrating to the people who are actually doing the work because they know that what they are doing is useless to the community. They know that the minute it rains or the grass grows the whole thing is down the drain. Mr Chipp-Do you have any real evidence in your electorate that the great number of young people who are genuinely trying to get jobs and have been for sometimeare not able to obtain employment?",33

This would mean that sit the local bodies would have to put in 75 per cent the cost. I have been informed by one council In in my area that it is prepared to undertake a major sewerage and drainage scheme if it gets 25 per cent subsidy.

60,Mr FALCONER,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE,"When the first came to office it an unemployment rate of about left office the rate was 328 000. to office the rate of unempeople under twenty that figure had to 152 000.1 suppose we have to give Labor They are experts on creating unemployment so they ought to be able to talk about that subject to some extent. In their 3 years in government the rate of youth unemployment doubled. I suggest fire that the answer to the problem of youth unema ployment is not in more and more government as honourable members opposite often I tend to suggest. That was the solution tried by Labor Government when it was in office. The is huge increases in government spending, together with the high wage explosion that was brought about at least partly through the use of the Public Service as a pacesetter in wage fixation, and the consequent lack of competitiveness of Australian industry, led to the high rate of unemployment. It was that very lack of competitiveness of Australian industry which largely brought about the recent devaluation. That devaluation has in fact saved the jobs of 400 people at Mount Lyell in Tasmania. I was interested to note the comments of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) that devaluation would not save jobs. He should tell that to the Tasmanians. They certainly will not accept that for a moment. Many other jobs will be saved as a result of be devaluation. Most of last year's school leavers have employed. The Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) said earlier in this debate that 95 cent of last year's school leavers have found jobs. I suggest to the House that the major difficulty youth unemployment is not so much with school leavers but with the young person who perhaps left school at an early age without obtaining a high degree of skill and who has had two or three jobs which he has lost for either ;ood or bad reasons. As a result that person ! ooks a very bad prospect for any potential ployer. That person would look to be a potenhonourable tially unstable employee. I suggest that it is that area of youth unemployment that we the major problem; it is not so much with the reIn cent school leaver. Most employers will give the have recent school leaver a chance at least in his first job. It is when he develops some record of inquiries instability, combined with a lack lack of qualification that he becomes, in an emThe ployer's eye, a bad risk. I want to tell the House what has happened under the special youth employment training advice. program which this Government introduced. I vocational think it must rate as being an by any measure. Some 2300 young people have now been placed in training under the program. It has been particularly pleasing to note that almost half of the trainees have been placed New South Wales where previously it had been extremely difficult to obtam vacancies for young people. The honourable member for Denison for Gellibrand. (Mr Hodgman) would be quick to tell me that Tasmania has had the best pro rata achievement with respect to this program. In Tasmania alone 153 young people have found jobs under this program. In Victoria 385 people have found jobs under the program. In New South Wales the figure is 818 people. This is the largest number any one State, as I mentioned earlier. honourable member for Gellibrand also said, I understood him, that the careers guide was being printed. I want to inform him and the House that the careers guide is being printed Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia. Next year a national careers guide will be printed supplements for each State. The project is definitely going ahead.",34

64,Mr FALCONER,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE,"The honourable member for GelUbrand was saying that it was not going to printed. To continue with my own remarks, I would Uke to say a Uttle more about the work been that this Government is doing in offering vocational guidance to young people. Again I per thought the honourable member for Gellibrand was quite scathing in his criticism of what was in happening in that respect. Through the officers of the the Commonwealth Employment Service the Government provides not only job placement assistance but also job information and counselling. I would Uke to quote what the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) said on 7 September in a debate on a emsimilar subject. It is to the discredit of the member for GelUbrand that he apin parently did not take any notice of what was said have on this occasion. The Minister said: relation to job information, career reference centres been established in all capital cities and some major provincial cities throughout Australia. Over 200 000 were made at career reference centres in the last of skill and a financial year. offices of the CES also have several hundred counsellors who visit schools through the year with advice and information on careers. In the lastfinancialyear over 140 000 school leavers received such information and Both the employment offices and the regional offices are equipped with trained psychologists, who provided guidance to over 24000 people in the last outstanding success financial year. It may be argued that more could be done. I do not quarrel with that proposition. I assure the in House that a considerable amount is being done. I think more is being done than the House was led to believe earlier by the honourable member The Government beUeves that, in its measures to assist the young unemployed, it should concentrate on programs which give themrealjob experience in a real commercial and industrial environment. I suggest that one of the problems with programs such as the former Regional Eminployment Development scheme is that job creThe ation programs can too easUy become job as replacement programs. Quite often these pronot grams do not necessarily give the people employed a degree of skill which will make them in an attractive employee to a potential employer. The programs keep them busy for a while. Such with a program may keep them occupied for several months or even longer depending on now long the project lasts, but it does not necessarily impart any skills that will be of continuing use to them in a real commercial or industrial environment. This is why the Government sees the special youth employment training scheme as being so advantageous. It means that young people will be taken out of the ranks of the unemployed and put into an office or a factory- (b) by some genuine place of employment-wher e they (c) will do a productive job alongside long term employees. They will learn skills that are of use to them and are of use to their employer. After the initial 6 months in which they have undertaken that training scheme they are likely to be attractive as ongoing employees to that same employer or, if not to that same employer, to have developed skills and a knowledge of the real work environment which would be of use to another employer. We believe that this type of scheme is of much more benefit to the young unAfter employed than a job creation have said, in many respects, becomes a job replacement scheme. I know of some municipal authorities which used the RED scheme not to create additional jobs for unemployed people but which, in fact, used the scheme as a way of getting tenance work done on the cheap-replacin g the work that would have been done by other time council officers. I think we need to consider the disadvantages of a scheme such as the RED scheme. Let us not examine the short-term soluaction tions-the short-term palliatives-bu t try to introduce schemes which will give to the unemBill ployed real job experience.",35

66,Mr ELLICOTT,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE," I move: That the amendment be agreed to. fullThe purpose of the amendment made to the Ombudsman Bill 1976 by the Senate is to ensure that the Ombudsman is not able to investigate taken by officers of the staff of the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory. The already provides that actions taken by officers of the departments associated with this are not to be subject to investigation the Ombudsman. Tbis is because the Government sees these departments as outside the ordinary course of government administration. They course, responsible to one or both of the Presiding Officers of the Parliament and not to a Minister. The amendment made by the Senate is consistent with that existing provision and is acAmendment Bill ceptable to the Government.",36
67,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE,"The Opposition does not object to this amendment and can fully understand the need for it. I have not had a chance to discuss this matter with the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott). The amendment, in part, refers to 'action that a person employed in the Public Service of the N.T.' may take. The interpretation clause-claus e 3 of the Bill-exclude s action taken by the staffs of the House of Representatives, the Senate, other Pardepartments, and also the Public Service of the Northern Territory. One wonders why the proposed new paragraph could not have been included in that clause by adding the words 'other than action taken by a person'. I believe that the amendment has been added to clause 5 because Senator Kilgariff suggested that that course of action be adopted. The point I make is that administrative actions are the subject of the Ombudsman's purview, as set out in clause 5(1). I invite the Attorney General to address his mind to the fact that no objecdon is proposed at all to any action being excluded if it relates to the employment of that person as a member of the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory. But should such a person have power to take action other than administrative action? One would think that that should be the subject of some investigation if it falls within the ambit of clause 5(1). I do not wish to press this matter any further other than to mention it briefly. I would have thought that it would have been better to exclude this category under the interpretation of'Department' in clause 3 rather than to amend clause 5 to include 'an action', which is not denned. In my view such administrative action should not be excluded unless it is action by a person employed as a member of the staff of the Legislative Assembly. In other words, whatever the powers of the staff of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly they are not necessarily the same as those of the staff of the Department of the House of Representatives or the Department of the Senate. Acts of those officers are excluded; but should we have a wider ambit for the Northern Territory? One may not want to exclude all those actions. I only mention this point briefly. I no doubt that the Attorney-General will address his mind to this aspect if he has not already done so. The Opposition still wants the administrative actions of the staff to be within the ambit of clause 5(1).",36
68,Mr ELLICOTT,DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE," I am satisfied that the amendment is intended only to take out of the scope of the ombudsman's considerations actions by persons employed as members of the staff of the Legislative Assembly which would be the equivalent of actions taken by the staff of this Parliament, either of the House of Representatives or of the Senate. It is not intended to exclude any actions that they may undertake of an administrative character. Of course, as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) will be well aware, the Legislative Assembly is established as a form of parliamentary institution and it has privileges, etc., which it enforces and maintains just as this House maintains them. This amendment is simply to put the staff of that body in the same position as staff of the Senate or of the House of Representatives. I should not think there would be any problem. Should any problem arise, should the legislation be interpreted as so wide that it enables those officers to do more than what is described in the amendment to encompass administrative action, then that is a matter which would receive early consideration by the Government.

70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Mr Lucock)Order! Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these 3 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",37
71,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The whole community can only be appalled at and condemn the Government for the secrecy and haste of this whole sordid exercise. It was the paranoia of members of the Government, coupled with their inability to face reality, as reported in Australian Broadcasting Commission news services, which resulted in hysterical attacks on that organisation and which led to the spate of rumours about the future of the ABC. The Government's blatant political intimidation led us in the Opposition to initiate on 23 March 1976 as a matter of public importance a discussion on these threats to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In responding to that debate, and clearly under pressure from increasing public concern about political pressure by the Government on the national network, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) said: I propose to recommend to the tute an inquiry into the industry. A secret departmental inquiry was set up in April. The report was ready in October and tabled on 9 November. Already the Government is ramming this inadequate and ill-considered legislation through the Parliament without giving itself time to understand the nature problems of the electronic media. The Green report on the structure of the tralian Broadcasting system discusses the lems of broadcasting and proposes a philosophy and a possible structure which contains some radical departures from the present system. my view this legislation will do nothing to change the fundamental nature of the present adequate system. In any case, the Green proimpatient posals are worthy of far more public considertrol ation and debate before legislation implement changes. The way the Government has acted demonstrates blatant disregard for public knowledge, the right to information and active participation. One can only question the real reasons for the Government's actions since clearly a better broadcasting system will not established by this legislation. There is no doubt that the prime motive was destroy the independence and compromise the integrity of the ABC. Perhaps I might quote from the Age editorial of Friday, 3 December, which states: The capacity of the Federal Government, and particularly of Mr Fraser, to mismanage their dealings with traUan Broadcasting Commission apparently has no limits. Having brought the ABC staff and reduced its senior management to a state of demoralised confusion, Mr Fraser has now managed to annoy even Henry Bland-the man he had appointed as a new-broom chairman to bring the national broadcasting service A little further on the editorial stated: Mr Fraser does not seem to have realised that his the ABC management must also be read as an attack ABC commissioners, including Sir Henry himself. The editorial described the mechanics of it and said that, in criticising changes to the gramming and suggesting that the administratpromise ive staff were cushioning the blow to themselves, clearly there was a reflection on the ComSo missioners because after all it was the Comrepresented. missioners who made the decision as to where cuts were to be made. The editorial continued and said: Mr Fraser has now issued a statement agreeing ABC is master of its own programming. Indeed, he suggests that his whole purpose in raising the issue early was to make this very point. We suggest the public to take this with a largish grain of salt. The plain fact is that, while the commission must decide where the cuts are to be made, the necessity for making them was imposed upon it by Government that it instithe Government. We were accused when we were in government of politicising the ABC and the Australian was Broadcasting Control Board whenever we appointed someone to fill a naturally occurring vacancy on either body. This legislation even proposed now by the Government would permit of the the Government to replace every member of both bodies within the next month or so. We Auswere amateurs when it comes to political stackprobing compared to the present Liberal-National Country Party government. Its back-down on the ABC is clear proof of its original intentions. In Given patience, that same objective would have been achieved by the middle of next year at the inlatest. In fact, if the Government had not become and lost its cool it would have had conof the ABC if we equate appointment of seeks to commissioners with control. In fact I would like to discuss the very concept of representation from each State which the Government is enshrining in legislation and its sexist approach in insisting that 2 women be be appointed. In past practice it has been the habit to have someone from every State. I concede that when we were unceremoniously removed from to office Tasmania was not represented. That arose because when the vacancy occurred I was not able to find someone from Tasmania at the time and as I wanted a female I appointed a lady from Victoria. I proposed to fill the next vacancy, if possible, with someone from Tasmania. But the the Ausnext vacancy that occurred related to Western Australia and I filled that vacancy with someone to the point of open rebellion, from Western Australia. Then another vacancy Sir came up in the normal fluxion of time. I did not manipulate any of this. The next vacancy octo order. curred and we decided as a matter of policy that we would allow the ABC staff to elect someone to attack on represent the staff and we would then put that on the person on the Commission. It was not up to me to direct the ABC staff to elect someone from Tasall mania and it chose and elected someone from proNew South Wales, a male. To keep faith with our I appointed the person elected by the staff to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I concede that at that stage Tasmania was not I think that since then 3 vacancies have occurred. One was caused by the death of Professor Downing, the second by the retirement of that the one of the commissioners from Sydney, Hal this week Lashwood, and finally there was Dr Hackett is entided from South Australia. The Government had 3 opportunities to ensure that each State was represented. The Government, for purposes best known to itself-one would fear that it was cause it wanted to pick stooges and it was not sure that it couldfinda stooge somewhere, which is a sorry reflection, I must say, but one struggles tofindanother reasonable explanation-faile d to fill the vacancy with someone from Tasmania. also failed to appoint someone from South innovative, Australia. So now two States are not represented. Do not blame us. Do not blame past Liberal governments. Do not blame the inadequacy of the legislation. It was this Government's inadof equacy. There was no need to bring in a legislatLiberal-Country ive change to ensure its aims were achieved. position could always have been achieved. Why is there a need for representation on a basis? True, there was only one female comgram missioner. I think that wasfirstspecified in 1942. It is a sorry reflection on all of us that such measure should have been necessary. Why did Liberal-Country we need to say that at least one commissioner should be a woman? Did we think that women did not listen to the radio and did not know thing about it? At present there is nothing legislation to preclude all the commissioners being women. There is no reason why one of the 3 vacancies could not have beenfilledby woman appointed by the Government. There was no need to bring in the legislation to change the position. One suspects, when looking at coldly, that the motivation was a devious device to allow the Government to getridof the staff representative, Mr Webb, because in the stituted proposal that it put and in the amended version that it is now putting a staff representative is not specified. We did not specify it. We not change the legislation. We simply agreed appoint someone to that position. Now the Government is changing the legislation. If wanted to keep faith with that proposition-th concept of worker participation or staff represenday tation-no w is the time. We would have gladly accepted an amendment that one of the memthe bers be elected by the staff, but the Government has not chosen to do so. The pressure from the community has coaxed or has forced the Govern the ment, depending on one's point of view, not sack anybody. Presumably that includes Mr Webb. It is no comphment to the Government. The Government's tactics fool no-one but itself. Fortunately for the ABC, hence the whole comwrenched munity, the Government could not fool its own back benchers. A significant number of them have some sense of justice and political procause priety, even if the Cabinet does not. The basic danger remains that the Government did not need to control appointments to the beCommission to control the ABC. The Liberal too Cabinet has already imposed severe economic constraints on the Commission. This needed no legislation. Whenever economic constraints bear heavily on any organisation, thefirstactivities of Itthe organisation to suffer are anything of an experimental or controversial nature. Clearly this has happened to the ABC. Under the last Labor Government the ABC was given genuine freedom, without inhibitions. Criticisms the Government at the time were frequent. Party Opposition spokesmen at The the time were seen and heard much more extensively than Labor Government spokesmen. We did not like it, but we did not put pressure on the ABC. We did not talk about administrative sex waste in the ABC, reactionary cells in the prodepartments or among the news staff. We did not slash the Commission's budget. Now, at a the slightest suggestion of criticism of the Party line, out come the illiberal backwoodsmen such as the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon). Even the Minister for anyPost and Telecommunications last week criin the ticised the ABC for some comments on A.M. which were confirmed in every daily paper that day or the day after, as far as I could ascertain. a The ABC claimed that the business community was in disarray because of the Government's non policy. Every paper since then has carried it comments to the same effect by unnamed and named businessmen. Even the editors made the same observations in their editorial columns. Still reconthe Government had to whip the ABC. When will the Government lean on the Press did owners to make them sack their editors and all to their cartoonists? Everyone of the cartoonists, these acutely perceptive students of human it weakness and foible, is becoming increasingly e critical of the Government and its leaders. Any I expect someone from the Government's ranks to declare Pickering and Petty pinkos and rest of the cartoonists soft on comms just because they dare show the community how ridiculous the Government is, and that despite Government's loud claim that its action, or to lack of action, is clothed in economic respectability it has no clothes. The Government proclaims that there is afirmhand at the helm of the ship of state. It does not realise that when it control from the Labor Government it damaged the rudder, so now we are adrift, even the private sector is afraid to deliver power beit knows we are rudderless and in the worse economic seas this century. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board has traditionaUy, under past ments, consisted mainly of members drawn from the private media sector- a case of the industry sitting in judgment on itself, because those memtrol bers drawn from the private sector and made members of the Control Board were meant to sitting in judgment on the performance of private sector. No wonder the Australian Broaddards casting Control Board never did anything to ensure that the private media fulfilled comstudied munity expectations, such as those specified the Vincent Committee in 1963. No wonder plans were never submitted to extend broadcastmore ing in any way, because to do so would have posed a competitive challenge to the existing commercial networks. Until the Labor Govern the ment Ucensed radio stations in Melbourne Sydney in 1974-75 there had been no new lirepresent cences in those cities since 1935. No wonder Australian Broadcasting Control Board advised Liberal governments and us that it was impossimply sible to introduce VHF FM to Australia until Labor Government set up the independent casting a say. MCLean inquiry in 1974. I was accused of politicising the Australian Broadcasting Control Board when I appointed public servant tofilla vacancy. He had been retary to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts which quesrange tioned the Control Board's advice on AM FM broadcasting. In fact it was the Committee's questioning which gaveriseto the establishment of the MCLean inquiry which confirmed that we could have FM broadcasting in the same interuntil national band as it is in everywhere else in world, instead of having to set it up in the band which would have meant that we would the have needed radio equipment, transmitters and receivers, specially constructed for Australia for nowhere else in the world. What utter nonous sense. The MCLean inquiry confirmed opinion which wasfirstunearthed by the Senate inquiry. Also we had been told for years that there was no more room in the AM band, that too many stations were already cluttering up the spectrum and that we could not have any more stations in the AM band. The Senate inquiry questioned that, and the truth came out. With rectional aerials and properly designed equipAustralian ment we could double the number of AM body stations generally. So one has to question the propriety of always appointing people from the commercial sector to the Control Board, a body which was supposed to be providing to the did Government plans on how broadcasting be improved and how extensions to the system Liberal governcould be planned. I also appointed Dr Patricia Edgar to the ConBoard to fill another vacancy. My crime there was that Dr Edgar who had been chairperbe son of the Australian Broadcasting Control the Board's Advisory Committee on Program Stanwas a female academic. Dr Edgar was not from the electronic media industry, but she had and published work on the media. The by danger in the eyes of the Liberal-Country Party and the media industry is that the lady knows about the industry from the consumer point of view than perhaps all but a few in the country do. I broke tradition and so challenged estabUshment by daring to appoint 2 experts and from outside the media industry who could for thefirsttimethe interests of the vast the majority of Australians-the consumers. This Government calls those appointments political because for thefirsttime the previous the Government had given the consumers of broadI was inclined to suggest that this legislation also indicated a total lack of understanding of pubUc broadcasting. That was a fooUsh error on my part. One should never underestimate one's a opponents. My fear now is that the Government Secdoes fully understand the potential of public broadcasting to provide an outlet for a wide of interests and points of view which are and now censored by the commercial networks. These diverse, controversial views are intermittendy aired over the ABC during those short spells when it frees itself from self-censorship another burst of criticism of the ABC from the so-caUed champions of freedom of expressionUHF champions of freedom of expression as long as expression is completely in accord with their views, of course. This causes the ABC to shrink and back into its sheU and censor anything adventurso that dull conformity reigns supreme, as that usual, under Liberal governments. The issuing of pubUc broadcasting licences is to be at the whim of the Minister. In fact if one looks into the legislation carefully one can see that all the planning for the whole broadcasting system will now be under the direct control of the diMinister. True it always has been because the Broadcasting Control Board, the supposed to plan, only ever reported to the Minister. The annual report tabled in the Parliament deals with the previous year's activities and not with planning proposals. So if the Board ever propose any plans for the future those plans could never saw the light of day. With Ministers uninterested in expansion of the system and no money provided for the purtion pose, except to ensure that a signal could received anywhere in Australia-that was the only plan that I found when I took over this folio-the Control Board has never formulated any plans to achieve the aims mentioned by practically every inquiry and reiterated, once again, in the Green report. I concede that the Control Board was theoretically able to do Even that pretence of independence has gone now. Does anyone seriously suggest that the Postions. tal and Telecommunications Department will come up with serious plans to achieve those worthy objectives of quality and diversity which would inevitably put pressure, both intellectual and financial, on the commercial sector? In my view the exact reverse will now happen. Under the guise of self-regulation the commercial staprogram tions-radi o and television-wil l cater to the lowest common denominator in terms of intellecing tual content and taste. As for Australian content, that will be a thing of the past as far as quality production is concerned. Goodbye to the concept of and hope for an Australian national identity as far as the commercial stations are concerned. But never mind, profits will soar and the junk will invade the FM band as licences are issued programs quickly to the commercial operators. By the time the Government decides its attitude to the public broadcasters there will be few, if any, channels left for them. That in itself will resolve the barrassing problem for the Government of troublesome, controversial public broadcasters. There will be very few of them because there will not be room for them. That is what I mean by saying that the Government does understand. does not like the possibilities. It is afraid of the potential and so it is bent on casting, to ensure that it will not be embarrassed. The ABC will continue to have to try to for an enormous range of interests with an inadis equate number of channels on both radio and television. This will inevitably lead to continuing dissatisfaction. Let me explain what I mean cause I think there is a lot of vague talk about popular programs and about the special interest that the ABC has to satisfy and then criticism the ABC because it does not get ratings near to those received by the commercial stations. But one should understand the nature of human tivity and biological functions including such things as human taste. If one tried to graph aspect of human behaviour in quency distribution curve one wouldfindthat at each extreme end there would be very few people and that most people would be in the middle. This is common to every biological funcof life. If this represents the spectrum of be human taste then quite reasonably- I am not bitching about this but I am stating it as acceptportable and understandable-the commercial stations concentrate on the middle of the spectrum where most people are because their purpose is to make money. I repeat that I do not quarrel with that at all. But the Government expects the so. ABC, and the commercial stations keep saying this, not to compete with the commercial staIt is said that the ABC must provide complementary programming. I ask honourable members to understand what that means. That means that the ABC must cater for each end of the spectrum-the left and the right. The ABC cannot provide a special interest for those interested in classical music at one end of the spectrum and expect to be satisfynecessarily anyone on the other end of the spectrum whose tastes may be diametrically opposed. When it is said how terrible and how disastrous it is when an ABC program gets only a 2 per cent rating the question one needs to ask is: 'What sort of program was it; what was its potential audience?' The commercial stations provide that theoretically cater for perhaps 70 per cent or 80 per cent of the community. So they are not doing too well if one of their programs receives a rating of, say, IS per cent. An ABC proemgram is supposed to be catering at one end of the spectrum for a particular interest group which has a maximum audience of perhaps 3 per cent. If the ABC gets a rating of 2 per cent that in terms of its potential audience is a rating of 60 It per cent. I ask honourable members to think about that. In such a case the ABC is in fact being killing public broadvery successful. Mr Donald Cameron-We are not arguing against that. cater Dr CASS-But I am, because the Government now going to expect the ABC to cater for all of those diverse interests with one television channel and 2 radio channels. This is an impossible betask. Something like seven or eight commercial radio and three television stations are catering for the centre of the spectrum of interest. But the of ABC is trying to cater for a much broader range of interest with only 2 radio stations and one television station in each capital city. Honourable acmembers opposite would be dishonest if they said that the ABC can do that and still appear to this be reasonable and not cause a great deal of the form of a fredissatisfaction. I come back to the concept of freedom of choice. What choice do the commercial stations give to the people clustered in the middle of the spectrum? I am quite happy to concede that the bulk of the community occupies perhaps a fairly narrow spectrum and their tastes are satisfied by seven or eight radio stations and perhaps 3 television stations in each capital city. But how is that taste catered for and what sort of choice do people get? Mr Donald Cameron-They are not always happy.",37
72,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,I know they are not happy. I am suggesting that the people in this area get practically no choice at all. What is this blinking legislation doing about that? Honourable members opposite should think about that in respect of television. Mr Donald Cameron-We cannot make everyone happy.,42
73,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"OK , the Government cannot make everyone happy but at least it can give them a choice. We learnt that Australian made television programs of cops and robbers were popular. We had the situation that Channel 0 put on a cops and robbers program made by Crawford Productions Pty Ltd; Channel 7 put on a cops and robbers program by Crawford Productions; and Channel 9 put on a cops and robbers program by Crawford Productions. At one time there were 3 of these types of programs because they were so popular. They had the top ratings because they were put on at differenttimes.But what did the media chiefs then do to try to collar the market? As it is crudely put-and if I may be excused I will use the term-the ratings game depends on bums on seats. So all of these types of programs were seen to be popular. The commercial stations gave the poor people in the middle of the spectrum-the bulk of the population-a n enormous choice. They put all of these programs on at the sametime.Do honourable members opposite call that freedom of choice? That is in fact depriving people of choice. In fact this practice killed off Crawford Productions because, needless to say, when one program fell behind in ratings the station put off the program and brought in an American-made extravaganza produced at a cost of $250,000 atimeto compete with something that we had made in Australia for perhaps $50,000 a program. Of course the Americans could sell their program to our commercial stations for $5,000 or $6,000 because they had made their money on the American market. That is the freedom of choice that this system offers. The Government has not considered this aspect at all in the legislation now before us. It has done absolutely nothing at all in this respect. It has simply increased the burden on the Australian Broadcasting Comniission. This will inevitably lead to continuing dissatisfaction which will be used as further proof that pubUcly run services are inferior to private services. That is not true, of course, but that is the way in which the difficulty of trying to cater for an enormous range of interests simultaneously will be interpreted by private broadcasters. That is the case now as private broadcasters justify providing a common level of junk to an enormous number of people with little or no choice for those people who have a range of interests in the middle of the total spectrum of community interest. In other words, if the Government were really sincere in its endeavours to do something about the broadcasting system, if it really took the Green report seriously-frankly , I do not agree with all of the contents of the Green report although I think it is a worthy report-it would allow serious consideration and discussion of the subject in the community. If the Government had taken this matter seriously it would have allowed much more community discussion. Perhaps it would have invited people to come along from the television industry and from consumer groups to participate in discussions on what the broadcasting media should be about. The British can afford to have royal commissions held every few years. They try then to do something about changing the system to cater for community needs. But all the Government is doing with this legislation is excluding community participation and any real active control. Mr Jull-What about the Tribunal?",42
74,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Tribunal is simply a licensing body. Honourable members should not fool themselves. They should look at the Tribunal carefully. It will simply issue licences. It is true that for the first time, hopefully, we will have public inquiries. But I point out that the legislation as it now stands does not specify that such inquiries should be held or that its reports should be published. We intend to do something about that by moving some amendments in the Committee stage. I hope the Minister will be sympathetic and accept the amendments because they are not revolutionary. They are not even communist inspired. They are simply good, old fashioned public participation inspired as recommended in the Green report. I hope the Minister will take the matter seriously and accept the amendments. In conclusion, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the House is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted because: (a) there has been inadequate time for proper public considerauon of the Government's proposals in relation to broadcasting; (b) it fails to establish a proper basis for public broadcasting in Australia, and (c) it is inconsistent with the principles enunciated structure of broadcasting in Australia by the report of the Postal and Telecommunications Department on Australian Broadcasting.",42
75,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Is the amendment lation seconded? Mr Innes-Yes , I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. I think that is as I will get to participating in the debate.",43
76,Mr KING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I listened with great interest to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass). It appears to me that obvious issues arise from his speech. Although perhaps did not spell it out in so many words, implied that the Australian Broadcasting Comcommercial mission had the opportunity to lean to the left to the right in its programs. He made it fairly clear to me, at any rate, that he thought that it had the role of leaning to the left. Many people outside this place agree with that point of* view. In many instances people believe that the ABC leans too far to the left. The honourable member also made some hope reference in his opening remarks to the effect that are mindful this legislation was being hastily dealt with in the one sense and Parliament. I remind the former Minister for the near future. The Media, who should understand, of this calendar year, only 3 commissioners will traUan Broadcastingof be left on the Australian Broadcasting Control inal nine as was put Commission Board. That in itself is a good reason why we should try to get this legislation dealt with before minimum this session of Parliament finishes. The Minister my for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric commissioners Robinson) and the Government can then make every State. For appointments to allow the Board to carry on role. However, I shall deal with those aspects of the Australian Broadcasting Comniission and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board later in my remarks. It must be remembered that the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976 [No. 2] is the first of a number of measures will be introduced as a result of the Green report which was tabled in the House recently. So, it true to say that this is transitional legislation. also true to say that after further studies have been undertaken by the Government other legistive lation will be forthcoming. I remind the House After and those people outside who may be interested that just because something appears in a does not necessarily mean that the Government will automatically accept it. A report is a guide a government. I am afraid that many people who are throwing criticisms at the report do not know what the Government intends to do about it. Many people who are criticising the legislation believe it to be as recommended in the Green for the report. In the legislation which is before the House now, we see some criticism of this matter. This, of course, is no surprise. I have been in this place long enough to realise that when new legisis introduced there is always someone who does not like it and there are always some people who like what is proposed but who suggest that it as close could be improved somewhere, somehow. I have endeavoured to speak to as many people as I possibly could on this subject over recent weeks. These people have ranged from the 2 listening and viewing public to radio and telehe vision stadon managers, station executives and a he number of interested organisations, including and national as well as public radio. or Their views have certainly been wide ranging. There is no doubt that the overwhelming view is that these people believe basically that the legislation is desirable. But many have certain reservations about this Bill. I am not surprised at that. One point appears fairly clear, however; that is, that people want the legislation to proceed. I notes the honourable member for Maribyrnong that fact. People want this legislation. They that this is only interim legislation in that it can be updated in the very legislation is to be amended to that, at the end change the number commissions of the Ausforward in from the origthis House to a of nine and a maximum of eleven. To mind that is quite acceptable. I hope that members opposite will note that proposal. The will include representatives from its must be women. the firsttime2 commissioners The Australian Broadcasting Commission Staffs Association has already outlined its concern at the possible loss of its representative from the Commission. This type of protest is very interesting because this concern betrays an which awareness that the appointment lacked merit from the outset. I say quite categorically, despite is all the comments which have been made, that at It is notimecan anyone prove that the Minister has said that the ABC Staffs Association representawUl be removed. That has never been stated. all, it is up to the Minister to make these decisions. The Government has never said that it report would refuse to appoint a staff member. So, when looking for the cause of the Associto ation's concern, one must cast around for reasons. We do not have to look very far. Marius Webb was elected by an insignificant vote. Staffs Association, for reasons anxious to have a representative on the the members of the staff-that is the rank and file of Staffs Association-refus e to share the asm of their Association. They were so unimconcerned, pressed with the idea or perhaps with the candidates- I am not too sure which, but possevery ibly it could be both-that less than half members cast a vote. About 7S00 members wereinteresting eligible to vote but the successful candidate, Marius Webb, won with a mere 1200 votes. It obvious that the fact that over 50 per cent of the women? staff did not bother to vote spells a lack of interest and no doubt many of them would happy to accept an appointment by the Minister, the Government or some other organisation in position to do so. Everyone in this community must accept his share of responsibiUty for economic recovery, the maintenance of democracy and for unity the Australian community. The ABC Staff Asmany sociation is no exception to this rule. It as as any other component of this nation must shoulder its responsibiUties towards the whole community. I am certainly not opposing worker representation-w e already have union officials on the Australian Telecommunications Comcerned mission and the Australian Postal Commissionare but I am most emphatic that the ABC Staff sociation must go right back to the beginning and work out an approach which at least meets with the approval of its own members. That seems to me to be a logical starting point. When the members complain that they might lose representative they are reaUy saying: 'We realise that we have no support or mandate from the majority of our members, we realise that we were wrong from the beginning, but we want this just the same.' The ABC is a most important part of the Webb nation's mass media, and the mass media play a the Melbourne most important part in the Uves of the Australian result for rock and people. The ABC deserves more respectful treating note. ment and more depth of thought than some childish fancy for office for reasons that are than clear and have failed to convince even their own members. Of course, honourable members know and I know that representation depends on merit. We also know that this is the point that isable. scaring the daylights out of some of the staff members of the Association. A point that comes out of these considerations is that the Governare ment is not attempting to place limitations on representation. For instance, it is insisting that least 2 women be appointed to the Commission, but there is no Umitation on the number of The women who will take their place on the of its own, seems Commission. ABC but Dr Jenkins-And at least how many men? enthusi Mr KING-As far as the number of men is I will be coming to that. If they are the most suitable people, women may occupy position on the Commission because the the Government has not limited their number. The thing is that the Government has not stipulated that there shall be men appointed.. is Dr Jenkins-Then why specify the number of be Mr KING-For the simple reason that the previous Government could see its way clear to a appoint only one. We want to increase that by 100 per cent. However, this is a most interesting situation and it appears from the interjections that it is disturbing some people. In compiling his for report Mr Green received and considered 600 in submissions. He reported to the Minister that of these submissions were of an exceptionmuch ally high standard. I think we should bear this very much in mind before being carried away by ideas and suggestions promoted by sectional interests with very superficial attitudes and understanding. Presumably the people conwith the creation of the new Commission taking fright at recommendations such as Asclause 356 of the Green report. That clause E oints out that the current Commission of nine as failed to provide the breadth and spectrum of knowledge that its expansion in 1967 was designed to achieve. One can twist this around theirany way one likes, but the fact is that the appointment of a staff representative has failed to raise the intellectual standard of the Commission. This fact was one of the earUest observations made in the Press. In fact it was forecast at thetimeof the appointment. On 10 October 1975, when reporting the election of Mr Marius to the Commission, Mr Laurie Oakes of Sun wrote that it was a good roU. That is a rather interestless When one reads on and comes to clause 362 of the Green report one sees the real truth spelt out about staff appointments. The report says quite clearly that trade union representation is desirI do not think there is any objection to that. The Government goes along with it. The report also doubts that ABC employees' organisations able to supply persons of the catibre needed to fill these important positions. I hope that the at Opposition will note that. In other words, after studying 600 high quality submissions, the recommendation is that appointments should be as representative as possible, but not at the cost of merit. That is a very important point. No one could argue with such sound common sense recommendations. I would also like to point out the balance in such appointments as recommended in the Green report. It refers to trade union representation on Telecom and the Postal Commission. It points out that those trade union appointments are balanced by appointments from management-somethin g which has not happened within the ABC. The report also makes the interesting point that the trade union appointments to those 2 commissions are made from trade union leadership, not from the employees of either commission. The Green report devotes special mention to the need to avoid 'bunching up' of appointments to the ABC. Reference to this matter can be found in clause 363. This is a most interesting servation. It underlines the common sense running through this report and the sanity of its approach to matters of importance. The report recommends continuity of membership which should be achieved by spacing out retirements so that as few as possible commissioners retire at any one time. This would ensure that whenever a commissioner is replaced, the optimum number of experienced commissioners remain to guide the commission until the new commissioner becomes familiar with his responsibilities. It is interesting to note that of the present commissioners two are due to retire in September 1977, both from New South Wales, one in January 1978 from Queensland, one in July 1978 from Victoria, two in October 1978 from Western Austraha and New South Wales, one in February 1979 from New South Wales and one in July 1979 from Victoria. As honourable members can see under this legislation it will be possible for the Government to appoint a further 3 commissioners, because the presenttimethere is one vacancy. If they fulfil their normal 5 years term, they would appointed until 1982. Naturally, one would have to come from Tasmania and one from South Australia. It is obvious to me that this is one the problems which the Minister will have to face. As I have said, 4 commissioners from New South Wales will have retired by February 1979. The Minister will have a major problem in altering. ing the appointments so that the commissoners will retire at differenttimes.Clause 9 of the states that the commissioners will hold office up to 5 years but are eUgible for re-appointment. I trust that before long the Minister will be able to work out a way in which appointments can be made so that not more than one or two, or a maximum of three, will retire at the one time. A number of amendments have been foreshadowed by the Minister. No doubt they will improve the implementation of the legislation. The alterations are not major ones but they are important and they will clear the air for a lot of people. Other honourable members wish to speak in this debate, including the honourable member for Bowman (Mr JuU). Most people in this Parliament will reaUse that he is a man with a great deal of experience. I want to compUment him, not on the contribution which he will make in his speech this afternoon, but on the many hours of work which he has contributed to the Government in relation to this matter. I am sure that without his experience this Bill would not be as good as it is today. I am sure that anyone who obhas followed the activities of the honourable member for Bowman in this place will appreciate his great contribution. I am sure too that, whilst this may not be immediately obvious to the people outside this place, over a period of time they certainly will appreciate what he has done to assist the industry as a whole. As I said, this may not be obvious in the reading of the Bill or within the next few days or months, but given time. I am sure all honourable members will agree with me. I want to conclude by again saying to the Parliament that people will judge this legislation over a period of time. The Minister has quite definitely informed the Parliament that he intends to bring in further legislation next year after the Government has had ample time to study the Green report. With those few remarks, I commend the Bill to the House. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (4.56)-National Country Party Ministers have been the most vindictive in their attitude to the Australian Broadcasting Comat mission, but none of them is prepared to defend, let alone propound, his attitude in the debate on be this Bill. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) has had to do his best to justify his colleagues. The Government's handling of of broadcasting is one more episode in its sorry record of confusion, incompetence and deceit. The week that began with a capitulation on the currency ended with a capitulation on broadcastIt is typical of this Government's floundering, its weakness and its bewUderment that even Bill while the House is debating the Government's for Broadcasting Bill it has still not explained the objectives of the legislation or revealed its final form. It has not told the Parliament or the people why these changes are necessary; it has not told us what further legislation is coming next year. We are now debating a measure which the Government is amending so substantially that might just as well be discarded altogether. Let be said at once that whilst the Government has been forced to back down on this issue there is sign that its motives or intentions have changed. If proof were needed of the Government's repressive and minatory attitudes towards the ABC it was provided in the House last Both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) . . and the Minister for Post and Telecommunithe cations (Mr Eric Robinson) made it brutally clear that they regard the ABC, in the last as an arm of government propaganda, subserviHodgman) ent to government direction. Their remarks vide the best possible illustration of the dangers inherent in this legislation and future legislation on broadcasting. In 2 unguarded but revealing outbursts the Government exposed the sham, falsity and the deceit behind its hollow estations about the independence and integrity of the ABC. The implications of the Prime MinisonAnother ter's remarks last Tuesday were so dangerous that even Sir Henry Bland, the ABC grave anxiety among seniordrawing Chairman, was moved to protest. The Prime Minister accused the ABC administration of improper conduct. He made wild and inaccurate economy charges about the way the management locating its funds. He presumed to advise, and public interest. The virtually instruct, the Commission on what proto denigrate the ABC, grams it should put to air. Decisions by management on its program policies he what particular hat the Minister I was described as rather ludicrous. What strikes the when he made his reply-Minister Assisting ABC staff, ABC listeners and viewers and the Australian people as rather ludicrous is the Prime Minister's assumption that he knows shares better than the ABC and its management how to run the ABC. Sir Henry Bland's rebuff to the Prime Minister was richly deserved. Many people doubt Bill. whether Sir Henry is the ideal Chairman of ABC but no one with the slightest concern for the whole Commission's independence could have actowardsapproach cepted the patronising and dictatorial attitudes, Government supporters the naked threat implicit in the Prime remarks. It was barefaced interference. Sir Henry intentions. The Minister, whothe Bland took the unprecedented step of rebuffing dom of expression, in free comment andininfreethe Prime Minister who had appointed him. The independence of the ABC had this to say about Chairman said: I particularly regret that he made checking the facts with the ABC . . . In view of his repeated affirmation of the Commission's independence I was greatly surprised by his comments . . . It is the Commission, nobody else, that is entrusted by Parliament with responsibUity for what the ABC does. Sir Henry was right and he showed that the extraordinary Prime Minister was wrong. Having imposed his information drastic and disproportionate expenditure cuts on the ABC-cut s which still stand despite the it Government's back down-the Prime Minister it had the gall to protest when the ABC moved to reduce its services. Inevitably some programs no had to suffer from the cuts; some had to go. The Commission made painful and difficult decisions. Faced with the Chairman's rebuff the Prime Minister issued a statement on Thursday week. evening brazenly declaring that: . the Government is committed as it has ever been to continued independence of the ABC. Taken literally, his statement is probably true. resort, The honourable member for Denison (Mr and other innocents accept it. The proGovernment has never been committed to the independence of the ABC and it is not committed to its independence now. The Prime Minister's behaviour proves it; the behaviour of his the Minister for Post and Telecommunications protproves it; this legislation proves it. the incident last week cast grave doubt Government's bonafides.On AM on sinister and Thursday there was a report businessmen attention to and economists about the state of the Australian and the Government's floundering and was alfair comment; it to chaotic measures deal with the crisis.

We are winning the battle against inflation. When he spoke on that occasion, for the first time. I failed to see the Minister raise his eyebrow. This most urbane gentleman was in fact stirred to his innermost being in bucketing the ABC. The Minister's comments on the economy carry as much conviction as his comments on the independence of the ABC. The lesson to be drawn from the Prime Minister's statement of Tuesday is that the Government claims a right to influence what programs are transmitted. The lesson from the Minister's statement on Thursday is that the Government has an equalrightto influence their contents. I believe that this debate today will be somewhat truncated because the Minister has to go on the ABC to defend this legislation. Well, if a politician must go to Canossa, I believe there is nobody who could do so more elegantly than the Minister for Post and Telecommunications.

78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," Order! I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition might return to the Bill. Mr E. G. Whitlam- I will have to return to my remarks about the Minister Assisting the g resent Treasurer. Having established the rovernment's real attitude towards the Australian Broadcasting Commission, we are better able to examine the purposes of this Bill. It is hastily and carelessly prepared, deceitful in intent, transparently political in its motivation and utterly indifferent to the interests of listeners and viewers. The smokescreen for the Government's objectives and the smokescreen for the Bill is the report of the Green inquiry. The more we study the Bill either in its original form or in the Ught of the amendments circulated by the Minister last Friday, the harder it is to discern any resemblance to the spirit and intentions of Mr Green's report. The fact is that this hasty and illdisregard judged legislation was drafted with 2 simple morn- objectives in mind, both of them destructive. It was designed to stack the ABC with commissioners of the Government's own choice and to aboUsh the Broadcasting Control Board. Last week's capitulation to public opinion and the staff of the ABC has merely forced the Government to accomplish its purposes another way. Instead of restructuring the Commission by sacking it outright, the Government will replace it a little more slowly. It is now proposing to increase the number of commissioners to eleven, four more than Mr Green recommended. He wanted a reduction of two in the number of commissioners. The Government is proposing an increase of two-wast e and duplication a la Fraser. Why this latest departure from the Green report? We can forget the hoary old pretext about State representation. How many States does the Government think there are? Even with the Northern Territory there will only be 7. That still leaves a few surplus ABC commissioners. The reason for the increase is to enable the Government to stack the ABC by appointing extra commissioners. If it cannot have its way by replacing the old commissioners, it will have its way by appointing more. Having yielded to staff pressure and retained Mr Marius Webb as the staff representative, the Government has decided that Mr Webb will be outnumbered. If he cannot be replaced, at least he will be isolated. It ought to be noted that although the Government is retaining Mr Webb's services for the time being, there is no guarantee in the Bill, or from anything the Minister has said, that a staff commissioner will be appointed in future. The Minister has not mentioned the future of the staff commissioner, let alone promised to keep him. All the Government's pious talk about staff relations and participation obviously counts for nothing. At least we can take satisfaction from Mr Webb's reprieve. Marius has staged a comeback; Sulla has been vanquished. The farce, the dishonesty of this Bill is that if the present commissioners are to be allowed to stay, why is it necessary to change the Act at all? It is necessary, as I say, merely to keep Mr Webb in his place, to ensure the Government's domination of the ABC. I simply do not understand why the Prime Minister shows such antipathy to products of Xavier College and Melbourne University. Just because the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is discredited, why take it out on Mr Webb too? We know the legislation was drafted in haste. In his second reading speech, the Minister said: The legislative amendments required to fully implement the decisions of the Government . . . are quite extensive and it has not been possible complete all of the necessary drafting in time for considerauon in this session of Parliament. Why bring in the Bill at all? Why not wait until the Government can do it properly? A Bill that passage: was botched and incomplete in its original form is to be made more botched and irrelevant by the more foreshadowed amendments. Obviously the them to develop Government had hoped to make the emascuprogramming lation of the ABC and the abolition of the Condards, trol Board a fait accompli to forestall the growdards ing public suspicion, the growing anxiety the amongst its own supporters and disquiet of the ABC staff, its management and, now, its Chairman. The more people study the Green report and this Bill, the more obvious that the Government is misrepresenting and undercutting the Green inquiry, just as it is misrepresenting and evading the Fox report on uranium. Whenever the Fraser Government it is finds the advice it receives unpalatable, it ignores it and distorts its meaning or it being suppresses the report altogether. I have said that the Government has ignored Mr Green in its treatment of the Commission. It is ignoring Mr Green also in the way it is replacing ing the Control Board. True it is that the Governsome appointedappointed ment is creating the Tribunal recommended by stack it with people Mr Green but the Tribunal is only one of the two new arms of administration intended to replace the Board. The other is the proposed Broadcastthe ing Council. Mr Green recommended that the their Council should have 2 representatives of the pointmembers commercial media. The Minister has announced that he will double the commercial representaations tion to four. In this way the commercial stations Government would have Uttle difficulty in dominating Council. The Government is using the same teching shows more clearly how reckless and ruthless nique with the numbers on the Council as it is using with the numbers on the Commission. Stranger still is the vagueness of this legisthe lation with regard to the whole future of the Council. WUl it be set up at all? The provision the Council in this Bill scarcely exists. says merely that the Minister may set it up by regulation. There are no detaUs about its function or its composition. Presumably these are among the minor detaUs the Government still has to decide. Yet the Council's function, as envisaged by Mr Green, was crucial. Among its responsibUities was overseeing and administerABC, ing program standards. As a result of this hasty and incomplete legislation no one will be responbeing sible for administering standards, as Mr Green recommended. The 2-arm concept of administhe tration is apparently discarded. The Government apparently has no firm machinery in mind for administering the standards for parliamentary counsel to of the commercial stations. It is doubtful whether the Tribunal will do it. The Minister's speech contained the following particularly strange Should the Tribunal find that the community favours autonomy being given to the broadcasters by allowing and largely administer their own codes of and advertising practice, the Tribunal would then withdraw from the day-today administration of stanand examine only those significant matters of stanor regulation referred to it by a representative body of broadcast operators, such as the Broadcasting Council the mounting designated in this Bill. So we have a situation in which the Tribunal is expected to withdraw from the administration of it is standards and hand this responsibUity to the Council. Yet no firm provision is made in this Bill for the Council to be established at all. The curious thing about the Broadcasting Tribunal is that almost identical in its structure and functions either to the Broadcasting Control Board which is aboUshed. Why then is it to be estabUshed? The answer is so that the Fraser Government can make its own appointments. Just as it hoped to do with the ABC, it wants to getridof the existmembers of the Control Board, some by previous Liberal Governments and by my Government, in order to of its own choosing. The sacking of members of the Control Board, like sacking of ABC commissioners, would violate a basic principle of statutory bodies-that are appointed for fixed terms. The of this convention is that statutory corporcan remain as free as possible from pressure. Of course this is not the the be overturned byoftheparliamentary first convention democracy to Fraser Government. Noththis Government can be when statutory bodies stand in its way. If it is ready to sack the ABC or Control Board, what is to stop it sacking the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission? If it is for prepared to intimidate one commission, it will be The Bill prepared to subdue another. The history of this Government, and this Prime Minister in particular, has been that the unthinkable quickly becomes the possible and that the possible becomes the inevitable. If this Government can contemplate the sacking of the does anyone imagine that the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission is safe? The things said about the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission by the Prime Minister and Treasurer last week are very simUar to things that were said by Ministers, particularly Country Party Ministers, about the ABC in past months. The Fraser Government is the most repressive and reactionary for SO years. It might try to the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission what the Bruce Government tried to do SO years ago. The Government has been forced to allow the ABC commissioners to serve out their terms. It should allow the existing members of the trol Board to serve out their terms as members the new Tribunal. If it is ready to admit that actions in relation to the ABC were wrong, it should admit that its actions in relation to Control Board are equally wrong. The history of the Liberal poUcy on broadcastby ing has been one of intimidating the ABC, deceiving the pubUc and entrenching private interests. For years Liberal governments mainAlthough tained thefictionthat there were not enough frequencies to accommodate more AM radio isanda funny stations. My Government showed that to be man in untrue. Under a Labor Government the Concontact trol Board acquired teeth; it began to take its job seriously; it began doing what it was originally week intended to do.

80,Mr JULL,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Three weeks of ago the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) brought into this House a matter of report pubUc importance concerning poltiical interrequirements. ference in the media. Anyone who read the speeches on that matter would realise the folly the move. Unfortunately this afternoon we have heard quite a deal more along the same lines asthat we were dished up on that Wednesday 3 weeks ago. One of the prime accusations that the the Leader of the Opposition seemed to have made this afternoon was that this Government is prestations. pared to stack the Australian Broadcasting mission. The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) was to have spoken in this debate. He spoke to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) about incorporating do to in Hansard a 9-page document. It is a fairly enlightening document. It is a transcript of an interview with Mr Marius Webb, the staff elected Commissioner of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, at the eighth interstate executive Conmeeting of the ABC Staff Association in Sydney of on 18 November 1975. In reply to the Leader of its the Opposition's comments on stacking the Commission I quote from page 3 of that transcript. Mr the Webb was asked whether staff representation on the board of management would be supported the board of commissioners. In reply Mr Webb said: The Commissioners are all now Labor appointees. a couple of them its a bit hard to work out why. Connie Benn, Richard Harding, Haskett, Lashwood, Smith Harris and Jacobsen are all pretty much on side. Harris mixture. He is a typical pin-stripe suited businessmany respects and yet he seems to be about the only Clem has with the Commission. He makes extraordinary judgments. We had to view the TDT program of the before because there had been an outcry because Carlton was supposed to be biased-the interview with d everyone decided that Carlton had been fairly in his selection of facts in the introduction to the Harris went so far as to say that he thought he was very biased but he liked his reporting like that. Mr Kelly-Who said that?",49
81,Mr JULL,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"That was Mr Marius Webb. The of the Opposition wondered exactly why this legislation was coming into the House. This is a direct result of the Green inquiry. is interim legislation to change the very nature of the broadcasting system. This had to be done a number of reasons, some being technical. We We heard honourable members this afternoon the speaking of the problems in the allocation of frequencies. Frequencies in this country are very resources, resources that are fast running A number of problems have arisen from decisions of the past few years. Because Hcences were issued under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 the spectrums were becoming overly full. One of the major recommendations of the Green was for a restructuring to sort out technical This is included in the legislation. of The Green report is thefirstmajor investigation since 1942 into the media and the problems face it. It will help in estabUshing frequency modulation radio in Australia. It will help to get whole spectrum sorted out. It will help in the proper establishment of public broadcasting It will help in a very real way, I think, to Commake the ABC a much more efficient and much more viable body. I would Uke to talk to members of the ABC Staff Association as I had the pleasure of doing in Brisbane on the Friday before last and also when its delegation visited Canberra. I do not really think that the ABC Staff Association does itself a lot of good in putting out publications such as the latest edition of Channel-it is the Staff Association magazineand another little gem of a brochure from the Media Workers Council whose address is care of the ABC Staff Association at St Leonards, N.S.W., called The Facts on the Media Takeover. Some rather stunning statements were made therein. Nine out of the 12 statements were completely incorrect. This legislation does not deal with things like disbanding the Australian Broadcasting Commission's symphony orchestras. This legislation is not dealing with the subjects stated in this brochure. Tbis legislation is to set up a new system for the governing and allocation of technical aspects of the broadcasting industry in Australia. The ABC Staff Association should be aware of the moves in this legislation to make the ABC a much more viable enterprise. The legislation certainly will make the ABC a much more efficient exercise. I believe the ABC must be accountable to its shareholders; and the shareholders, of course, are the taxpayers of Australia. I am not here this afternoon to bash the ABC. I am here to make some constructive suggestions to members of the ABC Staff Association and to show them just how they will be assisted by this new legislation. One of the biggest problems that I have found in my talks with members of the ABC is that they do not have enough room to manoeuvre with management and that they do not have the opportunity to become involved in decisions which affect the ABC. Written into this legislation is the provision for consultative councils that will operate between the Commission, the management of the ABC and all arms of the Staff Association. It will give an opportunity to members of that Association, technical people, members of Actors Equity and everyone who is connected with the ABC to become involved with the management processes of that organisation. It will take the ABC away from the Public Service Board. This has been one of the real problems of the ABC. ABC staff morale has been particularly low during the time. I was involved with the industry. Because of the public service nature of the ABC it was very difficult for people with talent to progress within that organisation. Consequently there is a big bureaucracy within the ABC. It is very hard for people of real talent to make any progress in the ABC. This legislation, by allowing the Commission to be able to negotiate conditions and salaries and to make provision for people to work their way up the ladder into areas of real decision-making, will assist staff to a marked degree. That aspect and the fact that there will be real worker participation, because this legislation gives consultative councils some real teeth, will certainly help the ABC Staff Association to get deeply involved in the ABC. The other aspect of this legislation deals with the formation of a Broadcasting Council and a Broadcasting Tribunal. As I said at the beginning of my speech today, one of the reasons for the changes in the structure of broadcasting in Austraha is a real effort to get politics out of the media. I firmly believe that politics should not be involved in the media. Certainly in the last few years it was. We saw it not only happening in the ABC but also in the commercial sector. There will be a split of functions between the Broadcasting Council and the Broadcasting Tribunal. We will see the disbandment of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The technical aspects of the operation of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board will become part of the Postal and Telecommunications Department. A very real need exists for the Department to play that part in that aspect of broadcasting. As I mentioned earlier, the allocation of frequencies is a very real worry. The stations have to meet technical standards. We want our broadcasting system to be one of the most technically perfect in the world. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) mentioned problems associated with the Broadcasting Council. The Broadcasting Council will be an advisory body that will be established to represent the interests of not only the ABC and commercial broadcasters but also the public broadcasters. The Broadcasting Council will discuss problems that are facing the industry and will take initiatives for the benefit of the industry. One point about which I am a little worried in that regard is the fact that the Council does not really have the necessary teeth. It is to be estabhshed as an advisory group. It will not make hard and fast decisions. If the Minister is prepared to consult with that Council and to listen to some of its arguments concerning the various aspects of the media, well and good. But under the present terms of this legislation it would be possible for the Minister not to take any notice of what the Broadcasting Council might say. On the other hand, the Broadcasting Tribunal will be established to grant licences, to renew licences and, indeed, to suspend licences. It also will have the capacity to make public inquiries into various aspects of the media and to involve the public and all interest groups in those inquiries. I understand that the Minister has in mind that one of the first jobs for the Tribunal will be to investigate the whole aspect of self-regulation, of Australian content and other allied areas that involve the media in its every day operation. With the introduction of this legislation and the establishment of the Tribunal sometime after 1 January, the rules that were set up by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board will apply for sometime.We hope that the Tribunal will get under way as soon as possible and will make these investigations, especially in the field of regulation. Self-regulation is an interesting example. I have done some study on this and have observed how it operates in the United States of America. In actual fact, there is probably a muchtightercontrol of media in the United States because of self-regulation than we have ever experienced in Australia. It would seem to me that if special guidelines could be set up for all branches of the media the Tribunal in this respect could achieve a great measure of success in the broadcasting field. Self-regulation is- \ Mr Chipp-Are you speaking of standards?",49
82,Mr JULL,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I am speaking of standards that will be set by the Tribunal after a public hearing. Everyone can be involved in the public hearing. It will be a chance for the ABC, the ABC Staff Association, commercial broadcasters, public broadcasters and members of the public to go along and to discuss the standards that should apply. Standards, of course, are another point which has been brought forward. We have been accused of trying to do away with Australian f irograms and Australian content. I do not beieve that that is so. I would think that the most ardent commercial broadcaster is most interested in the development of the Australian television industry for the simple reason that Australian programs get ratings. While the Australian programs are getting ratings-the y are getting ratings right now-the commercial broadcasters are interested. If we as a Government want to make a very real contribution to improving Australian television standards, why do not we, as a Government, look at the possibility of providing subsidies for television programs? We have provided subsidies for a number of years-sinc e the time of the Gorton Government-to the film industry. We have provided money for that industry in Australia. Australia has now taken place amongst some of the world's great film producers. Our films are doing exceptionally well. Why cannot the same be done for television? One of the biggest problems that has been facing television in this country over the last few years-as was rightly mentioned by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass)-is money. It is true that the American television producers can afford to spend $500,000 on a television program. The highest amount spent in Australia on a television program is some $50,000 only. Much has been said in this House over the last few months about the quality of Australian television programs. We should provide support for the Australian teleselfvision industry to go ahead and to make quaUty programs. Wflen we talk about Australian content one would hope that we are talking about a quality program rather than a cheap quiz type program that may cost next to nothing. If we examine some of the problems that exist at the moment under the present points system, wefindthat many television programs are working with budgets of $30 and $40. That statement is not untrue because I have seen programs produced for that amount of money. That is pretty frightening. I do not think that that is really the sort of content in which we should be interested. We should encourage quaUty programs. We should be helping Australia look towards an export market for its television shows. A number of Australian television producers have managed to crack the overseas markets and they have done exceptionaUy well. One hopes that this inflow of dollars from overseas countries into the Australian networks and into the Australian production houses wiU help the industry to establish itself as one of the leading television producers in the world. That, of course, applies also to the ABC because the ABC has had some rather marvellous successes in the last few months with some of its joint productions. I refer to programs such as Rush which have been sold overseas and which have done very well indeed. Of course, this is an important point about the ABC. When the ABC is given a go and the real talent within that organisation is given an opportunity to express itself the ABC can hold its own as a leading production house in the world. This legislation is designed to help the ABC do just that. No longer must the ABC be a home for burnt out disc jockeys or some of the dropout media hacks. We must encourage the very real talent within the ABC so that it may become a leading production house in the world. I am not completely happy with all the aspects its of the Green report. Indeed, much more pubUc debate needs to be held on that particular report before many aspects of it reach the legislative process. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the Green report is being acted upon in this legislation only inasmuch as we have a new structure for the broadcasting system. In actual fact, many aspects of the Green report are highly frightening and need a great deal of public discussion and public debate before we think about bringing them into operation. I should like to warn honourable members about some of those things that are happening now. One of the aspects about which I am not particularly happy is that the Green report recommends that the Commonwealth take over all transmission facilities for radio and television in Australia. To my mind, that sort of action would be frightening. The justification for that recommendation is that with so many additional stations coming into spectrum at the moment we will have technical problems with literally hundreds of television and radio transmitters scattered across the country. This certainly has not happened overseas. I am sure it would not happen in Australia under this Administration. I believe it would be frightening if one body controlled every transmitter and tower in the nation. What would happen if industrial problems occurred during atimeof crisis? Every transmitter in Australia could be switched off and all our communications could be broken down. Other aspects similar to that are contained in the Green report and I think they ought to be looked at carefully before they finally become part of the legislative process. There is one other aspect of the current legislation, that is a result of the Green report, about which I am not 100 per cent happy. I am referring to proposed new section 11 IDA (1) (a). I ask the Minister whether, later in the debate, he can explain to the House the exact implication of that clause. It is the clause which concerns the operations of the present Department. We know that the Department is to be used for planning purposes and we know that it has a real role to play in the planning of our technical services and in the allocation of frequencies within the spectrum. Before I am completely happy with that clause, I should Uke the Minister to inform me what else is involved with the Department. To my mind this is a grey area. If this power were in the wrong hands perhaps it could involve some political interference within the media that should not occur. Perhaps the Minister could explain that clause to me later in the debate. I think that the broadcasting industry ultimately will find that many advantages are contained in this legislation before the House today. I repeat my statement to the Australian Broadcasting Commission that some of the provisions in the Bill, so far as the staff consultative bodies are concerned-for example, the opportunity for advancement, the opportunity for better remuneration and the opportunity for better negotiations as far as working conditions are concerned-ca n be of great advantage. May I say to the pubUc broadcasters too, that now is their opportunity to be recognised as a legitimate part of the broadcasting system in Australia because their licences will be on the same standard and plane as those of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the commercial television and commercial radio industries in Australia. I support the Bill.",51
83,Mr INNES,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," Iriseas the seconder of the amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) has lauded the honourable member for Bowen (Mr Jull). If he is the hope of the side then God help the Government. There are few areas of policy with which the Government has shown greater impatience than broadcasting. It has moved to impose its own stamp on the structure of broadcasting with undignified haste. It had been in office just 4 months when it set up the inquiry into broadcasting and television and within 9 months the report was presented. It was certainly fast work. To my mind it was a little too fast. The matter of Australian broadcasting is too important and complex to be specifically processed in a superficial way over a mere 6 months. In Britain the Annand Committee has taken 2 years to conduct an inquiry into a broadcasting structure which is nowhere near as complex as ours. Something in that order just might have done justice to the intricacies and thorny problems which require attention and resolution in Australia. Certainly these problems will not be resolved by this Bill. This Bill shows the same iU-conceived haste of preparation that characterises the report. The resolution of the many and varied problems of Australian broadcasting is not what the Government is worried about. The Government's intentions are political. It wants to destroy the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This Bill is interim legislation and one needs to compare its terms carefully with the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) in his second reading speech. Apparently there are a number of things left untouched by this Bill which will be the subject of later legislation. But, even allowing for some of the gaps to befilledat a later date, it is apparent that the Bill departs substantially from the recommendations of the Green report. This is interesting. After all, the Government appointed its own private inquiry and has now chosen to ignore its recommendations without explaining why or how it believes its own report to be unsatisfactory. Let us look at some of the inconsistencies. Under the Green report, the Australian Broadand casting Tribunal will set the standards to administered by the Broadcasting Council as statutory body. Yet the Bill waters down Broadcasting Council to the status of an advisory body. Who will administer the standards then? The department? We do not know, but in the abremaining sence of such vital information the Government must excuse us if we fear the worse. We find in clause 6 of the Bill that no provision made for appeals from Tribunal decisions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which Green Green recommended. We find further that the legisincreasingly lation does not require the Tribunal to hold pubMinister. Uc inquiries as recommendation 17 of the Green report proposed. Why not? What does the legislation Government have against pubUc inquiries? It has Parliament.ever an anti-democratic unwilUngness to allow the Government's intention-i people of Australia to scrutinise or even to parsome instances directly and ticipate in pubUc decision making. It should be-The main target for this control ware. The people of Australia are starting to apfine body of Australian excellence preciate the contempt in which this Government Government, used to the mindless bleatings holds them. If we look at clause 9, which alters the compohas determined sition of the Australian Broadcasting Combecome mission, wefindthat the provision flies directly out by the in the face of recommendation 32 of the Green equate report, yet it is all quite purposeless. been the convention to appoint commissioners from various States. The States of South termined Australia and Tasmania and also women are under-represented because of this Government's action in appointing Sir Henry Bland and Short. Clause 13 also provides for the Minister grant pubUc television or public radio licences. Why does the Minister want this power? Again is inconsistent with the Green recommendations which are that the Tribunal should grant all cences. So why the variation? The answer is ous. In fact certain aspects of licences issued previously were never attended to, such as Austing tralian content, a matter which was referred to quite wrongly by the honourable member for Bowman. That condition was never carried out. The Government wishes to have personal control of this aspect of broadcasting as part of its tern of poltiical subversion of Australian broadcommercial casting. If another interpretation can be placed on this state of affairs I look forward to hearing from the Minister. FinaUy, the Bill gives the Minister power to make regulations for the establishment of an Australian Broadcasting Council. Again, this is significantly different from the Green report which advocated a statutory authority for the Broadcasting Council with administrative powers. Earlier I caUed the Green report superficial said that it was hastily prepared. That is so, be but at least it contains a broad statement of a broadcasting principles. That is why the Govern the ment has ignored it. The Government is not interested infindinga means of exercising maximum political influence in broadcasting while as invisible as possible. This clearly comes through from an analysis of the Bill's dialso vergence from the recommendations of the is report. These divergences amount to a significant shift away from the structure envisaged by the report and in each case the shift is to place more power in the hands of the This Bill is one of the most insidious pieces of to come before an Australian There can be no doubt about the t is poltiical control, in in some by proxy. is the ABC, that which the of the fawning, petty tyrants in the private media, to crush. The Government has so used to having its every whim carried commercial media that it has come to sycophancy with neutraUty and true neuIt has long traUty with sociaUst bias. Firstly, there is the ominous but as yet undequestion of the relationship of the ABC to the Tribunal. The Bill gives the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal power to determine miniMr mum standards for commercial and pubUc stato tions. Whether the ABC also will be answerable to the Tribunal has yet to be determined. Yet it commercial broadcasters have argued that the ABC should no longer have the power indepenUdently to determine its own standards. If the obviGovernment does determine to subject the ABC to review by the Tribunal, it certainly will be putit at the mercy of the commercial broadcasting interests. In the composition of the proposed Broadcasting Council the commercial sector has, of course, come out on top with 4 representatives. What is likely to occur then? Can we expect the patGovernment eventually to hand over the ABC to interests? Of course we can. What better way to emasculate the ABC than the surit reptitious way it is happening under this Bill? This is precisely what the Government is aiming at. Furthermore, the Government has let its guard slip on sufficient occasions to give fuel for these fears. The Minister has indicated that when the Parliamentary Counsel has time to draft further legislation new powers will be given to the Tribunal. On 8 November or thereabouts in an interview on State of the Nation the Minister stated that the Tribunal would be much more self regulating, thus pre-empting the result of inquiry set up specifically to determine that very quesuon. It has been made very clear just what is meant by self-regulation. There would seem to be 3 elements to the concept-the setting of censorship standards, of advertising standards and of Australian content in television and radio programs. In each of these 3 areas it would seem most undesirable to hand over control to a so called self-regulating body dominated by commercial interests, but particularly in the latter 2 cases. We have been asked to contemplate the idea of a self-regulating body dominated by commercial interests establishing advertising standards in the public media. What sort of Randist madness has the Government served up for us here? The total inappropriateness of this measure is so obvious as to require no further comment. And what of this other area of selfregulation, Australian content of programs? The Government is in the process of handing the commercial interests the enormous bonus for which they have schemed and lobbied so long and in the process is dealing a mortal blow to our own brave but ailing entertainment industry. Despite what the honourable member for Bowman said, there is plenty of evidence to that effect. The Government is handing over Australian broadcasting to whet the appetites of the commercial media. That it does so is further evidence of its blind devotion to these dogmatic tenets of trendy Fraserism. The only wonder is that the commercial media appear rather reluctant to accept this marvellous gift that the Government is offering them. It is a matter of wide public knowledge that the commercial sector of the media industry launched a vigorous lobbying campaign to get Liberal members of Parliament either to get all the powers transferred to the broadcasting tribunal rather than to have any power in the Postal and Telecommunications Department or to get the legislation delayed for another year. This Government is so incompetent that it could not even carry out the wishes of its cUents accurately. The commercial media are unwilling to have any powers vested in the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, for they recognise that there will be a Minister of quite different ilk holding that position sometimeafter 1978. As of Friday, the Government changed aU this. Itfinallyworked out what the commercial interests want. Of course it is determined to act accordingly. Hence we now have an additional provision in clause 14 which, according to the Minister's statement at page 3265 of Friday's Hansard is 'designed to make it quite clear that clause 14 will not convey a right for the secretary'-the Secretary of the Postal and Telecommunications Department-'to in any way require changes in the program formats of stations'. Thus the last objection of the commercial sector has been met. It has received from this Government everything it wanted. It has received that at the expense of the pubUc broadcasting sector. I turn to the internal impUcations of this Bill for the ABC. The Government has reconstituted the Commission's membership in a way which makes a mockery of the standard practice in statutory appointments. It is obvious that this is a transparent device to remove certain people from the Commission, not, as is claimed, a mere reform of the principle of representation. New commissioners will be appointed by the Government. Until last Friday the Government had not denied speculation that staff elected Commissioner Marius Webb would not be allowed to complete his fuU term. Undoubtedly this was what was going to happen. I will clear up something for the record. Mr Webb is not the Staff Association representative. He was elected from 30 candidates nominated from all ABC unions. He represents the staff of the ABC. More than 50 per cent of the ABC staff voted in that election. There had also been reports that the Victorian Commissioner, Mrs Benn, and the Western Australian Commissioner, Professor Harding, would also have their terms curtailed. Only in the face of strong and sustained lobbying by ABC staff members has the Government capitulated on this point and made provision for all the present commissioners to serve out their remaining term. The Government is to be commended for making this smaU concession at least. It was a rather belated effort and highUghted the weakness of its original intention. In this part of the legislation, both as originaUy drafted and as presented now, we are again treated to an admirable exhibition of the subtlety with which this Government goes about pursuing its aims. The end is still the same- a totally reconstituted commission, stacked by the Government's hand picked men. The Government will not be running the ABC. will do so by proxy, by making sure that 'right' people, people of its own choosing, people on whom the Government can depend to make politically amenable decisions, will be running the show. The Bill should be placed in its proper context. Its context is that of a political vendetta aimed poliucally neutral public broadcasting. Its target is the ABC. This Bill is only one of a series attempts aimed at bludgeoning the ABC to the Government's will. The Bill needs to be in the context of the appointment of the Government's faithful hatchet man, Sir Henry Bland, as Chairman of the ABC. Unfortunately for the Government, Sir Henry is not particularly disradio? criminate at whom he aims his hatchet. The Bill needs to be seen in the context of a sustained propaganda campaign aimed at destroying the integrity of the ABC's current affairs division. needs to be seen in the context of drastic cuts in the ABC's budget, cuts so severe that members and of the Australian Journalists Association a employed by the ABC at Canberra were able to list 14 examples of impairment of broadcasung services as a result of cuts, when they met to take their action last Sunday. Finally, it needs to be seen in the text of continuous administrative bungling aimed at the slow wearing down of staff morale. One does not wonder at the concern apprehension of many of the staff and supporters of the ABC when one is mindful of the stateprogram ments by 2 Ministers, Mr Nixon and Senator Withers, and certain National Country Party officials that the ABC is to be cleaned up, parto ticularly in the current affairs broadcasting I want to discuss one aspect of governmental mismanagement of broadcasting in Australia, and that is ethnic radio in which honourable members know I have a long standing interest. It is well known that the control of been the subject of an empire building feud between the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. It is widely known that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs met the Chairman of the ABC and other senior ABC executives in mid-October when the Minister's gentle overtures were deftly and subtly rebuffed by Sir Henry, particularly on the matter of the appointment of a national ethnic broadcasting council to advise the ABC. At that meeting Sir Henry rightly pointed out that, despite the Minister's assurance that his interest in the council would cease with its appointment and that he would be prepared to consult the ABC about the appointees, the fact that the apIt pointees were the Minister's would be seen by the the public as an intrusion on the political independence of the ABC. Moreover, if it were known that the Minister intended to have no interest in the council once it were appointed, suspicions of political influences could be strengthened and there would be the implied reflection that the ABC could not be trusted to at appoint the right sort of council. There is also the consideration, as I believe Sir Henry pointed out of to the Minister, that normally any body desiring advice selected its own advisers and that this is placed the long standing practice of the ABC. What should be the ultimate fate of ethnic The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is probably not the appropriate authority as it is presently constituted. The Department is almost exclusively a Department of It Immigration and has little to do with ethnic affairs as such. It has a heading on its stationery, that is about where it starts and finishes. It is moot point as to whether the ABC is the appropriate seat of location for ethnic radio. Ideally ethnic radio would have been more suitably located in its own statutory authority, as I have argued previously in this place. Given that ethnic radio is to be located in the ABC, there are a number of safeguards which should be insisted and upon. For instance, each ethnic community desiring to participate should be able to elect its committee and chairperson. The size of each program committee and the method of its election should be left to each ethnic community determine for itself and to organise. An ethnic area. broadcasting council should be established in each State, with some representatives from the ABC, but the majority should be elected from each of the community broadcasting committees. The ethnic broadcasting council should be responsible for formulation of State policy on ethethnic radio has nic broadcasting. These proposals add up to a substantial degree of autonomy for ethnic broadcasting in the ABC. I am very worried about the implications of this legislation for the autonomy of ethnic broadcasting. The ABC is soon to become subject to a Broadcasting Tribunal which will be dominated by commercial broadcasting interests who have already shown what they feel about ethnic radio. Too much is left unsaid by this legislation for us to know the exact nature of this relationship, but the portents seem ominous for the ABC and, thereafter, ethnic broadcasting. I think the purpose of this Bill is clear. It is an iniquitous document. I urge the House to deal with it accordingly and to carry the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong.",52

I regret that I was able to hear all of the contributions made members of the Opposition this afternoon, but seems to me that they have some idea that there is something sinister about this legislation. course all of their words amount to suspicion speculation. Let them for a moment have an open mind and listen to a few facts they accept the facts they will not be concerned with speculation and suspicion. First, the Government decided in April to inibudget tiate the Green inquiry. I was able to present reduction some recommendations to the Government early tion was much in October. During the period between April and board cuts in thesmaller October about 600 submissions were presented of 10 per cent. It was a much to the inquiry. Ample opportunity was organisations and people throughout Australia ments and instrumentalities. It is knowndepartto make their views known. They did so, and ABC and to Sir Henry Bland, as it is known their submissions were valuable. During that period quite a number of informal useful disevery cussions were held with interested parties. I find they that despite that, despite the report was tabled in the Parliament some weeks sidered on its merits ago and despite the fact that the Government's us. intentions have been known for some weeks people such as the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes), who spoke last in the debate, are still making erroneous statements. The honourable member for Melbourne is apparfor ently concerned that the same rules will not apply to public broadcasting as will apply to commercial broadcasting. Let me state quite clearly that the legislation we are now discussing is in part transitional legislation and that broadcasting will go through exactly the same format as commercial broadcasting. It will have exactly the same requirement to go before the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for open and public inquiries as will commercial broadcasting. We propose to disband the Australian BroadDepartment. casting Control Board, leave the with the quasi-judicial powers of licensing, the renewal of licences and, if necessary, the ability to revoke licences. One of thefirstjobs it will will be to hold an open public inquiry into the questions of standards and self-regulation. It be open to everyone and every organisation in Australia to make comment on those questions because it is desirable, if we can move towards self-regulation, to see whether this arrangement is available and acceptable to Australians. Planning will go back to the Postal and Telecommunications Department but we have quite ensured that the Department wiU not be to interfere with the programming of comradio stations. That has never been the concept. To ensure absolutely that this is the unthrust of the Government's poUcy the amendby ment about which I spoke in the House last it Friday has been included. A lot of utter nonsense has been spoken- I regret to say even by the Of Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam)and about the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It remains independent and its integrity is not at because once risk or under threat. We would reject the suggestion that the ABC should be separate and apart from the Government's economic poUcy. This year the ABC's was decreased from $138m to $129m, a of $9m or about 6 per cent. This reducthan the overall across the Budget which were of the order smaller percentage given to than cuts in many other government to the to other government instrumentaUty, that can come back to the Government with a fact that the Green submission able.

The enlarged Commission will allow for that and all the present Commissioners to serve their full terms of office. I never said that it would be otherwise. Reports to the contrary have all been based upon speculation and not upon any statements by the Government. I would have thought public that the Opposition would have been pleased with the decision to estabUsh the Broadcasting Council because this instrumentality will enable liaison to take place in a co-operative and consultative way between all the elements of broadcasting, from the national network, the public broadcasters, the commercial broadcasters to the It is desirable that the Council can new Tribunal comment on planning. The whole thrust of this legislation is to take do politics out of broadcasting. The Minister will no longer have therightto decide as to who gets liwill cences. Thefindingof the Tribunal will be the determining factor. The autonomy and integrity of ethnic radio and Radio Australia will be maintained because they will both be remaining within the Australian Broadcasting Commission.",56

90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 4 measures? There being no objection I will allow that course to be followed.,58
91,Mr HURFORD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"These 4 Bills were introduced into this House only last Wednesday afternoon, after my Party's last meeting. I must place on record my objection to such complicated legislation being hurried through this House. If anything, the drafting and introduction to this House should have been given high priority after the Budget announcements, because these income tax Bills arise from the Budget. It is all part of the disarray which we have witnessed over the last few minutes, not only in relation to the Government's economic policies but also in relation to the management of this House. I must admit that the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) gave me advance notice of the subjects of the Bills, but this has been no substitute for studying in great detail the actual wording of the legislation. Furthermore, there has been no time for the community to contact honourable members on both sides of the House with objections to the wording of this legislation. What I now have to say is subject to those earlier comments. The Opposition may have amendments to move to any one of these 4 pieces of legislation in the Senate or later on after the community has had time to absorb what is in these Bills. Although critical in a positive way of some aspects of the legislation, the Australian Labor Party Opposition is not opposing any one of the 4 Bills. Before referring to the specific measures which the Government has introduced in the Bills before us I intend to comment on aspects of the Government's general performance in the area of taxation. One of the great myths that the Government, aided and abetted by its media supporters, has attempted to sell the Australian people is that it is actually lowering the burden of taxation upon individual taxpayers. Nothing could be further from the truth. We all recall the great fanfare with which tax indexation was introduced in one go. The Income Tax Treasurer spoke loud and long of the $1 billion Less endowment which was being put back into the pockets of taxpayers.",58
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I do not intend to ask the House again to come to order. If honourable members want to carry on conversations they can go outside the chamber to do it. It is not possible to hear completely what the honourable member for Adelaide is saying. He is making some comments on the Bills and I heard him say that they are rather important measures. Even though we are in the closing stages of the session I suggest that honourable members continue to extend to the honourable member the courtesy which should be extended to all members of this House.,58
93,Mr HURFORD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Predictably, the Treasurei made very Uttle of the tax rises which he announced at the same time as he talked about tax indexation. However, the man in the street was soon to feel the effect of the Medibank levy and the phasing down of the home interest deductibility scheme. It is incredible that any government which, in its Budget and associated measures, reduces a family s take home pay by $300 could have the gall to claim thatits Budget was the first in 3 years not to raise the indirect tax burden. Now that the fuU impact of tax indexation and the Medibank changes have been felt we can obtain an indication of the tax burdens borne by Australians under the 1975-76 Labor Government tax scales and under the 1976-77 Liberal-National Country Party Government tax scales. In the edition of the Taxpayer of 30 October the editorial page is headed 'Despite so-called full tax indexation personal taxes are much higher now leaving less spending money than before'. In the body of the journal calculations are given for a taxpayer with a wife and 2 children. After adjustment for higher child endowment, health taxes and inflation we find that in 1976-77 the family that had earned $10,000 for 1975-76 has had its spending power reduced by $5.15 a week. I ask leave to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the tax comparisons, the source being the Taxpayer of October 1976.",58
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.

95,Mr HURFORD,TAXATION COMPARISON,"Of course, those people who find, in addition to the above, that their housing mortgage interest deductibility is being phased down are in a worse position still. Thetypesof calculations to which I have referred above have been done by numerous groups. All these people reach the same conclusions. The net effect of the taxation measures introduced by this Government has been to raise, not lower, taxation. For example, the authors of the Econometer in the National Times of 2 October conclude as follows: . . . by June next year, when inflation has up and the temporary benefits of tax indexation have nearly eroded, almost everybody, except low wage around $ 100 weekly with lots of kiddies, will lose. I might add that with the inflation now to be expected as a result of this disastrous devaluation what the Econometer authors wrote on 2 October will be made even more true. I am glad that low wage earners with farriilies to support are exempted, but they are the only ones. I plore the misrepresentation perpetrated Australian community to the effect that everyone has benefited from tax changes. This just is not true. These facts speak for themselves. This Government has, as the Treasurer would put it, in the totality of the situation raised and not lowered taxation. It really should not come as surprise that the Government and its influential supporters should attempt to hoodwink the pubnificant lic into accepting the myth that taxation has reduced. After all, were not the myths surroundwent ing support for Medibank and wage indexation, promises of 6 to 7 per cent economic growth in the Government's first year and of cutting the deficit without cutting essential public works with equal gusto? And to the same extent they have turned out to be sheer myths and totally scheme. untrue. Perhaps the Treasurer and even the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) secretly realise that their Government has increased the tax den. After all, they both continually refer to Government's intention to cut taxation. It is difficult to reconcile the Government's call consumers to go out and spend now with their hints that tax cuts are just around the corner. Surely it is reasonable to expect that the sumer will delay his purchase until he finds just how much he is to get out of the tax cut. This is just another example of the inconsistency which pervades this Government's thinking. It creating a climate which can only exacerbate the uncertainty many consumers feel. Perhaps the best advice that can be given to the Treasurer he roams the country hinting at tax changes comes in the form of the quaint but effective colloquial expression: 'Put up or shut up.' Any public debate regarding taxation invariably comes around to international comparisons of tax burdens. In recent times many groups, including the Government, have tended to project the impression that by international standards Australians are very highly taxed. This is probably an opportune moment to set the record straight on this matter. In the report of the Asprey taxation review committee an intersent wages national comparison of total taxes as a probeen portion of gross national product for the year people on 1971 is given. In this comparison Australia ranked 16th out of 22 countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, that is, only six of the OECD countries surveyed had lower total taxation levels than did Australia. By 1973 the position had changed little. The publication, Revenue Statistics of OECD Member Countries, revealed that of the de23 countries surveyed only 5 countries had lower on the overall tax levels than Australia. Starting from an acceptance of Australia's real position in the international taxation league, there is of course much room for reform in our taxation system. The report of the Asprey coma mittee is arichsource of material on this subject. The Labor Government introduced a very sigreform in the replacement of concesbeen sional deductions with the rebate scheme. This a long way towards restoring a degree of the vertical equity which had been eroded through the use of concessional tax deductions. It is to be hoped that the Government looks long sold and hard before it even considers bending to interest group pressure to alter the Labor rebate Senior members of the Government have hinted a number of times that in Australia income taxes are too high and indirect taxes on goods and services too low. Indeed, by interburnational standards Australia does lean more the heavily on income tax for revenue than do most other countries. However, this very fact does not for mean that we should blindly change the emphasis of our taxation system. Income taxes rank much higher on the grounds of vertical equity conthan do taxes on goods and services-indirec t out taxes. On the other hand, such income taxes do result in high rates being applied at the margin and the consequent high marginal tax rates on is high incomes are alleged, by conventional wisdom, to be a disincentive to work effort. I say 'by conventional wisdom' because there is little hard as evidence on this subject. Indeed, studies of tax incidence have been sadly neglected on the whole. So far there is as much evidence to show that people work harder to compensate for take home pay as there is to show that they less hard if their net benefits are not great enough. In looking at tax reform it is important that we do know the actual impact any tax changes may have on people's incentives to work harder. I repeat my hope that more work will done on that subject. Mr Kevin Cairns-That is a very important ostensiblyAdjustments point.",59
96,Mr HURFORD,TAXATION COMPARISON,"As the honourable member who for Lilley says, it is a very important point. More evidence needs to be collected so that we build human our policies on sound facts, not just on beliefs. It is important also that any move towards a wider use of taxes on goods and sermend vices recognise that these are in fact consumption taxes which do not discriminate between incomes in their impact. Their wider use must coupled with moves to lessen the burden on low income earners. Most indirect taxes are regresBut sive in nature but qualifications must be made the general statement. Indeed, in Treasury Taxand ation Paper No. 5, published in October and entitled Commonwealth Taxation of Goods and Services, a number of means of offsetting regressiveness of indirect taxes are canvassed. These include special modifications to the income tax system and appropriate adjustments to social service payments. As an example, in Sweden the trend to greater reliance on broadly based income taxation has been accompanied compensatory changes in their income tax and social service structures. Any informed debate on taxation levels will include a recognition of the other side of the coin-the services provided by government to expenditure. Lowering taxes is one of the few things a politician can suggest which is guaraninforcement teed popular acclaim. However, it must be recogtion nised that there are many goods and services which individuals aspire to possess but which individuals it is beyond their scope to provide. For example, no matter how much taxation lowered to allow people supposedly to spend they choose, the restrictions on any individual group of individuals being able better road or any other community facility are such that the task becomes impossible. The Government is the proper medium through in which demands such as these may be fulfilled. Taxation plays an important role in their vision. It is a vehicle of collective payment. Recently the newspaper the Australian ran interview with the Treasurer in which, among other things, taxation reform was mentioned. In less its leader article on the same day that same work newspaper eloquently put the case against our present levels of taxes. To put the debate in perspective, however, I should like to quote from a letter to that newspaper from Judy Suttor, the policy officer of the Australian Council of Social be Service in Sydney. This letter was prompted by the editorial and read in part: to the personal income tan system which gives individuals greater' independence' in spending power to meet their own needs do nothing to assist those are not wage earners and those whose income (be it wages or a pension) is inadequate to enable them to live decently and disguises the fact that important welfare and services are either not available or become effectively vague inaccessible to the public who need them. That is the close of my quotation but I recomthe full contents of that letter to anyone interested in more than the peripheral aspects of .a debate on taxation. I agree that personal be income taxes must not be allowed to rise so high that incentive is killed and productivity suffers. I believe that most Australians have a social to conscience. They want to live in a fair society, understand that a fair amount of progressive 1974 taxation is needed to achieve this. the As well as being a source of revenue, taxation in all its forms is an integral part of a government's intruments with which it may influence the level of economic activity. Different taxes have different speeds and extents of influence. For example, indirect tax changes are recognised by as having a faster and more substantial impact on activity than an equivalent amount of direct tax changes. Lowering indirect taxes has the added advantage of directly lowering the price level. It is obvious that in this area the Government has failed to use wisely policy options open it. A lowering of indirect taxes, as suggested by the Labor Opposition, could have led to a reofthe downward trend in the inflarate included by overseas influences. An obvious fall in the inflation rate in the December as quarter, rather than a substantialrise,as we must expect, would have gone a long way towards is restoring economic stability. In addition, as indirect tax cuts would have stimulated conor sumer spending, thereby helping to get our econto provide a omy moving again. I refer now to the specific measures introduced the Bills before the House. In all there are 4 Bills. Three of them, the Income Tax Assessment proAmendment Bill (No. 3) 1976, the Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Bill 1976 and the Loan (Drought Bonds) Amendment Bill an 1976, are concerned primarily with giving effect to proposals announced in the Budget. The fourth Bill, the Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Bill 1976, declares the rates of tax payable by companies and superannuation funds for the 1976-77 financial year. As explained by the Treasurer the rates of tax set are the same as those established in the 1975-76 Budget for that income year. The Opposition does not oppose the Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Bill 1976. It could hardly do anything else as the 1975-76 Budget was a Labor Budget. It was a thoroughly satisfactory Budget and it is a tragedy to know that it was tampered with because the tampering, including the cuts in government spending and all that has happened since the beginning of this year, has given rise to the disastrous effects on consumer confidence in this country which have flowed over to affect the confidence of overseas investors. This has given rise to the terrible consequences of this massive devaluation with all the horrendous policies that go with it, about which we have so far heard only a part. Considering the damage that has been done to the economy since the strategy of the 1975-76 Labor Budget was destroyed by this Government, it is a matter of deep regret that the company and superannuation fund tax rates are one of the few measures from that Budget still allowed to influence the economy. While on the subject of company taxation, I would counsel the Government to be careful in introducing its stock valuation adjustment scheme. As yet, details of the scheme are only sketchy. I heard one or two questions being asked in the Senate today, even from the Government side, requesting more details of the scheme, but the Government is not giving; it is not telling us more about the scheme. However, it is hoped that when any decision is made, adequate time is allowed for discussion of the Bills involved, time for all interested parties to comment and to have their comments taken into account before legislation is passed. In my opening remarks on these Bills I stated that I hoped that such time would be given for these measures because there is no more complicated legislation than income tax legislation. I do not blame any of the officers concerned at all, whether they are attached to the Parliamentary Counsel or to the Taxation Office. It is a question of priorities to be set by government. the whole country ought to know that there has not been time for people outside this Parliament to absorb the wording of the legislation and to be able to counsel members of Parliament about the changes that are being made and to show just how these changes will affect them. It would probably be preferable if the Government would, in the case of the legislation relating to the so-called Mathews proposals, actually present the Bills to the House and allow a considerable time to elapse before they are debated, something which I hoped would have happened to these 4 Bills. A series of statements from the Treasurer, as happened with the investment allowance legislation, probably would allow a repeat of the confusion surrounding that particular investment allowance legislation. We want to see the actual Bill, in the case of the Mathews proposals, in plenty oftimeto avoid the confusion that has arisen in the case of the investment allowance proposals, confusion which may arise out of these 4 Bills before us now. I turn to the measures contained in Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 3) 1976. Two of the measures, those dealing with transitional provisions for visiting experts and with mining in Papua New Guinea, are associated with arrangements made under the Labor Government, and are not opposed. There in also a technical drafting change involving a new definition of a resident of Australia. As explained by the Treasurer in his second reading speech: 'The need for this change arises out of the alteration of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund.' The Opposition accepts the need for this change which is made in clause 3 of the Bill. Clause 4 of the Bill allows for the exemption from tax of income derived by the Thalidomide Foundation. This represents a welcome change in a Government decision. Previously the Government had decided to make grants to the Foundation rather than to exempt income from taxation. An original grant of $150,000 had been made. Considering the amount of compensation which has been made or is in the process of being made, the grant was clearly inadequate. Under these arrangements the income that each child receives from the foundation will be exempt from taxation. This measure by the Government reflects the attitude of the Labor Party when in government. The Opposition supports the Government in this measure with regard to the taxation of the income of the Foundation. I repeat that I am glad that the Government has belatedly adopted Labor's more generous thinking on this measure of taxation of income for In this case thalidomide victims. Clauses 6 to 8 and 31 to 36 of this Bill enable the setting up of a scheme of income equalisation deposits. Deposits lodged by primary producers with the Commissioner of Taxation under the income equalisation scheme are to be allowable as tax deductions, while withdrawals of deposits for which deductions have been allowed will included as assessable income for tax purposes the taxation years in which those deposits are redeemed. The recommendation for this measure comes from the report of the Industries Assistance Commission titled 'Rural Income Fluctuations-Certain Taxation Measures'. report was handed down as a result of a reference from the Labor Government. The object of the measure is to reinforce the existing tax averaging system for primary producers. need for such schemes arises out of the higher burdens which people withfluctuatingincomes bear under the progressive tax scale. It is felt people who, over a given number of years, ceive equal income should pay equivalent amounts of tax on that income. The Opposition has considered carefully the possibilities abuse of this scheme and is satisfied that decision. sufficient safeguards exist to minimise such abuse. It also investigated the possibility that the IAC recommendations should be followed more closely, the IAC having recommended that only the investment component, that is the non-tax component of the income equalisation depositsthe IEDs as they will become known-shoul have interest payable on it and that the rate interest should be the medium term bond rate. The rationale for such a recommendation by the IAC was that under the present scheme being instituted by the Government, the effective interest rate received by investors varies with their marginal tax rates. The higher the income, the greater the tax rate saved and, thus, the greater the return. However, the Opposition is convinced that there are considerable adminisat trative difficulties involved in implementing letter of the LAC report, more equitable though its recommendations might be. Bearing this mind and also the willingness of primary prowould ducers, the lower income primary producers well as the higher income producers, to accept this scheme, the Opposition supports this legisto lation. If there are abuses and greater inequities in the implementation of the scheme than are now envisaged, and knowing that the vast number of farmers themselves seek equity and legislation realise that one man's gain is another man's loss, the Opposition shall seek reforms. Clauses 9, 10 and 35 of the Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 3) 1976 refer to changes in taxation arrangements for private companies. The retention allowance in respect of trading business income available to private companies for undistributed income tax purposes is to be increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, the increasefirstapplying in respect of the 1975-76 be financial year. Broadly speaking, private comin panies, as defined for taxation purposes, are subjected to additional tax at a 50 per cent rate to the extent that those companies do not make a sufficient distribution to shareholders in the relevant year out of after-tax income, as reduced This by specific retention allowances. This move should give a measure of relief to private companies who play an important role as employers in the economy. As it is designed to help small The businesses, unlike many of the Government's tax other business incentives, the Opposition supports this change to the tax laws. I make the obthat servation, however, that any improvement in the recash flow position that private companies may gain from this move will assuredly be eroded by increases in interest rates and inflation which will for stem from the Government's recent devaluation As I have pointed out on another occasion, the draconian monetary and fiscal policies which inevitably must follow and are following the massive devaluation hit the medium and smaller businessmen as well as the wage and salary d earners rather than those who can, of course, of borrow at blue chip rates and particularly those who can borrow overseas. At the sametimeas the Government has moved to increase the retention allowance it is withdrawing excess distribution provisions. Previously if a private company distributed dividends greater than the stipulated amount the excesses were allowed to be carried forward to later years to reduce the amount which must be distributed in those later years in order to avoid undistributed profits tax a 50 per cent penalty rate. This concession is the being removed. The Opposition was concerned that any benefit that companies may receive in from the increase in the retention allowance be offset by this aspect of the measure. It as has also been brought to our attention that insufficienttimehas been allowed for companies adjust their affairs tofitin with the legislation. The Australian Labor Party does not like which has a retrospective element in it as this legislation could have. However, on balance we have accepted the argument that the previous system was open to wide abuse and despite elaborate legal measures such avoidance could not be countered. Also it appears that very few genuine cases will be disadvantaged by this or move. As the retention allowance is being raised it is an opportune moment to take this action. We trust that all those who have access distributions in their companies arising from genuine transactions and not from tax avoidance schemes will be able to use their excess distribution by the of next April and thus not lose the benefits. The remaining measures in the Bill concern aid given through taxation concessions to the mining industry. Two of these measures, firstly the allowance for more rapid write-off of resources development expenditure of petroleum mining pose. companies and for those expenditures and explothe ration expenditures to be deductible against income from any source and, secondly, for eral transport facilities to be deductible over either 10 or 20 years and to include certain port expenses, are not being opposed by the OppocU sition. Our appropriate caucus committee has examined these measures in depth and has cepted the need for them. Special risk factors volved in petroleum mining exploration and need for development of our natural resources are sufficient grounds for the Opposition not oppose these concessions. Although the Oppothe sition is not opposing the other measures relating to milling operations, namely the allowance for more rapid write-off of development expenditures of general mining companies, we do raise some doubts. The Government has decided that deductions which currently are allowable over the estimated life of mine or field will for expenditures be allowable on reducing balances by reference to a maximum life of 5 years instead of the present 25 years. This will have the of increasing the minimal annual rate of deducthings. tion from 4 per cent to 20 per cent. The Industries Assistance Commission recommendation on this issue was that the depreciation should be over the Ufe of the mine or the asset or 15 years ever is the least. It implied a straight line method of depreciation which is also the method recdirectly ommended for the tax system in general by the Asprey report. The Opposition feels that the Government measures are excessively generous. However we do see the need for the existing coning cessions to be altered in the miners' favour. close by saying that these mining measures will be covered by the shadow Minister for national resources.",60
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION COMPARISON,Order! The other honourable member'stimehas expired. Debate (on motion by Mr Viner) adjourned. NA Ministerial Statement,63
98,Mr VINER,COUNCIL FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"by leave-I inform the House that Council for Aboriginal Affairs is winding up its activities and at its own suggestion terminated 30 November after nearly 9 years of valuable end service to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait people and to successive Commonwealth governments. I need hardly say that its disbandment in no way impUes a diminution of the Government's resolve to lift Aboriginal standards of well-being or a pause in theflowof or real consideration towards that purIt signifies only that in the joint opinion of Council, the Government, and representative Aboriginal organisations an advisory and conminsultative task which was always envisaged as transient has come to an end and can now properly pass to others. The termination of the Councoincides with the receipt and study of the report of the Hiatt Committee of Inquiry into the acfuture organisation and role of the National inAboriginal Consultative Committee. This seems the an appropriatetime,while the Government is considering the future style of consultation with to the Aboriginal people, to make the break with Council which was responsible for much of the consultative process at an earUer stage. The Council for Aboriginal Affairs is a most unusual body set up in unique circumstances to do a job for which, in any case, there seems to new have been no precedent, but which grew more and more urgent and complicated. The late Harold Holt, as Prime Minister, in November effect 1967 commissioned the Council to do certain It was to oversee the establishment of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs; to advise the Government upon the formation of national policies to give effect to the new obligations whichimposed on the Commonwealth by the 1967 referendum in respect of Aborigines; to consult with Aboriginal people and organisations about their wishes and felt needs; to become the avenue of Aboriginal approaches to Government; to estabUsh and ensure good workrelationships at the official level between I Commonwealth and State instrumentalities in the Aboriginalfield;and as far as practicable to co-ordinate the working out of the then highly variable policies and administrative practices throughout Aboriginal Australia. Subsequently, duties were added. In 1971 the Council was made responsible for recommending the acquisition by the Commonwealth of land for Aboriginal immunities; in 1973 for watching over the interests of the Torres Strait Islanders in negotiations over the Australia-Papua New Guinea border; and later in the same year for discussing with officials of the Queensland the Government possible amendments of Acts of that State Parliament affecting Aboriginals and on Islanders. I feel that I should say, though for reasons into which I need not at the moment enter, these tasks were made the harder by the informahty of the Council's position. It was not given either statutory or even chartered recognition and, for its first 5 years-until late in 1973-ofte n had to depend for its effect only upon the rational appeal of its proposals and the force of its personalities. Perhaps fortunately, each of the 3 members-D r H. C. Coombs, Emeritus Professor W. E. H. Stanner and Mr B. G. Dexter-brough t to the assignment a long experience of the inner workings of Government and public authorities, a large fund of specialised knowledge, a capacity to act jointly, and a remarkably similar vision of their task. If honourable members who are in a position to do so will cast their minds back to 1967 they will, I am sure, agree with me that there have been many significant changes in the Aboriginal scene. These reflect the Council's influence. It may well turn out to be the case that its greatest contribution has been its insistent confidence that the Aboriginal people, if given a chance, could demonstrate their capacity to manage their own affairs. I would attribute largely to the Council's tireless efforts to go to the Aborigines and to listen to their own statement of their viewpoint and wishes the present healthy fact that everywhere within Australia Aborigines now approach Government without inhibition or hesitation, speak up for themselves in no uncertain way, and are quick to demand the full measure of their constitutional rights. This is not the occasion for me to attempt to judge other respects in which the Council has performed its duties. When the Office of Aboriginal Affairs became a department, and in the second half of 1973, began to develop the full capacities of a department, the Council has withdrawn to the sidelines of policyplanning and day-by-day administration. More recently, it has withdrawn into the background and has concentrated on particularly critical matters of policy and on projects referred to it by the Minister or the Permanent Head. I should like to place on Parliamentary record the Government's appreciation of the services of each of the 3 members of the Council. I believe that Dr Coombs' contribution as Chairman is among the most significant of his many public services. The third member of the Council, Mr Dexter, has been Council's Executive Member and in that capacity and as Director of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and since 1973 Secretary and Permanent Head of the first Department of Aboriginal Affairs has ably carried out an onerous task and lead a dedicated staff. Professor Stanner, in addition to playing a full part in the work of the Council and contributing particularly from his great anthropological knowledge, also acted a Special Adviser to several Standing Committees of this House and will be well known to many members. The Government hopes to retain the part-time services of Dr Coombs and Professor Stanner on a consultancy basis for particular tasks on which the Minister or Permanent Head feels a need for their special experience.",63
99,Mr LES JOHNSON,COUNCIL FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"by leaveTrie comments made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) to a large extent strike a common chord of approval with the Opposiuon. His remarks related to the proposed disbandment of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs. The Labor Government leaned heavily on the Council for Aboriginal Affairs for advice during the period from December 1972 to 11 November 1975 when the great policy initiatives about Aboriginal affairs were being taken. The calibre of the Council's members was and is unique. If I recall correctly, it is intended that this Council will cease to function on 30 November. Dr Coombs was its Chairman. As all honourable members are aware and as most Australians know, he is one of Australia's most distinguished public servants. He has made many valuable contributions in addition to the role he played as Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs. After all, he was the Chairman of the Reserve Bank, Chairman of the Australian Council of the Arts, Chancellor of the Australian National University, Chairman of the Board of the Commonwealth Bank of Austraha, Governor of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Director-General of Post-War Reconstruction and adviser to governments from 1947. He has given about 30 years distinguished service to this country. I cannot help but feel that he showed a greater genuine devotion in his role as Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs because of his interest in Aboriginal affairs than he did in his other distinguished roles. Professor W. E. H. Stanner also was a member of the Council. He certainly is regarded as Australia's most distinguished anthropologist. Professor Stanner came to note early in the piece. In 1968 his Boyer Lectures on Aboriginal affairs entitled After the Dreaming proved the most enlightening and influential work of its type ever accomplished. Mr Barrie Dexter was the third member of that Council which it is proposed to abolish. He is, of course, a senior and a competent public servant who was previously a diplomat- a profession to which, I understand, he intends to return in the near future. He was the adrnirdstrative arm of this body. Even before it became the Council for Aboriginal Affairs-i the old days when it was the Office for Aborigiregard. nal Affairs- Mr Dexter was the adrninistrative arm of that body. This troika or this trinity, depending on what attitude one takes, has been invoked periodically to look at and advise upon very difficult problems. Successive Ministerswas certainly no exception-foun d the Council's contributions invaluable. The trio came together 9 years ago to give effect to the decision of Australian people made by referendum to grant power and responsibiUty for Aboriginal affairs the Australian Parliament. This objective, large degree, has been accomplished and the Council for Aboriginal Affairs has fulfilled useful role in negotiating the transfer of bility and personnel from State government's the Australian Government. Its efforts culnunated in the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act 1973. That does not sound much when one mentions it as cursorily as that but it involved a great deal highly diplomatic and sensitive negotiations. Successive governments have, to a large degree, given effect to the wish of the people. But I this opportunity to express regret that in recent times there has been a departure from this objecan tivity, particuarly in regard to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill in which the Commonwealth appears to be abrogating of some of its responsibiUty by passing it over to Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. The difficulties that the Council encountered in its efforts to transfer power and responsibiUty from the States to the Commonwealth are worth mentioning. GeneraUy, the States complied-in fact it is fair to say that all States compUed after little time-wit h the exception of the Queensland Government which bucked the will of the Pty people. Even the very accomplished Council for Aboriginal Affairs could not improve on or make inroads into this situation. As a sequel, it necessary for the Australian Government to introduce the Racial Discrimination Act and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders approval (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act which was assented to on 19 June 1975. The Council has done a great deal towards providing advice in respect of the structuring of the Department Aboriginal Affairs. My colleague, the honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant), who obviously should be given the opportunity to speak on this matter the first Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Labor Government-that government of innovaArnhem tion in respect of Aboriginal affairs-woul d able to indicate the extent to which the Council n was able to make useful contributions in this It would take a longtimeto enunciate all the Council's activites. I do not want to take up the time of the House. All members of the Council rendered advice to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. I During my time as Minister and subsequently, the Council has rendered invaluable service in regard to safeguarding the interests of Torres the Strait Islanders in its negotiations with Papua New Guinea. That part of its operations was not to so difficult, but in respect of steering a middle to a course keeping in mind the Commonwealth's interest, the interests of the Torres Strait a very Islanders and the interest of the Queensland responsiGovernment, the Council certainly demonto strated its outstanding sensitivities and capacities. I think the Minister will acknowledge- I readUy do as a former Minister-the work that of was carried out by the Council in identifying the trend towards outstations, particularly on the part of the people of Arnhem Land who were take seeking to return in large numbers and large groups to their traditional lands. Of course, it is important matter for the Australian Government to identify the justification of and reasons for this movement to outstations for the purpose estabUshing the extent to which it is approprithe ate for an Australian Government to support, encourage and, indeed, underwrite this movement towards outstations. A great deal of services will foUow in the wake of such a move. The Council also has assisted the Government in regard to the intrusion of miners into Aborigia nal lands. It has provided advice about the effect of mining development on the part of Nabalco Ltd at Gove and Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd at Groote Eylandt in respect of the manganese deposits. Subsequently, the Council examined the was Weipa situation where Comalco Ltd is involved. It also has examined the Aurukun position where the a new consortium is seeking now to obtain the of the Aboriginal people to exploit the lease which has been granted for ruining purposes. Valuable reports have been provided by the Council in relation to Yuendumu- I might of just mention as an aside that this involves the Tanami question and the quest of the Aboriginal people who Uve there, a quest which has been denied by this Government up to date, for the as granting of land in their Aborginal areas-and in the Hooker Creek, and there was a report on Land in 1975. The Council made a be valuable submission to the Ranger inquiry about the impact of mining on Aboriginal communities in 1976. Over the years the honourable member for Wills, Senator Cavanagh and I took advice about the initiatives of the Labor Party in respect of the establishment of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the establishment of Aboriginal housing associations, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, the Aboriginal Loans Commission, the Aboriginal secondary grants schemes, the Aboriginal study grants scheme, the Aboriginal Legal Service, the Aboriginal Medical Service and the Aboriginal Arts Board. Now we come to the winding up of the Council and I want to say that I believe this marks a milestone in the progress of Aboriginal people. The Labor Party objective was and still is to establish and dignify the National Aboriginal Congress. I am pleased that the Government is accepting the lead it was given in that regard. The Council, like everything else, is not without its faults, but I believe it served its purpose. May it rest in peace. Together with that peace may its members have a sense of justifiable gratification for a job well done, one which I think will advance the interests of the Aboriginal people.",64

105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COUNCIL FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,Order! It is no good the honourable member for Griffith and the honourable member for Wills holding a battle royal across the amphitheatre. It is quite wrong of them to do so. I ask both honourable members to behave themselves while the Clerk is reading the next message. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed.,66
106,Mr SAINSBURY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I would like to say first of all that I appreciate being able to follow the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) in this debate. (Quorum formed) It was significant that in his speech the honourable member mentioned that we had had very little chance to reflect on this tax legislation. It is very interesting to see now that members of the Labor Party do not want us to debate it either. I was saying that it is a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Adelaide who is the Labor Party spokesman on Treasury matters. During the 12 months I have been here I have sometimes wondered who is the Labor Party's spokesman on Treasury matters. It would appear today that because the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) is away the honourable member for Adelaide at last has his chance. He does have an agile mind and I respect it, but I do not respect the shifts in policy that he seems to adopt. At question time this morning we saw again that he does shift in his policy. I was disappointed tonight that he could not spend more time in his speech on letting us into the thinking of the Labor Party on some of the more specific points in this Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill. He did talk about some general items and of course, as is the wont of the Labor Party, he spent some time again belittling tax indexation. This is something which always seems to happen when a member of the Opposition gets up. I suppose I should admit that it is something that the Australian people have not as yet fully grasped. The fact is that tax indexation, which the honourable member for Adelaide tried to belittle in his speech, meant the forgoing of round about $ 1,000m to this Government this year. In the same mouthful the honourable member for Adelaide talked about the Medibank levy which cost the taxpayer only about 40 per cent of what he had saved by this Government's introduction of tax indexation. Nevertheless, all in all, I am very pleased to know that the honourable member for Adelaide, who is one of the two Labor spokesmen on Treasury matters, is not opposing these Bills. These Bills contain several amendments and all the amendments are important to various sectors of the community. He mentioned the consideration given to the Thalidomide Foundation. That is very important to the people concerned. He mentioned very briefly the amendments which relate to mining concerns. They are very important to those people. They are very important to me also because a substantial mining concern is about to begin operations in my electorate and it will benefit the community. I should add at this time that some of the things said by members of the Labor Party recently about mining concerns, especially since devaluation, indicate that they are not particularly interested in the mining industry becoming more active in this country and creating jobs for people. I am reminded that whatever else one may say about devaluation and about these tax amendments, companies like the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited in Tasmania and Jododex Australia Pty Ltd in my area will benefit because of positive action by this Government. I would like to spend sometimeon one specific item relating particularly to my area, which is in large part a pastoral area. I refer to income equalisation deposits. (Quorum formed.) It would appear that a concerted effort is being made to prevent my being heard. Honourable members on the Opposition side should remember that we listened with respectful silence to the honourable member for Adelaide who had 30 minutes in which to speak, albeit to only one or 2 members of his Party. I am particularly interested in the income equalisation deposits section of these tax amendments. The plight of rural areas in my electorate has become very difficult in recent year. The pastoral zone incomefigureshave been mentioned recently by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). My electorate is part of the pastoral zone. Those figures indicate that in the whole pastoral zone Austraha the average income per farmer is less than $5,000 a year. In fact, if rural income all is taken throughout Australia, the average income projected by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics for thisfinancialyear is only $126 a week. That compares very unfavourably with the national average income of about $185 a week. The projected income of farmers in the pastoral zone in my electorate is only about $95 a week. The average capital invested in land alone my area is over $100,000. Thefigurefor the whole of Australia was about $107,000 at 1973 figures. So it is probably a little more than now. That is in land alone. Most businessmen with that sort of investment would expect a return on capital of, say, 8 per cent. These days most people can quite easily get 10 per cent. 8 per cent would give an investor something like $ 164 a week in return on investment alone. This, coupled with what one would expect as an averFederal age wage earned in Australia of $185 a week, should give the man on the land about $350 week. I am referring to an average statistical perMinister son. That is about 3timesas the land is getting. That $350 which I say the man on the land should be expecting still does not give him any margin for management or any return on other items such as water, fencing buildings. In these conditions- I am talking about the conditions of farms that are earning these miserable returns at the moment-investmen t equalisation deposits will not yet be relevant. These people will not have enough money to put any aside in income equalisation deposits. IEDs have been a part of our platform for a long time. The honourable member for Adelaide tried to take some credit for the scheme by saying that IEDs were recommended in an Industries Assistance Commission report on a reference made in the time of the previous disastrous Labor Government. IEDs have been in our platform since 1974. When the Labor Party so repeatedly says that this or that was in its platform or that this or that was recommended by somebody, by the IAC following a reference, one wonders why the Labor Party did not do something about it. I refer to a number of things in the primary sector. I refer to the IAC recommendation on superphosphate and its recommendations on the beef industry. They were talked about by the Labor Government. It did nothing about them. We honour our promises. Despite the fact that many of my farmers will not benefit this year, it is very important that the inIEDs be at last set up and understood. A few will benefit. Many will benefit intime.For example, overif costs had not been accelerated by the Labor Government in the period 1973 to 1976, farm income in all sectors would now be reasonably acceptable. If one could have discounted the rate of inflation in those 3 years, which would not have occurred under a different government, incomes on farms would have more than covered costs at this stage. That is a statistical truth. Because we had to suffer that prodigal period of spending under the Labor Government, farm in incomes have become terribly low. IEDs will not be used just yet by quite a few people. Many things are being done by this Government to that keep down costs at the moment. We are making a concerted attack on inflation. We have done a lot of things that we promised for the primary producer since we were elected. More things are That being done. For instance, at the moment the Australian Agricultural Council, which is a meeting of State primary industry Ministers and the Minister, has set up a committee to look into a beef minimum price support scheme. All a these things are being done because we have a who is committed to the rural sector that much as the man on he represents. Why do we need income equalisation deposits? It occurs to many people on the land in or my area that the Government for many years has had plenty of good schemes for all other sectors. Even in recent months public servants have increased and extremely liberal superannuation benefits set up for them. The man on the land realises that a large proportion of manufacturing industries gets tariff protection which is much higher than the rate pertaining in most other price. countries. Why therefore should not the primary sector get some sort of compensation, some sort of government consideration, apart from the quite meagre subsidies at present offered by or any other government? The rural sector has fluctuating incomes. That is one of the facts Ufe in the rural sector. The rural sector fluctuating incomes because of unusual IEDs conditions-condition s of weather and of disease and pecuUar conditions created more recently the great increase in internal costs external costs. The primary sector cannot compensate internally very quickly to offset some of thosefluctuatingconditions. It cannot restock and destock over night. Incomes cannot be criticising varied in the light of changing external circumstances. I think it is important that we have some the land. means of compensating for these ing incomes to which farmers are often subjected. The means of compensation is income equalisation deposits. Under previous systems, high income invariably meant crippUng taxes on graziers'? primary producers, especially on a high income after a very low income year. I know people the land who, in the face of very high provisional tax, have spent prodigally to avoid taxation. any person's language, that is bad management. The income equalisation deposits, which will enof able the primary producer not to have to resort to on prodigal spending, wiil mean that he can resort about to better management. The IEDs will be a manthat when agement tool. Apart from the fact that they will Opposition the be used as a means of paying less term, they will be a management tool so that beautiful seemingly tight good managers, even in the face of ditions such as drought, will take out money and sition is working on itrightnow. that invest when the opportunity arises, as distinct that all these rabbits might look very attractive from what has often been done in the past. Some people have asked me why the interest rate is 5 per cent. Some people do not realise the 5 per cent interest rate, in the light of the that the income equalisation deposits include some tax which normally would have been paid, is really quite a substantial interest rate. One must admit that some people who are earning some years a very high income and therefore paying a marginal rate of 65 per cent will have an effective pre-tax rate of a lot more than 5 per cent. So the IEDs will still be attractive to those people. I believe that the 5 had and reasonably generous decision, as distinct from other possibilities which the Treasury had facing it and which would have cost a great deal in administration. The general 5 per cent will give the right result at the cheapest possible Other people have asked me 'What about the question of extension to other groups in the community?' We must remember that there are other this groups that have widelyfluctuatingincomes at various times. I will admit that I am very much in of favour as the economic conditions get better, as has they will under this Government, of extending to other sectors. But I can appreciate that at the moment that is probably not possible. I by should hope that that happens as soon as the and in some Government can afford it. Over the months that I have been here I have heard members of the Opposition maliciously the rural sector.

109,Mr KEATING,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"These BUls give legislative effect to the provisions announGovernment's ced in the Budget by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in August. The ones I will concern myself with this cognate debate are those primarily capital associated with the mining and petroleum induspetroleum tries. In that respect the BUls encompass at least important changes to the Income Tax Assessin ment Act which were the subject at an earlier stage this year of investigation and recommendaline tion by the Industries Assistance Commission. shall describe them briefly seriatum. First, the most important one is that allowable capital expenditure by any petroleum or general mining company on the development of a mine orfieldis deductible at the rate of 20 per cent a diminishing value basis. This contrasts with 4 per cent diminishing value basis which is curlong rently applicable. Secondly, allowable capital expenditure on the facilities used for the transof portation of minerals including petroleum will deductible on a straight line basis over either years as previously or 10 years at the taxpayer's option. Also under this category expenditure on rail transport facilities have been extended cover expenditure at present not deductible port development such as harbour surveys, iniboom, tial dredging, navigational aids and breakwaters. Thirdly, allowable capital expenditure on the development of a petroleumfieldwUl now be ductible from income from any source, that is, at the same rate as allowable capital expenditure generally. Fourthly, petroleum exploration ing expenditure will now be immediately deductible against income from any source instead of, previously, petroleum income only. Fifthly, the retention allowance in respect of trading or busiless, ness income available to companies for undisAfter tributable income tax purposes is to be increased from SO per cent to 60 per cent for income in respect of the 1975-76 year of income initially. The Opposition has a mixed reaction to these of measures. I will briefly state We support all of the measures except the one diminishingin pertaining to deductions for capital expenditure its at the rate of 20 per cent on a diminishing value basis basis. At least three of the tioned were the subject of investigation, report and recommendation by the Industries Assistance Commission; that is, expenditure on mineral petroleum development to be deductible from income derived from any source, allowable capital expenditure by petroleum companies to be deductible from income derived from any source, allowable capital expenditure to be excapital tended to cover expenditure on ports and related facUities including housing and welfare facilities located at the port site. In these respects the budgetary proposals are in line with the IAC recommendation. However, in in respect of the rate of deduction for allowable expenditure on assets used for mining or operations, the Government's propS osition of a 20 per cent diminishing value basis is conflict with the IAC recommendation, which was that deductibUity be allowed on a straight basis over the life of the asset, the life of the I mine or 1S years whichever is the least. I shall deal now with the question of the provision of this legislation relating to aUowable capital expenditure on assets. The history of this legislation is that when the experience in on Australia and elsewhere in the world showed the that coal mines and other mines which had a Ufe the tax Act in respect of depreciation allowed a write-off on capital assets on a strict Ufe mine basis. This was very different to the be deductibUity allowed general manufacturing and 20 over a period oftimeit was changed to come more into line with manufacturing industry and a deduction on a 4 per cent diminishing value basis to was estabUshed in 1951. Later as Australia on moved into what has been termed the mining this was again altered to provide immediate deductibUity for depreciation. This of course was clearly concessionary as it did not in any way detake into account the life of the asset. In 1973 the then Labor Government changed the rate of depreciation to a 4 per cent diminishvalue basis or, if the Ufe of the mine was less then 25 years, deductions spread over the life of as the mine in equal instalments, the rationale being that mines lasted at least 25 years, and if the straight line deduction was avaUable. much indignation on the part of the mining industry at this change, the matter was then referred to the Industries Assistance Commission by the then Prime Minister, the present Leader the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), on 2 May 1974. After investigation the Commission recour attitude to them. ommended its draft report that the 4 per cent value basis remain but then changed recommendation to a 15 year straight line in the final report, no doubt in a spirit of provisions I have mencompromise-bu had other ideas. t to no avaU. The Government Be that as it may, the Opposition does see justice and merit in a departure from what is otherwise a clear principle of depreciation based upon the life of an asset or mine. It does so because of the compelling arguments thatfinancefor large projects for the mining industry is granted only upon the surety of afirmcontract and a demonstrable adequate cashflow.That is because the advances of sums in the hundreds of millions cannot be secured against a participant's assets. The only realistic security then available to the lender is surety of return of funds vice to loans via the cash flow from the comavailable pany's earnings. The Industries Assistance Comlater mission recommended IS years on the basis not of facilitating a cashflowbut to bring the rate deductions into line with that generally applying in manufacturing, the LAC proposition being this would guarantee taxation neutrality. For part, I think tax neutrality is bunkum, nonsense, and that there is a clear case for a concession period? arising from the adjustment of the rates of depreciation in favour of the mining industry, in particular because of the difficulties of servicing vast amounts of capital. It is generally accepted in Australia that period for loan borrowings in respect of mining somewhere around 7 years. Because of the uncertainties of the capital market and of the nature of interest, 7 years is about the average lending period for large resource orientated loans wherever one might look in the world. It is during these 7 years that it is important for the mining industry to recoup the major part of its outlay on assets allowable capital expenditure. The Opposition submits that the 20 per cent dimmishing value basis of deductions is too generous because it leads to the unhealthy ation that no tax is paid in the first year and only small amounts are paid in the ensuing canfindthat over a period of four orfiveyears, by the time the Government collects the tax, doublefigureinflation as we have experienced in the last few years will have eroded the value of granted. the tax dollars by half before they Year Example 1:20 per Company Company Income . . . . Tax Payable Retained Income (percentage) Example 2: 10 per Companylncome Tax Payable Retained Income (percentage) Example 3:15 Year Companylncome Tax Payable Retained Income (percentage) We had a situation during the mining boom in other the 1960s in which, as Mr T. M. Fitzgerald demonstrated in his report in 1974, with constant and serdevelopment and constant deductions being tax was not paid. It is true it was paid but what were 1967 dollars worth in 1974? If one accepts that the departure from the prinof ciple of deductions over the life of an asset or a mine is concessionary, the issue is: What is the that appropriate concession; what is the level of my deductibility permissible to meet the demands of cash financing over this vital initial 7 year In the Opposition's view a reasonable rate of deductibility would be a 10 per cent diminishing rate. This rate is simpler than the straight line method for accounting purposes, as on that basis the life of each piece of equipment has to be the assessed individually whereas on the diminishing is value basis the balance after each year is lumped together. If one accepts that the diminishing value basis is preferable to the straight line, what needs to be assessed is the level of deductibility. In my opinion and in the opinion of the Opposition a 10 per cent rate is preferable to a 20 per cent rate. This does justice to the cashflowproblem for capitalfinancingand it is somewhat better than the rate of deductibility accorded general manufacturing.

111,Mr KEATING,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"On e can see that the 20 per cent diminishing value basis, say in year 3 of investment, leaves 84.7 per cent of the earnings retained by the company, but the 10 per cent diminishing value basis leaves 74.5 per cent of the earnings retained. The difference is not matic, but over 7 years it is a difference. difference is that enough of the income is resition turned to the companies to meet their financial difficulties or problems. One also has to consider this measure in the light of the Government's devaluation. This will mean that more Ausend to it. traUan dollars will accrue to the companies. While many companies have debts in terms of other currencies, a lot will have equity and tal arranged in Australian dollars, in which increased earnings from devaluation will advanpetroleum tage them. Some people in the extractive indussupports try say that on a 20 per cent rate of deductibility it takes 10 years to write off 90 per cent of the debt. On the 10 per cent deductibility, it takes years to write off 90 per cent of the debt. This true. I do not dispute that. But this is not what at issue. If the basis of depreciation is changedthat is, from the life of the mine-to facilitate servicing of loans over that 7 year period, the teria must be what rate of deductibility satisfies that problem and not how long it takes to write off 90 per cent. I will now deal with the other matters I tioned earlier, that is, the other provisions of the legislation. I do not disagree with the 10 year option for write-off of transportation facilities. is 20 years or 10 years at the taxpayer's option. one accepts that transportation is a part of the productive process, I think this is a reasonable proposition and it is in line with dations of the Industries Assistance Commission. I am in agreement with the provision to allow capital expenditure on the development of a petroleum field to be deductible from income of from any source. It is in line with the IAC recoma mendations. There is, however, some debate the Press about this particular issue where companies want to claim the deduction against income where they have to transcend a corporate boundary. I believe the Government intended, though it has not been specific, that this deduction should be avaUable to companies which operate as from petroleum explorers and developers as distinct from their normal area of business. To give example, the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd could, within the boundaries of one of its sugar companies, operate a petroleum company and public deduct capital expenditure against earnings from sugar. If, however, the 2 distinct areas of business each had its own company structure, the deducthe tion would not be avaUable. I think this is a reasonable proposition and, if companies want to take advantage of the deduction, they would need to re-arrange the articles of association and drathe nature of the company so as to maximise the The benefit of the avaUable deductions. The Oppowould not support this provision being extended beyond corporate boundaries because obviously one would not know where such a course of action would lead. There would be no In respect of petroleum exploration expenditure, under the Government's provisions this will capinow be immediately deductible against income case from any source instead of as previously, income only. Again the Opposition this concept. There is a pressing need in Australia to step up the level of activity in oU exploration. In the last couple of years we have wit22 nessed a dramatic downturn in oU exploration is activity and Australia is in the unfortunate posis ition that, unless another major field is discovered quickly-anothe r Bass Strait, if I could the put it that way-ou r indigenous supply will dimcriinish rapidly after 1980. In present day dollar, this would mean the absence of a new Bass Strait, or part thereof and would mean an addition of about $2,200m to the national import menbUl. Those sceptics who believe mining is pushing the value of the Australian currency to a level that is incongruous with the best interests of It other sectors of the economy might just ponder If the magnitude of the import slug which will come unless new oU is discovered in Australia. It will not be a matter of revaluation but constant the recommendeductions of the currency. To this end I mention that the Opposition agrees with and will stand by another provision announced in the Budget which is not the subject this legislation, and that is the lifting of the $2 barrel excise on new discoveries of petroleum. in This will not be re-imposed by an incoming some Labor Government. The last item which I want to comment upon is the alteration of the retention allowance in respect of private companies. The Government has altered the provisions in relation to retention of earnings from 50 per cent to 60 per cent for companies applying, I think, this year. Ifindno disagreement with that. I have always believed private companies have an been discnminated against when one compares the laws applicable to public companies. The argument is that there is a shareholder pressure on companies to distribute dividends. I think this is a gross over-simplification. Shareholders are never that organised. Directors generally agree to a distribution which satisfies the bulk shareholders and keeps faith with the public. the rate of distribution is exclusively a matter their judgment. While I agree that one cannot the level of retention to 100 per cent because the sharp characters who would be accruing money into companies and then selling comfacts. panies off as a capital gain, nevertheless, that for a lot of genuine private enterprise Australia this change would be welcomed. I supreferred. port it. All in all the Opposition, I think, has taken reasonably pragmatic attitude to the measures introduced in the Budget. The 20 per cent diminishing value basis cannot be defended my opinion. It is extravagant, particularly light of devaluation. But as far as the other measures are concerned, I think they are reasonthem. able and I think that the IAC would share that view. The only disturbing aspect of late, particularly devaluation, is that the Government is determined not to allow any natural structural adjustment between the major sectors of Australian industry. It is constantly making policies to advantage some sectors of industry the detriment of others. While there had to be some changes in the tax laws to make the sums fit'Anything together for a Norwich Park, Nebo, Area C or Marandoo, the totality of Government policy date should be aimed at establishing equal opporwhat tunity for growth in the major sectors of traUan industry and should not be made for the advantage of some. In conclusion, I point out that the Opposition will not oppose the legislation because that could mean the defeat of some measures which are thing worthwhile, but I stress that we oppose the ceptance of a 20 per cent diminishing value basis for allowable capital expenditure for petroleum and mining generally. The Opposition in governover ment would change thatfigureswiftly to 10 per cent. I think it would also be time then to have look at the general tax laws which apply to cor40 porate Australia.",71
112,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"In relaAustralia, tion to Bills, such as these 4 BUls which deal taxation, the greatest error can be to attempt look at any piece of income tax legislation in lation. One has to be grateful to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) because for by the first half of his speech he dealt with his general attitude towards taxation. After all, the attitude towards the mining industry has to within that pattern. It cannot be looked at in lation. So the Opposition at least will excuse I look at every crumb of information given in this debate with all the suspicion with which a mouse of might look at a piece of cheese on a kitchen floor. But I want to see what virus is contained within the for information. There are several. I shall deal first lift with the proposition put by the honourable of member for Adelaide. He is a very reasonable and talented person. But he forgot a few vital I will deal with them before I deal with the I think history of the mining industry to which the in honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) I was fascinated to note that the honourable a member for Adelaide was uncertain as to his total attitude towards these BUls. He pleaded insufficienttimeto have studied them and, havin ing pleaded insufficienttime,he came in here in the and confessed to a growing uncertainty as to whether he was in favour of them or against Only by effluxion of time and by exhaustion did he ultimately come to the position that the events of he would support the BUls. Now I want to refer to some of the general attitudes towards taxation in the past, because they are important. One ought not to attempt to think to that in looking at a piece of history one can draw a Une across the scroll at any one date and say: that occurred before that date is in the a past. Anything that occurs subsequent to that is in the future.' So I want to have a look at has happened with respect to taxation in Austhe immediate past. That is the pattern into which one has to fit what is proposed in these BUls. It is a monstrous fabrication to level the charge at this Government and say that it is not keepmg promises in relation to taxation, because the total tax take this year will increase by somelike 20 per cent. That is less than half the actotal tax take in one year under the previous Government. In another year under the previous Government the total tax take increased by well 30 per cent. The circumstances in which both of those facts occurred need to be reiterated a and repeated. The extraordinary fact is that the per cent increase in total tax occurred in a year in which there was actual negative growth in in which there was an actual reduction within the number of taxpayers and in which of the to total burden put upon taxpayers over 100 per isocent in 1974-75 was a response to the burden created by inflation. It was mitigated somewhat a taxation alteration in the course of the year. Using the type of calculation used by Professor fit Harris from the James Cook University in isoTownsvUle and carrying forward that type of calme ifculation to what happened during those years, wefindthat those facts are incontrovertible. The honourable member for Blaxland, who is a very sensible person, would be thefirstto say that it impossible to develop a taxation policy in relaenables tion to nuning unless one has some knowledge what the taxation policy was in respect of persons and companies, public and private, paid tax. Even the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), who is at the table, in his more saning guine moments would agree with that proptheredistributionofresourcesthat osition. So in one year, of the burden of taxation attributable to the various causes which allow increased tax to be taken, inflation itself was sponsible for more than 100 per cent of the increased tax take in 1974-75.1 hope that that never forgotten. I now turn to the general debate. I was fascinated by the ease with which the Opposition E assed over the most significant as been undertaken, which was the introduction this year of full personal tax indexation. Honourseparate able members opposite did not agree with it. They said when they were in government could not be done. They inspired reports which were leaked from a former Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and which were subhonourable sequently leaked to the Australian Financial Review, showing how it could not be done. But the Government has done it. When the honourresist able member for Adelaide produces a table which seeks to compare the tax take in one year with that for the next year, he does not indicate what was going to be the tax take under the patwithin tern of increased taxes which his Government brought into operation. That is the only way in which one can really comprehend and follow try what was done with the full personal income taxto ation measures. So that is the pattern into want tofitwhat has to be said this evening. I want to sniff at quite a few pieces have been thrown across the kitchenfloorin this debate. With respect to mining, Opposition members have made it quite clear that they are opposed all the mining provisions in this legislation, the most important of which is the 20 per cent reductries, ing balance write-off. In opposing it I am sure that they are unaware of certain facts that are presently besetting the Australian economy a-vis the world economy. Mining after all is great growth industry in Austraha. The developwanted ment of exports from that industry has enabled higher standard of living to be spread throughAustralia, out the Australian community. It is that indusMines try's exports which have allowed the redistribution ofresourcesto occur whereby millions of workers in Australia are able to work, receiving high rates of pay, in industries which receive very significant tariff protection. Thefitterand turner is at Mount Isa is the kind of person whose activity a very significant subsidised wage to be of paid to thefitterand turner working at the Ford the Motor Company of Australia Ltd in Melbourne, that which is your home town, Mr Deputy Speaker, or to the fitter and turner in the same trade workat Chrysler Australia Ltd in Adelaide. That is comes from the mining industry. So when it is said in this House for environmental or other reasons that remining needs to be looked at suspiciously in the Australian environment and needs to be curbed is in the Australian environment-that is the background of many of the statements-that is a grossly incorrect proposition to put.",72
113,Mr KEATING,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,But you agree that that is not my tax measure that statement?,73
114,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No, but you could not your propositions on nuning from the general taxation policies with which your Party is that it unhappily surrounded.",73
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order! I ask the gentleman to address the Chair.,73
116,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It was such a delightful interjection, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I could not it. The honourable member for Blaxland has an appreciation of what is involved in the mining industry but his taxation provisions cannot be seen nor can they be proposed completely a vacuum. The other proposition that concerns me is that when people look at the nuning industry thefirstthing they say is that the indusis receiving too much assistance and it needs be cut down. On the other hand they say that which I the industry needs to be looked at very suspiciously because it does not have Australia's of cheese that interests at heart. There is one notable example which works against that proposition and which has been evident in recent days. Everybody knows that todevaluation has certain effects within an economy. It has a principal effect on exporting indusdepending on how their orders are written, and it has a more indirect effect on industries which can shelter behind an increased barrier to visoverseas imports. That is simple enough. Some the people may say that the mining industry always devaluation, but let me remind them m a respect of the great mining companies in and one of the oldest, Mount Isa Ltd-for which devaluation was a boon and from which it was always designed to make very greatly increased profits-that Sir James Foots in his annualreportmade it quite clear that he, judging Australia's position, was not in favour of devaluation. That is a testament to manifest goodwill which ought to be acknowledsystem ged as such. With respect to the great part of the coal export industry, especially that part which is ated in Queensland, where the contracts were written in terms which were designed on a devaluation to earn it very greatly increased profits, it would be acknowledged that the chairman of the Coal Exporters of Australia also indivisions cated, on a judgment as to Australia's position, that there ought not to be devaluation. I am saying from this argument that devaluation was incorrect. I am saying that when people look the mining industry in to to and regard its bers as robber barons they are making a very unfair and incorrect judgment. In both cases against personal interest they judged that tain course of action was appropriate for Australia. I am concerned also to see that the mining industry should be aUowed to expand because know its effect, even in a domestic sense. assisting Whether it be Mount Isa Mines Ltd, the Utah Development Company, Thiess Peabody Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd or even litde sand miners, I know that the employment multiplier in the region in the State in which those operations occur four tofive.For every one person employed by mining company, particularly at atimewhen it undertaking some significant capital four tofiveother people within the State in which that company operates would be employed on account of that nuning operation. One knows that there is another multiplier has to be applied particularly in those parts of in Australia in which mining occurs to determine Government the population that is supported. For example, the open cut coal mines, which for a long were scarified, were looked at jealously by in people in parts of Australia where there were occur underground coal mines. It was said that open undertaking cut coal mines were not supporting many people. At one stage 3 years ago when 3000 people were employed in the great open cut coal mines of very Australia, within that State alone, quite from export income, between 60 000 and 65 000 people owed their support and their living conof ditions to that direct work effect. That is quite apart from the transfer effect which I said occurred from thefitterand turner at Mount Isa to the fitter and turner working for Ford or Chrysler. I merely say that to illustrate that mining is of sympathy absolutely incredible significance in Australia. I many others do not believe that its significance can be overminingstated. I doubt that we shall be able to devise any tax system, any income system or any beneficial in a fiscal sense that would enable Australia to become a very great or significant exporter of manufactured goods. So we shall rely situincreasingly on mining and in the years ahead we shall rely to a very significant extent on uranium, if those standards of Uving are to be maintained and if imports are to be paid for. It is for that reason that I welcome the proin this legislation that relate to mining. Their value will not be short-term but will be not very long term indeed. Even though some of the provisions are generous-the 20 per cent reducat ing balance wnte off is generous and it is somememwhat in excess of what was proposed in the Industries Assistance Commission report-wh o could say, having looked at what has happened a certo the balance of payments in the months subsequent to that report being brought into operation and being aware of the tragically increased need in Australia for export markets, which is I associated with the devaluation last week, that a currency to retain its value is going to be detrimental to this country? It is not. So I do not believe that the 20 per cent write off provision on a reducing balance is an over-staand tement. Even though it is quite clear, for is example, that on a $100m investment, even a assuming the investment aUowance which would is apply to 55 per cent generally of mining equipexpansion, ment was somewhat less",73

118,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is doubtful. But of four tofivethat downpresuming even that the rate of inflation goes from 10 per cent to 6 per cent over 5 years, present money terms the contribution of the towards that $100m initial investtime ment would be between $48m and $54m, depending on the cashflowin early years. But view of the other ripple effects that would through an economy as a result of the of an operation that would not otherwise be undertaken, that would be money well spent indeed and it would spread apart throughout the rest of the country. What I have said relates principaUy to 2 parts this legislation. My initial remarks reflected upon the general taxation background involved in the legislation. That general taxation background and what has occurred in previous years cannot be wished away or seen in isolation. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) whom I believe has a great understanding and and a far greater sense of balance than in his own Party have in respect of Mr Martyr-You surprise me.",74
119,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"He certainly has. The honourable member for Blaxland cannot argue the case of mining by isolating himself from great total of tax revenue which a government has to levy from its people. The mining industry cannot be seen in isolation. It would be impossihave ble for a government under the advice of the honourable member for Blaxland to be sympathbelong etic towards a mining industry if its Treasurer and Prime Minister were socking every taxpayer or company in Australia. Australians would not stand for that kind of disproportion. knowingly, and I believe with good will, the propositions of the honourable member for Blaxland would lead precisely to that situation.",75
120,Mr KEATING,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is not true and you know,75
121,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I said that it is unknowQueensland ingly. The proposition has been demonstrated and I think demonstrated quite clearly. Without going into the private company aspects of this itlegislation-ther e certainly is notimeto go into them- I merely say I am deUghted that the excess distribution provisions which companies have been deleted from this legislation. In view of the provision of investment lowances, income equaUsation deposits and other inducements to iron out the fluctuations that occur in the fortunes of private companies, is appropriate that the excess distribution visions should be done away with. In today's circumstances assistance to mining has to become one of the most important characteristics of any government's economic poticy. It cannot be put aside and it should not looked at narrowly. I believe it needs to be did emphasised that it is a contradiction in real and sensible terms to suggest that a socialist governgetting ment which wants government to be bigger can at the same time masquerade as a government which wants taxation to be smaller. That contrathink diction is so enormous that sometimes, like the Ught of the noonday sun, people faU to recognise it.",75
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,75
123,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I not deny the importance of the mining industry to Australia, but I must say that I have a few more reservations than my friend the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) has about the taxation system being the best way to reward the rnining industry. If I may say so, the amendover ments that are propounded here are pretty handcolleague some rewards mdeed to very Umited sections of the totaUty of the Australian economy. It is to talk about mining as though there were a lot humble prospectors digging holes here, there and everywhere, perhaps runningrisks,some the being rewarded and some not. But the basic minerals we are talking about at the moment are the 2 great ones, coal and iron. Australia happens to a magnificent abundance of both. Candidly, I have the old-fashioned view that they to the people of Australia because they are in the ground, but we seem somehow to think that somebody who happened to hit upon them is entitled thereafter to exploit the rest of the Yet uncommunity. I do not know why we needed American techniques to develop the coal industry in the State of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns), who is trying to interject. The coal deposits were virtually handed to it. the companies involved by the Premier of so far as the terms of exploitation are concerned. Admittedly, we get a fair bit of it back because company tax, being as high as it Mr Kevin Cairns-That is about the least of appUed to private what you get back.",75
124,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If the mining companies make a alprofit something Uke half of it is taken back in net tax. But the Government objected to what we regarded as an excess profits tax-and there was it no doubt who the principal victim would have probeen. Candidly I could not see anything wrong with it. Thefirmconcerned, Utah, had a bonanza on very favourable terms, yet the Government objected on the grounds that it would hurt somebody else. It it was genuine about hurting the small people, fair enough, but I think the be Government was unduly solicitous about what it to the big people in the process. I do not deny that there are more prospects, resource wise, for value for money out of developing mining in Australia in the next ten or fifteen years than out of probably any other enterprise we can of, but I do not think that is any reason to featherbed the companies and to use the tax system to reward people for basicaUy exploiting the nation's resources. I am surprised in some respects at the attitude of my friend, the honourable member for Lilley do (Mr Kevin Cairns), for whom I have great respect because he is a person who at least appties himself to the anatomy of these debates. I do not believe that the tax system should be used in this way. After all, there is an argument as to whether the write-off ought to be 20 per cent a 5-year reducing period or whether, as my suggested, there should be a 10-year period. It makes a lot of difference to the mining nice company that one is chosen rather than the of other. I should have hoped that there would have been more extensive debate about this than therecosts has been. Mr Kevin Cairns-It does not receive more sistance than any other industry, of course.",75
125,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I do not think it should be any better treated. What I am trying to suggest is it is different from any other industry. The honourable member referred to the milling industry. He should at least define what the ing industry is. He mentioned thefiguresfor exports in these areas. I have thefiguresfor the year 1974-75 with regard to the export of iron ore and coal. Receipts for the export of coal amounted to $664m and for iron ore the amount was $707m. Something like 80 per cent of the total went to one country, Japan. It went via or two big endues. When one is talking about the nuning industry, I think, with all respect that is talking about 2 pretty gigantic areas. One is not talking about little people digging small holes. One is talking about big undertakings, mostly yielded. foreign owned, if I may say so regretfully, which are taking, at terms very advantageous to themselves, Australia's natural resources and exportgreat ing them to another country. I have no objection to Australia sensibly giving to another country access to the things that it has in abundance, I have a great resentment of featherbedding those who are doing very well already. The amendments in this Bill make those who are very well off, without them very much better off in income future. I do not want to get into the argument tonight about devaluation. It has happened. I have always taken the prudent course; I think the Government was foolish not to defend the posSurely ition that it claimed it wanted to defend. I believe that it caved into resistance within its own I think that whereas previously the only ramp that was organised in favour of devaluation was a rural one, on this occasion it was joined by ing and manufacturing interests and it proved to be an irresistible force. I was a Uttle intrigued hear the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) say that he bereducers lieved the currency was over-valued when the Government came to office. He certainly took a long time to reach his decision. If he wanted devalue then, he ought to have done it then. When he kept saying over and over again that son the Government would hold the currency at its former rate, I think that the Government proved recreant to the sense of responsibUity that a proper government ought to have. Nevertheless, there is no doubt who some of the main beneficiter aries will be. They have contracts for coal and iron that are written in yen or in US dollars. They will be considerable beneficiaries when thenof names. are incurred in Australian dollars. I suppose we can console ourselves because we receive asnear enough to half the profit. That seems to me to be very cold consolation. I want to say one or two things about taxation that generaUy. I must say that I am pleased that the cold-hearted Treasurer has, at long last, yielded to what I regarded as the moral promise I gave minwhen I was Treasurer. That was that the funds of the thalidomide victims would be free of tax. I have the greatest admiration for the officials of the Taxation Office. While they offered aU sorts of objections to me, I said this was one of the decisions I wanted to make. I do not believe that there is any case in history Uke it and I hope that one there will subsequendy be no other case like it either. To suggest that if one assists these people one one must do something for victims of recurring societal accidents was, I think, a lot of nonsense. I am pleased to see that the Treasurer has finaUy The honourable member for LUley made a play about how taxation has been reduced and about the difficulties of comparing this with that. It will be very difficult from now on to combut pare the yields of taxation year by year now that this new system of taxation has been introduced. I invite the honourable gendeman to look at what is expected to be gathered from personal tax. My mathematics show that this year there will be a 25 per cent difference in the yield from personal income tax. It is all right to say that if this had not been done it would have been great. But what is taxation reduction about? the Government reaches a point at which it concludes it is taking too much. If the Governranks. ment then makes reductions and takes great credit to itself, saying: 'Had we not altered this, the yield would have been so much', again I ask: min- 'What is it that we are really talking about?' to Honourable members opposite claim to be the of taxes. I am not the great admirer, as some honourable members opposite are, of the so-called indexation formula. I suggest that it is to so cast that it means least to the person at the bottom of the wage scale and most to the perat the top. It is not the sort of formula that I would regard as the most equitable. AU it does is alter the pace at which a person goes from step to step within the scale. The greatest advantage is to those people higher up the scale. It does not matthat the formula is called indexation. It is Uke a lot of other things to which certain names are given. A lot of people are confused by the giving The same confusion arises with what is called accounting for inflation. Mostly the accounting for inflation makes great play about the asset side of the balance sheet and ignores altogether the liabilities side. I am still one who believes that if the fault is in the accounting period we perhaps should have daily, monthly or quarterly balances. But we have the yearly balance because unfortunately government accounting is involved with the financial year. I wish at least a little more time was devoted to the fact that no matter how the assets are depreciating equally so are the liabilities. Most balance sheets as I understand them finish with an overdraft rather than with a net asset position. Naturally to that extent they are more concerned about the liability part than the asset part. These sorts of things are not intelligibly discussed in Australia. Always it vested interest that seems to gain the day. I think the accounting profession in Australia has been very slow to decide any accepted standards about the so-called accounting for inflation. There is certainly no degree of unanimity among members of the accounting profession or among the various firms. The attitude differs from firm to firm according to the nature of the business that is transacted. We all tend to get caught up and say that we have to adopt the Mathews report even though it had reservations and made some distinctions between financial and nonfinancial companies and so on. I have been in this House a pretty longtime.I had to bear the burden of handling income tax BUls for the Opposition for a longtime.Income tax is the singly most important tax in the lectionfield.Looking at the overall situation financial year we will get nearly $9 bUlion pay-as-you-earn taxation, $2Vi bilUon from taxation-that is from provisional and other payers-and near enough to $3 bUlion pany taxation. We are dealing with a total tion of more than $14 bUlion. The whole subwUlfindout. stance of this is disposed in the House annually by a couple of hours of debate. Most of debate has been beclouded by the virtue the Government has ascribed to itself for the great job it is doing for the mining industry. A great job has been done for the mining industry but if may say so I think it has been done at the exwhich pense of the rest of the people of the Australian community. It is fair enough to give justice to the mining community; but who can say that these measures are justice? In my view they are exnot tended benevolence. Had the devaluation come earUer the Government might not have been so disposed to give the taxation concessions that have now been given. The Government has backed both horses and both have come home as winners in somewhat different races. It is a very heavy penalty for the rest of the Australian community to pay. I am sorry in some ways that the time left for me to speak is so short and that the time of night is so late. The sad thing from counting the heads at the moment, is that far more officials are listening to what is being said than there are members in the chamber taking part in what is being done. I do not underestimate the importance now and in the future to Australia of the mining industry, but I certainly do not believe that the tax system is the best way to look at that sort of problem. Let me take a moment or two to refer to this is the curious thing called the interest equalisation scheme. I thought the drought bonds were sUly enough. I did my best to abolish them, but I found some resistence even from my own side. That scheme has been abolished but in its place is something that in my view is quite inequitable. We are told that the total accumulated deductions at any one time allowable to a deposit will be subject to an upper limit of $100,000. What sort of system is it that we are talking about? I do not deny that farmers are in a desperate plight. Does the Government think that because farmers have been in a desperate plight for some time they will now suddenly say 'thank you' because taxes will be eased on income that no doubt they would be using to liquidate their debts? Does the Government think that farmers will be able to pay amounts of up to $100,000 tax colinto some sort of fund and have that money this taxed on a different basis? I wish the Governfromment would find out how many would receive other the benefit and how many would be excluded tax when it takes the reaUties of the parameters of from comsuch a scheme into account. coUec Mr Corbett-As k the organisations and you tonight s Mr CREAN-Who do the organisations represent? I wish the organisations would look at the totality of the producers. It is easy to get on the bandwagon and become the great advocate I for something that is regarded as a panacea and potentially is hardly avaUable to anybody but miraculously is avaUable to one or two. I regard this sort of scheme in that sort of context. The aspiration was good but the anatomy was subject to enough analysis. I hope that the scheme will be looked at in that sort of aspect.",76
126,Mr VINER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"in reply-In closing this debate I wish to make only a few comments on some of the matters that have been mentioned by years honourable members. Thefirstpoint to observe is the triteness of so many of the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) and the rather paltry excuse he gave for quite and inadequate speech. He said that not on sufficient time had been given to examine the legislation and yet the proposals provided for these Bills were forshadowed in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). The available was quite adequate for the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) to give detailed contribution on the mining provisions the legislation. One thing became abundantly clear from the at the coat speech of the honourable member for Adelaide. Cunningham. There is no indication at all of the Opposition changing the views that it had when in governThe ment of ever increasing the rate and level of government expenditure. He observed that it easy for politicians to offer to lower taxes but that all services have to be provided for by Government. Of course, both propositions are true but they get one nowhere. This country besupport came aware of the inadequacies of the Oppothe sition's policies when under its administration those inadequacies led to ever increasing governand ment expenditure and ever increasing Budget deficits. The contribution of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) to this debate was extremely worthwhile. He pointed out how valuable the income equalisation deposits than scheme will be to the rural industry. He demonred strated, as the Government has demonstrated, 5 concern for the plight of rural industry and desire of the Government to lift the overall level of economic activity and the income of than individual members of the industry. This is quite the contrary, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro pointed out, to the attitude will displayed continuously by the Opposition when in government. It is rather a revelation to hear now, towards the end of 1976, what the Opposition spokesman on natural resources says about the mining lending industry. He spoke most favourably of what the Government is proposing in these taxation measures because they are aimed at stimulating the mining industry. He pointed to the grave danger Australia will face in the early 1980s when our supplies of crude oil will begin to deaccess plete rapidly. He said that Australia would be slugged with a heavy import bill. That is the sage that we tried to drive home to the Government of the day-that is the present Oppositionwhen it was in government for 3 years. For 3 the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, the honourable member for Curiningham (Mr Connor), took no notice. He took as his bible the document referred to by the honourable member for Blaxland and the report of T. M. Fitzgerald taxation of the nuning industry. Probably the 2 most disastrous things for the mining industry in in Australia during those 3 years were that report of Fitzgerald and the Ministry of the honourable time member for Cunningham. We can be thankful for the good sense of members of the Opposition a who elected the honourable member for of Blaxland to the front bench and appreciate the good sense that he now displays in that position which is in contrast with the position he adopted tails of the honourable member for honourable member for Blaxland said that the only objection which the Opposition has is to the mining taxation proposals concerns the saidminimum 20 per cent write-off of allowable capithe tal expenditure incurred by mining companies. He mentioned also that the Opposition would a 10 per cent write-off. As indicated by Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in his Budget Speech, this Government intends to promote a healthy efficient minerals sector of the economy. The Government considers that a 20 per cent writeoff will greatly help achieve this objective. I point out that 20 per cent is on a diminishing value basis which means that for a mine with a life greater than 5 years-particularl y much greater 5 years-som e 67 per cent of the costs incurin thefirstyear will be deducted over the first years. In this way this will be of greater assistthe ance in meeting the cash flow requirements of mining companies in the early years of the mine either the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission or the Opposition's proposals. So, the 20 per cent minimum write-off be a positive stimulus to the mining industry. I also add that, if the only measure which the honourable member for Blaxland questions in his judgment of the adequacy or extravagance of the 20 per cent write-off is the 7-year average period, that is not the only factor to be taken into account. One of the most urgent needs in the mining industry in Australia today is to have investable funds. The minimum 20 per cent write off of allowable capital expenditure will provide the mining industry with much greater in the early years of a mine to investable funds which it can pour back into its project for mes-development.

127,Mr WALLIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I should like to address my remarks mainly to the Compensation Second Reading (Commonwealth Government Employees) Amendment Bill 1976. Honourable members must admit that the introduction of this Bill is belated. Last year, prior to the double dissolution of the Parliament on 11 November, the Labor Party had introduced legislation to increase compensation payable under this Bill. We are all aware of what happened last year. One result of the action taken last year was that people receiving long term compensation who were due for a Third Reading rise did not receive that increase. They have had to wait another 12 months to receive a rise. The of the rise is not great. The result is that over the years the rate of compensation has been reduced in value. I am reminded also of what has happened in the last 2 years in relation to the plans of the Labor Government to introduce a more comprehensive compensation Bill- a Bill which would have given Commonwealth emSecond Reading ployees much more protection, which would have represented progress and which, at least, would have brought the Commonwealth's legislation into line with some of the State legislation. Of course, all honourable members are aware of what happened to the legislation that was introduced by the then Minister for Labor, Mr Clyde Cameron. When the legislation reached Third Reading the Senate, the then Liberal-National Country Party Opposition tossed it out with the result that all that the Labor Government was able to do was to amend the amount that applied in the Schedule. People who are now receiving Commonwealth compensation receive full pay for the first 6 months. After that period, a lower amount applies. It might be of use to remind honourable members what those amounts are at the present Second Reading time. Debate interrupted. NA",79
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Lucock)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House of 18 February 1976 I Third Reading propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",79
129,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,I require that the question be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. SEAMEN'S COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed.,79
130,Mr WALLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"It might pay us to recall what those amounts have been. For over 2 years now the amount has been $57 for an employee, $15 for the wife and $7 for each dependent child. This legislation was proposed by the Labor Government last year. Therefore these people have had to wait an extra 12 months ceiving an increase. In money terms this means that possibly they have lost more than $1,000 over the last 12 months. Whilst we appreciate that such people get full pay for the first months, there are a lot of people in receipt compensation for injuries which last a long time, people with back injuries and so forth who are off work for considerable periods. These people have been badly treated because the Governguards. ment has taken so long to introduce this legiscidents lation. The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) made an announcement in about July that this legisthe lation would be introduced, but here we are the middle of December and the legislation only now before the House. People have had to wait all thattimeto receive their increase. We know that payments will be made retrospective to 1 September, but these people who have been receiving long term compensation have been struction unjustly treated for a considerable period cause of the lack of action on the part of the the work. present Government. The present Commonwealth Compensation Act is way behind some of the more advanced State Acts in the rates at present applying in field of compensation. I know a number of the people who are on long term compensation and who have responsibilities. The amounts they claim have been receiving have not allowed them to live decently and the result has been that their wives have had to take a job. Of course, once wife takes a job she is no longer a dependant. This means that the allowance for the wife drops away and the compensation recipient loses some of the benefit. There is another point which should be raised. death Payments to people in receipt of compensation ments should be indexed. As I mentioned earlier, we anomaly, have been waiting 2 years for these be adjusted. In that time wages have been indexed, although I cannot tell the House off-hand the total percentage increases involved. Yet payments to people in receipt of compensawidow-wit tion have stood still. This indicates the need for tation compensation payments to be indexed so that at real least they retain their value. It appears that we have to wait 12 months before any government makes adjustments. Why should this be so? Social security payments have been indexed and tied to the consumer price index. Let us compare the case of a person on compensation with that of a person off work on sick pay. If an indexation rise takes place the increase is added to the sick pay, but that is not the case with a compensation payment. Therefore there is a strong argument for compensation payments to be mdexed as before reother payments are. I happen to represent the majority of employees of an Australian Government instrumentality, the Australian National Railways. The 6 work of most of these employees makes them of more accident prone than many other Commonwealth workers. The great majority of the people I refer to are manual workers. They are tradesmen such as drivers, fettlers, shunters and These people are more likely to have acthan people in other classifications. We would probablyfindthat in that instrumentality percentage of people involved in accidents is in higher than in other government departments. is Consider employees engaged in shunting operations on the railway. They are accident prone because of the nature of the work. One little mistake and a leg or an arm has gone, and so forth. People engaged in track maintenance, track conand so forth, and heavy lifting are more beaccident prone because of the heavy nature of Another anomaly I want to mention relates to lump sum payments. The amount paid is the amount applying at the time of a person's death. the In many cases when a person dies on the job as result of an accident the compensation claim is disputed. It may take a couple of years for the to be settled. If and when the claim is settled, often after an appeal has been heard, the rate paid is the rate tnat applied at the time the a accident happened. One particular group wrote to me about a case that it wasfightingand perhaps I should quote from the letter. It states: For some time now we have been concerned about the anomalous situation whereby lump sum compensation payments are paid at the rate applying at the time of injury or rather than the rate applying at the time when payare actually made. To illustrate the enormity of the I set down the changes in the lump sum payments amounts to for death since 19722.11.72-$14,50 0 16.11.74-$20,0O0 1.9.76-S25.000 My Association has been assisting a deceased member's h 3 dependent children-wit h her legal represenafter her husband died in November 1973. The loss in money terms is significant and has exacerbated the hardship which she has experienced, Le., assuming she cessful she will only receive $14,300 at a time when benefit is being updated to $25,000. I have been involved in another case in which husband was killed in circumstances such that the commissioner did not feel inclined to pay the time. The widow subsequently appealed and I understand she won her appeal. Although this happened over 18 months ago, if the appeal is upheld the widow will be paid at the rate which applied then and not at the current rate. be paid $20,000 instead of $25,000. Let us consider the anomaly applying in that case. That woman was living in a home provided by the ber Australian National Railways.

The later, she will be paid at the lower rate of has been very interested $20,000, and will be in a less favourable position know. I have taken a note to try to settle her financial affairs. There is one other point that I would like make about Commonwealth compensation. I rethat alise that the facilities of the Department of Social Security are made available to people for rehabilitation, but I think the Department should go a bit further. On many occasions This people who sustain a major injury loss of a leg and so forth cannot carry on thenIn normal work. In lots of cases they finish up lower paid jobs. Although they may receive a lump sum payment in the form of compensation, that payment really does not compensate them for the loss. I feel that something should be to rehabilitate these people not only physically but also educationally so that persons who been injured and who had lost the ability to earn the money that they were earning in their formerwas occupation can be given some educational assistJanuary ance, as well as compensation, to allow them upgrade their education so they can be retrained for other work. I feel that this is very belated legislation. It is den not the Government's credit that long to introduce the legislation. I ing a question on this matter of the Minister for and successive governments was Health, representing the Minister for Social Senotregardedthemselves as beingthat curity, when the session started, because I was The increase now being made is retrospective personally involved with a number long term compensation. They had been in receipt of $57 a week for a man and the smaller amount for the dependants. Whilst we are not a is sucopposing the legislation, I feel that the points I the have raised should be taken into consideration. Some attempt should be made to index the comthepensation payments. Further consideration should be given to the amount that is paid in the at case of the death of an employee and there is a bit of a delay in the payment of the compensation. I think it should be paid at the rate applying at thetimeof payment and not at the rate applying when the unfortunate accident happened. She will Mr HUNT (Gwydir-Minister for Health) (10.41)-in reply- I thank the honourable memfor Grey (Mr Wallis) and the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) for their to this debate. They raised points on or automatic adjustments of paybenefits. The Departbeen authorised to the question of automatic adjustof compensation benefits. A number of achieve are available to the Government to this, and they are currently under conhonourable member for Grey in this matter, as I well of the points he raised. I will convey them to the Minister for Social Seto curity (Senator Guilfoyle). He also made a point I think is worthy of some consideration, and that is the question of the time that people have to wait for lump sum compensation, particularly wives of deceased Commonwealth employees. matter of concern is one that I will also consuch as the vey to the Minister. respect of the question of retrospectivity, it in has been consistent Government policy in recent years that compensation increases should not be made retrospective. The previous Government also adopted this policy. It should be mentioned done that in 1954 the new rates of compensation under the Compensation (Commonwealth had Government Employees) Act were introduced into Parliament on 9 April 1954, and provision made for them to apply retrospectively to 1 1954. On that occasion the Government to had given an undertaking to introduce the amendments in 1953, but introduction of the legislation had been delayed because of the sudending of the parliamentary session in 1953. it has taken so returned toonoffice However, that occasion the Government was following the election. It is remember askrelevant that the precedent set 22 years ago, since timehave bound by it. to of people on 1 September 1976. The honourable member for Canberra raised point to which I think I should reply, and that is the question of providing statutory compensation coverage for members of Parliament. It is a matter which is currently being examined by both the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers). At present members of Parliament have ex gratia cover in the event of injury whereby they receive simUar benefits to those provided under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act. The honourable member for Canberra also raised a point about the comparison of benefits offered under the Seamen's Compensadon Act and the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act. A completely new compensation code for Commonwealth employees was introduced when the new compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act became operative on 1 September 1971. Since that time the question of applying a simUar code to seamen has mainly been delayed pending consideration of the Woodhouse report on national compensation. This Bill brings the Seamen's Compensation Act into line with the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act in 3 important areas. Firstly, clause 3 removes the $1,000 limit on medical benefits. Secondly, clause 6 removes from the Act the time Umit on proceeding for damages. Thirdly, clause 8 sub-clause (1) introduces benefits for student chUdren aged 16 to 21 years. The Department of Social Security will shortly be opening discussions with interested parties in the shipping industry on the question of reviewing the Seamen's Compensation Act with a view to extending the compensation code for Commonwealth employees to seamen. I think those are the main points that need to be answered. I thank once again the honourable member for Canberra, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Martyr) and the honourable member for Grey for the interest that they have shown in this matter. I will convey to the Minister for Social Security the points that the honourable member for Grey raised most recently in this debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Hunt) read a third time. opposedCOMPENSATION (COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES) AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 30 November, on motion by Mr Hunt: That the Bill be now read a second time.

NA Currency Devaluation Motion (by Mr Hunt) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",80
131,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT," I think that most people are aware that fortunes have been made and are being made as a result of the devaluation of the currency. I raised the issue at question time, I think last Thursday, as to how much the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in view of his grazing interest, would have made out of devaluation, but he declined to answer the question. Accordingly I thought I would do a Uttle research as to the sort of interest he has in the grazing field. I have a document dated November of last year, so what I will read to the House goes back to November of last year. I think it is very important that we look at this document because it is well known that it was the moved Prime Minister's personal decision on the devaluation of the currency. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) himself and the Treasury were Mr Bourchier- I rise to order. Is it correct that this member for Chifley can make comments against the Prime Minister and cast aspersions on the decision that was made by the whole Government and not by him personally and then for the honourable member to start a personal attack on the Prime Minister's own particular financial situation?",82
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Lucock)Order! Mr Bourchier- Mr Deputy Speaker, I think that if an honourable member is prepared to stand up",83
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! There is no point of order.,83
134,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"I made the point that it is well known that the decision was made by the Prime Minister personally, not by the Treasurer and not even recommended by the Treasury and accordingly the question of pecuniary interest does arise. Mr Bourchier- I take a point of order.",83
135,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Right , from now on points of order will be taken against every speaker from the other side of the House.",83
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! I think it would help if the House came to order. I would suggest to the honourable member that his point of order must be valid. Mr Bourchier-Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think it is quite valid. The honourable member for Chifley made a statement that the decision was not made by anybody else but the Prime Minister. That is not a correct statement.",83
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member knows that that is not a point of order.,83
138,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to quote a few points from the document. The document speaks of 'Malcolm Fraser, in his own phrase a couple of months ago, is only ""average wealthy"".' Mr Bourchier- I rise to order.",83
139,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a deliberate attempt to stop me from speaking in this House. The honourable member who does that",83
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! I have twice said that the points raised by the honourable member for Bendigo in respect of a comment by the honourable member for Chifley are not points of order. Mr Bourchier- Mr Deputy Speaker, I think that you will agree with me that it is a rule of House that an honourable member cannot refer to another honourable member by his Christian names and surname. Honourable members have to be referred to by their ministerial rank or electorates. The honourable gentleman has referred to the Prime Minister as Malcolm Fraser. He should be referred to as the Prime Minister or the right honourable member for Wannon.",83
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! That is so unless an honourable member is quoting from a newspaper or report which mentions a member of parliament by his Christian name and surname.,83
142,Mr ARMHTAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Of course, the Fraser family has the Nareen property. The document states: The Fraser family acumen is better displayed in the operation of the Nareen enterprise by two separate legal ennties which give it tax advantages, and by the Fraser links with Rupert James ('Dick') Hamer, Victorian premier and skilled solicitor. The land and buildings are owned by Fraser Properties Pty Ltd, by now a well publicised entity. On 30 June 1974 its land and buildings stood at $640,683 and otherfixedassets at $3,350. It showed a net prolit of $480 after tax and paid a dividend of $430. In other words, tax dodging. The document goes on: The profits of Fraser Properties in 1974-and even less its accumulated losses since incorporation in 1966",83
143,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,Iriseto order.,83
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! In spite of the interjections which have made it a little difficult to hear completely what the honourable member for Chifley was saying. On the basis of what I have heard I would remind the honourable member that under Standing Orders all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on members are considered highly disorderly. I do not think that the honourable member for Chifley directly made an inference, except at one point where he used the phrase 'tax dodging' which could be considered to be a reflection. I would also say to the honourable member that there were implications in some of his remarks which I think would have gone fairly close to transgressing the Standing Orders. I would suggest that in future the honourable member might give consideration to that aspect.",83
145,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,My point of order was understanding order 76 with respect to the disgraceful remarks of the honourable member for Chifley.,83
146,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,I rise to order. The honourable gentleman is doing exactly that on which he takes a point of order. He is imputing improper this motives to the honourable member for Chifley and I would suggest that he ought to withdraw that remark.,83
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The that honourable member for Denison raised a point of order and cited a standing assume that in raising the point of order he left it to the Chair to decide as to whether that point order should be upheld.,84
148,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in raising the point of order the honourable Denison made comment about the honourable member for Chifley which was, in fact, exactly line with the point of order you had ruled on, that he imputed motives to a member of this E lace. I would suggest that the honourable memin er ought to be made to withdraw the remark made in respect of the honourable member for Chifley.",84
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I might have made that a mistake, but as I understand it I thought the honourable member said that the point of order that he had intended to raise was along the remarks. lines of the ruling and the decision that I had given. I was not aware of the fact that there was hope an imputation in what the honourable member that certain for Denison said-that there was a personal reflection in respect of the honourable member place for Chifley. Mr Armitage- I rise to order. The honourable Macarthur. member referred to the disgraceful remarks of the honourable member for Chifley. As is a reflection upon myself.
