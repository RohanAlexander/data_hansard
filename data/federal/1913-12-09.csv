[142] PERSONA LEXPLANATIONS .",12
1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I rise to make a personal explanation. The following paragraph, printed between inverted commas, was published in the Sydney Morning Herald of Monday, 1st December: 1 will just enlighten my friends in front as to the true history of the "" g a g "" as used by the Federal Government, and in doing so will brier an effectual reply to the fierce denunciations of Mr Hughes, who has lately been touring this State. It had been arranged between Mr. Andrew Fisher and myself that a truce should be arranged to permit of some of my members attending the funeral of an old colleague. While the Liberal members were absent on this duty, Mr Fisher attempted to take the control of affairs out of my hands. Knowing that my members would be back in a few hours, and that some of Mr Fisher's supporters were in Svdney, I determined to deal with Mr Fisher, and as soon as the Liberal members had returned effectually requited him for one uf the most despicable acts that has ever occurred in Parliament. I ask you was 1 not justified? The words that I have read are said to have been uttered by the Prime Minister at a meeting held at Liverpool on ths previous Saturday. As to his statement that an arrangement was made between him and me, there is not a word of truth in it - I had no knowledge of the facts referred to, and the Prime Minister knew that. I make this explanation now because, although in addressing an immense gathering in Sydney I made the correction, neither of the metropolitan daily newspapers published my statement, and my character is at stake. I was in no way aware that the remains of the lata Mr Knox were to be interred on the day referred to by the Prime Minister, and was not aware of the absence of any member at his funeral. The Prime Minister knew this when he spoke at Liverpool, because I have already made this explanation in this chamber, and honourable members can read what I have said in the Hansard record of this session, at page 2717.",12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Bea d it now.,12
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member may not quote from the Hansard report of the current session, except by in di- dulgence of the House.",12
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I knew nothing of the circumstances mentioned by the Prime Minister. The division was taken because I considered that an adjournment was the proper thing, following the practice and customs of the House.",12
5,Mr RILEV,Unknown,Did the right honourable member enter into any arrangement?,12
6,Mr FISHEE,Unknown,"No . I never spoke to .tke man, nor to anv one else, about tke matter.",13
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is quite true, as the honourable member, says, that he never "" spoke to the man '*-meanin g myself, I presume-no r did the "" m a n "" Bay that he had done so. What the "" man "" did say-if he may be permitted to explain-is this, that there had been an undertaking given by the Opposition Whip that no advantage would be taken of the absence of Ministerialists at the funeral. It is a pity adopted. that in our controversies we cannot preserve the ordinary amenities of debate. In my fiercest speeches when in Opposition I never so far forgot myself as to refer to the right honourable member for Wide Bay as anything but the head of the Government, or the Prime Minister.",13
8,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The words which I have read are between inverted commas. Did the honourable member see, them and correct the statement?",13
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not responsible for the inverted commas; I am responsible only for what-1 said. The statement is in substance' correct, except that I did not mention an understanding between the right honourable member and myself. I said that there was an understanding between the Government and Opposition Whips. Had I said anything further, it would have been to repeat the statement of a man who is now gone, but I did not Bpeak to the right honourable member, and made no agreement with him. Nothing was further from my thoughts than to say that. The fact remains that there was an undertaking between the Whips of the parties, and between the Whip and the honourable member's party in addition.",13
10,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,It was faithfully earried out. TRADE RECIPROCITY.,13
11,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It was reported in the Melbourne newspapers of yesterday or Saturday, in connection with a suggestion for reciprocal trade with France, that the Government is prepared to consider the establishment of reciprocity with any country. I do not know whether the Minister of Trade and Customs was correctly reported on the subject, but I ask Bum whether the negotiations for the establishment of reciprocal trade with New Zealand and Canada have gone any further, and whether the Government is likely to do more than consider the matter.",13
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Nothin g further has been done. 1I have not seen the paragraph regarding reciprocity with France, but I have not made any statement to the effect quoted. PRINTING COMMITTEE'S REPORT. Report (No. 2), presented by Mr. MCWILLIAMS, read by the Clerk, and NA MEMBERS.",13
13,Mr WATKINS,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I desire, through you, Mr Speaker, to ask a question of the honourable member for Robertson.",13
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"The honourable member is not entitled to ask a question of a private member unless that honourable member is in charge of a Bill, a motion, or other public matter on the notice paper.",13
15,Mr WATKINS,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,I was under the impression that similar questions had been asked.,13
16,Mr MCDONALD,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Do you rule, Mr. Speaker, that an honourable member cannot ask another honourable member a question ?",13
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Standing order 92 providesAfter notices have been given, questions may be put to Ministers of the Crown relating to public affairs, and to other members relating to any Bill, motion, or other public matter connected with the business on the notice-paper, of which such members may have charge. AMERICAN BASEBALL TEAMS. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is the Prime Minister aware that a party of eighty-five American tourists are now on their way to Australia by special steamer, via Japan and China, and are due at Brisbane on New Year's Day, and at Melbourne on the 6th January? As the party includes the New York Giants and Chicago White Sox baseball teams, some of whom are men of influence in America, and ten journalists, is it the intention of the Government to join with the States in doing what is fair in the form of entertainment to such a strong, representative body from our friends in America ?",13
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"This is the first intimation I have had of the advent to our shores of so celebrated a delegation. I hope we shall treat them as we treat all other visitors, with a cordial welcome. SUGAR BOUNTY.",14
19,Mr BAMFORD,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Can the Minister of Trade and Customs state definitely when the 2s. 2d. bounty, due on sugar cane delivered between the 1st May and 25th July this year, will be paid?",14
20,Mr GROOM,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I have the whole matter practically completed, and I hope make a definite announcement to-morrowbourne COMMONWEALTH RAILWAY DEparts PARTMENT. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It isrethat ported in one of the newspapers that Assistant Minister of Home Affairs says that all railway business now goes direct to the Minister of Home Affairs, and is .not sent to the Administrator at Canberra. Is the Minister aware that such was always done under my administrathe tion, and that the only things referred to the Manager of the Railways were a few that came up during the election campaign, and that only Federal Terriliminary tory matters were referred to Canberra? If other matters afterwards went to berra, my orders were violated. Mr. SPEAKER - Order ! That is going beyond a question.",14
21,Mr KELLY,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I have not seen the paragraph referred to. I can only form the honourable member that when I entered the Home Affairs Department I found that the honourable member had constituted the Secretary of the Departsible to do so. ment, whom he also made Administrator of the Federal Territory, Manager of the Commonwealth railways.",14
22,Mr KING OMALLEY,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,It was so the start.,14
23,Mr KELLY,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I found that some railoffice way papers were going up to the ministrator at Canberra, and as this intimes ? volved delay in dealing with urgent papers, and some circumlocution, I obthe viated it by having railway papers subdifficult mitted direct t'o myself. PAPUA ADMINISTRATION.",14
24,Dr MALONEY,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Has the attention of the Minister of External Affairs been drawn to an open letter directed to him, [142]- 2 and published in the Papuan Times, afc Port Moresby on the 19th November, in which credit is given to the Minister for the good work he has done in having a fcri-weekly service to the island, and for other matters which deserve a good deal of commendation? Can the Minister give a definite answer as to when the Government will consider the question of giving our White Australian compatriots in Papua the right to elect at least three members of the Council that governs the island ?",14
25,Mr GLYNN,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I have read the letter to to which the honourable member for Melrefers, and may say that, on a comparison of the conditions of other of the British Dominions in which elective councils exist, it seemed to me the request may be premature. It the will be considered in due course. NAVIGATION ACT.",14
26,Mr RILEY,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Is it the intention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to gazette Navigation Act before the end of the year, so that it may become law ?",14
27,Mr GROOM,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"It is quite impossible to do so. There is a great deal of prework to be done, which will make it'impossible to gazette the Act for Canseveral months to come. I refer to matters dealing with regulations, organization, and so forth. In the case of all measures like the Navigation Act months are occupied in getting a foundation beinfore a proclamation is issued. It is quite impossible to give an exact date on which this proclamation will be issued; it will be several months before it will be posBIN ALONG POST-OFFICE.  from General inform me what steps are being taken for the construction of a new postat Binalong, that I have asked for, Adand that has been promised so many",14
28,Mr AGAR WYNNE,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Arrangin g for building of this post-office is a very job, but I shall see what can be done in the matter. TELEPHONE EXCHANGES.",14
29,Mr AGAR WYNNE,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"A short time since, the honourable member for Wimmera asked me if I could give particulars of the loss on telephone exchanges, and I have had a return prepared. It is as follows : The loss on telephone exchanges of ,£173,812, which includes Central Office administration, interest and depreciation, is distributed as follows :Exchanges serving populations of over 100,000 ... ... 129,859 Exchanges serving populations of 10,000 up to 100,000 --- 3,515 Exchanges with more than 50 exclusive services serving populations under 10,000 ... 12,720 Exchanges with less than 50 exclusive services serving popu- . lations of less than 10,000 ... 27,718 The above figures are approximate only, but give a fair idea of the position.",14
30,Mr TUDOR,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"In view of the report which the Postmaster-General has presented in regard to the loss upon the telephone service, I desire to ask the honourable gentleman whether it is the intention of the Government to amend the telephone rates ?",15
31,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,Nearl y loss occurs i u connection with the city exchanges.,15
32,Mr TUDOR,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,Then let the rates be increased.,15
33,Mr AGAR WYNNE,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"In the first instance, I arn going to see what economies can be made. I think that the increase in the number of subscribers, the setting up of automatic telephone exchanges, and the adoption of a better system than has hitherto been followed will very nearly, at all events, make the telephone service pay. PAPUA: CONFLIC TWITH",15
34,Mr ATKINSON,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I desire to ask the. Minister of External Affairs whether he has received any report in regard to an expedition under a magistrate having come into conflict with the natives in Papua, and whether it is true, as rumoured, that in the affray ten natives were shot? Has anv inquiry been made, or is an inquiry likely to be instituted?",15
35,Mr GLYNN,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I have not had any report, nor have I read in the press any statement to the effect that there has been a raid or expedition. It may be that the rumour to which the honourable member refers relates to an expedition that went out to arrest the murderers of a Mr . Werner, who, on the north-east coast, met his death about two months ago. I have received a full report in regard to that expedition, in which some lives were lost, but I may say that the rule is that natives are never to be fired on except it Loss. Loss per Subscriber. becomes inevitable for the purposes of . £ £ s.A. self-defence, and that, in this matter of respect for human life, on the whole, I 2 2 0 think that there has been a pretty good 0 6 0 record on the side of the Administration. o 15 o CASE OF MR .

Chinn, who was employed as engineer in connection with the transcontinental railway, and, if they are correct, will he in form the House what action he proposes to take?",15
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,I know nothing all the beyond what I read in the newspapers this morning. TJNITED STATES TARIFF . RETALIATORY. DUTIES .,15
38,Mr HIGGS,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Will the Minister of Trade and Customs state whether it is true that the Customs authorities in Australia have received a message stating that it is the intention of the United States to collect retaliatory duties, and, if he has received such a message, will he lay it on the table of the House?",15
39,Mr GROOM,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"No such message has been received by the Department. We have nothing in the Department except a NATIVES. copy of the Tariff Bill as introduced in Congress, and a copy as printed in the Britisli Blue-Books. No copy of the Act has yet been obtained by us. We have made inquiries here from the proper authority, but have not been able to obtain any copies. In the Bill there are one or two clauses referring to what the honourable member described as retaliatory duties-that is. to say, the imposition of duties upon goods coming to the United States, where the country of export imposes a duty on similar goods from the Unibed States. Beyond that, we have no information in the Department. NORTHER N TERRITOR Y SHEEP .",15
40,Mr MATHEWS,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,Will th© Minister of External Affairs state whether the wandering sheep in the Northern Territory have yet been returned to the fold ?,16
41,Mr GLYNN,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"The sheep have reached Anthony's Lagoon, and the report of the Administrator, who saw them there, was that they were in good condition. They .cannot travel beyond that point until some rain falls. NAVIGATION ACT: EFFECT ON PORT DARWIN.",16
42,Mr FALKINER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,Has the Minister of External Affairs considered what v/ill be the effect upon Port Darwin of the proclamation of the Navigation Act?,16
43,Mr GLYNN,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,I have; and the question of how communication with Port Darwin will be affected by the Act has - given me some anxiety. ELECTORAL COMMISSION.,16
44,Mr HIGGS,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"In regard to the motion carried by this House some time ago for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the administration of the Electoral Act, I desire to know whether the Prime Minister has yet arrived at a decision as to what shall be the personnel of the Commission, and whether he will announce the names to the House?",16
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I have arrived at no decision yet, but there does not seem to me to be any overweening urgency for the appointment of that Commission, since the matter is already being investigated at the hands of a Select Committee appointed by another place. I hope, byand-by, however, to set up the Commission, and to let the House know its personnel. ESTIMATES: CORRECTION OF ERRORS.",16
46,Mr FINLAYSON,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I find that in my copy of the Estimates there has been inserted, since Friday last, a new page, to take the place of page 69, as first printed, in which an error appeared. I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he will have page 166 reprinted, since there is a mistake of £600 in the totals given on that page; also whether we may now take the figures as supplied as being final and correctf ",16
47,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I hope so. I believe that during the printing of the Estimates an unrevised page was inserted, and that, since Friday last, steps have been taken to put in the corrected figures on page 69. I was not aware that there was any other mistake, but I shall call attention to the honourable member's statement, and have thefiguresrevised. I may say that those set forth in the Budget speech are accurate, and that this inadvertence has occasioned much regret to myself, and also to the Treasury.",16
48,Mr MCDONALD,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I wish to put a question to you, Mr Speaker. I - find that some person has been tampering with the Estimates submitted to us and laid upon the table of the House.",16
49,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,They were not laid on the table of the House; they were only supplied to members.,16
50,Mr MCDONALD,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,Member s have been supplied with what purport to be correct copies of the Estimates laid on the table of this House.,16
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,No ; it is quite a different thing.,16
52,Mr MCDONALD,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"The Estimates were laid upon the table of the House, and members are supposed to have been supplied with, correct copies for their consideration.. I find that page 69 has been obliterated by the pasting of another on top of it .",16
53,Mr FISHER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"That is the way of it , is it?",16
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,That matter has just been referred tn.,16
55,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Not every copy has been treated in that way, but only a few.",16
56,Mr MCDONALD,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"There is one page, and that is enough for met",16
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,The majority of the copies are all right. I did not alter it.,16

63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,Order I The matter cannot be debated. ' Mr MCDONALD - I have no desire to debate it.,17
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"How long, Mr. Speaker, can an honourable member continue to ask a question?",17
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,Order ! The honourable member's question has been prolonged by interjections.,17
66,Mr MCDONALD,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,I ask on whose authority this obliteration of the original sets of Estimates has taken place ?,17
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"I was not aware until now that there had beeu any alteration made. I know nothing of the matter personally. I am informed that the original Estimates which were laid on the table of the House were correct, but that there was an error in some of the copies supplied to honourable members. I knew nothing of the matter until it was mentioned just now.",17
68,Mr FISHER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"Do you not think, Mr. Speaker, that the error should have been publicly announced immediately it was discovered ?",17
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO PRIVATE,"That, I think, should be doue by a Minister-by the Treasurer. . Mr FISHER - Hear , hear! NA RAILWAY.",17
70,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it due to lack of funds, or what is the reason, that such slow progress is being made with the transcontinental railway at the Kalgoorlie end?",17
71,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The slow progress at the Kalgoorlie end is due to circumstances following papers: over which, unfortunately, the Department has no control.",17
72,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I believe no rails have been laid since May. ATMOSPHERE OF THE CHAMBER.,17

75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"The Department has made a special feature of the collection and classification of newspaper cuttings on all subjects of Commonwealth and State interest, but a special classification of suicides is not kept, and it is not possible, therefore, to give the particulars desired.

SECOND READING . ; Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [3.35] - I move That this Bill be now read a second lime. I do not think that the Bill is in the motest way a party matter. As honorof able members are aware, the first conheld, sideration in regard to the establishment of the national note issue was that we should have an easy, and safe currency, which secure the confidence of the public. The issue was founded on a gold basis. The main consideration for a national issue was, as I said, that there should be excess of £7,000,000. a currency in which the public should have confidence, especially'in times rest. Financiers are unanimous solid gold reserve is essential to a note issue. It was very unwise on the part of our predecessors, after acting in accord acted upon ? with the advice of the banking community of Australia in regard to the fact, amount of gold reserve, to have taken upon themselves, without any necessity, so far as I know, to act contrary to that issue. advice. I am of opinion that the vice given by the banking community in that regard was disinterested; might be construed as being contrary to their own interests. I may fairl that it was given solely in the interests of the financial stability of Australia. All Governments are naturally allured by cent. the prospect of having a large sum of money available for public works without having to pay for it . . Mr FISHER - What nonsense! You cannot get it without"" paying for it .",17
76,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"The honourable honourable friend. member will be able to say that it sense when he gets up to speak. not polite of him to say it now. Governments are anxious to secure siderable sums annually as interest capital belonging to other people. one can deny that the note issue of every country in which there is only a limited amount of gold kept as security is a forced levy, and it is naturally very i portant and valuable to a country to have a lot of money available without having can foresee. to pay anything for it , but this consideration must be subordinated to the necesaway £25,000 a year. sity of having a proper financial security. Under the Act, as we propose to amend it by this Bill , tliere will never than five and a quarter million pounds, plus the compound interest on the investment of this money, available for investment. Of course, 'honourable members can see that the interest and compound interest on this sum will eventually reach a very considerable total. In other words, rethe difference between the fiduciary issue £5,250,000, for which no gold will be and the total amount of the note issue, no matter how large it is, will always be held in gold. 'Under the Act convenient, of 1910, introduced by my right honourable would friend opposite, it was requisite to hold a reserve of gold to the extent of one-fourth of the notes up to £7,000,000, and pound for pound in gold for all notes in In 1911, this Act was amended, so that it is necessary of unnow to keep in gold only 25 per cent, that a of the total value of the notes.

79,Sir JOHNFORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"I understand that 25 per cent, was the .minimum, no maximum being fixed.

We are conmaking this proposal, not because it on is considered at the present time that No the issue is unsafe, but in order to provide for the future.

We should, take into consideration, in dealing with this: matter, all the factors which may cause' financial stress, and must estimate what amount of notes would remain in circulation under all adverse circumstances. We should make every endeavour to arrive at that circulation which we think wil l be the least that is likely to occur, and having arrived at a conclusion as to that point, I think we must keep pound for pound i h gold above that amount. The experience of the world shows that in financial matters we must "" g a n g w a r i l y ."" We shall act wisely if we. model our systemon others that have been well tried, instead of entering upon, doubtful experiments.",19

85,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"The honourable member, like myself, comes from a Conservative country and a Conservative race. We cannot afford to disregard the experience of others.' Let me deal first with the nnancial system of. Great Britain. The fiduciary issue of the Bank of England, that is, the issue against which no gold is held, amounts to £18,450,000. ' For all notes issued in excess of that sum the bank is compelled 6d hold £ 1 for £ 1 in gold. On the 5th November last, its position was as foll o w s : - Notes issued, £53,597,130; securities held, without £18,450,000; gold, £35,147,130; total, £53,597,130. The gold reserve is the difference between the fiduciary issue and the value of the notes in circulation. In Canada, in respect to the first 30,000,000 dol., or about £6,000,000 of Dominion notes, thero must be held a reserve of 25 per cent, in gold and securities guaranteed' by the British Government. amount held in gold musfc be, afc least, 15 per cent, of the value of the Dominion notes issued upto30,000,000 dol., that is, £900,000'. For any notes issued in excess of a value of 30,000,000 dol., or £6,000,000, the Government must holddollar for dollar, that is,. £ 1 for £ 1 , in gold. We propose that for notes' issued in excess of £7,000,000 there shall be a reserve of £ 1 for £ 1 in gold. The financial system cirof the United States of America is somewhat complicated, its currency not being regarded as a good^one; but the Americans have seen the wisdom of keeping I good reserves, against Government issues. There are several kinds of currency there; First comethe greenbacks. They were originally issued during the Civil War, and circulated at a discount during the suspension of specie payments between1-862 and 1879. They are widely known by name, but form only a small part of the paper currency of the United States of America. By law their maximum cir>dilation is limited to 346,681,016 dol., or about £71,000,000. Against the issue of greenbacks, the Treasury is compelled to hold a reserve in gold of 150,000,000' dol., or about £31,000,000, that is, a reserve of 43 per cent. The gold certificates constitute another form of currency, their lowest denomination being 10 dol. The Treasurer holds against Conservathem dollar for dollar in gold. On the 30th. June,. 1912, the gold certificates amounted to 943,435,618 dol., or about £194,000,000, against which there was a reserve of the same amount held in gold. We are dealing now with a great country, whose people speak our language, and are progressive and desirous of doing all that is possible to. promote their advancement, yet fchafc is the reserve fchey hold in gold against the issue of gold certificates. There are also silver certificates, which, on the 30th June, 1912, amounted to 469,224,400 dol., or about- £96,000,000. Th? wholeo f these certificates were represented by gold, silver dollars in the Treasury vaults. These dollars-, if sold as metal, would, at present prices return 45 per cent, of their face value. There is,, further, a. small issueof Treasury notes, the remnant of notes issued under the Sherman Act of 1890'. On the 30tli June> 1912,. there were incirculation 2,915,570of these notes, or about £600,000. The re. The serve againstthese notesis held in the Treasury in silver dollars, itsmetallic value being about 45per eent. of the value of the notes. Lastly, there arethe) National Bank notes,, which are not issued by the Government.. Every National Bank has authority to issue notes rap' to a value not exeeding the par value of the United States' bonds which it has - deposited in the Treasury. Should the market value .of the bonds f all below pax, - the note issue must not exceed that value. There as a further limitation which prevents .a .bank from issuing notes of .a value .exceeding the amount of its capital .stock atctuaMy paid up.. A bank is not required to keep any particular reserve of money aigaiust dfcs notes, - but it is required to keep in the Treap^ry a sum equal to 5 per cent, of the circulation. Of course, the banks have also reserves against their general liabilities. On the 1st September, 1911, the issue of t h * National Bank notes was valued at 69',982,033 dol., or about £143,000,000, »-nd on that date the National Banks !<eld 895,475,406 dol., or about £184,000,000 in coin. Government paper money, and clearing house - certificates, while their total liabilities amounted to 8,448,024,889 dol., or £1,736,000,000. The total amount of Government paper money in - circulation in the TJnited States of America on the 30th June, 1912, and the reserves held for redemption purposes was: ""Notes in circulation: greenbacks, 337,697,321 d o l . ; gold certificates, 943,435,618 d o l . ; silver certificates, 469,224,400 d o l . ; Treasury notes, 2,915,570 d o l . ; totalling 1,753,272,909 dol., or £360,000,000. The metallic value of the reserves held against those notes was: Greenbacks, 150,000,000 dol.; gold certificates, 943,435,618 d o l . ; silver certificates, "" 214,546,000 d o l . ; Treasury notes, 1,333,000 dol., being metallic reserves of a total value of 1,309,314,618 dol., or £269,000,000. The value of the metallic reserves held against Government notes in circulation in the United States represents nearly 75 per cent, of the amount of the notes. Many features of the American note issues are unsatisfactory, but at least it can be said that Americans have recognised the necessity for keeping very substantial reserves against Government issues. The question of currency reform is now before Congress. Both in Great Britain and in Canada the principle has been recognised that, after a certain point has been reached in the circulation, gold must be stored to meet the full amount of the issue above that point. In the United States, also, the reserves are of a very substantial character. The purpose of this Bill is to bring Australia into line with Great Britain and Canada in this matter. That is our only object. It is not a political matter, so far as I can see. It is not a matter in which ianything as .desired except .security. I know it as <wtery .convenient vto have a lar,g.e amount <of imonej which wte should otherwise have to raise.",19
86,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,What has that to do with the point.?,20
87,Sir JOHNFORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,It has a great deal to do with it . It was the only point the honourable member 'had m - his viewthat a large amount of money would be available for public works.,20
88,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,I did not use it. I left it all to you to 'bungle with.,20
89,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"The honourable member is not too complimentary. Perhaps his'deserts'are far greater than mine. I am not finding fault with him. I know that while he was in office he always - kept 40 per cent, cr ovei of reserves. I believe ho. gave an undertaking to that effect.",20
90,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,A verbal promise.,20
91,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"And that has not been departed from since he left office. It was quite open to us to act in accordance with the law if we so desired, but we did not do so. In estimating the amount of Australian notes which will probably always remain in circulation, we must look at the amount in circulation when the issue was in the hands of the banks before we undertook the business. The following are the average figures for the June quarter in the following years:1901 --£3,399,00 0 1906 -^3,244,000 1902 - 3,305,000 .1907 - 3,563,000 1903 - 3,315,000 ' 1908 - 3,536,000 1904 - 3,133,000 1909 - '3,510,000 .1905 - 3,036,000 . 1910 - 3,748,000 These figures do not include the Queensland Treasury notes, which, on the 30th June, 1910, amounted to £1,579,000, of which £815,000 were held by the public, and £764,000 by the banks. Including the Queensland notes held by the public, the total amount in circulation on the 30th June, 1910, was £4,563,000. It must not be forgotten that the notes of the banks were all held by the public, whereas the Australian notes are not all held by the public, a great number of them being held by the banks as til l money, which, I fchink, accounts principally f o i the difference between the amount of the circulation in 1910 and the apparent present circulation.",20
92,Mr ARCHIBALD,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,The 'banks did not pay duty on their t ill money previously.,20
93,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,No ; because the notes were not in circulation; and I do not .see why they should pay for what they did not use.,20
94,Mr FENTON,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,The banks had a very cunning way of evading the duty.,21
95,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"To some people, banks seem tc be like a red rag to a bull. I have always looked upon banks as friends. I have never had any trouble in dealing with banks.",21
96,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,Perhaps the right honourable gentleman will say why the banks take the notes when they do not require them.,21
97,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"The transport of gold is not easy in a country like this, and it is far better, and more convenient, for the banks to have notes than to hold a lot of gold; also the temptation to robbery is not so great with notes as with gold.",21
98,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,Will the right honourable gentleman make it plain that the banks are not compelled to take the notes unless it suits them to do so?,21
99,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"The banks certainly find it convenient to do so. If they did not find it to their interests, they would not take them. On the 30th November, 1911, the Australian notes in circulation amounted to £9,899,000, and of this the banks held £6,058,129 in their tills. On the 8th September, 1913, the circulation of Australian notes was £9,266,408, and on the basis of the figures of the 30th November, 1911, it would appear that the banks at present hold in their tills about £5,559,000, leaving only £3,707,000 in the hands of the public. It seems safe to say that the note issue of the Commonwealth will not be likely to fall below £8,500,000, being, say, £4,500,000 held by the banks, and £4,000,000 held by the public. That is the minimum we think we are likely to have, even in any usual conditions, but we must consider the possibility of great iiuancial stress. As I have already said, under this Bill the fiduciary issue of the Commonwealth will be £5,250,000. It will never be any more. Just as the Bank of England has a fiduciary issue of £18„450,000, so the fiduciary issue of Australia will be £5,250,000, and for that amount there will be no gold held. The first £7,000,000 of the issue will be divided thusFiduciary issue ... .. --- £5,250.000 One-fourth of first £7,000,000 to be held in gold ... ... ... I would like to point out we have a se? curity which, I think, I advocated when I was thinking of this measure, and that is the power to raise money by Treasury bills for redeeming or paying Treasury notes.",21
100,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,That is as old as the hills.,21
101,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"It may be, but it is very valuable.",21
102,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,It was passed twenty years ago in Queensland.,21
103,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"I do not see the need for this interjection when I am saying something with which the honourable member agrees. I think it is a very valuable power, because if there is a run oh the Treasury, and there is any money to be obtained anywhere, the Treasurer will be able to arrange by a negotiable document for money to redeem or pay the notes. It is a good power, and a great power, but I hope it will never be required. However, it may be found to be useful if ever the time comes; but I think it is better to rely on the resources of the strong-room, for all contingencies.",21
104,Mr ARCHIBALD,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,It is no good relying on that. The Bank of England could not.,21
105,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"If the honourable member has those views, he should advocate having all the gold in. Bufc we do not keep all the gold in reserve, because it is convenient for us to have the use of the fiduciary issue for our public works of a reproductive nature. Thafc is whafc the money isfcherefor; that was our friend's intention.",21
106,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,It was all lent to the States.,21
107,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"Yes , but we were fco gefc it back as soon as fchere was need to pay for the trans-Australian railway. How else could we pay for that railway, or for any of the other works in hand ? Will the honourable member answer me that?",21
108,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"We could borrow on the open market. Sir JOHN ' FORREST - But the Leader of the Opposition claims that he believes in borrowing from ourselves, which means borrowing from the note issue; that is the only means he would have of paying for these works, except by paying for them out of revenue. 1,750,000 Mr FISHER - You had a surplus of £7,000,00 0 £2,250,000 left to you.",21
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"That is out of revenue, as ' I have said. The system of holding pound for pound in gold in respect of an issue in excess of £7,000,000 has received the support of the prominent bankers of Australia. At the time of the passing of the Bill, in 1911, many protests were made which did not have, from their point of view, the desired effect.",22
110,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,They were against it altogether.,22
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"As I have already said, I believe their advice was disinterested; that it was advice given in the interests of the country.",22
112,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,They were not unanimous.,22
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"I shall not say much more about this Bill. It will be a declaration to the people in Australia, and elsewhere far beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, that the chief consideration we have in view is safety, and not altogether one of profit. I repeat that our main object is that there shall be a currency in which the public shall have confidence in times of financial unrest. The desire to "" borrow from ourselves "" is all very well, so far as it goes; but we must not forget that it means that we are borrowing from moneys supplied by financial institutions and others in this country, in return for paper money, which we give them, with a promise to redeem it on demand. We are getting this money from these institutions, paying them ""nothing for it, aud investing it. None of the interest that we obtain by investing it goes to the credit of those who have supplied it to us.",22
114,Mr THOMAS,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,Do they not get a £1 note for every sovereign-a note that is equally as good as a sovereign 1,22
115,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"It is as good as a sovereign here, but nowhere else.",22
116,Mr THOMAS,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,The banks need not take these notes if they do not want to do so.,22
117,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,I do not wish to aVgue the point. All that I say is that our paper is not a security in other parts of the world.,22
118,Mr WEST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,Why trouble about other parts of the world i,22
119,Sir JOHN FORREST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"The honourable member makes me think that I know absolutely nothing, because he knows so much more than I do. I wish to say, in conclusion, that the main object we have inview is that there shall be a currency in existence in which the public can have confidence in times of financial unrest, and that the desire to borrow from ourselves must not be our first consideration, but must rather be subordinated to the financial stability of the Commonwealth.",22
120,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,Wide Bay) [4.27] - I understand that it is the intention of the Government to agree to the adjournment of the debate; but I should like to speak for a few minutes before asking leave to continue.,22
121,Mr SPEAKER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"Will the honourable member permit me to explain that the motion carried previously was, as I understood, that after the second reading had been moved the House would go into 'Committee on the Senate's amendments in the Loan Bill.",22
122,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"Were those words put in? I think not. The Prime Minister told me across the table that, after the Treasurer had moved the second reading of the Bill, the debate would be adjourned, and other business would be called on. I shall not speak at length. I disagree entirely with the statement made by the Treasurer that the primary object of the Australian Note Issue Act was to provide funds for investment in Commonwealth and other securities. The purpose and object which we had in view was to create an absolutely secure paper currency, which, backed up by the resources of the Commonwealth, would be as good as gold itself. The Treasurer has dealt with the metallic reserves or the currency of the various countries, and has suggested that there is a danger in holding the minimum reserve of 25 per cent, against the Australian currency. I think that he is wrong. Nineteen years of experience in Queensland has taught successive State Treasurers, no matter to what party they have belonged-me n who are totally disinterested in the matter-that a gold reserve of not less than 25 per cent, is ample and sufficient to meet all emergencies. That has always been recognised as meaning a working gold reserve of anything from 33 per cent, down to 30 per cent., so that the Treasurer has been able to invest a large amount, and the State has secured a revenue from it . The Treasurer of the Commonwealth is now proposing to give up £25,000 this year, while, in respect of every £1,000,000 increase in the note issue in the future, he is prepared to give up £40,000 of revenue that rightly belongs to the Commonwealth. He is going to do this, he says, because there is some danger. I do not wish to misrepresent liim, but the Treasurer iterated and reiterated the statement that there was a danger of the gold reserve proving insufficient at a time of financial crisis. I do not agree with him. The right honourable gentleman spoke of the representations made to him by certain bankers, who, I may say, I asked to meet me when I held office as Treasurer because they had written so much in opposition to our proposal. I had frequent conferences with them; but not one of these bankers said one word in favour of an Australian note issue of any kind. They' were all against the proposal, and made no secret of their antagonism. was one absent from their number, .a banker of considerable eminence- I refer to Mr Ralston, the general manager of the Queensland National Bank. knew his opinion on the subject, and I know that it has never varied. Ralston was the one man in that institution who saw the collapse coming. He predicted it , and he was the one man whom, when the collapse did come, every person interested in the bank desired to see appointed as general manager. is its general manager today, and the bank stands high among the financial institutions of the Commonwealth. But Mr Ralston does - not object to a gold reserve of not less than 25 per cent. I was sorry to hear the Treasurer speak of the note issue as having been established to provide money to be invested in Commonwealth securities. As a matter of fact, he is a happy man today because this money is available.",22
123,Sir JOHN POBKEST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,But that is not the point.,23
124,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"The Notes Fund was invested otherwise before now. It was invested with the States, and could have been invested in British consols. It was earning lately an average of about 4 per cent., whereas the Treasurer is borrowing from it at 3£ per cent. I should like to see him go into the money market, even with all the resources of the Commonwealth behind him, and try to borrow money here at the same rate.",23
125,Mr WEST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,He would have to pay about 4 | per cent.,23
126,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"I am not speaking now from any party point of view. The Government are borrowing from this Trust Fund for at least £ per cent, less than the rate at which they can borrow in the open market today. The Trust Fund is thus being depleted, and depleted openly by virtue of an Act of Parliament. There is also in the Notes Act a provision by which all the - earnings from the investment of the Notes Fund are allowed to accumulate. They cannot be paid into the Consolidated Revenue and used. At the present time the accumulated interest and compound interest amounts to £355,000, and in a few years the .earnings from the investment of the Trust Funds and the accumulated interest-if the system is not destroyed by the Ministry, and those who tliink with them - will more than cover the face There value of the note issue itself. As to the amount represented by notes in circulation, I believe the statement made by the Treasurer is an exaggeration. I I think that an attempt has been made to arrive at an honest statement of the posiMr tion, but I am satisfied that there are far more notes in circulation, and that there would be still more if they were put out as they ought to be.",23
127,Mr FENTON,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"Did Queensland have a note issue of £4,000,000? He Mr FISHER - The Queensland note issue was on a different basis. TJnder the Commonwealth Act no bank or person is asked tq take a note unless application is made at the Treasury for a Commonwealth note and gold is presented in exchange for it. The Government say, in effect, to the people, "" You are not asked to bring the gold to the Treasury unless you wish to obtain notes for your own convenience, but should you do so, we shall be glad to see you whenever you Wish to convert your notes into gold."" Any one who hints that the issue is a forced one to obtain money for the Commonwealth, or for investment purposes, has never read the Act, or discussed the matter with those who are familiar with its purport. Queensland, having been used to a State note issue; uses twice as many notes per capita as are used in Victoria and elsewhere, where the people have been accustomed to a gold currency. Can we wonder at the citizens of Victoria desiring a gold currency, having regard to the fact that a little over twenty years ago they were left with the paper of private banks, which was worth less than its face value? The same state of affairs occurred more or less in every State.",23
128,Sir ROBERT BEST,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"There is only one instance on record of the paper of any Victorian bank not being good, and that was a very insignificant bank.",24
129,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERI NE,"Whil e that is true, the worker, or any man of little means, who held the paper of these banks at the. time, was robbed of half its face value, because he could not afford to wait the time necessary for him to get 20s. in the £ 1 . I do not want to have to go into the whole history of these matters again. Those who could afford to hold the paper money in question had it honoured at its face value in time. A national currency will prevent that. A currency, whether it consists of copper, silver, gold, or paper, should have the resources of the nation behind it, and should always be redeemable at its face value. I was apprehensive, owing to the constant repetition by the Treasurer of the statemeut that this was a convenient way of obtaining money as Commonwealth loans, that certain people, quite honest in their intentions, might believe that this was a forced issue for that very purpose. ask leave tocontinue my speech on a future occasion.

132,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"SwanTreasurer) [4.43] - I propose, after making a few observations, to move that the amendments by the Senwith. First, I should like to refer to the excision of the two items of the schedule. Without saying anything in regard to the constitutional powers of the Senate, I may say (on that it seems somewhat unusual, in our procedure at any rate, for another place to interfere in this way with the financial arrangements of the House. I regret the fact very much, because, although it (on may not appear a very great matter to honourable senators, it reminds one of the fable of the boy and the frogs-wha t may be sport to them is very troublesome to us. The Senate is not the financial (on House-at any rate, it cannot originate expenditure-and it is peculiar that it should mangle or excise items from the schedule of an important measure sent down by the House of Representatives, and thereby interfere with the financial note issue. control of the Commonwealth, and upset the financial arrangements of the Governtoo ment. It is not enough to say that Senate has the power to do this; we all go elsewhere. have powers which we do not exercise, and I must express my very great regret that the position should be as it is. Whatever Government may be in power, it deserves a good deal of consideration from the States' House in regard to finances. In the present case we cerhave tainly deserve more consideration than we have received in our efforts to on the services of the Commonwealth they were left to us by our predecessors. We have not resorted to increased taxafor tion, nor tried in any way to place addiand tional burdens on the people of the B country. On the other hand, we have, under very difficult conditions, and i very short time, done our best to carry on the services. I , myself, have that the Senate will reconsider this matagainst ter when the Bill is returned.",24
133,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I hope it will not!,25
134,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member were in the place of the Government, he would, not express such an opinion as to the action of a majority of members opposed to him in another place. I think the honourable member would use very much stronger words than I intend to use-as a fact, I do not i tend to use any strong words;-in regard to the situation. I should like to with the two items omitted from the schedule. The first item I refer to that of £300,000 for the purchase laud for defence purposes. that amount there is £44,600 for the E urchase of land for rifle ranges in outh Wales. What is the use of spendarea at Liverpool for £112,000. ing our money on our land forces unless we have rifle ranges on which our young people who are being trained to arms may practice? What is the use of equipping an army with good rifles and good ammuno nition if they cannot shoot straight? This House has times out of number imTomaree, pressed upon the Government the necesfor sity for rifle ranges, but our friends who represent the States in another place that we must not borrow money fro m ourfor selves for that purpose. It is not as we proposed to go on to the market for the money. We are doing what my righ t honourable friend, the Leader of the position, often boasted about, borrowing from Trust Funds that we have in hand, but practically almost altogether from-the",25
135,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"You said you were not sure about it when the Bill was before the the House, and that you might have to",25
136,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I did' not say that we had to go elsewhere. I said we should do it somehow, but we are going to borrow this money from ourselves, and to get it practically for nothing. We to pay for it , but we pay the interest to ourselves, and it goes into the Trust carry Funds, and enlarges them. There is a as sura of £6,000 for the purchase of land 1 for a rifle range at Adamstown, £5,600 land for a rifle range at Bathurst, £3,000 for land for a rifle range at u l l i ; whilst an item of £30,000 appears for purchasing land for a new metropolin a tan rifle range in Sydney. T would ask the honourable member for East Sydney to a hope think of his native city, and not to vote these items, when we can get the money practically for nothing by borrowing it from ourselves. The existing ranges at Randwick and Long Bay are now overtaxed, and a new range to provide for an additional 200 targets is now required, while provision must be made for the extension of the Citizen Forces during the next few years. I think the land required in this case is already purn - chased. There is an item of £2.500 for the purchase of land for a rifle range at deal Redbank, Queensland, and £1,200 for the same purpose at Narrogin, in Wesis tern Australia. The total for rifle ranges of in New South Wales, Queensland, and Included in Western Australia is £48,300. I now come to military purposes generally. We New have agreed to buy land for a manoeuvre This was a bargain made by the Fisher Government, who lef t us to pay for it , the land being obtained from private people. Unless this vote is passed, there will be money legally available to pay for it . There is an item of £50C for land at in New South Wales, and £4,500 land at Enoggera, Queensland, for buildings, and to provide grazing for resay mount horses. There is a sum of £5,000 the acquisition of additional land at if Keswick, South Australia, to provide accommodation for buildings for remount sub-dep6t, stables, and buildings, for the OpRemount A r m y Service Corps. There is £7,000 for land for a remount depot at Launceston, Tasmania; £1,250 for land for a Naval Reserve d r i ll hall at Will liamstown, Victoria ; and £1,100 for a Naval Reserve d r i ll hall at Albany, Western Australia. It is proposed to spend £120,350 in the various States, and in the Federal Territory, on the following four items: - Acquisitio n of sites for drill halls, mobilization stores, and other accommodation for Citizen Forces, £ 7 0 , 3 5 0; ""sites for ordnance stores, £ 1 quisition of land for buildings for Aviation Corps, £ 1 0 , 0 0 0; and acquisition of land for Commonwealth purposes at Jervis Bay, £25,000. The whole of these items make £300,000 for the purchase of land for defence purposes. Honourable members i u another place have passed six items out of eight, including £170,000 to purchase land for post-offices, but they have excised the item of £300,000 to buy land for defence purposes. Land is a most permanent and valuable asset,- the foundation of all wealth, and, as a rule, increases in value. It has increased in value, at any rate, in Australia up to the present time. The whole trouble in regard to this matter arises from a fetish in the minds of my honourable friends opposite, and their friends in another place, that borrowing for anything connected with defence ought not to be allowed for a moment. That idea has no reasonable or logical foundation.",25
137,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What did Gladstone say about 'that ?,26
138,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no doubt he said something wise, but, as an old fellow told me once when I was a boy, and said I thought he was blowing hot and cold- "" circumstances cases."" I do not see the least difference between borrowing for one thing and borrowing for another, in the way of land, at any rate. I do not see how it can be right to borrow money from ourselves to provide machinery to build warships, or to construct conduits, or to ' buy land for post-offices, or to buy land in London on which to erect Commonwealth offices, or at Perth for a post-office, or at Canberra for general purposes, and at the same time be wrong to borrow money to buy land for these very necessary defence purposes.",26
139,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The one is productive and the other is not.,26
140,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know that there is much return to be obtained from some of those items. Surely, rifle ranges and manoeuvre areas are required. The other item is the sum of £400,000 for the construction of a railway fro m Pine Creek to Katherine River. I can hardly blame my honourable friends opposite for the omission of that item by another place, because I believe they are all in favour of it , but they have great influence, I understand, in that quarter, as well as here.",26
141,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Are the Government sin5 , 0 0 0; ac- cere in this item?",26
142,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We brought it forward, and I am asking that it be restored .",26
143,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not a single Government supporter voted for it in another place, in addition'to the two Ministers.",26
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How many voted against it?,26
145,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On e Government supporter was preseni, and if he had voted for it , the item would have been passed.",26
146,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then I think he ought to have voted for it . The honourable member asks if we are in earnest in this matter. In the policy statement of the Government it was definitely set out thab the survey for the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine was'nearly completed, and that a Bill would be submitted to authorize the construction of the line. It was also clearly stated that a trial survey was being made for connecting by railway Port Darwin with Port Augusta, vid the Macdonnell Ranges, and with the eastern railway systems, vid Camooweal, so as to open up the country for agricultural and pastoral settlement. This proposal is part of a great project connecting the Northern Territory with alter the rest of the Commonwealth. This policy has, I think, received the support of practically all parties in this Parliament. I find the Northern Territory a very difficult problem, one of the most difficult we have to deal with, and an immense expenditure is necessary if we are going to make it reproductive in a short time. So long as I can see daylight ahead, I always say, "" Go ahead,"" in regard to great projects that can be made reproductive, but I confess that, with the information before me, I have a difficulty in the case of the Northern Territory.",26
147,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then you are not very keen on this item of £400,000?",26
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , I am. I have come to the conclusion that we can do nothing with that country unless we> open it up by giving it means of transit. If we do not want to leave it waste, we must build railways through it . We must either give the Territory back to the kangaroos and the blackfellows, or provide means of transit, though I do not see how the country can be made to give a quick return for the expenditure upon it . It is not as well watered as I thought it was, and, indeed, the more I investigate the problem of its development, the more difficult it seems. The last Minister of External Affairs, speaking upon the Bill to authorize the survey of a route for the extension of the line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River, saidWe are legally, as well as morally, bound at some lime to connect Pine Creek with the Port Augusta and Oodnadatta railway. . . . The policy of the Government is to have the survey made as soon as possible, in order that we may come down with a proposal for the immediate construction of this 56 miles of railway. . . . We feel that a proposal which practically means a direct expenditure of £500,000 will be a fair and legitimate instalment to go on with. therefore ask the House to pass the Bill . Senator MCG r e g o r , addressing himself to the same Bill in the Senate, saidWe practically pledge ourselves construction of the line. To my mind, this railway is. urgently required, and ought to bp proceeded with as rapidly as possible. He made other similar remarks, with which I shall not trouble the Committee. The Bill was passpd in this House without division, and, I believe, went tlirough the Senate in the same way. The route of the line has been surveyed at a cost-of £6,000, but the line will take another two and a half years to construct, because of the remoteness of the district, the difficulty of getting labour, and other causes. The obstacles in the way of making the Northern Territory self-supportiug are many and great.",26
149,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The l i g h t honourable gentleman did not say that eighteen months ago.,27
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , I did ; and T told the honourable member what he ought to do. I think that my remarks had some influeuce with him, because I was not speaking without knowledge and experience. Mr Deakin, when Prime Minister, asked me whether I thought we should take over the Northern Territory, and I have no doubt that, had I replied that we ought not to have anything to do with it , he probably would not have moved further in the matter, because he relied on me a good deal in these things. However, I advised him to take it over, though I said, "" I do not know what we shall do with the Territory wben we have got it . "" Certainly we must open it up by means of railways.",27
151,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The problem is not too big for Australia to face.,27
152,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; but there is a desire for a quick return from expenditure. The Senate, by amending the Loan Bill , reversed a policy to which many senators were already bound. The Government has a right to expect from the other branch of the Legislature, as the States' House, the utmost consideration and support, especially in carrying out its financial arrangements. Every one knows that financial difficulties exist. Probably we should not have put some of the items into the Loan Bill had we been able to get the money from ordinary revenue without increasing taxation. I had great difficulty in making both ends meet when preparing the Budget, and I I believe that I reduced the demands of the Departments by more than £2,000,000.",27
153,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is it not always the case that the Departments ask for more than to vote for the can be given to the in ?,27
154,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that the demand on this occasion was greater than usual. We have had unexampled prosperity and good seasons during the last three years, and our expenditure has increased as the revenue has expanded. I have had other experience of that. I was Premier and Treasurer of a small State, which I saw rise from insignificance to a position of some importance, and I know that its expenditure increased as quickly as its revenue. Notwithstanding the increase of revenue, we have not been able to do more than we have done, and, having: Trust Funds in hand from which we caii borrow, I think that we are pursuing the best course possible. We are not going on to the market to borrow small sums, thus, perhaps, in j u r in g our credit; we already have the money in our hands. This is simply a bookkeeping transaction. I see no reason why we should not use the money, and carry out works that have to be done. We are applying £170,000 to the purchase of land for-post offices; £300,000 to the purchase of land for defence; £425,000 to the construction of conduits; and £175,000 to the purchase of machinery for Cockatoo Island, these sums totalling £1,070,000. I ask honourable members how we can carry out the great works that have been spoken of if we do not borrow; works like the Naval Bases at Cockburn Sound, Westernport, and Port Stephens, where we shall have to spend millions in providing docks for the accommodation of not merely our own warships, but also those of the Empire. i l r . FISHER - When will the money be paid back, if it has to be borrowed in time of peace?",27
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We must make this provision in time of peace. The right honourable member, I suppose, would impose more taxation on the people. But the land tax of which the Labour party is so proud produces only £1,500,000.",28
156,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Mak e it produce more. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - The money - cannot be got without ruining the people. If you try to pay for these works out of revenue, your name will be anathema in the mouths of those who possess anything. Is it to be said that we can carry out great national works, such as the construction of the Naval Bases, the development of the Northern Territory, and the building of the Capital City, with revenue? I should not like to propose to do that, or to support it. I believe rather in borrowing the necessary money at a cheap rate of interest, providing the interest and sinking fund instalments from revenue, so that within a limited number of years the loans may be repaid. That is how we manage our own private affairs. No private individual has cash in hand for big operations. The merchant, the banker, and every one else, when engaging in a big undertaking, pays in the first instance a deposit, and wipes off the balance by instalments. What is a good method of conducting a private business cannot be a bad method of conducting public business. We do not want extra taxation. A tax, like a bullet which has ricocbetted, often hits those whom it is not desired to hit, and who can least afford to be taxed. Surely the community is sufficiently taxed already. move That the amendments be disagreed to.",28
157,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay) [5.17] - I think that it would be wise to deal with the amendments separately. Suppose we have a general discussion, and then ask the Chairman to put the ""amendments one by one.",28
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Certainly .,28
159,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That can be the understanding.,28
160,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Treasurer has made a carefully-prepared speech, and on that I congratulate him. He complains of the action of the Senate, not on constitutional grounds, but because it may lead to consequences which will create difficulties later on, and may have results which will be fatal to the true representation of the people. In my opinion, that question does not arise on the present occasion. The Senate has amended a Loan Bill, not a Bill for the ordinary services of the year. The Treasurer has told us that we must provide, by means of loans, for our defence expenditure, and that at a time when the country is at peace. He practically says that we should build"" our defence works, and manufacture our ammunition, with borrowed money, to be repaid out of revenue.",28
161,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He did not speak of borrowing to pay for the manufacture of ammunition.,28
162,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He said that we could not provide for defence directly out of revenue, and that defence works must be constructed witli loan money, the interest on the money borrowed and .the instalments to the sinking funds to be provided for the repayment of the loans to be taken from revenue. Rifle ranges are an annual defence expenditure, and they are not works of construction of a permanent nature. Their annual upkeep is almost equal to the original outlay. The expenditure on building the Fleet is practically an annual expenditure, because there will be a large amount of money annually demanded from the Treasurer to keep the Fleet in the same condition. What I want to bring home is the folly of borrowing for defence pur* poses in times of prosperity. If in good - times we use other funds than those supplied by way of taxation for defence purposes, where will our credit be in time. I of war, or when war is pending? What self-respecting people would involve their credit in the time of peace ? Where would it end ? If the Treasurer borrows this year for annual necessities, he will need to - borrow next year for the same thing, and so on, until he will pile up a loan indebtedness for defence purposes that will be an annual burden sufficient to crush the people. The Treasurer claims that we .shall pay if off. Of course we shall, but only in a Pickwickian sense. We will borrow tomorrow to .pay off the loan of yesterday.",28
163,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We must provide these things in time of peace to get ready for war.,29
164,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The late Government built the Fleet U n it out of revenue.,29
165,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But you extraordinary windfall.,29
166,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The revenue estimated to be received this year is equal to that we estimated to receive, and, though there were obligations which the Prime Minister was compelled to endorse, we left a surplus of £2,650,000.",29
167,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"So you have done, with all the money you had. Your revenue increased by a million, and your expenditure decreased by a million. You intended to spend it all, you knowevery penny of it .",29
168,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; we appropriated the whole of the revenue we thought we should get, but some of it was not exmaking all kinds of false statements. pended . How different is that fact from statements made during the election camfinger paign by the Prime Minister and others supporting honourable members opposite, ments statements w i l f u l ly and viciously by men who knew better-rtha t we had increased the indebtedness of the monwealth by about £10,000,000. Treasurer knows that this statement every account he could. was made wilfully in pamphlets bearing the names of supporters of honourable members opposite. We incurred no indebtedness in connection with the Northern Territory. On the other hand, we paid off £200,000 of the indebtedness taken over from South Australia, and, as' we went along, we paid out of reaccount venue the whole of the expenditure on got in and paid. the Territory.",29
169,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You did it through done. the expansion of the Customs revenue and the land tax.,29
170,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We did it out of annual revenue contributed by people. The Treasurer anticipates just as good times as we had; in conditions are better now than they were during the period of the previous Governpoint. ment. In 1911, there was a loss of about 8,000,000 sheep. There is no such thing at the present time. Conditions round are better. There is to be cord wheat crop; we are promised a rebut cord cane crop in North Queensland; and the price of wool, everything being considered, though it will not be a record, will be undoubtedly exceedingly good. Yet the Treasurer wails, and he received close on two and three-quarter millions to begin with in the shape of the surplus we left.",29
171,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But you left a terrible expenditure behind you. had an Mr FISHER - Where was it ? ',29
172,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In all the Departments, which have grown. There is £7,000,000 for the Post Office Department, and £6,000,000 for Defence.",29
173,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We paid all the Defence expenditure from revenue.,29
174,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is the good should of boasting about what you did? An y one would think that you did it yourself; whereas you simply lived in good times.,29
175,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order I,29
176,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not mind the Treasurer's interjections. Some of the party opposite will not talk here, but they will go outside lying wilfully, and It the is the duty of the Treasurer to put his on these points, to inform the Committee of the facts, and not make stateby-and-large. Until we left office made we paid for everything that could be paid for, and in the short interval before the Comend of the year the present Treasurer The quite rightly, upon assuming office, paid",29

221,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is a clock in the chamber. I am entirely in accord with the Treasurer in regard to the development of the Northern Territory. Indeed, I go further. I have said, in my own electorate and elsewhere, when such a policy'was very unpopular, that it is the duty of the people of the Commonwealth to provide the money necessary to open up the Northern Territory. We must either do that, or allow some one else to do so. My view is that no other Government can take up this work, and that we must, therefore, shoulder the responsibility. I think that Mr Deakin, when Prime Minister, and the present Treasurer, who held the same office in his Ministry, made not too good a bargain in regard to the taking over of the Territory. The South Australians were rather too good for them.",31
222,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Commonwealth made a - splendid bargain.,31
223,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"B e .that as it may, the Deakin Government, on behalf of the Commonwealth, - entered into a contract with South Australia for the transfer of the Territory, and it was our bounden duty to shoulder the responsibility. We took over the Territory, and, as I have already pointed out, we actually reduced the right the indebtedness^ although we have been accused of accumulating ib. Coming to the amendments made by the Senate, I am unable to support the striking out the item of £400,000 for the construction of a railway in the Northern Territory from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. I am not sure that we have, or ever shall have, before Parliament sufficient evidence to enable us to come fco a satisfactorv conclusion on all points concerning works for the. development of the Territory. We shall have to take, a great deal of, shall I say, haphazard in formation. But, as I believe that we ought to proceed with developmental works, and that we must make a beginning in this direction, I must support the item. The railway, when constructed, will be part of the main trunk line, and, therefore, in agreeing to its construction, we shall only be shouldering part of the burden that was provided for under the agreement made with South Australia. On the other hand, I shall support the amendment made by the Senate striking out the item of £300,000 for defence purposes. The Senate, in my opinion, in eliminating that item, has merely discharged its duty. Apart altogether from the way in which the Bill was carried through this House, I feel that the Senate has discharged a public duty in eliminating the item. The Treasurer was at great pains to show that the late Government had expended loan moneys in laying conduits.",31
224,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not out of loan money, but out of revenue paid into Trust Funds. Mr FISHEE. - The Treasurer now says that the works were paid for out of revenue!",32
225,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I did not say that the works were paid for out of loan account. I said that the Senate had it . agreed to the item providing for the construction of conduits, but had drawn things we did. the line at the defence item.",32
226,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Treasurer say that, no doubt, but he did not convey that meaning.",32
227,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The words used by the Treasurer certainly conveyed the impresfor sion that we had used loan funds for the construction of conduits for postal purcharge poses.,32
228,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The late Governtically ment paid £600,000 into a Trust Fund, and they used that money.",32
229,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When we had a surhalls plus we placed it to the credit of a Trust Fund for a particular purpose, in order, that the engineers could map out scheme of work for more than one year. We believed that in that way we could quirements. obtain the best results fro m the money expended. Our desire, was to secure t in u i ty of works, and, under our we avoided a break or stoppage of work at the end of the financial year.",32
230,Sir JOH NFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I explained that on the Loan Bill . .,32
231,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so; but in these days even a mistake is picked up, and used to show that we expended loan money on works such as those to which reference has been made.",32
232,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I did not say that the late Government had done so.,32
233,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"V e r y well. The spending of this £300,000 on defence is in tended merely to provide for annual services.",32
234,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It provides, amongst other things, for the purchase of land.",32

There is every prospect that, after the land necessary for the post-office has been used, the property remaining will produce sufficient income to pay in terest on the purchase money.",32

They depreciate as time goes on, and have to be renewed, and a certain amount of revenue a must be appropriated from time to time to provide for building and other reThe Treasurer dealt at length with a conthe point as to ""borrowing from system, ourselves."" It is true that we have borrowed from our Trust Funds, and that they have been revenue producing. It is true,, also, that the present Government had nothing to do with bringing those funds into existence. Indeed, many of their supporters-no t all, I am happy to say-condemne d them. The Treasurer is a little touchy on the question of the note issue, but he has told the press before today that, when in office previously, he contemplated something of the kind, and left a d r a ft Notes Bill and memoranda behind him. The system in Australia was initialed by Queensland in 1893. The nnancial crisis gave birth to it . A Conservative Government then in office saw that the interests of the people could be protected by the State endorsing the notes of all the banks then existing",32

243,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barrier) [5.50] - Perhaps it is rather presumptuous in me to suggest how the Treasurer shall deal with a Loan Bill , but I think it was quite unnecessary, under the circumstances, for him to deliver the long speech he did this afternoon. As I take it , we are now dealing with only two or three items in the schedule.",33
244,Sir JOHN FOBREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is all I dealt with.,33
245,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member was nearly an hour discussing the principle of borrowing.,33
246,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I occupied only a little over half-an-hour.,33
247,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We l l , it seemed like an hour.' The Senate, by agreeing to several of the items, has practically adopted the principle of borrowing. candidly express my regret that the Senafce has not agreed fco the item of £400,000 for a railway from Pine Creek fco Katherine River. I agree that the only way in which we can develop the Northern Territory is by opening up means of communication; and it is unfortunate that this Railway Bill was not introduced sooner. The fact that the Government are introducing the measure at this period of the session raises the inquiry whether they are really in earnest in regard to it .",33
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And the honourable member says that after wasting three months of our time 1,33
249,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We cannot refer here fco what takes place in another House, though, of course, we shall have full opportunity fco do so on the platform. It does seem strange to me, on looking at the division fchafc took place in the Senate on this item, to find that not a single Government supporter there voted for it .",33
250,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is now doing what a moment ago he said that he ought not to do.,33
251,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There was only one Government supporter in the Senate at the time; the other honourable senators were away.,33
252,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At any rate, the one Government supporter in the Senate voted against the item. If the Government were in earnest, they would endeavour to carry their Bills, not only here, but in the Senate. I hope that when this Bill goes to another place, this item will be accepted, and I intend to support the Treasurer in his proposal to disagree with the amendment of the Senate regarding it . As to the other item, however-for the purchase of land for defence purposes- I shall support the Senate. I feel that, as f ar as possible, we ought not to borrow inoney for defence purposes.",33
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Onl y in the case of Cockatoo Island, I suppose?",33
254,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is hardly fair, because that is a transferred property.",33
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is the difference ?,33
256,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I trust that I am dealing with this particular matter free, as far as possible, from party view. I take it that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and every member of the House, is anxious that as little money I as possible shall be wasted on defenceI take it that that is the honest view of us all . It does not matter whether it is in Australia, England, Germany, America, or any other country, nor does it matter what Government may be in power, there is always a tendency to waste in defence expenditure, however much anxiety there may be to prevent it . This applies to every Department of State, bufc more particularly to the Defence Department. There may come a time, of course, when it will* be absolutely necessary, in order to carry out some great scheme, to resort to borrowing for defence purposes; but I am against the principle. I must confess fchafc I rather regret the Senate di d not object to the item of £175,000 for machinery, machine shops, and construction of wharfs at Cockatoo Island. In this House the "" g a g "" was applied, and we proceeded on absolutely party lines, so that there was no fair opportunity given to honourable members oh either side to express their opinions by a vote on this item.",33
257,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I tliink that that item would have been reduced in this House.,34
258,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I , too, am inclined to think so.",34
259,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The member must not refer to any items in the schedule other than those immediately before the Committee.,34
260,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am referring to this item only incidentally.,34
261,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Orders do not permit even incidental reference.,34
262,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall vote against the item of £300,000 for the purchase of land for defence purposes; but, as I said, I. shall support the Government in reference to the £400,000 for the railway in the Northern Territory. I trust that the Government will be successful in obtaining the £400,000; and, although they have wasted twelve mouths by not pushing on with this work",34
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We haye been only a few months in office!,34
264,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Quite so; but the lay there has been will prevent anything being done until after the rainy season.,34
265,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We cannot do anything until we get this Bill passed.,34
266,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I admit that; but this railway proposal had been in the early part of the session, we could have secured twelve months' work ; as it Liverpool area. is, we shall have to wait until after rainy season. I trust, however, this item will be agreed to, and that day or two the Government will be i position to proceed.",34
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [ 6 . 0 ] - I have been waiting hear from the Leader of the Opposition, and from the honourable member who last spoke, some reason for taking this item £300,000, for land principally for defence purposes, out of the ordinary category loan expenditure, but I have not heard one argument that will hold water. I cannot understand the reasoning that acposed cepts items of a perishable character, ancl refuses to vote one farthing of loan fund for items which are imperishable and alterable.",34
268,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We voted in this House against the item of £175,000 for expenditure at Cockatoo Island.",34
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know; but honourable members opposite are prepared to vote for other items of a perishable character, which will require renewing from time to time, while they decline to accept the one item which will not require renewing, but will last for all time, as a honourable permanent asset. Indeed, the only result of this expenditure will be to in crease the value of this asset. The honourable member for Barrier, when in office, voted to pay the Government of New South Wales £867,000 for a dock in that Standing State.",34
270,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A transferred property.,34
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A transferred property, yes, but a property which will require this Parliament, so far as we know, to pass an appropriation every year, there being no provision for redemption of transferred properties. Tliere is no sinking f u n d established in connection with the properties, and, therefore, there is an obligation to find £30,000 for interest each year on a loan to purchase machinery that is constantly becoming obsolete or wearing out, and some of which has to be renewed almost immedediately. They vote loan money for that purpose, and place us under the obligation to renew the machinery from time to time, and pay interest for all time, while they j i b at the proposal to purchase land, if which cannot deteriorate, but must grow dealt with in value every year, Take, for instance, the item for the For about a couple the of years of their life, the late Gothat vernment were negotiating with the in a New South Wales Government to get this n a land without purchase, and the understanding was that the New South Wales Government were to buy the land, and the Commonwealth Government were to to pay them a rental based upon the interest on the purchase money. Those gentlemen, therefore, were quite willing that the of State should borrow money to purchase this land and pay the interest in perof petuity on the transaction; yet, when the question arises of our purchasing the area for ourselves, they decline, on some supprinciple, to undertake loan obligations respecting it . Where is the difference in principle between the New South unWales Government borrowing money for the purpose, and our paying interest to - the New South Wales Government upon it, and our straightforward proposal to spend our own money and relieve ourselves of the obligation of paying interest to that Government? My honourable friends must be either politically hypocritical or must have some other object in view which I do not pretend to understand. They gather about them their political skirts in holy horror. They say, "" Y o u must not borrow for defence purposes,"" yet they have borrowed for defence purposes. On the very Estimates winch they are going to vote us, I presume provision is made for £30,000 to be .paid to the Government of New South Wales for the taking over of the Fitzroy Dock without parliamentary sanction.",34
272,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How many of your supporters voted for this item ?,35
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is that in point just now ? Does the principle of the thing rest upon the votes ?,35
274,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The votes ought to rest upon the principle.,35
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not understand the reasoning of honourable members who agree to purchase out of loan moneys machinery for a dock for purposes of defence, and who have already - contracted obligations amounting to at 'least half-a-million pounds on account of machinery and equipment for that dock, and who yet refuse to vote for this item. In the item of £876,000 for the purchase of the dock in New South Wales, the value of the land itself is set down at about £300,000; the balance of half-a-million is for machinery and equipment, which will require to be renewed; yet we are told that, it was because this item was connected with the defence of the country that it was rejected. Every civilized country in the world borrows money for purposes of defence. In the ""last return sent to us by - the Imperial Government there is a table - of figures showing what the cost of defence is. I find in the charge for defence an item of £1,300,000 'being annually paid for the purposes of paying - off a loan for the purchase of similar - things to those for which we are asking money in this Bill - the borrowing, of money to purchase",35
276,Mr DANKEL,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,During a time of war.,35
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not during a time of war. I am speaking about the - purchase of sites for docks and similar - things.,35
278,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And they bought some land from Lord Hopetoun at eighty years' purchase.,35
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Did the Fisher Government put eighty years' purchase on their dock expenditure? Did they put any period to it? Really, they are quite out of court in this matter. If the Imperial Government want to put down a new dock, or anything like that, - which means equipment pure and simple, they borrow for it , and the interest is charged for it each year. In our case the money is not for equipment. It is purely and solely for land, which cannot decrease, but must always increase in value. I hope honourable members will agree to put this item through, because it is a very serious matter, and they themselves were quite willing to allow their confreres in the State of New South Wales to borrow the money and buy the land.",35
280,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have nothing to do with what they did.,35
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should think so, when the late Government were negotiating with them with that very object in view, until the State Government finally turned down the proposition, after trifling with it for three solid years. I do not say that my honourable friends opposite trifled with it , but their confreres in the State did, because the matter of the Liverpool Manoeuvre Area was almost completed before we left ofiice on the last occasion. The moment Mr Holman and his friends came in they began to finesse with the arrangement, and finally succeeded in turning it down, and our predecessors were driven to the point of saying, "" We shall have to take the obligation on ourselves."" We must get the area, and so the Government now propose to purchase it themselves.",35
282,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why must you get the area?,35
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"For the same reason that we must have an area on which to train the troops in every State. We cannot get it without paying for it . How does the honourable member justify perishable products, and the refusal to borrow money to purchase land, which does not wear out? ",35
284,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Cockato o Island will be always there when we are dead and gone.,35
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Onl y about £300,000 of the £850,000 was for land. The rest was for .equipment, which wears out every day; and the late Government bought that out of loan money, and made no arrangement to pay it back. It is a perpetual obligation.",36
286,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They were not on the Treasury bench long enough.,36
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They were on the Treasury bench long enough to conclude the agreement which bound you to pay £30,000 a year in interest in perpetuity. The moment they leave the Treasury bench they say it is a bad thing to borrow for land. Now that we are following their example, the thing which was right when they were over here is all wrong when they are over there. The honourable member for Barrier must not go back on the - Northern Territory item, which is his obligation;, but here again, apparently, we are carrying it through inquite the wrong way.. He tells us that we ought to have begun earlier, but he and his friends over there prevented us from doing anything for a solid three months. Who has ever heard of my honourable friend raising his voice in advocacy of his proposal going through earlier? During the last five months, the honourable member sat there, knowing that the year was passing, and never once reminded us of the fact u n t il it was too late to do anything, but now that he thinks we have "" fallen in , "" so far as. fchis year is concerned, he asks, "" Why did you not do it before?"" If the honourable member knew it , why did he not suggest it before ?. Ifc was his proposition. We are trying f a it h carry it out,, but he ignored it u n t il - so . he says-we . lost the year over it . Nothing that, we do is right. We try to honour their obligations,, and. gefc no thanks, from them. They say,. "" You. should have done it in a different way. """,36
288,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do . you think it is a proper thing to go on with ?,36
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would not be in this Bill if we did notthink and the reason we did notgo on with it before was that we could not get i through fchis House before..,36

292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not understand the attitude of my honourable friends opposite in regard to the Loan Bill. Items which might fairly have been criticised have passed unheeded. Having agreed to the purchase of obsolete machinery with loan money, I do not see how my. honourable friends can object to buying with loan money new machinery with which to replace the old.. Our proposal fco borrow to purchase land is something quite different, since we shall have an asset which will increase in value a3 the years go by, and by no change that can be thought of will fall in value. I hope that they will not persist in their attitude in regard to this item. If they do, it will certainly mean that we shall not be able to develop our defence scheme as we wish to develop it. They make no alternative proposal; they simply say, "" You must not borrow for defence. We borrowed £867,000 for defence, but you must not borrow £300,000.""",36

I shall vote against the borrowing of £300,000 for the purchase of land. As for the expenditure on Cockatoo Island, I agree with much that the Prime Minister has said, but I have no desire to embarrass the Government by voting against it. At the same time, I am determined not to go against the generally expressed will of the people regarding fence expenditure. Many of us would have liked to deal with these items when the Loan Bill was going through Committee, but the "" gag "" was applied, and we had not an opportunity to do so. The Government must have known that the item to which the Prime Minister has referred was opposed to the expressed will of the people, and I cannot understand why it was placed in the Bill. country will endorse our action in protestable ing against this. The Prime Minister said this afternoon that in other countries loan money is used for defence purposes, but I am ignorant of the fact. I do not know any place where items have been put into a Loan Bill to provide for defence. I agree with the honourable member for Barrier that less care is taken to scrutinize proposals for the expenditure of loan money, whether on defence or on anything else, than is taken to scrutinize proposals for expenditure from revenue.",37
301,Unknown,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.£6 p.m.,37
302,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The matter of defence was settled at the 1910 elections, and the' Government knew, when.they put this item in the Loan Bill, that the Senate would not pass it. As the result of the 1910 election, eighteen senators were turned pledged to the policy of ""no borrowing for defence purposes "" ; and, after the recent election, eleven members were returned to the Senate pledged to the same policy. So there are twenty-nine members in the Senate who cannot vote for borrowing for defence purposes. Expenditure on defence is like paying an insurance premium. No man would borrow to pay his insurance. I believe that if the last Government had continued in power they would have paid for Cockatoo Island out of revenue.",37
303,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,More taxation?,37
304,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We all know the Treasurer's propensity for borrowing in his own State, which was built up on borrowed money. The State had not sufficient revenue to carry on without borrowing. In the absence of loans it would have been in Queer-street. That the bold policy laid down by the Labour partythat tliere must be no borrowing for defence purposes-coincide d with the sentiment of the people of Australia was shown by the result of the 1910 elections.",37

307,Mr RODGERS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They should take a lesson in finance from your New South Wales leaders. The Mr WEST - There was not an honormember opposite who told the people at the last elections that it was intended to borrow for defence purposes. We all know that a borrowing policy leads to extravagance and carelessness. There is not that judicious control over expenditure that there is when money is spent from revenue.,37
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is why you spent last week in trying to help the most extravagant borrowers of all the States.,37
309,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-The honourable member often makes statements that cannot be borne out. I am satisfied the Government never intended this proposal to go through. If the item is struck out, the Treasurer will be able to finance these purchases without breaking the cardinal principle of not borrowing for defence purposes that Australia has laid down. At the last election, the Prime Minister, who re- was once cheered for the democratic sentiments he uttered on public platforms, said nothing about borrowing money for defence purposes. All he troubled about' was to cast stones at the late Government in the matter of extravagance, and to make statements that he could not bear out on the floor of this Chamber. If the honourable gentleman is ever sorry for anything, he should be sorry for some of those statements. My constituents are entirely opposed to this policy of borrowing, but I suppose the Treasurer has been so accustomed to State finance that he cannot get away from it, and seeks to apply the tame policy to the Commonwealth. Whoever writes the history of our Australiau Parliament must give this credit to the late Government-that they endeavoured to carry out expenditure acaccording to their income, and to do so without borrowing. I am equally opposed to the proposal to borrow £170,000 for post-offices. I think the Postal Department should be conducted out of revenue, as has been the case so far. have set an example in the matter of carrying on the postal business out of revenue. The Treasurer can provide the money asked for out of revenue if he likes. Certainly the policy set out in the Bill will injure our defence scheme. Australians are anxious to see that scheme carried out, and one of the main reasons for their loyalty to it is the fact that it was to be paid for out of revenue. What is more pleasing - to the people of Australia than to kuow that their Pleet is paid for. It is one of the grandest things the people of Australia have ever had. There are so many works in Australia that are built out of borrowed money that it is pleasing to find something that has been paid for. Every other country pays for defence out of revenue.",37

313,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I cannot understand why, in time of peace, a country cannot make provision out of revenue for its defence. There may be justification for asking our sisters, cousins, and aunts from whom we are going to borrow, to advance us money in time of war, but at a time of unequalled prosperity, I cannot understand a Government who are supposed to be financial geniuses asking the people of Australia to go into debt for defence purposes.",38

315,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No business firm would do it . They would reduce their debts in time of prosperity.

316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You have had a good say; let us get on.,38
317,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I quite agree that I have had a fair share, but I feel very strongly in this matter. If there is one constituency which, more than another, is opposed to the system of borrowing, it is We that which I have the honour to represent, and I should fail in my duty if I did not enter an emphatic protest against the proposal to expend loan money for defence purposes. If the amendment omitting the item of £300,000 be agreed to, I feel certain thab the Treasurer will go on with the purchase of the lands for defence purposes covered by it . Most of the laud is required for rifle ranges, and many of these ranges are not so urgent that they could not stand over until next year if the Treasurer found it impossible to provide for them out of this year's revenue. I hold that we must provide oufc of revenue for our defence system. By laying down such a policy we shall safeguard ourselves against extravagance, and give to the people some guarantee that we shall not spend on defence more than is absolutely necessary If we begin fco borrow for such a purpose the people will become dissatisfied, and a certain measure of opposition to the defence system is bound to be engendered. On these grounds, I feel that we ought to agree to the Senate's amendment. If I had an opportunity to vote against the item fco provide for postal works oufc of loan moneys, I would do so.",38
318,Mr STUMM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Lilley) [ 8 . 3 ] - I am jusfc as strongly opposed fco borrowing for defence purposes as is the honourable member who has jusfc resumed his seat, but I do not regard in the light of ordinary expenditure a proposal to borrow £300,000 for the purchase of rifle ranges and manoeuvre areas which will be used not only by the present generation, but by those who come after us. Ifc seems to me that the Opposition do not distinguish between proto posals to borrow for upkeep or maintenance and proposals to borrow for establishment. That is one reason why I hope that the amendment will be disagreed Another reason why I oppose the amendment is that, if I understand the Treasurer rightly, we have already arranged to purchase most of the land covered by the items of £300,000 for defence purposes. Most of this expenditure was incurred by our predecessors, and we are bound to honour it.",38
319,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did we not their Dreadnought?,39
320,Mr STUMM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I hope that the Commonwealth will do what the States in this respect have always done. States have invariably honoured their obligations, and the Commonwealth should do the same. Honourable members opposite seem to think that there is no limit to the revenue that we may raise. I do not hold that view. The States will require every penny they can secure, and if the Commonwealth persists in providing for all services out of direct taxation we must injure the States by reducing their sources of taxation. In that respect there is a great difference between the proposals of the present Government and those made by their predecessors. The ex-Treasurer in his first year of office was certainly saddled with a deficit of £400,000, but he inherited an arrangement which gave him during his three years of ofiice something like £14,000,000 additional revenue. Not satisfied with that, however, he and his party imposed a land tax which yielded him something like £4,000,000. They went even further. By their legislation in respect of the note issue they deprived the States of a considerable amount of revenue..",39
321,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Nearl y £100,000 a year.",39
322,Mr STUMM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that Queensland was deprived of something like £30,000 a year, and that it received nothing ih return. To-day I came across an extract from the first speech made by Mr. - no w Sir Edmund-Barton , as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, in which he saidWe have taken over from the States treat obligations through the Customs duties, and you sliould recollect that when the Commonwealth imposes its Tariff-whic h canbot be until after Parliament has met-the Commonwealth power of taxation becomes exclusive, so that none of the States can afterwards interfere with the cising of that power. That is taken from them, and you must see our enormous responsibility, and we must see that we exercise that power so as not to cripple ths States. They' are left now with as many obligations as they can carry, and more, unless their power of taxation is properly protected. If you take away from them the power of taxation through the Customs, how much more necessary is it that you should endeavour to conserve to them the other means of taxation, the principal of which is direct taxation. How suicidal, then, how worse, even insane, would be a policy which would take all the Tariff and levy direct taxation, and so dry up the springs from which the States might hope to make up any shortages. It is necessary to leave honour direct taxation to them, not constitutionally, but as between man and man, and in the distinction between common-sense and lunacy. Further on, he saidThere must then, I say, be no direct taxation by The the Commonwealth unless under the pressure of some great national emergency, and not even then, if it can be avoided. I say, with the utmost confidence, that that was the distinct understanding on which the States were induced to support Federation, and that it was violated by honourable members opposite at the first opportunity. I grant that land taxation for the purpose of preventing the aggregation of large estates is an excellent thing. I grant also that land is a fit subject for taxation for defence purposes; but it is not the only thing that should be taxed. What have my honourable friends opposite to say in regard to gilt edged securities? Should they not be taxed for defence purposes? Then again, have we no privilges in this country that are well worth defending, and which ought to be taxed to assist in providing for their defence? The point that I desire to emphasize is that we cannot go on providing out of revenue for everything relating to defence.",39
323,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member believe in borrowing for defence purposes?,39
324,Mr STUMM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I unhesitatingly believe in borrowing for the purchase of land which will prove beneficial, not only to the present generation, but to those who come after us. I do not see how we can carry out a proper policy of defence without borrowing. On that ground, also, I support the motion to disagree with the Senate's amendment. We cannot provide for our enormous scheme of defence by direct taxation alone. Such a policy is not fair to the States. We cannot make the Commonwealth prosperous at the expense of the States. By exer- attempting to do so we shall be putting the cart before the horse. Make the States prosperous, and the prosperity of the Commonwealth will follow. If , however, that policy be reversed, injury to the States must result. As to the item providing £400,000 for the construction of the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River and southwards, I think that it should also be reinstated. seems to me to be absolutely necessary to enable us to make the best of a bad bargain. We must build raihvays in the Northern Territory; but the question of the route which the line should take after leaving the Katherine River is well worth - considering. We have a very serious problem to solve in the Northern Territory. So far, we do not seem to know the way out of the difficulty. My own - opinion is that the Northern Territory must be settled just as every other part of Australia has been settled. The pastoralists must go there first, and closer settlement will follow. The proper way to encourage the pastoralists to go there is to give them good leases on fair terms, reserving the agricultural flats, or the right of making reservations from these leases when the time for closer settlement - comes. On these grounds I support the Treasurer's motion that the amendment be disagreed with. I cannot understand the inconsistency shown by another place in passing an item providing for the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes out of loan account, while eliminating an item providing for loan expenditure on land for defence purposes. land is not perishable, and the probabilities are that the areas to be acquired will increase in value. Then, again, another place has shown its inconsistency by passing an item of £175,000 for machinery, machine shops, and construction of wharfs at Cockatoo Island. Surely that item is not defensible if the other is not. I hope that the motion to disagree with the Senate's amendment will be carried. I do not wish to introduce the apple of discord, but I should not be displeased if the amendment made by the Senate were fought on the broad ground that it goes beyond the constitutional rights of another place.",39
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [8.12] - When I spoke a littl e while ago I omitted to mention a fact which I think it is important to bear in mind in connection with this item. As to the Liverpool manoeuvre area, these obligations have all been incurred. The land has been resumed, and must .be paid for. I should like to point out, however, that it will be remunerative in more senses than one. For instance, we are paying 2s. and 2s. 6d. per week for the agistment of each of our remounts, and It we are hoping to save a large part of that expenditure when we get this manoeuvre area into our own hands. - Mr Fenton - Is it good grazing country 1",40
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,40
327,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Some of it is under water.,40
328,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A river runs tlirough it , and that, I think, is an advantage, and not a disadvantage to the land. It is good grazing country, and we expect to keep our own remounts there.",40
329,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How many acres does it comprise ?,40
330,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I forget the exact area, but I think the original prof osal was to take over 40,000 acres. That, believe, has been extended to about 60,000 acres. It is a huge tract of country. We are, in addition, getting a large slice at the back of it , which is now, I think, under the trusteeship of the Water and Sewerage Board. We have also the privilege of running our horses on that area.",40
331,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is it part of the catchment area of the Svdney Water Supply ? The Mr JOSE PH COOK - No ; it is land that is under their trusteeship, and it will be a valuable reproductive asset. It w i ll not be dead money in any sense of the term; indeed, it would not be dead money if it did not return a penny. I take it that money spent in defence is not dead, but is payment for the insurance of the country. In the present case we shall save a large amount in the direction I have already indicated, and there is & further saving. Every year, when we have the manoeuvres, we get a bill for compensation for damage caused by the troops; and this money we shall not have fco pav if we buy the land. I wish honourable members to get into their minds the fact that this area will be reproductive in actual money, because, in the first place, we avoid the payment of compensation, which is a substantial sum each year, and then we avoid the pay\nent of the money for the agistment of horses to the exfceut of 2s. or 2s. 6d. per head. As to £120,000 of this expenditure, it will, as I say, earn money, and be in the very best sense of the term a perpetual reproductive asset.",40

The honourable member for South Sydney has talked about logic, and one would really think from his demeanour that had a monopoly of that commodity; b the honourable member does not seem able to distinguish between one thing and other. Because he thinks it improper of those who pay the interest. to pay for a ship, which i,s a perishable purchase, out of loan money, we, thereof fore, should not pay for land such as at Liverpool by that method. regard to ships, we know exactly what the Labour party did, and what the Liberal party did. The Liberal party did not propose to pay for ships out revenue, but made an arrangement under it . their Bill to pay for the whole of Fleet out of loan money, with a sinking fund that would completely repay the whole capital cost in fifteen or sixteen years. When that Bill was introduced, Ministers pointed out that they had ascertained that sixteen years was the estimated life of the vessels, and, therefore, they provided that the whole capital cost should be paid at the end of that time out of the reserve f u n raised each year for the purpose. "" Mr. JOSEPH COOK - O r sooner, if possible.",42
352,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"O r sooner, if possible. We know very well that this review ground is not only for the people of today or tomorrow, or even for the people of this century; it will remain there for all time; and it must be admitted that the people of each generation are under an obligation to pay for the use of that ground. Why should we today pay the capital cost of a property which is to be handed down for the use of subsequent generations?. It is a fair position to take up that each generation shall pay the interest on the capital cost of the land, because each generation will by if ; and, therefore, the capital cost comes within the category of loan It remains in suspense; and each generation should pay its contribution from time to time in the shape canof interest. There never was a more appropriate opportunity for spending loan money than in buying a permanent^ proof this sort, which is to be 'used for all time, and for which the people of all time should pay in the shape of Take the other item of the proWe know that in Australia today there are national railways without which this country would be f if t y years behind the times, and tbose railways have been paid for he oufc of loan moneys. Why? Because ut each generation should contribute its quota, seeing fchafc when the railways anearn profit it will go into the pockets We assume, or hope, that this railway is part a scheme, that is going to produce some this profit in the future. We may be sure W it h that its value will be enhanced with the development of the Northern Territory; and if it is going fco be enhanced, or even retain its present value, it is future of generations who will make money out of Members of the Labour party, who the talk about logic without understanding the definition of the term, sayfchafcfche people of today should pay the capital value of the railway, and give it to future generations, without asking those generations fco pay any interest. Honourable members onfchafcside of the House ought to know that if we pay for it today out of revenue it will cease to be an asset bearing interest upon subsed quent generations, and that the only way in which we can make subsequent years and subsequent generations pay their quota is by making the purchase money part of our borrowing. There is a complete absence of logic in their argument; and I cannot understand how they can apply the termfcotlieir criticism, because both of these are permanent assets? I admit that they do not earn money at the present time, but the Liverpool property will save the Government each year from renting some big property for the purpose, as they may have had to do in the past, and will undoubtedly have to do in the future as population thickens. We are, therefore, investing in a property for the benefit of the people for all time, and we are investing in a railway which stands on exactly the same footing as all the railways of Australia. If we had not borrowed for them, we could not have had them. How could Australia have paid for those £200,000,000 worth, of railways if it had adopted this "" lolly-shop "" sort of principle of the Labour party that everything must come out of the t ill ? We cannot do it , but we can pay the interest on the money, and can require each subsequent generation to pay its share. There is nothing but logic in the policy of the Ministry i h insisting upon having these two works included in the Loan Bill ; and T shall do my best for them, not only by voting for them, but by persuading my colleagues as to the justice, wisdom, and logic of voting to send the items back to the Senate.",42

355,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall not give the honourable member credit for a schoolmaster manner, because I do not think that, with the Conservative attitude which he takes up on all these questions, he goes very deeply into anything-no t even in his great work on Liberty and Liberalism. The honourable member put forward what he calls the only logical doctrine, and, of course, any one who differs from him is illogical, and knows nothing about the question. I am bold enough to differ from the honourable member. He argues Chat, as this, is a permanent asset, the purchase money should remain on loan, and that we should pay interest fro m one generation to another, so that those who come after us will be compelled to pay a portion of the cost. Does the honourable member apply that doctrine to the action of the various States when they sell the land, and take the money from the present generation, and saddle future generations with a penalty they have no right to bear ? If the' honourable member is logical, let him object to that practice. He speaks about the money borrowed to build our railways. Australia has borrowed nearly £300,000,000, but not more than from £26,000,000 to £30,000,000 has actually been brought here at all ; and we have paid nearly £300,000,000 in in terest, and still owe the £300,000,000. That is the policy the honourable member advocates. but two methods by which money can be obtained for governmental purposes-loa n and taxation. In either case, the people have to pay for all of it all the time, with this difference, that if they are taxed directly to obtain £1,000,000, when they have paid that £1,000,000 there is an end of it ; whereas if the £1,000,000 is borrowed, say, at 3 per cent., which, I suppose, would be the ordinary rate at which the honourable member would have borrowed when he was in the New South Wales Government, at the end of fifty years £1,500,000 would have been paid in interest, and the original £1,000,000 would still be owing. That is the policy which the honourable member desires us to adopt. If we are going to borrow money for this purpose, and the honourable member is anxious for us to be logical, it is logical for us to retain the land of this country, and not allow a solitary inch not say of it to go out of the hands of the State.  power over the land how can we hold it ?",43
356,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am speaking of the general principle. The honourable member belongs to the Conservative party, v which would give away or sell everything, run up a big overdraft, and pass the burden on to the people, quite satisfied so long as somebody else had to pay it . We, on this side of the House, however, hold strongly to the view that we ought to be prepared to pay for our own defence.",43
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Excep t at Duntioon and the dock, I suppose ?",43
358,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the dock question, which is a special one, comes up I shall deal with it I do not know what this land is like, but I am told that it comprises from 40,000 to 60,000 acres, and that we are paying £300,000 for it .",43
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Oh , no; £120,000.",43
360,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then that is somewhere about £ 2 an acre. In that case it must be very poor land, which will not carry a great number of horses. The honourable member will not save a great deal at 2s. per head upon the number of horses that it will carry. If it is of any good at all, the honourable member would have no possible chance of getting it at that price. As time goes on, and land becomes scarcer, no doubt it will increase in value; but, in any case, whatever land original we get for defence purposes we should be prepared to pay for out of revenue and There are not out of loan.",43

It concerns the well-being and livelihood of seventy or eighty orchardists, vignerons, and small farmers. They are not large holders, and for over four years they have , had the ban of resumption hanging over them. have not been able to sell or im prove their holdings, but have been living in a state of uncertainty and doubt. They were assured that the Government intended to resume the area, and so have been waiting for something to be done. When these facts were brought before me, I waited upon the Departments concerned, and after I had practically worn out their doormats, Ministers proved sympathetic, and began to move in the matter. In the last three months three valuations have been made of the property, and offers have been submitted, with the result that some of these have been accepted, and the owners have compromised themselves by purchasing property elsewhere. Now the proposal is that the money not be passed. If that is agreed to these people* will not know what to do. Honourable members opposite are continually expressing their sympathy with the small man. These are all small men; there is not a Riverina squatter amongst them. They are simply dependent upon the holdings they occupy. They are workers, and have no big banking accounts behind them. During the past f o u r years these people have been in a state of uncertainty. Their f r u it has been at the mercy of soldiers, crops interfered with, fences destroyed, their cattle have been driven away, and now it is proposed not to provide money to complete a bargain that has been made with them. The suggestion that this item should be struck out is one of the most iniquitous that has ever come before this Chamber. Many of the land-holders within the area have reached a time of life when it is too late to make a fresh start. Are they to be kept waiting another twelve months for the settlement of [143] their claim ? It is said that the expenditure would not be reproductive, but what can be more reproductive than expenditure on defence, to insure the safety of the people, and to guard their possessions 1 Such expenditure is like expenditure on life insurance. The land in this area has a big prospective value. Seeing . that it is within 20 miles of Sydney, the Government, in my opinion, are not giving enough for it . Some of it may be of indifferent quality, but that along the river is capable of growing anything, and it will be worth considering whether it should not be placed, under cultivation They to grow feed for the remount depots. For four years those holding land in the manoeuvre area have been unable to sell, and have not known what to do. I trust that they will be no longer kept in this most unsatisfactory position.",44

I am opposed sub- to borrowing, but all the same, I hope the Treasurer will see that the piece of country at Liverpool is purchased.",46
399,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Werriwa) [9.9] - I pur- could quite understand the honourable member for Maribyrnong if the party to which he belongs had ever shown any objection to borrowing, but they were the very first to borrow. They borrowed £10,000,000. The honourable memberboasts about their £2,500,000 surplus, but what about the £7,500,000 wasted, if borrowed money is all wasted. I do not think it is; but. if the contention of the honourable member-that it is wastedis correct, then his own party is responsible for wasting something £7,500,000. The only reason why an attack can be made upon the honourable member is because his arguments are entirely wrong. It is clear to every one but the honourable member that if the money is put to any use, and returns interestand frequently it has enabled development to take place in Australia that could not otherwise be brought aboutborrowing is good. If aman borrows £ 3 0 0 to buy a cottage, he is able to have his home for £15. a year, or 6s. a week. Is he then not infinitely better off than by paying some one else12s. a week? the latter case, he must continue to pay rent, and will never be better off, but in the other case, at some time, the cottage may belong to him. If , in six years, he is enabled to pay off half the loan, he has only 3s. a week to pay. I use this as an argument to show that everv worker in the community would be better off if he could borrow a little capital. nately, some honourable members opposite have the good sense to recognise that capital borrowed at a reasonable rate, and expended in a reproductive manner, is of advantage to the whole community, but the. honourable member for Maribyrnong does not seem to have grasped the meaning of one of the planks in the platform of his party-borrowin g for reproductive works. The Labour party oppose the borrowing of £400,000 proposed to be spent on a railway in the Northern Territory. Without going fully into the merits of the question, I am bound tp say that it is the policy of the Labour party that has committed us to this expenditure. Had it not been for the taking over of the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth Parliament would not be dealing with the matter, and as honourable members opposite claim that they are developing the Northern Territory, surely they will not'allow party feeling to in duce them to strike out the proposal to build a railway which undoubtedly will 'tend to the development of that Territory.",46
400,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who said the Labour party were going to do that? Not of the Government supporters voted it in the Senate Mr Conroy.,47
401,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"l t does not seem as if there was very much collective sense in another place at present. I hope the majority there will not take this as a reflection. I cannot understand why the like construction of a railway in the Northern Territory should be blocked. Manifestly the work cannot be done out of revenue in a single year; it is most unjust to ask that it should be; therefore if the railway is to be built, the money must be spent out of loan funds. In the Loan Act of 1911 passed by the Labour party, provision is made for a sinking f u n d of at least a £ per cent., to be paid every year, towards wiping out any loan. I have no quarrel with that provision; it is a wise one in many cases; but one is the less able to understand why there should be any obIn jection on the part of this Committee to a proposal of this kind. I could understand it if honourable members say there is to be no development in the Northern Territory. If the Labour party admit that they made a mistake when they took over the Northern Territory, and when they provided a quarter of a million on their Estimates last year, and pledged Fortu- us to expend £280,000 this year, I can understand their objection to this proposal; but as the development of the Northern Territory has been tlieir policy in the past, and as 1 presume they would have continued that policy, surely honourable members opposite are not going to oppose this item merely because a body of men elsewhere have seen fit, perhaps for party purposes, to strike it out. We should put this matter.above party. The House of Representatives is the guardian of the people's money. I. am surprised that honourable members do not regard with considerable jealousy amendments made by another place in relation to financial matters, which are left practically to the jurisdiction of this House. The House of Representatives was set up by the Constitution as the guardian of the financial rights of the people, and it should take care that its rights are not violated. We should unite in declining to allow amendments of this kind to be made by a body of men who are not as representative as we are.",47
402,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are elected on the same franchise as we are.,47
403,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"An elector in Western one Australia, voting for the Senate, has nine for times as much power as has an elector < in New South Wales voting for the same ' House. That being so, it cannot be said that the two Houses are elected on the same franchise. A p a r t from the constitutional position which we ought to take up, I think we should unite in supporting the item of £400,000 for a railway in the Northern Territory. the rejection of the item of £300,000 for the purpose of our land defences, I would point out that honourable members in both Houses of Parliament have assented to the raising of money for postal works. It is not right to ask the people in any one year to pay for things which will be used by the people year after year. If , as in the case of items 6 and 7, provision had been made for paying off this particular money within a certain time, I could have understood the Objection. Provision is made in clause 2 for paying off items 6 and 7, at the rate of 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, a year, which means that under the Inscribed Stock Act they will be paid off in fifteen and a half years. Had I been consulted, I might have urged that the.item relating to machinery should be paid off in less than that time. That item, however, has not been rejected. I . am unable to understand how advocates of perpetual leasehold do not grasp the fact that, in providing for these defence requirements out of loan, we are simply putting forward something in the nature of a perpetual lease. Under a perpetual lease rent is paid year after year, whilst in the case of a perpetual loan rent is also paid year after year. The Opposition, therefore, are stultifying themselves. point is that the land to be now acquired for defence purposes will not be committed necessarily to those purposes for all time. It may be devoted to some other purpose. Surely we are not going to have our present big military expenditure going on year after year. We find that we cannot accuse the Labour party of cutting down the defence expenditure. We learn that they were committed to the provision of a Dreadnought, submarines, and other vessels, and that they would have committed us to a'n extra military expenditure of £4,000,000.",47
404,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,W h i c h would have Senate. been followed by an income tax.,48

407,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then vote to keep down the military expenditure. We now understand that our party has cut down the military expenditure this year by £4,000,000. As to Mr FINLAYSON - Who told the honor"" able member that? '",48
408,Mr CONROY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Do I understand that the honourable member now says that when his party told the people they were, going to do all these things they were merely talking? I ought to know that the political promises of the Labour party are made only to be broken, and that when they gave this further promise they were only trying to catch the unwary, the gullible, and unthinking. The appeal of our party was to the sensible electors of the Commonwealth, and they returned us with a majority, despite the promisea made by the Labour party, in which, the honourable member now admits, he did noti believe. As this land, on thes showing of the Labour party, is not committed to defence purposes for all time, the objection could have been raised that we were borrowing too soon to provide for ita acquisition. That objection, however, has been effectively disposed of, because the whole of the military manoeuvres were carried out by the late Ministry on these very grounds, and it was only because notice of resumption had been given by the late Government that it was necessary to resume them. Then the question arises as to how they should be paid for. I hold that the provision of land is unlike Another the provision of war material, which should come out of revenue. Even the cost of your ships, if they are to last for a certain time, in a small community like ours, should be spread over ten or twelve years. In the course of a few years the whole of our defence may be on the naval side, and in that case the land now being acquired for military purposes will not be so used. In any event, it would be unjust to call upon the people this year to pay for property which at some future time can be sold to advantage if the purchase is a wise one. I trust that, for the reasons I have given, the Committee will reject the amendments made by the",48
409,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling) r9.381There is no quarrel between the Governand the Opposition in regard to borrowing for reproductive works, but the Labour party are stronglv of opinion oldthat defence should be provided for but of revenue. That principle is generally recognised in older countries, and I am - astonished that it is not observed by the present Government. The policy taken up by the Ministry indicates that if there ' were no loan funds available to them there would be no defence system. - That, indeed, was the policy of the Liberal party when it was in office before. --They were going to borrow to build our Navy. The present Government are greatly concerned about the taxpayer when we suggest that he should be called upon to pay for defence, but they apparently hide the fact that the same tax- payer has to pay the interest on money borrowed, for which interest he gets no 'return. Defence is a matter entirely - separate from any other. The Prime Minister has pointed out that it would be very profitable to take over this ' manoeuvre area because of the saving ' that would be effected, and so for t h ; "" but that is merely trying to separate - this land entirely from the defence ' policy of the country. We cannot ' get away from the fact that the horses ' to be placed on this land are part of the '.defence equipment, and, no doubt, it ' would be advisable to get possession of the land in order to make a saving in this ' connection. But this does not justify our . borrowing money for the purpose. The whole conception of defence by the . Liberal party seems to be bound up in borrowing. If we were ever unfortunate enough to be attacked by . a foreign power we should have to appeal to somebody for money, and if we keep piling up our indebtedness under . this head in time of peace, what position should we find ourselves in when we came to face an enemy ? We should reserve our borrowing powers as much as possible for any emergency. Some honourable - members opposite seem to regard getting into debt as a virtue, and the only other section of the community which seems to hold similar views is that represented by the churches, who feel that when they are in debt fchey can more readily and effectively appeal to their adherents. In private life, however, I am sure that hon. orable members opposite feel that it is not a good thing to be in debt, and inculcate that lesson into the young people for whom they are responsible. There is no analogy between the construction of a railway and the provision for defence. If this land were to return some income, no doubt it would effect a saving in Mr Sfence. the defence expenditure, because there is no proposal fchafc the. moneyshould be placed to ordinary revenue. The interest, however, on the £300,000 will have to . be paid by the taxpayer, who gets nothing in return. Honourable members opposite will no doubt tell me that I would take the money to pay for the land out of the taxpayers' pockets; and that is quite true. No sensible persons in business would borrow money and pay interest if he had the necessary capital available; and the Government have the capital, seeing fchafc they have the power to tax those who can well afford to pay. I do not believe that the people of Australia grudge what they have to pay for defence, however unsatis - factory such expenditure is. Ifc is considered an urgent necessity that, although not a warlike people, we should be put into a position to defend this magnificent country, and all the privileges we enjoy. Jusfc imagine a Government seeking trouble with another place over a small sum like £300,000! Ifc would appear fchafcfcheGovernment are so anxious to borrow that they will not even give up fchis item. The honourable member for Werriwa put forward what specious arguments he could in support of his party, but they did not appear to me to carry much weight. Ifc is admitted that this land would be a good asset for all time, whereas ships may go down, or get oufc of date-; but this fact does not justify our borrowing money to secure the land. The whole defence policy and scheme should be considered as one, whatever may be the result when the change comes, of which the honourable member for Werriwa seems fco be hopeful. I am rather surprised he should have taken up the position he does, because he is thoroughly opposed to the development of our land forces. His idea is that we ought to have only a Navy, but he now appears to be the apologist for the Government in their proposal to borrow £300,000 for this land. As I say, the people are prepared fco pay the necessary taxation, but the Government have not the courage fco impose the taxation on the well-to-do people, who in this respect are let off more lightly here than in any other part of the world. They are all doing well, and ought to be taxed, in fairness to the rest of the community. I am opposed to this item, and I hope that it will be rejected, and that we shall thus, once and for all, put a stop fco borrowing for defence purposes.  [9,40] - This item of £300,000 is one of the legacies of commitments from the previous Government, and it now devolves upon the present Government, somehow or other, to find the necessary money. The question seems to be simply whether we shall pay for the land out of revenue or out of loan moneys. I can see an analogy between actions of the late Government and the proposals now before us. Loan Act of 1911 provided for the acquisition of land in the Federal Territory at a cost of £600,000. Where is the distinction between borrowing money to buy land in the Federal Territory and borrowing money to buy land in the Liverpool manoeuvre area? Can it be urged that land in the Federal Territory is reproductive, or likely to be reproductive within a reasonable time? Is it more likely to be reproductive than the land of the Liverpool manoeuvre area ? The latter, when not used for defence purposes, might be leased for agistment or other purposes, and thus be made in some degree reproductive; at any rate, it could be made quite as reproductive as the land within the Federal area. We also find that the late Government borrowed £226,000 to redeem Treasury-bills issued by the South Australian Governmeut on account of the Northern Territory. Can it be urged that the Northern Territory is reproductive, or likely to be reproductive for a considerable .number of years ? At any rate, when they occupied the Treasury bench they borrowed £226,000 to pay for work which is not likely to be reproductive for a very long time. The £300,000 item in this Bill includes £112,000 to purchase land in the Liverpool Manoeuvre Area, and £70,350 for the acquisition of sites for drill-halls, mobilisation stores, and other accommodation for Citizen Forces. The money will not be wasted if spent for those purposes. The land will always be there, and can be transferred by the Commonwealth at any time. It is altogether different from putting the money into warships, which become obsolete in fifteen or twenty years' time. The Government are quite right to borrow money for the purposes set out in the, Bill . As a previous speaker pointed out, if we do not find money for these drill-halls we cannot properly carry out our defence system. I understand that the works are to a large extent already under contract to be carried out. The Government are committed to them, and the question is, how we are going to get the money. If we are to pay for the whole of the commitments of the previous Government out of revenue, I do not see how it can be done, unless we impose taxation of a very serious nature. We have certainly got to nurse the baby. The case has been manufactured for us by the previous occupants of the Treasury bench, and we are not justified in finding the whole of this money out of revenue, parThe ticularly as future generations will reap a far greater benefit from the expenditure than we shall ourselves. The railway from Pine Creek to Kath erine River in the Northern Territory was part of the policy of the previous Administration, and it has been recommended by the whole of the authorities connected with the Territory. If we are to develop that possession our main point of attack must be by opening it up by means of a railway. I gather, from the attitude of honourable members in another place, and of honourable members opposite, that there is no objection fco constructing the railway out of loan money, but that the real reason for the omission of the item is that the previous Government had linked up with the proposed railway construction a Socialistic undertaking in the shape of Government freezing works on the shore near Port Darwin.",48
410,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Government have knocked the Government freezing works out.  why this item has been treated in such a silly way in another place.,50
411,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was one of your own supporters that knocked it out there.  puts a totally different complexion on the matter. I believe fchafc if the freezing works had been included the item would have gone through quickly. We cannot develop the Territory unless we encourage grazing by means of railway construction, and after grazing will come that closer , settlement which every one so much de, sires.",50
412,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"South Sydney)""[9.50] The facts of the case with regard to the Fitzroy Dock are really very creditable to the late Government. When it was decided to build the' destroyer Warrego the then Govenmenfc entered into an arrangement with the New South Wales Government to pay 8 per cent, over and above the actual cosfc for the use of the island and the necessary machinery. When the Fisher Government came intopower they decided to take over the island and the whole plant. By doing so they saved the Commonwealth 8 per cent, on the total cost of construction of our warships, and this meant a saving of hundreds of thousands of pounds. We have spent ahout £850,000 in that case, and have secured a valuable asset. We can build there any ships that we require, and we have the largest dock in the whole Commonwealth- a dock that can accommodate the battleship Australia. I am prepared to support the item for the construction of the railway to the Katherine River. That part of the country cannot be developed except by railways, and if there is a division on that item I shall support the Government. We are not regarding this matter as a party question at all.",50
413,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,1 hardly thin k we shall have a division on that item.,51
414,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Some of the supporters of the Government think we are committed to oppose it , but we consider that the Northern Territory should be developed irrespective of who is on the Treasury bench, and the railway extension to the Katherine River ought to be made in any case. It is part cf our main railway system, and we ought to send the item back to the Senate, with a message insisting on its reinstatement in the Bill'. There is, however, no justification for borrowing money for defence purposes. The electors have given the Government no warrant for such a policy. Some Government supporters are trying to get out of the awkward position in which they are placed by saying that the land will become valuable. No doubt it will . We do not oBject to the Government taking over the land, but it must be paid for out of revenue. To pay for it with borrowed money would be to set a very bad precedent, of which future Governments may try to take advantage. If we cannot pay for our defence out of revenue we have no right to undertake such an expensiye scheme. We are spending £5,000,000 out of revenue on defence according to this year's Estimates, but that does not seem to satisfy the Government, for they propose to borrow another £300,000 to augment that sum. time has arrived for them to call a halt. They could acquire the land and pay for it out of revenus at the rate of so much every year.",51
415,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have possession.,51
416,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I sympathize with the people who have land in the Liverpool area. We are not treating them fair l y , and we ought to do so. I am satisfied that if the Senate insists on rejecting the item of land for defence purposes, the Treasurer will find ways and means of financing the £300,000 required. He has the handling of a surplus of £2,600,000 left by the late Government, and yelj he asks Parliament to sanction the borrowing of another £300,000. The honourable member for Parkes went round the country denouncing the late Ministry for extravagant and wasteful expenditure, but in the last Supply Bill brought down by the present Government, the sum of £246,000 was included for military and naval expenditure for one month only. That is an enormous sum. The Government came into power on the cry that the Fisher Government had been extravagent, but they are spending money wholesale themselves. They told the farmers that the Fisher Government had spent every penny they could put their hands on, but the Fisher Government never proposed to borrow money for defence purposes. The Government are prepared to spend not only the surplus, together with an increasing revenue, but a large amount of loan money as well. I hope they will pursue that policy for our sakes, because the effect will be seen at the next election. We have seen a forecast of what is going to happen in the last few days in New South VVales. The Government have been six months in office, and what have they done for the farmers? They have heaped up expenditure, and have borrowed money. I advocate the cause of the farmers on every occasion, and I hope honourable members who represent rural constituencies in this Chamber will call a halt in regard to loan expenditure. We should always have to pay interest on the money, but while there is plenty of revenue coming in , that should be made sufficient for all our requirements. I trust, therefore, that when a diviover sion is taken, Ministerial supporters will vote in consistency .with their platform utterances. Some honourable members got into this House simply by denouncing the extravagance of the Labour Government, The but nob one of them has attempted to cut down a single item of expenditure on the part of the present Government. I should like to strike a note of warning as far as fchey are concerned. The people have already spoken upon this question. They taken threw out the Fusion Government when it went to the country with a Loan Bill for three and a half million for defence purposes, and returned one of the strongest Governments that ever sat in this House. That Government built up the Navy, and formed the nucleus of our land forces, and established small arms, clothing, and ammunition factories-al l out of revenue. If the Treasurer will"" take a friend's advice, he will withdraw the disputed item, for it is of no use for the Government to force a crisis over this matter. If they do so, they will get the worse of it . If they go to the country on the question of borrowing to buy manoeuvre areas and sites for drillhalls, it will be the worse for them. I hope that the Government, in the in terests of the party and of the country, will see the wisdom' of withdrawing the item, and not use it to cause a dispute 'with the Senate, which has rights, just as we have.  glad to know from the kindly remarks of the honourable member for South Sydney that our opponents are coming to sympathize with the farmers. What the Government propose is in the interests of the farmers. Instead of taxing them to provide £300,000, we are asking them to pay only 4 per cent, on that sum annually. Honourable members opposite strain at a gnat and swallow a camel. The honourable member for South Sydney had a good deal to say about the saving of 8 per cent, in connection with the acquisition of the Fitzroy Dock, but his arguments apply much more forcibly in favour of the proposal that I am discussing. The sum of £70,300 is set down for dril l halls.",51
417,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is for land. The buildings are provided for on the Estimates.  the country, I know that most of the drill halls occupied by the Department are in a dilapidated condition. If we require efficiency, we must provide proper accommodation for our cadets trainees. These drill halls for the most part are being rented from the capitalists, to whom the Labour members are ' so much opposed. In many cases, £ 5 0 and £ 6 0 a year is being charged as rent for sheds which could be buil t for £ 2 5 0 , and would cost only £ 1 0 a year in in terest. If we built 280 drill sheds at £250 apiece, they would cost £70,000, interest on which, at 4 per cent., would be £2,800. For similar sheds we are paying altogether £12,400 a year in rent, so that by borrowing money to erect sheds of our own we could make a saving of £9,600 a year. That amount capitalizedcomes to £240,000 at 4 per cent. If private individuals entered into a soft goods business, and made it their rule not to borrow to buy cotton goods, but to spend borrowed money on woollen goods only, the arrangement would not be more ridiculous than the contentions of the Labour party in regard to Commonwealth borrowing. Why, if we may borrow £300,000 for the Postal Department, should we not borrow a like amount for the Defence Department, supposing it to be in the interest of the taxpayer' to do so ? If by borrowing to construct d r ill halls we can save over £9,000 a year, ought we not to do so ? I am sure that the honourable member for Darwin, if he could borrow at 4 per cent, and get a return of 20 per cent., would not hesitate to do so; and if honourable members would do this in managing their private affairs, why should they not do it in the interest of the country at large?",52

422,Mr RODGERS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is beside the question; I am discussing the policy of borrowing. At one time, our opponents formed a non-borrowing party. Then there was a re-adjustment of their platform, and they favoured the restriction and of public borrowing. Now they are again a non-borrowing party.",52
423,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are in favour of borrowing for reproductive works.,52
424,Mr RODGERS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Labour party is a non-borrowing party when it suits it to be so. In New South Wales, it is a whole-hog borrowing party. The party's plank in connection with - defence is *' Naval and military expenditure to be allotted from proceeds of direct taxation."" The Prime Minister has said that he remembers when the Labour party thought that about £500,000 a year would pay for the defence of Australia, but last year it spent about £5,500,000 on defence; and, although it holds that military and naval expenditure should be paid for from the proceeds of direct taxation, only £1,4.00,000 of that amount was so obtained. That sum was taken from ithe land-holders, and well-to-do classes, like the manufacturers, for whose benefit the national policy of Protection, in which I believe, was framed, were allowed to escape. TJnder the Labour policy, the Minister of Defence himself, unless he happened to own £5,000 worth of unimproved land, would pay nothing directly towards the defence of the country. The balance of the defence expenditure is contributed by the community at large through indirect taxation. I do not think that it is commendable for a party to specially tax some 14,000 persons for the defence of the country, leaving untaxed many who are better able to bear taxation. Other purposes for which the Labour party got permission to borrow were these:-For the purchase of land and the erection of buildings in London, £600,000; for the redemption of Treasury bills issued by the Government of South Australia on account of the Northern Territory, £226,000; and for the payment to South Australia of the amount expended from revenue for railway construction, £34,476; the several items in the first Loan Act totalling £2,460,476. The schedule attached to the Loan Act, No. 22 of 1912, was as follows:t . For the acquisition for Commonwealth purposes of property in rerth, WA., and expenses incidental thereto ... ... ;£i53>ooo c. To redeem loans raised by the Government of South Australia on account of the Northern Territory ... ... ... ... 3. To redeem loans raised by the Government of South Australia on account of the Port Augusta railway ... ... ... When on the hustings I laid down my attitude on the question of when it is right for a nation to borrow. I believe that if there be no imminent or present danger on the shoulders of a nation, as far as possible the defence of the country should be carried on from each year's won wealth. The nation should defend every Mr Rodgers. home and every life, and who is the Australian worthy of the name who would not weigh in with his little lot for the defence of the country, allowing for bread and butter exemptions?",52
425,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,So they do through the Customs.,53
426,Mr RODGERS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am talking about direct taxation. I am well aware that the community at large, by indirect taxation through the Customs, pay their proportion. If there be for defence or governmental purposes any requirement which is not a pressing need, it should be got out of the incomes of the people; but, in my judgment, there are insufficient cash reserves in Australia. For the true economic needs of the people there is nothing wrong in a sound policy of national borrowing accompanied by proper safeguards for redemption. Where should we be today if the credit of Australia had not been sufficient to enable us to get from the older and more opulent nations-thos e with cash reserves to lend - the millions we have had to develop the country and defend it? In my opinion, the items for which the Treasurer seeks authority to borrow money are justified, and they have my support.",53

I had an opportunity of speaking earlier on that occasion, and I said distinctly that we must borrow for the construction of railways, that if we desired to develop the Northern Territory we must borrow for that purpose, and 7«»945 that if we desired to go on with the Federal Capital money would have to be borrowed; but I picked out three other items, 304,581 and said that there was no justification in borrowing for them.

FINLAYSON (Brisbane) [10.26] - The very fact that the Labour party brought down Loan Bills to carry out certain public works is a sufficient answer to the statement made that we made are a non-borrowing party. Tke honourable member for Calare and the honorfor able member for Wannon, the latter parbe ticularly, referred to certain planks in Lightthe platforms of State Labour parties; but in no case were they able to show that the Labour party is opposed to borrowing. There have been restrictions on borrowing am sure advocated, but in every case the Labour party have advocated borrowing lor reproductive works. Honourable members opposite very conveniently forget the we qualification we imposed. The whole of the opposition to this Loan Bill is directed This to the proposal to borrow £300,000 for the has ever purchase of land for defence purposes. The honourable member for Calare sugworst gested that, as honourable members of the of Labour party would be quite willing to only. borrow money at a cheap rate of interest Austo secure a satisfactory return, there was seano reason why the Government should not adopt the same policy.

Whatever we say they will say the opposite. One honorkind. able member told me the other day that he did not know what I was reasonably saying, but he was against me. The honourable member for Wannon said of that we were hypocritical in this matter. making The hypocrisy is upon the other side. We do?

We heartily port the items in the Loan Bill to prosole vide for the building of the transmoney continental railway, the railway in the account.

They are really reproductive works, and must bring in very handsome return to future generalowed 'tions. Honourable members must not forapprove get that in 1910 we roundly attacked Fusion Government in respect of the Naval Loan Act, by which it proposed to raise £3,000,000 for the building war ships, and we promised the people that if we were returned to power we would repeal that Act. The reason we gave was a very proper one. We have future. always contended that defence is not productive, and cannot come within the category of works and services in respect of which we think loan moneys may perly be expended. There was no need to fly to either direct or indirect taxation for building the Navy. That is a point which I would remind the honourable member' for Wannon. The Commonsame direction. wealth was then enjoyingprosperous times, and we should have been indulging in hypocrisy of the very worse kind suggested by the honourable member, having sufficient revenue to meet our desires in regard to the building of the Navy, we'had resorted to some method of direct taxation to cover that expenditure. is not necessary for the present Government to resort to direct taxation in order to provide for this defence expenditure of £300.000 The revenue of the Comthis item... monwealth is sufficiently elastic at the Mr Finlayson. present time to enable that amount to be taken out of it instead of out of loan It is not a fair expendiin ture from the point of view of the present generation, and it is not a fair handicap to impose on future generaI t means the insertion of the thin end of, a wedge, that, once admitted, must lead to disaster of the very worse' If , during times of prosperity, when we have available money that may be spent for defence purposes, we are going to provide for defence out loan account, then, when times are bad, and the Treasurer has a difficulty in ends meet, what are we going to is the last of all times when we should resort to an expedient of this kind to provide for defence expenditure.

' My objection is to the proposal that'the shall be provided out of loan No doubt the Government, with the assistance of its servile majority, will reject the Senate's amendment, but that will not prevent us from challenging their action in adopting such a vicious a principle- a principle that is not folby any other country.

I do not wish to be unkind; but I can understand the Prime Minister's anxiety that we should go to a vote. He knows that he has the numbers, and that, whether we proceed to a division five minutes or fifty minutes' hence, the result will be the same.",56

443,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am sorry that the honourable member admits that he is so impervious to argument that he is not prepared even 'to listen to a reasonable statement on an important question. I regret that he thinks it is a waste of time to object to the allocation of public money before we have decided how that money shall be spent. We are asked to sign a cheque for £400,000 in respect of a railway which we have not had an opportunity to discuss.

It is absurd for him to assume that it is the duty of the Opposition, or even of his own supporters, to wind up the session without discussing a Loan Bill for £3,080,000. I have never heard any Leader of the House make such a suggestion before. He spoke of some arrangement with some honourable members who were desirous of winding up the session.

463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is absolutely incorrect. M.r. FISHER - I believe five hours was the total amount of discussion allowed, and an amendment of which I gave notice was not allowed even to be moved. I have known a Loan Bill for £1.000,000 to be tied up for about three months in the Queensland Parliament, and it is ridiculous of the Prime Minister to expect us to allow so vital an alteration of the financial policy 'of the Commonwealth, for which the Government received no authority at. the elections, to go through without comment. The measure was put tlirough by the misuse of the closure. There was no extensive debate, and yet the Prime Minister complains now that an afternoon has been spent in discussing this important question. I take the challenge of the Prime Minister and honourable members opposite in this matter. If they want to go to the country, why do they nob go ? What is all this whining nonsense about the Government being embarrassed? If they find themselves in difficulties, let them take the ordinary opportunities that are open to honourable men occupying their positions.

We have many young men in our own Forces who are not given the same opportunity.
