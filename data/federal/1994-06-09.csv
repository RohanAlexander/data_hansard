3,Mr BEAZLEY,SUPERANNUATION LAWS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill amends the Parliamentary Cbntributory Superannuation Act 1948-the PCS Act, the Parliamentary Contributory .. Superannuation Amendment Act 1981, and the Parliamentary Contributory SuperanilUation Amendment Act 1983. The main purpose of the amendments is to allow the parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and associated acts and regulations, referred to as the SI(S) legislation, in relation to the vesting and preservation of members' benefits, and disclosure of information to members of the scheme. The opportunity is also being taken to correct a number of inequities in aspects of the scheme. Amendments are being made to the arrangements covering the reduction of former members' pensions when they hold offices of profit, invalidity retirements, service in state and territory parliaments, as welI as in the Commonwealth parliament, and a minor amendment is being made to spouse benefits. Honourable members will recall that the SI(S) legislation provides for the prudent management of certain superannuation funds, particularly with regard· to the security of members' moneys, and for certain minimum standards. The parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme is an unfunded scheme, that is, there is no separately invested fund and members' contributionS of 11112 percent of their salary are paid into the consolidated revenue fund.· Consequently, many of the SI(S) provisiOns are not relevant to the scheme. However, the government has decided that all Commonwealth schemes. that are completely. unfunded will comply with the main operative provisions of the SI(S) legislation, that is, vesting, preservation and disclosure of information to fund members-. .Turning to the vesting aspect first, the SI(S) legislation and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 taken together require that alI employees receive a minimum level of employer sponsored superannuation support. While the pension benefits. provided by the scheme will meet this minimum requirement in all cases, the lump sum benefits provided where. persons do not qualify for pensions may not, in some cases, meet that minimum requirement. Accordingly, the bill proposes 'topping up' lump sums where necessary so that recipients receive at least the legislated superannuation guarantee minimum available to most other workers in the community. With regard to the preservation arrangements,there are no provisions in the PCS Act which require the preservation of lump sum benefits. The bill amends that act to ensure the preservation of lump sum benefits in line with the SI(S) legislation. I should mention that, in common with the arrangements that apply to all other superannuation schemes, the preservation. arrangements do not affect "" pension entitlements· as the pensions are payable for life. Finally in the SI(S) context, there are currently no provisions in the PCS Act requiring disclosure of information to members. Honourable members will be aware that the Department of Finance has provided members with annual·statements for the last three years. Relevant information has also been provided to new members and to retiring members. The bill formalises these administrative arrange;,. ments by amendments to the PCS Act to apply the SI(S) legislation disclosure arrangements. The PCS Act currently provides for the reduction of a pynsion where a beneficiary the holder of an office of profit. Offices profit are defined to include positions such ambassadors, judges and positions that judicial status. Many less w-1I paid positions, such as part-time 'board members of Commonwealth and state authorities, are also included in the definition of an office of profit. Currently,most people who hold part-time posithat tions lose the entire remuneration paid from the office of profit. This is a result of cmi""ent, pension ·reduction of $1 Jor each dollare-rned from the office of profit until 50 per cent of the initial pension entitlement has been removed. The bill amends the PCS Act to decrease the amount of pension reduction to 50c for each dollar earned from an office of profit, and to provide a threshold below which territory earnings from an offic- of profit cause no reduction in pension. For persons who receive substantial remuneration from an office of profit, the current 50 per cent maximum ments pension reductio,n will continue to apply. The PCS Act currently provides for the parliamentary retiring allowances trust to grant a member of the scheme an invalidity retirement benefit if it is of the opinion the member's resignation from the parliament is made bona .fide on grounds of ill-health. The PCS Act provides little guidance to the trust in making a decision. The current rangements make no provision for the special demands of parliamentary service, as the $80,000 invalidity arrangements in the Defence Force superannuation schemes do in respect of demands of military service. Accordingly, bill introduces procedures to be followed where there is an application, for invalidity retirement, provides for three degrees of invalidity with differing benefit levels, provides for a mechanism to review invalidity assessments once made. The parliamentary superannuation scheme currently provides for the recognition of periods of service in a state or territory parliament in some circumstances, and for reduction of benefits payable from the scheme where the beneficiary' is a member of a state or territory parliament or is receiving a sion as a result of such a membership. Under is the current arrangements, the interaction of of Commonwealth and state/territory legislation as usually results in the Commonwealth funding have all of a ,benefit that is based on both Commonwealth and state or territory service. The bill amends the PCS Act so that periods of state or territory service will be recognised in the scheme only to the extent the service is purchased through payment of a transfer value from the state or territory the scheme to the Commonwealth scheme. If a transfer value is paid, the state or territory service would be recognised on the same basis as service in other employment is recognised on the payment of a transfer value. It is proposed that benefits paid under the PCS Act would continue to be reduced where the beneficiary is a member of a state or parliament, but would not be reduced where a beneficiary of the scheme is also in receipt of a state or territory parliamentary pension. Importantly, transitional arrangeare included in the bill 'to protect the benefitS available to current members with prior state or territory parliamentary service. It is not possible to' quantify the precise financial impact of the changes in the bill that because of the limited application of the amendmerits in the relatively small parliamentary superannuation scheme. Having said that, however, the restoration or partial restoarration of pensions to persons who currently hold an office of profit is estimated to cost in a full year. It is expected that, in the longer term, these additional costs will be the more than offset by savings made by the the Commonwealth no longer recognising prior state or territory parliamentary service at no cost to the state or territory. In summary, therefore, the changes in budgetary outlays and and change in long-term costs from the measures in the bill are expected to be relatively insignificant. I commend the bill to the House.",11
4,Mr ANDREWS,SUPERANNUATION LAWS,"At the outset, I indicate to the Minister for the Finance (Mr Beazley) that the opposition supports the Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill.·We have a number of concerns on penthese matters which I might raise with the minister during my remarks. I am informed that there are some 223 members and senators contributing to the scheme at present and some 264 former members and senators receiving benefits under the parliamentary superannuation scheme as at 30 June 1993. These provisions arise from some problems with the operation of the scheme, one of which is the provision of invalidity payments. As the minister· pointed out prior to the introduction and the coming into operation of this legislation, the question of how invalidity could be treated under the act was something which was unsure and somewhat uncertain. The new arrangements provide that categories of invalidity can be determined by the trust and, depending on the level of invalidity of a senator or member, the level of benefit which may be paid is then determined. We certainly support the clarification of that aspect of the bill. There are also provisions in relation to lump sum payments whereby a certain proportion of a benefit can be taken by way of lump sum. I wish to raise one matter of concern about that. I am informed that, since 1948, some 75 per cent of former members and senators have qualified for the parliamentary superannuation scheme. This means that, if that proportion is maintained jn the future, one quarter of all members of parliament will not fully qualify under this scheme. The reality these days seems to. be that the average period of service in parliament is some six to seven yeats. When we look at the records. of service of members of the parliament, we find that these days members are coming in at perhaps a younger age and are certainly not staying the length of time that members and senators stayed in the past. There are some notable exceptions, such as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honour our side, and there have been others from the government sideMrs Bishop-The Prime Minister.",12
5,Mr ANDREWS,SUPERANNUATION LAWS,"Yes, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), whose period of. service to the parliament has been of some considerable time. In each of the· cases of those three gentlemen, their serVice has been in - he order of 25 years, on average. Maybe the change in the pace of life affecting members of parliament is why, on average, the length of service to the nation through the parliament has been reduced-the average period of service is now six to seven years, which is less than the minimum qualifying period for the scheme. When people enter parliament at a younger age and perhaps stay for only one or two terms, their ability, in their mid-40s, to go back to a profession or job is proving very difficult. This occupation in parliament is now a full-time one and it is very difficult for most of us to carry on any other sort of occupation, unless perhaps one is lucky enough to be a farmer and have someone run the farm but, even in those circumstances, it is proving very difficult. People come in here from all walks of life and from all political persuasions and give up their profession or occupation, and do so at an early stage, and for many it can mean that they have to go back to working outside the parliament after a period of, say, six to seven years. If they are in their mid-40s or so, it means starting a career again because, in most cases, they have young familieS and it is not simply a matter of being. able to retire, so to speak, on the publicpurse.,-far from it. So the ability to be able to conver:t some of any accumulated benefits intO a lump sum to enable them to start their occupation or profession again is obviously quite important. We realise on this side that. in a superannuation scheme, which is aimed at providing a retirement income for people generally, there must be a balance between providing a retirement income, which is the purpose of superannuation, and in this instance, because of the peculiar circumstances of parliamentary service, being able to have some of those funds available to, in effect, restart a career. Therefore, we are pleased that th- amount of 50 per cent by way of a .lump s-m has been provided. It is something which I think we should continue to monitor becaUSe there may be circumstances where, if members are leaving parliament alan earlier age, the figure ought to be reviewed. The. other matter which I wish to comment on relates to the position of former state members of parliament. I noted in the section Minister for Finance's second reading speech that he made reference to this matter and said that the act would be amended so that periods of state or territory service would be recogmember nised in the scheme only to the extent that service is purchased through payment of a transfer value from the state or territory scheme to the Commonwealth scheme. He went on to indicate that transitional arrangesome ments are included in the bill to protect benefits available to current members prior state or territory parliamentary service. The reality, of course, is that from time time members and senators who have served in state parliaments are elected to the federal parliament, and the preservation of any results entitlements which they have as a result their parliamentary service elsewhere is important to them. I am informed by some of my colleagues, and there are members. on both sides of the House in this they have some concern about the possibility of ,a disadvantage arising from this proposal. I noted what the minister said in. his second reading speech; but, on behalf of them, would like to seek some assurance that they are, not going to suffer any impediment or disadvantage as a consequence of these state arrangements. I am informed that some proposed complegetting mentary legislation will be introduced in the states in relation to ihis matter, not occurred .at . this stage. Therefore the possibility ora lacuna developing in relation to this matter. is obviously of major concern to them. Some assurance from the minister that they will not suffer any disadvantage a result of this matter would, I am sure, reassure them. We are supportive of this bill subject to these concerns being allayed. The Parliamentary Library.raised a question about the possibly unconstitutional effect of parts of this legislation by dint of the ation of section 44 of the constitution relation to ho]ding offices of profit. I presume that the minister and those· who advised him will have looked at this matter. .As we have observed in recent years, citizens' of the 'Commonwealth have been prepared to take a suit to the High Court under the provisions of 44 of the constitution. Whilst I have no doubt that the government fully intends that that should not arise here, one would not like to 'see the situation arise where some or senator in this parliament' was the subject to a challenge of his or her position by virtue of the operation of section 44 of the constitution. I presume that has been well and truly looked at by the minister, but again .assurance .on that matter would be the comforting to those members and senators with who could be affected by it. Most of us realise we have to leave this to place at one .time or another.· Most of us prefer to leave voluntarily. Sometimes we have to leave involuntarily because of the of elections, but I am sure that none of of us want to leave involuntarily because of some technical difficulty with section 44 of the constitution. I would be grateful if. the minister could address those specific concerns situation, that with the legislation.",13
6,Mr MACK,SUPERANNUATION LAWS,"If there is one thing that brings parliamentarians and the institution of parliament into disrepute I it is the enormously generous unfunded parliamentary superannuation schemes that exist for federal parliament and also for the parliaments. It .is interesting that the Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill is very minimal attention, because I think most people in here are really aware of but that has the situation. I think these schemes underline the selfserving nature of parliaments and to an extent they make a mockery of the endless calls that we hear in here about concerns for the wellas being of the public, Further expanding the benefits for members and ex-members on top of the recent salary and: benefit rises is quite unjustified and is. guaranteed to bring this institution and all of us inhere into contempt. At a time when we· have almost a million operunemployed, when we have an· DECD report in expressing alarm at the widening disparity between the rich and the poor in Australia, and while there·has'been some dispute about that OECDreport, I notice the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has·' tried to defend the report on the basis that we should take into account the many direct payments that have been made over recent years and that the disparity is really not as great as the report shows. That is really not much of a defence. because he is really saying that we are becoming much more of a welfare dependent society. This bill is couched in very obscure and complicated language, but fundamentally it gives members and ex:..members the option to take improved benefits. It is quite clear from the bill-I think the previous speaker, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), can be assured of this-that no-one will be worse off. We stand only to gain. The public are going to like the expansion of benefits for ex-members who are in public positions-in other words, making jobs for the boys much more attractive than they were in the past. I find this appalling when millions of low income workers, mainly women, have been forced to pay superannuation that they cannot afford and then have fees and charges use up most of their funds, yet we are making jobs for the boys, for ex-members, more attractive. There is no unfunded, fully guaranteed scheme for the average person like ours. There are no management charges on MPs' superannuation. We have a situation where it is just one law for us and another for the public. We cannot expect them to respect us for it. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) yesterday expressed belated concern about low income workers and superannuation-he is going to support the removal of fees and charges-but I think the general public can only regard this as so much hypocrisy. The basic fact is that we enjoy· superannuation far beyond the dreams of the average worker. We receive vastly greater contributions from our employers, who are in theory those same low income workers. We can enjoy benefits long before we reach retiring age, unlike the rest of the community. I am sure other members had people coming into their offices because of the recent recession wanting to somehow get access to their superannuation funds. to help them over a difficult period, and of course they cannot. They cannottouch them, but we can. Most of them have to pay on average for around 40 years and get far less in benefits than we can get after eight years. As the previous speaker pointed out, this situation is going to get far worse because the average age of parliamentarians is dropping. We have larger and larger parliaments and the time spentin parliament is getting shorter and shorter. Real increases in salaries are going on all the time. To try to pretend that this is only a minimal cost of $80,000 which applies to ex-members in public positions is, I think, really trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the public. Under the current scheme we have 264 beneficiaries and the public are paying some $12.8 million, which is indexed. That works out at around $50,000 a head and does not include other retirement benefits such as the gold pass. We have seen in the past that some people have taken· another $30,000 each for gold passes. I admit that that has been restricted somewhat in recent times, but it would be interesting to know how many retired members might accumulate frequent flier points and get a couple of extra overseas trips a year. As I understand it, there is no effective way of checking on those matters. The explanatory memorandum attempts to minimise the costs of all this. As I said, it indicates only $80,000, but that disregards the flow-on effects to all of the states and eventually the flow-on effects to the Public Service in general. At least the explanatory memorandum does indicate that it really is impossible to quantify the total costs. It is claimed that there are some offsets, but when we really look at what those offsets·are we see that they are really only the federal government passing the costs back to the states. But the taxpayers are not interested in sleight of hand between the Commonwealth and the states. The fact is that they are paying. Another indefensible arrangement is the administering trust, which is five members of this House. Would the publi- not like to be able to administer their own .superannuation trusts? When questions of extra·benefits come out, the members of the trust are very conscious-they are usually senior members of this House-of their own benefits .. Without casting any aspersions on them, there is every incentive to be a lot more generous with public funds than with their own. They can allow extra benefits without any financial loss to the members because we have an unfunded scheme. I am genuinely· affronted by this proposal, and I think many in the community would also be affronted. I have had a long standing position· on this. I have refused benefits on two occasions. I say that simply to indicate a consistency of position over the last 10 years. I am not against parliamentary superannuation schemes. If a scheme were comparable to the public scheme, I would be very much in favour of it. I think the arguments that people try to. maunt far a special case far paliticians are quite spuriaus. In this day and age af cantract emplayment, many peaple suddenly have to change careers several times in their lifetime. The aId idea af career service has gane farever. We are no. different from anyane else in the cammunity. Other peaple can tum up to. wark an Manday to. suddenly find they have been sacked. We have much greater security in a sense, and I do. nat believe there is a special case to. be made far paliticians. think the public will be genuinely affronted by this bill. If we had any respect for the public, we wauld withdraw the bill.",14
7,Mr BEAZLEY,SUPERANNUATION LAWS,"Swan-Minister far Finance) (9.56 a:m.)..;....in reply-I presume nabody else wants to. speak, so. I will clase the debate an the Superannuatian Laws Amendment Bill 1994. I want to. pick up a cauple of paints that were made by bath speakers who. havespaken on the bill. The hanourable member far Menzies (Mr Andrews), who. spake far the appositian, made a number af paints and sought assurance an same af them. I think his basic analysis of the very shart periad that mast members serve in parliament is carrect. I think the average term is abaut seven. years. Althaugh it is passible to. see a cambinatian af circumstances that wauld produce a parliamentary pensian within seven years, generally speaking it wauld nat. The problem to.. which the hanaurable member alludes af future members leaving this place withaut access to. much of the maneys they are ultimately entitled to. is a point of same concern to a number af members an bath sides af the Hause. That matter is nat addressed in this bill. Its. impact is unlikely to. fall terribly heavily on anyane who. is here, but it will certainly fall heavily an people who. are subsequently elected to. the parliament. . The way in which the cammunity handles this prablem-because this bill makes the parliamentary scheme like any . ather. scheme it) the cammunity as far as lump sum entitlements.are concerned-is thraugh redundancy payments. Redundancy payments are not part af a superannuatian benefit and therefare cauld nat sit as a piece af superannuatian legislatian. Same af us on this side af the House are turning aur attentian to. the matter to. see whether there is a way it can be addressed. The Cammissioner af Taxatian, as I understand it, daes not accept that parliamentary defeat canstitutes redundancy because thejab is cantinuing. Nevertheless, the circumstances have all the characteristics af a persan being made campulsarily redundant. Whether it has the. technical characteristics is anather matter. II think there is a problem in that members af parliament are unusually disbenefited campared. to. the rest af the cammunity. The second pain.t that he raised was the service af existing members. In these amendments there is no. diminutian af benefit far any person who. has a state entitlement. Such peaple have the right to. persist. with the arrangements that are in place to. this point. A 'lacuna' might arise-that is the ward that he used-in the passibility that these changes cauld produce a better benefit. In ather words, there is a possibility, if state legislatian is passed in a certain way, that the cambined tatal af the twa benefits may exceed the benefit that wauld naw be abtained. It is anly a passibility because these schemes have a series af ramificatians assaciated with them that may praduce ane effect far ane persan and a different· effect far anather persan depending an their terms af service, the extent of time they may have served in ministries and so. an. Unless the states pass camplementary legislation, the po-ibility of additional benefits being obtained by existing members of parliament will not exist. There is also the possibility that lesser benefits will be obtained by members of pl:lrliament who choose to opt into this arrangement if the state legislation reads in that way. The principal point is that, while it is' possible for better or worse options to be offered via state legislation to existing bers of this parliamellt, it is not possible for them to be offered worse optiolls than they currently experience if they choose to· stay with the arrangements that are currently in place. The issue relating to section 44 of the constitution has been raised informally with my department. It has had opinionsexpressoo to it on this. I am advised that no problem arises with this section. This legislatiQn the parliamentary scheme as· close as it possibly can to the experience in the general community. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), said, it is' true that the parliamentary scheme is' a generous one in comparison to most schemes. But the gap is dosing quite substantially. The honourable member said that people would; through their lives, locate themselves in a number of different superannuation schemes. That is a perfectly valid analysis. This legislation brings tary scheme closer to that situation. . This legislation assumes that most members of parliament will come in here with some form of superannuation cover. Up to this point in time many will not have unless they were state or federal public servants or state parliamentarians. If people change employment, most schemes that are confronted in the general community will offer those people the opportunity to buy into the scheme connecte4 with their next employment or to. stick, effectively, with an accumulation of schemes. This legislation will do exactly the same·thing for the parliamentary scheme. There has been quite a substantial attack on the motivation of existing members of parliament. In our defence, whilst it is true that this is an unfunded scheme and benefits are substantial; it is also true that there would be very few people in the community and very few people for many years to come who would contribute from their own income anything like the amount that is imposed on members of parliament in this place. We contribute 111/2 per cent of our income. Most other superannuation schemes have contributory arrangements that are .much less than that. The benefits we emerge with at the end mem-:- of the day have not been accrued without some degree of sacrifice on oiJr part. The sacrifice has been so extensive that in the state area, but not in the federal area, one or two state politicians have chosen to opt out of their schemes and to keep their contributions b-ause they felt they would be much better off. I think they were unwise in their judgment, but the personal contribution of members' of parliament is so substantial that brings that issue does arise for many people. . . . I am able to give the opposition spokesman the assurances that he seeks to most of the concerns he expressed. I cannot give him an assurance on the first problem that he mentioned. I think that is a matter for ongoing discussion and trust between members of this place. .",16

Second Reading",17
11,Mr JOHNS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (10.06 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 which would suspend for three years the age discrimination provisions of that act in relation to junior wage rates. This issue was foreshadowed in the government's Working Nation white paper on employment and growth. These provisions were included in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 as a result of amendments in the Senate in December last year. Although the Sen-te amendments required that junior wage rates be removed from all federal awards as they are progressively reviewed under the act by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, they did not allow for a transition period. These provisions are also creating difficulties for new agreements and awards, because some employers have not had sufficient time to adapt to the new requirement. The government has received representations suggesting that many parties,particularly those whose awards would be examined early in the first statutory review period, would not be able. to adjust to the new requirements in time. The government considers that an orderly change to competency based wages can be achieved within three years and re.;. gards this as a reasonable transition period. The government is concerned that the existing requirements of the act may create difficulties· for that orderly transition, that many parties appear to need more time to develop wage arrangements that pay workers on· the basis of their skill and capacity rather than their age. This bill will modify the effect of the four provisions in the act that prevent age discrimination. They are to be suspended to the extent that they apply to discrimination because an employee has not reached a particular age. The provisions concerned are. for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to review all awards over a three-year cycle beginning on 22 June 1994; for the commission to certify agreements and to approve enterprise flexibility agreements; and a provision contained in the act's principal object. The period of suspension in each case would correspoild with the first three-year cycle of award reviews under section 150A of the act. In other words, this aspect of the age discrimination provisions would commence in relation to wage rates on 22 June 1997. All other grounds of award review would commence on 22 June 1994. This would result in the commission's only applying the age discrimination element of section 150A in the second and subsequent three-year cycles of award reviews. Similarly, agreements which contained wage rates that discriminated on the basis of age could not be approved or certified under the actfrom 22 June 1997. . The government rema,ins committed to the general policy of preventing and eliminating age discrimination. However, the government has been persuaded that a suspension of the relevant provisions. of the act would facilitate the orderly introduction of more appropriate arrangements for junior rates. Amendments concerning termination of employment I also wish to foreshadow amendments to the bill that relate to the termination of employment provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. The proposed amendments, which were announced by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) on 30 May 1994, will change certain aspects' of those provisions, namely: who is covered by the given termination of employment provisions; the amounts of compensation that can be awarded by,the court; and where the onus of proof lies in proceedings before the court. The tennination of employment provisions are part of a safety net of statutory minimum entitlements for employees who do not have adequate alternative remedies. This protection is contained in part VIA of the Industrial Relations Act, which took effect on 30 Mar-h 1994. Broadly expressed, the termination of employment provisions have the following feat\lres. Under the act, an employer. have a valid reason for dismissing an employstatutory ee. That reason must be connected with the employee's conduct or capacity or the operarrangements ational requiremellts. of the employer's busialready ness. An employee must be allowed to rebe spond to any alleged grounds of dismissal, except if the employer could not be reasonably expected to give that opportunity to employee. Employees must be given specified periods of notice or pay in lieu of that notice, unless that is not reasonable. The act also prohibits dismissals on various discriminatory grounds. Some reasonable exceptions are allowed. There are also consultation and notification provisions in respect redundancies. If someone is sacked and wants to challenge the dismissal, the Industrial Relations· Court can decide whether dismissal was fair, unless there is an adequate alternative remedy available under other federal or state laws. Conciliation occurs before the· Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the usual case. If conciliation fails and the employer cannot justify the dismissal, under the current law the court can order the employee's reinstatement or the payment of compensation or both. These provisions are to be modified in following ways. The amendments will confine the tennination provisions to employees who are .either employed under a federal. or award or whose base wage is no more than $60,000 per year. This amount is to be inwhichever dexed annually by regulation to reflect inbe creases in average· weekly earnings.· restriction will not affect applications made to the court· before the bill is enacted. The exclusion of high income earners who are covered by awards is intended to ensure'that the court's resources are fully available address matters involving the lower paid and non-managerial employees who constitute the vast majority of the Australian work force. There will be a broader power to make regulations excluding categories of employees from· the provisions about tennination of employment, as allowed by the ILO·Termination of Employment Convention. This will allow regulations to be made to exclude those cases where the application of the legislation must is anomalous. An example is where the notice provisions could apply in a way which is not consistent with employment for which special provision has been made under an award. There will full consultation with interested parties before any regulations are made. The proposed modifications will maintain the the key objective of the current provisions, namely, to give employees protection against unfair dismissal. This is to be by reinstatement or, if that is not practicable, by fair compensation. The emphasis is on reinstatement in an unfairly dismissed employee's former position or one that has no less favourof able tenns. In such a case, the court will be able to make orders for the payment of any lost remuneration and to preserve the the employee's continuity of service. The court will also be able to award compensation as an alternative where reinstatementis impracticable. This condition is not meant to be narrowly construed. It is expected that the court will have regard to the surrounding· circumstances, such as the practical effect of reinstatement on· the· working relationship or the industrial consequences. . Compensation that is awarded instead of the reinstatement is to be limited to an amount not exceeding six months remuneration. For non-award employees, the compensation will state be limited to an amount which does not exceed six months remuneration or $30,000, is the lower. This amount will also indexed annually by regulation to reflect This increases in average weekly earnings. The· onus of· proof in court proceedings alleging unlawful dismissal is to be altered. not The employer will only have the onus of establishing. that the dismissal was·for a valid to reasoli. The applicant will have the onus of establishing any other elements of the caSe, including that a dismissal was harsh, unjust unreasonable. Employers involved in proceedings before the court about termination of employment will be given the right to be represented by any association of employers to which they belong. At present, only federally registered organisations of employers can represent their members in such proceedings. The government is proceeding with these amendments in advance of a review of the practical operation of the act scheduled for later this year. This action is being taken in direct response to some employers' views that the existing unfair dismissal provisions are impediment to employment. The government considers that the concerns expressed in some quarters·about the legislation are exaggerated, particularly since the court has yet to order compensation in any application under the existing provisions. Even so, it is not acceptchanges, able for the termination of employment provisions to be perceived as an impediment to the recovery of the labour market. It also appears that a number of claims have been made in the court in anticipation of more generous awards of compensation than have been available in other jurisdictions. This is not consistent with the purpose of these provisions, which is to guarantee adequate forms of protection for people who do not otherwise have them. The amendments should also assist in ensuring that proceedings before the court are not delayed by unnecessary arguments about the adequacy of alternative remedies or arguments about the validity of extremely large claims for compensation. The g<;>vemment considers that the amendments will ensure that the' provisions operate fairly and effectively, particularly for ordinary Australacknowledged Ian employees who require the protection of the law against the unfair termination of their employment. Financial impact The bill will have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill, and I commend the bill to the House.",18
12,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"On behalf of the opposition let me say at the outset that we do not intend to vote agaillSt the proposal about the youth wage rates. We have a lot of reservations about .what I might call the Carmichael regime so far as training wages in this country are concerned. We are not certain that.the best approach to training wages is to relate them entirely within the concept of awards. However, the government. is saying that it is not practicable to proceed with the removal of the age related junior wage rates at present and that· they ought to· be maintained over a transition period. I have absolutely no argument with that at all, and the an opposition will not be voting against it. Nor, indeed, will the opposition vote against the changes the government now proposes to the wrongful dismissal .provisions of the Industrial Relations Reform Act. Those coming as they do within what must be a world record short period of time after a bill has been enacted, will make an unsatisfactory· act somewhat less unsatisfactory but will still leave the act as a very unsatisfactory piece of legislation. For reasons which I will canvass briefly in a moment, it is an act which actually makes the Australian labour market more rigid and less productive and represents a further impediment to the achievement of higher levels of productivity and international competitiveness by the Australian economy. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the passage of this Bill, the House, aware of the distress caused by Austraiia's continuing high rate of unemployment, mindful that a heavily regulated labour market contributes to unemployment, and conscious of the DEeD's strictures of Australia's dilatory rate of labour market reform; reminds the Government that it has . the need for greater flexibility in the labour market, states its belief that this Bill will do nothing to achieve it, and urges the Government to . abandon its Industrial Relations Reform Act which not only has failed. to relieve labour market deficiencies but exacerbated them"". That second reading amendment encapsulates all that the opposition has been saying for a long time about the state of industrial relations and the state of labour market law in this country. I take this opportunity to restate my very strong conviction that labour market reform is the nerve centre of micro-economic reform in this country. We will never have a truly modem and competitive Australian economy until we reform our labour market. We will never reform our labour market unless we do four essential things. The first thing to do is give all Australian workers, subject to adequate protection on the question of minimum standards, an absolute right without duress to either continue to be employed under the existing award structure or to enter freely and voluntarily into an employment contract which does not need to be vetted-unless it is the desire of the worker-by a trade union, the Industrial Relations Commission or any other body. To deregulate the Australian labour market in its best sense, we need to give freedom. of choice. That is a choice that has to be exercised without duress and without fear of victimisation. Equally, to truly free the Australian labour market, we need to give Australian employers the opportunity to operate without compulsion and without fear of duress. So principle No.. 1 is freedom of choice. It is a great Australian principle, a great liberal principle and a principle that is important to the future international competitiveness of the Australian economy. Principle No. 2 is that people should have absolute freedom of association: I know it is hard for those opposite to emotionally embrace the concept of freedom of association. They preach from the mountaintops about discrimination when it comes to sex, religion and all sorts of other things. They carry on about age discrimination. The politically correct have captured every high point inside the bureaucracy that advises the government on these matters. They even have the nerve and the gall to lay down a set of guidelines in the Australian Public Service about workplace harassment. They virtually tell people whom they can have a drink with or whom they can dine with, but there is one thing they will never suffer telling people about: the compulsion to join a trade union. It is still a fact in this country, as I June 1994, that people are forced to join trade unions in order to be fairly and equally considered in the Australian Public Service. It is still a fact, despite what the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) and the government may say, that preference is given to people who belong to trade unions. I know of men and women who at the moment cannot get voluntary redundancies, because they do not belong to unions. I know of somebody who has been employed by a government agency for 29 years and who, out of conscientious belief, has never joined a trade union. This man was entitled to a voluntary redundancy, and he was told that he could not have it unlesshe paid 10 years back union dues. Ten years! That is blackmail. The minister grins. Do you think that is funny? Do you think it is funny for a man to be discriminated against? Mr Johns- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member implied that I am grinning at that remark. My facial expressions bear no relation to that remark.",20
13,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Order! The minister will resume his seat.,21
14,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"I am pleased to hear that you do not find that amusing. I would like to know what you are going to do about it. It is not a question of whether you find it amusing or whether I find it something or other. I want to know what is going to be done about that. You carry on about human rights. You lecture and preach and harass and hector from the other side of the House about discrimination, human rights and about the equality of men and women in our society. What kind of equality is it that will allow a great commercial agency of this country to do that sort of thing? What kind of fairness is it to put an advertisement in a newspaper calling for applicants for one of the DEET programs and, at the bottom of the advertisement, to say that preference will be given to people who belong to the Public Sector Union? That happened only a few months ago. All of us on this side of the House have examples of that kind of thing. This is not idle talk, this is the hard edge of speak in discrimination. You can make your fine speeches, you can send your Prime Minister overseas and you can talk about liberty, equality and fraternity while he rubbishes our flag and our constitution in a foreign country. What about a bit of liberty, equality and fraternity here in Australia when it comes to freedom of choice? It is an absolute cornerstone of what we believe in for a free labour market that people have freedom of choice. They should have a right to decide whether or not they belong to a union. That should apply whether a person is a metalworker, a doctor, a lawyer, a rugby league player or a shearer. It does not matter. There should be complete freedom of association right across the board. It does not exist at present. The concomitant of that must be that, if a person decides to join a union, he should not suffer any victimisation or punishment in consequence of that decision. It has always been part of our policy that people should be free to join unions, free of victimisation or punishment. .Let us examine our voting' record on this. At no stage have we ever voted against provisions of legislation guaranteeing people who join a union protection against victimisation. Yet, time and again, you have voted not only against protections in industrial relations legislation but also against guarantees in human rights legislation and against guarantees about freedom of association. The second great principle on which our approach to IR is built is total freedom of association. The third principle is that all sections of Australian community should be equal before the law. That is a very basic thing. It is very strange to me that, in 1994, we should still be arguing such basic issues. A great document written in ,1776 contained the very famous words: 'We hold certain truths to be self evident. ' That was the American constitution. One of the things that I hold to be self evident-and I would have thought every man and woman representing any party in this parliament would hold to be self-evident-is that all sections of the Australian community should be equal· before the law. The truth. is that, .under the act that was passed a few months ago, you once again place sections of the Australian society, namely, trade unions engaging in certain forms of secondary boycott activity, above the law. You treated them differently. You treated them less harshly-:",21
15,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Order! I remirtd the honourable member for Bennelong that he should address his remarks through the chair. His use of the second person and 'you' is a bit misleading on this occasion. He should address his remarks so that they clearly go through the chair and point out whom he is referring to as 'you'. I might have personal opinions but, while occupying this seat, I am the chair.",22
16,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"I am indebted to the declaration of neutrality that you have made, Mr Acting Speaker, and I am courteOusly rebuked. You are always very courteous and I appreciate that, Mr Acting .Speaker. It is self-evident that this government does not believe that one of the truths which are selfevjdent in our society is that everybody should be equal before the law. Let me illustrate my point. Under the law of this country which existed until the Industrial Relations Act was passed, if the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations, who is at the table, were running a business and one of his business competitors put a secondary boycott on its activities, he would have been 'able to go to the Federal Court and get an injunction telling that competitor to lift the boycott. He would have been able to do it immediately, straight away, as soon as the boycott began to bite. Equally, the under the law that used to exist, if a trade union had imposed that same boycott with the same consequence and the same damage, the minister's firm would have been able to go to the Federal Court to get an immediate injunction.That was equality before the law-same predatory behaviour, same consequence, same damage and same remedy. Under the changes that the government has now made and which we have voted against, that has been altered. The government has preserved the remedy if it is a compariy which is applying the boycott-it can still go im:mediately to the Federal Court. But the change it has made in relation to the trade union is that, if. a trade union puts on the boycott/the company cannot go to the Federal Court, for three days and, during that threeday period, it has to conciliate before the Industrial Relations Commission. Anybody wlth any atom of common sense knows that, if you say to - small firm which is denied essential supply that it is three days before it can go to court, that firm will sue for a settlement, it will cave in; in other words, it w-ll be puLata massive disadvantage. If it is necessary to avoid wasteful litigation, why did the government not amend the law to apply equally to a company; why is it that it does that favour for a union, but it does not do that favour for a company? It is a totally unjustified privilege which is being given to unions. I have no argument with unions occupying a central role in the industrial relations of Australia; I never have had. But I have every argument with trade unions being given privileges and being put above the law. Here is an open and shut case of how the trade unions in this particular respect have been placed above the law. That is the third principle that we are on about. The fourth principle is that people who decide to join unions should have a right join any union of their choice. It is very strange that,even when it comes to a choice of unions, this union-driven government reluctant to give people freedom of choice. We ought to have workplace unions in Aussaid tralia. We ought not be telling our workers that they can only join a small number of very large unions, many of which have no sort of coherent industry philosophy any more. We now have a combined mining, forestry and energy union; there is ""also that humorous example of where we have one union which embraces both clowns and journalists-and so the examples can be multiplied. Those are our four principles and, until in this country embrace that kind of approach, we will not reap the benefits of labour market deregulation. The government keeps telling that it has made great strides. I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the radio this morning speaking to a French audience. rubbished our"" constitution and denigrated Australia's history-once again; in a foreign country. He does not have the guts to do Australia. Why does he not do it here? Why does he have to go racing off to a foreign country? He rubbished the flag in Indonesia, and he has despoiled our history in France. Mr Adams-What has this got to do with it?",22
17,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"It has a lot to do with it because he was talking then about productivity and international competitiveness. He says that we need to change our constitution to do well in the world; if we do not, we will not do well in the Asia-Pacific region. Perhaps he can tell us why Hong Kong, which still has the Union Jack in the comer of its flag, with eight million people can have a GOP which is 25 per cent of that of China, which has a population of 1.2 billion people. I am sure the logic of that would totally escape our peripatetic Prime Minister. What the Prime Minister did not acknowledge when he addressed his French audience was that one of the things holding back the internationalisation of the Australian economy do is the rigidity of our labour market. The to OECD told us' a few weeks ago that, between 1987 and 1992, Australia's productivity growth was only 70 per cent of the OECD is so average. The OECD only yesterday, in a report on .unemployment in its member states, that rigidity of labour markets was one of the major. causes of high unemployment. That same report by the OECD identified the rigid labour markets of continental Europe and Oceania-Oceania being Australia and New Zealand-as suffering, more than other member states of the OECD, the affliction of high unemployment caused by rigid labour markets. The OECD and many others have .pointed out that the United States labour market is infinitely more flexible than is ours and, as a consequence, the United States has we an unemployment rate of 6.5 per cent. There is a lot of evidence against this us government's record When it comes to the labour market. It talks about reform, it runs scare campaigns and it talks about the oppresHe sion of workers. There is nothing more oppressive for a worker than not to be able to work; that is the ultimate· indignity and the it in ultimate oppression. The government is running an industrial relations system which shuts people out of jobs, which frightens small employers out of taking on more staff. The government has essentially admitted that the unfair dismissal provisions that it brought in a couple of months ago did have a negative effect, otherwise it would not changing them. It cannot seriously expect us to believe that, after only two months operation, something has to be changed any reason other than it was wrong in the firSt place. If it had been in operation for a couple of years and those opposite had come in and said, 'Well, look, it's gone all right for couple of years, it's served its purpose but now have to change it,' I could understand that. But, for heaven's sake, these unfair dismissal provisions have been on the statute book for only eight weeks. We were told when they came in that nobody had anything to worry about. But it was obvious from. very beginning that people had a lot to be concerned about and, as a consequence, the government has found it necessary to change those provisions. We do not think the government has gone far enough. We think the changes are better than the bill in its existing form-that is why we are not going to vote against we believe very strongly that the government should have gone much further. The onus of proof is still on a person to establish the valid reason .for dismissal. That will mean, practice; that every small employer will to keep a dossier on every employee that or she has and will have to take a careful record and. note of every discussion that employer· has with the people who are embelief ployed. Of course, for reasons I have already outlined and also made in other speeches this parliament in recent weeks, other sections of the legislation are highly objectionable. have dealt with secondary boycott provisions. The workplace bargaining provisions, which are meant to give anew era, as promised by the Prime Minister, to people in the. non-union sector, are of course a joke in that respect. that common law can solve all. The game' has been given away by people su<;h as Stan Sharkey of the building unions who has made it perfectly clear with· his famoUs' 'ton ·of bricks' phrase that, as far as ,he is concerned, we cannot expect unions to stand by and allow employers and employees in the non-unionised sector to make workplace deals without unions muscling in on the situation. We will not vote against the specific be . amendments because they make very unsatisfactory legislation slightly liss unsatisfactory. of But we will be pursuing the second reading f9r amendment and, in the process, yet again saying to this parliament that the most urgent area of micro-economic reform in this country remains the labour market. It is still the litmus a test of whether goveniments and oppositions we are serious about micro-economic reform,. We will not have a modern Australian economy until we change the operation of our labour market, until we trust workers and employers at an individual plant level without unwanted interference from anybody, be it a the union, an employer organisation, a goverriment, or an interfering bureaucract. ;-whatever it may be-and until we change our·industrial relations system. It is through that that we can genuinely. have higher levels of productivity. That is why we propose the second reading amendment - hich I commend to the House.",23
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Mr Andrew)them-but Is the amendment seconded? Mr Charles-I second the amendment.,24
19,Mr ADAMS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"I in oppose the amendment moved by the honourhave able member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) to he the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2). I want to deal with a couple of issues that the he raised. The honourable member has a great that common law has always protected working people. Common law has not always in protected working people, including the Tolpuddle Martyrs and many others. Industrial I relations is a little more complex than just holding up the common law 01' the rhetoric of a lawyer. The history of our country and many' other countries would show that, but the honourable member. has' a simplistic attitude ' . The honour-ble· Jl.lember holds up the American system and says that unemployment is lower in· America than Australia· and that, therefore, America's industrial relations system is better. Many working people. in America are working poor and have no dignity-and that· is where the honourable member's argument falls down. If we look at the system in America in detail, we find that it is deficient The Americans under the Clinton administration have been in Australia recently looking at our industrial system to see where they can make some gains and take some positive suggestions back to America. They have problems as they do not have an underpinning of their system. The bill deals with junior rates in awards and provides transition for three years from the old junior rates to a competency and skill based wage structure for juniors. In the old system, a junior was not usually older than 21 and rates commenced at about 50 per cent of the adult wage and. increased with age, rather than skill. We should be building in a recognition for skill. In the future, using a wage scheme based on skill and competency-not age-'-is definitely the way for this country to go. We should be building pathways for working people to go down. A young person in Australia should be able to train in an industry and pick up skills and competencies to do the task. We then need a regime in the training and education system that allows people to move to the next skill level with an acceptance of prior learning. In the past, we have made it hard for people to move on to other levels of training; The apprenticeship scheme has been seen as an end of training, not as a beginning. Junior workers receive no recognition for their skills or for how competent they are for the task they are to perform. If junior workers are to negotiate and bargain for their wages and conditions, they have a right to have their skill levels and competencies recognised. There is no reason in the future why workers cannot have pathways, from being· a junior worker to achieving a university degree. It will be based on· ability and there will be no other impediments, such as no prior recognition of the knowledge already acquired. For example, a fitter should be able to become a civil engineer if he has the ability, and a carpenter should be able to become a building inspector, with recognition of prior learning. If their ability and skill levels are such, should not be any impediments to slow them down or stop them from doing so. Junior· workers have always been· abused. They have had very weak bargaining posi:"" tions because they have been tied to the adult rate. So, no matter what the level of competency, they are paid a percentage of the adult rate'. In most industries, junior workers have always been charged out as full workers. If a third year motor mechanic services your car, you do not receive a discount on the bill because of his wage rate. Ifa cleaning contractor has a contract and uses juniors to do the cleaning, the savings are never passed on to the client. . Juniors in the future should have an opportunity to bargain by having their skills. and competencies recognised. Junior rates have been in existence for 70 years and are .common in industries where there is less skilled labour, such as in the retail sector and the restaurant industry. Unions have certainly recognised that there is a need feif pathways. Many have been active in. trying to solve the problems of allowing young people to learn on the job without compromising their conditions. The issue finally came before the ACTU Congress in 1989. The Carmichael report went into some detail of the changes required. This report advocated the abolition of junior wages in favour of additional training schemes and a compet-ncy based scheme called the Australian vocational certificate training system. The government has broadly supported this report and has sought cooperation with the states to enable young people t6 go ahead and gain skills that count towards their competency. The amendments to the principal act ensure that junior rates can continue iri federal awards and agreements and provide atransition. period of three years for the movement from junior wage rates to wage rates based on competency and skill. This bill reflects those policy goals. ThereJs no excuse to maintain the old ways .. Industry can afford - o change and employers have been given three years to implement those changes. . The other amendments deal with dismissal there and are mainly employer concerns. I think employers have been listening to their own rhetoric, but I accept that they have some genuine concerns. They have been taken into account in the amendments of the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns). People who have been involved in representing workers before a tribunal would know that, in the state systems in Australia, there have not been huge payouts. I do not believe that will go over to the new scheme. If conciliation helps to get people reinstated, to have the umpire used to sort out a problem, that is always useful. If the system breaks down and the employer cannot justify the dismissal, the court has certain obligations under these amendments, which I support. I support the bill and the government's foreshadowed amendments. I reject the opposition's amendment as being the shallow rhetoric that we are constantly hearing. I commend the bill to the House. Mr CHA,RLES (La Trobe) (10.49 a.m.)We are here tOday to debate the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill' (No.2), which amends the Industrial Relations Act 1988. With the help of one of theattetidants, I just measured this document. The act now measures precisely 24 millimetres in thicknessjust under an inch. Do honourable members remember what an inch is? We have a oneinch document which indicates the depth of complexity that we have put into what should be a simple matter of determination of wages and working conditions between employers and employees. We are here today to deal with, firstly, the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Last year we had the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, which was to amend the act. During the passage of that bill, we had amendments to the reform bill to amend the act. They were in two parts; som- amendments were put forward from our side of the House and 'some were the minister's. We now have an amendment bill to amend· the amendments to the reform act to amend the principal act. Today we also have amendments to the amendment bill to amend the amendments to the reform act to amend the principal act It is' almost hilarious-it is almost a joke-but it - is deadly serious. The regulation upon regulation that we dump on industry, business and commerce in this nation is intolerable, and this nation can no longer afford it. The OECD report, which we have talked about frequently throughout this week, condemns this government for its approach to industrial relations.·It says that if we want to do something about employment in Australia, relieve the dole queues and get rid of unemployment, we need a more flexible labour market. We all' know that. Even those on the government side know that, but they cannot take their fingers out of the pie. They have to continue to hold on. Why do they have to hold on? They have to hold on because there is this marriage between a political party and the Labor bureaucracy, which means that the ACTU has a seat in cabinet. That is why we have this whole mess of amendments to the Industrial Relations Act, which is already complex in detail. Regulation is piled on top of regulation for those people who are trying to provide products and services that the people of Australia want. We should be exporting those products and services to earn income for Australians to increase our standard of living. The amendment bill deals with youth wages. It gives us three years to ensure that the transition to the new competency bll$Xl system is not overly prolonged. If I had my preference, I would rather that this bill did not have a sunset clause for 1997,because I have some serious concerns about where we are headed with the·training reform agenda. It is clear we need to make sure that any new system we put in meets the requirements of industry, business and commerce, not just those of the training bureaucracy or the ACTU, which is the Labor bureaucracy. Those concerns are real, because a huge training bureaucracy has been built up around the whole concept of the Carmichael system i,n transition to competency based training. We all agree that the old-time training systems were inappropriate. We all know that the age of young people is not necessarily a determinant of their worth toa firm or organisation. Their .competence has a lot to do with it; how much training they' have has something to do with it. Experience is something for which employers will pay. At the end of the day, experience determines the worth of the actions of employees in helping their company. As long as they have skills and experience, it is easier to judge the value of employees to the organisation. In any case, the government has realised the error of its ways. So we are amending the bill to ensure that youth wage rates do not disappear while this new bureaucratic system evolves. I certainly hope that it evolves with the complete agreement of industry and that it does not just become one more bureaucratic nightmare. If we wind up filling up the award system with training requirements, we will further exacerbate our problems with - our inflexible labour market. . The competency standards which are set need to be practical. When those new competency standards are put in place, they should not radically alter the minimum pay rates for young working men and women. If they altered them dramatically, we would see an exacerbation of the unemployment problem with our youth, and that is something that all of uS would· decry. These competency standards must not preclude experience. Employee experience is a contributing factor that is of positive benefit to companies. The bill deals with youth wage rates. However, the amendments deal with the unfair dismissals court. We tried to tell the government when it brought the bill before this House that the unfair dismissals courtthe Industrial Relations Court, which was set up largely to hear. unfair dismissals-would find unfair dismissals because that is why it was set up. It has generated precisely what I predicted months ago in 1993. What I predicted would happen has happened: almost immediately the court's doors opened for business it was flooded with applications of unfair dismissals. Why is that so? Mr Deputy Speaker, have you ever met employees who have been dismissed who thought they had been fairly dismissed? I never have. I do not know any people who think they have been fairly dismissed. Those who have been dismissed from a job·consider that they have been hard done by. Whether they have or not is a matter for some·great discussion. But, if an employer finds an employee unsatisfactory, no court in the world will all of a sudden make the employee satisfactory to the business. A relationship cannot be established between an employer and an employee by a court or tribunal. There was an unfair dismissals tribunal in Victoria prior to October 1992. That tribunal was so logged with cases that it came to be the practical application of the point .that those who were dismissed automatically, for any reason whatsoever, took their case to the tribunal. Why? Because; at the very least, the tribunal would find something in favour of the dismissed employee, regardless of what the employee had done-be that not coming to work, stealing out of the company's till, coming to work drunk or having unsatisfactory performance-or whether the company just could not use that person's services any more.· I am reminded of a case in my electorate. A very small employer--a carpet supplier to homes....,...worked in an office in a small warehouse. He had one staff member, a girl Friday-a young lady who worked with him - and did a whole range of duties. She had a better job opportunity, so he agreed to let her go. He put an ad in the newspaper and selected a replacement employee. On the day in question, the new employee arrived while the owner of the business was having discussions with a client about what colour carpet the client was going to buy. The employer said to the young lady, 'Would you just make us a cup of coffee, please?' She replied, 'I do not make coffee.' He said, 'Oh, all right. Well, the vacuum cleaner is over there in the cupboard. Would you just get the vacuum and dean up while I finish these discussions with the client?' 'I do not hoover,' she said. So by about 2 o'clock that afternoon the two of them had agreed that the arrangement was not going to be satisfactory, that in fact it just was not going to work out. The job was not what she thought it was to be and she was obviously not what he needed, so they agreed that . they would dispense with this arrangement. But she said, 'Would you mind giving me the sack because if you don't then I can't get unemployment benefits if I don't find another job.' So reluctantly he agreed and said, 'You're sacked.' Within 48 hours he had an unfair dismissals case on the books. That is-precisely the kind of thing that pens out there in the real world. No-one ever thinks they are fairly dismissed. When we set up procedures, rules and regulations surrounding relationships between employers and employees, we surround the whole relationship with legalism and procedural arguments. Employers in my electorate have found dealing with these procedures extremely costly. The employer, if he uses head, will find that he needs legal advice the legal advice does not come inexpensively. The legal advice is expensive and time consuming and the employer finds himself bound up in legal arguments. An employee may have been dismissed fairly and yet, because some very small point of a very long, detailed procedural requirement has not been met, the court will find in favour of the employee. The problem with all of this is that it encourages unemployment. It discourages business people from hiring new people and giving them a go because they are frightened to death of the cost. As many employers learnt in 1990 and 1989, the economy goes bad and they are faced, unfortunately, with redundancies. Most of these people do not like losing their people, because good employees are the basis of any company. Companies do not want to lose their employees, but there may be no other choice and they are faced with redundancy. The cost of redundancy built now into our formal system is so high that many employers have personally told me that they will not hire permanent staff again as we come out of this recession because they are frightened of the high cost of redundancies if the recovery does not work, if we go back into recession. . The same argument is used over and over again, particularly by small and medium sized businesses. With the present structured unfair dismissal procedures they cannot afford the time or the cost. The regulation requirements for discussion and notification of anything employee does wrong make it extremely difficult for small business people to run their businesses, keep track of employees and get on with the job; What is the result? They work longer hours themselves, they \lire fewer people than they otherwise would and we as hap- a country .suffer. We suffer because the unemployed do not have work they want and we suffer because we then pay taxes to support those who are unemployed so that they can live reasonable lives. All these regulations act as a· structural impediment to full employment in the Australian economy. That is why we are opposed to the Industrial· Relations Reform Act. We his are not opposed to these amendments as such and because they make the situation marginally better-thank goodness they do-but they certainly do not fix the problem which has been set up. The act is complex and the unions are still able to use compulsory arbitration for broad based craft or industry award increases and at the same time pursue enterprise bargains in other venues. We now have this dual system set up by the reform act which allows unions-not individual employees but unions - to seek changes to awards across an industry or across a whole craft which may straddle several industries and at the same time be negotiating with individual firms for enterprise agreements for changes at the firm level. One suspects that we are ultimately going to see huge confusion in the marketplace. We are neither fish nor fowl. We. are neither here nor there. It has, been, pointed out by more than one internationally respected researcher that those econpmies that have centrally, highly structured wage determination systems and those that have completely deregulated labour markets do the best in terms of unemployment rates. The ones in the middle, such as Australia, trying. to .be· a bit of the best to everyone, are the ones that fail. There is no encouragement whatsoever in this huge set of regulations for small to medium sized business. That is where employment growth is. Major business is still divesting itself of jobs and will continue to do so at least for the balance of this financial an year. We know that because it has told us. It is still finding efficiencies and it is still shedding staff. If we are going to take up the unemployed, we need to do· so in small and medium sized business. Regulation is killing them. Employer after .employer has come to me and told me about the difficulties they have with the superannuation guarantee levy. The paperwork is just. a bureaucratic nightmare. The construction industry lives with the prescribed payments system, which has been a long standing headache: The multiplicity of oncosts add to the cost of doing business. We know that our oncosts are too high as a percentage of our total wage costs in Australia-the OECD says so as well-but the greatest difficulty of it all is the paperwork requirement on people who are busy trying to produce products or .supply services. It is that regulation, the paperwork requirement, the bureaucracy behind it all, that is absolutely stifling new innovation and imagination leading forth into new products and new services for the marketplace. The awards are already too detailed. On 21 April last year the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his now famous speech to the Institute of Company Directors, did promise to the country that we would simplify awards, that we would take all the details out of awards and bring them down to represent a set of minima for any particular award situation. I applauded that sentiment. It sounded great, but that is not what we wound up with. We have wound up with awards still containing all the restrictions, all the details of how people work, when they work, where they work and all the conditions of employment, instead of being simplified minima around which employers and employees then sit down at a table and negotiate how they are going to work together every day out in the shop. That is really what it is all about at the end of the day. It is all about trying divest ourselves of the age-old class distinction, class warfare differential between employers and employees. (Time expired)",24
20,Mr SLIPPER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"The fact that the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No.2) has been introduced into the House of Representatives at all proves beyond all doubt the incompetence of the Minister f.or Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and the government over the handling of industrial relations. Like many other honourable members, I spoke in this place when the 1993 bill was first debated. At that time. I said: The Industrial Relations Refonn Bill 1993 would surely be one of the most disappointing pieces of legislation ever to be brought before the Commonwealth parliament. It was a much heralded item of legislation designed to refonn a system which was much in need of repair. Unfortunately, despite much huffing and puffing by the Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the government and the ACTU, the industrial legislation before the parliament at present is woefully inadequate. If ever there was any doubt as to the inadequacy of that legislation, it is proven by the fact that on this morning in June 1994 we are debating this bill. The bill in 1993 had very little to commend it. It was moving in the wrong direction; not the right direction. Even this government must be embarrassed by the constant changes and backflips it has been forced to make in the area of industrial relations because of pressure from the community, business, unions and, most recently, the government's own backbench. One of the items contained in this bill is intended to allow three years for the transition from junior wage rates to wage rates based on competence by delaying implementation of provisions· proscribing payment by age. The opposition is not opposed to the principle of payment on the basis· of competence rather than age. I hark back to my days in law practice when we would often look for staff. We would put advertisements in the newspaper and, in times of high unemployment, sometimes receive up to 50 applications from people wanting jobs. Some of those people had newly left school and some had been out to finally of work for one or two years. The great tragedy was that the longer a person was out of work, the less employable that person became. Those people who had been out of work for one or two years or had never been able to find work were more expensive to employ. On the one hand, they were less employable because they had been away from the discipline of school or the employment market for a considerable period; on the other hand, because they were older, the employment ""and wages system 'deemed them to be worth more to the employer. Clearly, the situation worked against those people who had been unable to get work and in· many respects condemned people to a very long time on the job scrap heap. That is why I am in favour of payment on the basis of experience and competency. I support that principle verystrong]y, because it will give those kids who have left schoo] and who have been unable to find a job immediately a chance. I do, however, understand that this bill makes alterations by giving the government a litt]e more time. As mentioned by previous opposition speakers, we are not opposing this proposition in the bill. One ought to note, however, that payment by competency, while a very good thing, shou]dbesubjected to a number of caveats. First]y, the transition from one method to the other should not be used to hike the junior young wage rate minima, which would price even more young people out of the labour market; secondly, procedures for determining competency standards should be both realistic and' practical; and, thirdly, criteria used to determine competency standards should not preclude experience. I think they are common sense matters which I hope the government will adopt. It would be tragic if the move to payment for competency were used as an excuse for making it even more difficult for employers to put young people into a job. The tragedy of unemployment at the moment in this coun-ry is monumental. One million people are out of work, and a couple of million people are unable to find adequate work. It is very important that the government focuses its endeavours towards finding rea], long-term jobs for people, not just temporary mickey mouse jobs or training scheme jobs that have .no long-term prospects- Unfortunately, the government seems to be too keen too often to rQrt the unemployment figuresby m-)Ving people froilJ ,-ne training scheme to another. . 1I have had a lot of. complaints .from residents in Caboo]ture and residents on .the Sunshine Coast who say that they have been out of work for a number of years. In some cases, they have attended up to five or six training schemes and they have various certificates, proving they are competent in a number of spheres of activity, but they have been trained for jobs that do not exist. That was the tragedy of the government's white paper on emp]oyment-really it was a white paper on unemployment-because it did nothing to solve the problem.",29
21,Mr COBB,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,It was a whitewash.,30
22,Mr SLIPPER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"It was a whitewash. I do not even know whether the government had a whiteboard. The other matter is that the government is reducing the' amounts of compensation that would have to be paid to those people deemed to be unfairly dismissed. I think it was a tragedy that the government brought in these unfair dismissal provisions in the Industria] Re]ations Reform Bill. The provisions that were there were more than adequate. On the one hand, they guaranteed an employee certain rights; on the other hand, they left the employer the right to run his own business as he wished, .within reasonable limits, and to hire and fire. While the minister has' been forced to do a backflip in this area, the major problem facing small businesses is that the compensation limits which are being introduced through these amendments will not be an incentive for those small businesses to employ people. I have asked a question on notice of the Minister for Industria] Re]ations. The question asks: (1) Did he state that Australian business groups were Scaremongering about the unfair dismissal provisions in recently implemented industrial relations legislation and were worrying small business. (2) Has he proposed changes to the unfair dismissal provisions. which will result in business proprietors paying salary for 6 months to unfairly dismissed award workers and $30,000 to non-award workers earning less than $60,000 per annum; if so, how will the changes address the concerns of small·· business proprietors. Clearly, we know the . answer to part of that question, because the legislation before the House makes changes to the amounts of compensation payable to people deemed to be unfairly dismissed. Around the electorate of Fisher and in the rest of Australia there are a lot of small businesses. Even after the minister announced his backflip on compensation, J have been contacted by many of my constituents. They ask me, 'How on earth can we, who are earning almost nothing from our small business, afford to pay the kinds of compensation that the minister is saying should be paid?' And that applies even to the reduced amount of compensation included.in the amendments. They say that it is simply not worthwhile employing people. In many small businesses the employees are taking home more than the employers. How on earth can those small businesses afford the kind of compensation suggested by the government? My view is that the amendments being made by the government through this legislation will not assist to create jobs. One ought to remember that a very high percentage of jobs in Australia are provided by the small business sector. A couple of days ago the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans)-it was repeated yesterday in the matter of public importance by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl)pointed out that almost no government members have any experience in small business. I think it was stated that perhaps one government member had some experience in small business. This means, of course, that the government does not understand the problems of small business. I think that is a tragedy, only for the government but also for the nation. . So we find the minister coming in here yet again to make changes to the legislation before the House-legislation that was put through the House last year. At the time we said that the legislation was no good and very strongly opposed it for very many reasons. We said. that the legislation was unworkable, regressive and that it would cost jobs, not create them. The result is that we areheing proven right. The legislation that went through the parliamentlast year is now being changed; it is being chipped away bit by bit. The minister should, as the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), suggested yesterday during question time, come in here and admit that his legislation is a failure. This legislation will build the unemployment lists in this country from a million people out of work to even more. After 11· long years in office this governrtlent still has. no answers to the unemployment problem. It has become worse. Instead of over the 11 years gaining the experience to bring in legislation which will create jobs and employment opportunities, we find that the government is moving in the wrong direction. The other matter I wish to mention is the international treaties, protocols and agreements entered into by the government. The !LO conventions are included in that group. This government runs around the country claiming that it is the champion of Australian independence while at the same time it and its predecessors, have signed almost 2,000 treaties which subvert our national sovereignty and independence. I think it is pathetic that the Minister for Industrial Relations comes into this parliament and uses as the basis of his industrial relations legislation the argument that Australia needs to conform with its international treaty obligations. Mr Johns-The opposition leader thought it was a good idea.",30
23,Mr SLIPPER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Yesterday, in a speech at the National Press Club, the opposition leader opposed very strongly the government's subversion of Australia's national sovereignty. not He referred to our economic sovereignty, which is being given away through the enormous debt levels that this government is building up. He also refel)""ed to how our political sovereignty is being subverted through the signing of these treaties which somehow override Australian domestic law. The· Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) is wrong. . The opposition leader has highlighted the sham of the goveJ:lUllent's so-called republican push. The opposition leader has reaffinned strongly that, as an opposition, as a coalition and as a Liberal Party, we stand for Australian institutions and continuing Australian independence. Over the next 18 months prior to the next election we intend to expose those in the government as subverters of Australia's independence, as people who are undennining what we stand for and as people who are not really true AustraliansI think it is wrong. that the minister comes into this parliament and says that we have to enact certain provisions in our legislation to confonn with ILO conventions. The ILO consists of many representatives from countries which do not share our notion of democracy, yet the government says that as a nation we ought to put ourselves in bondage to these overseas bodies. The executive, without reference to the parliament or the Australian people, has chosen to sign away our national sovereignty. We in the Liberal Party are totally opposed to this idea and in the run-up to the next election we will expose the government for what it is-a fraud and a sham. We are not, however, opposing this bill. The provisions in this bill are not ideal, but they do improve the disastrous situation which resulted from the passing of the Industrial Relations Refonn Bill last year. We will not be opposing the bill because it makes a slight improveJ]1ent. The government, as the shadow minister suggested yesterday, ought to tear up the Industrial Relations Refonn Act. The act has been in force only for a very short time. It is being found wanting in an ever increasing number of areas. The minister is being forced by the community, business and,his own backbench into making constant changes. Obviously, the 'legislation is fundamentally flawed. The legislation now before the House will improve things slightly, but it is only one small step in' the right direction.",31
24,Mr COBB,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Since the last'election the area of industrial relations Australia has been nothing less than a complete shemozzle. Last year,. the. Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) introduced one of the most stupid, bills this parliament has ever seen. Appropriately, it took effect on April Fools' Day. It has done little more than burden employers, who in many cases want to employ people, with red tape, higher costs and utiIiecessary legalism. There are ,many employers in the community that want to put people on but are· too worried to do so. Members of opposition keep saying these sorts of things, but they seem to go straight over the government members' heads. I do not think they understand at all what we are talking about.",32
25,Mr SLIPPER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,They don't want to.,32
26,Mr COBB,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"That is true. Surely, if they had their office doors open in their electorates, they would have people filing in, as we do, complaining about these laws. To a large extent, the minister has refused to change the legislation. He has at last made some changes. He has done backflip after backflip so that even I cannot keep up with the changes, amendments and the brawling in caucus over what the government should finally decide on. Every time the minister makes a change he promises that this will be the last one. The minister is not here today. If ever there were a bill that the minister should be here for, it would be this one. I say to the minister that the government is going to have to change the legislation again. If the government were sensible, it would scrap the whole bill. The minister has been so inept and so incompetent since he has had this job that if he were not a. member of the infamous New South Wales Right, quite frankly, I do not think he would hold the office that he does.",32
27,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,He is a member of the Labor royal family.,32
28,Mr COBB,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"A member of the royal family, yes. He seems to have no feel for his portfolio. He shows no common sense and no experience of actually ever having been in the work force. It is beyond belief that in this country we have in excess of 900,000 people unemployed, we have at least another half a in million people who are hidden from the unemployment lists on training schemes and what have you, we are approaching the figure of 350,000 long-tenn unemployed; and the minister has done. nothing more than' bring legislation into the parliament that increases the inflexibility, increases the costs and increases the impediments to actually employing people. He has an absolute callous disregard,for the unemployed. His twisted ideology has overruled all common sense and compassionfor the unemployed. I think· everyone would agree that the Industrial Relations Act is far too complex and far too lengthy. I have the act in my hand now and it consists of almost 450 pages. At the back of the act there are sections from the ILO conventions, upon which half the acts seem to be based these days. I defy any businessman in this country to read this act or understand it. In fact, I defy any government member to explain the act in simple language. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says that the 'agreement procedures in the act are almost unreadable'. This is the view of the peak body of employers. It cannot understand the act. It says that the act is far too complex. It is more complex than the legislation applying in other countries that it has to trade and compete with. The award system as described in the act is so comprehensive that it is nothing more or less than a barrier to the spread of enterprise agreements which the government is reluctantly saying we should be welcoming. The rules and regulations surrounding all aspects of awards are so cumbersome and far reaching that they are nothing more or less than a disincentive to move to something better. Under the federal award, with private employment, only about six per cent of employees are operating under some sort of formal enterprise agreement. I do not think the Australian public or the government realises just how slow the spread has been to enterprise agreements that all common sense Australians believe we should be moving towards. We have still got a long way to go. My understanding is that so far there have been only four applications for enterprise flexibility agreements and of the four only one has been successful-IOF Modular Offices Pty Ltd in Canberra, a small furniture manufacturer that employs about 20 people. The case was a. classic d-monstrationof why other companies and employers are too frightened to go into these enterprise flexibililoadings ty agreements. The company had a nonunionised work force. The workers arid the employers were very happy about that arrangement but, because the trade unioIl.had to be called in because the company had applied for a flexibility agreement, there is now partial unionisation of that work force. Nobody is particularly happy with it, apart from the trade unions, and it has just about frightened off every other company in Australia from applying. The trade unions in this case were completely uncooperative. That has been the only 'success' yet in this country with enterprise flexibility agreements. To think that enterprise agreements have been available to companies and their workers for as long as they have and only one company in Australia has enteredMr Braithwaite-It speaks for itself.",32
29,Mr COBB,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"It does speak for itself. The white paper the government brought down the other day says that the government is aiming for 80 per cent of employees under federal awards to be in direct bargains by 1996. We have a long way to go yet. I for one will not be surprised if we do not come within a bull's roar of the 80 per cent. So far, only six per cent of those in the private sector have en"", tered into these agreements. As far as the award system goes, I think most employers would agree that there should be no more than the core minimum standards on which to base enterprise agreements. But the award system has virtually become the upper standard for most agreements entered into in Australia. The minister has had to make several changes to the unfair dismissals provisions. When the unfair dismissals provisions came in with the original legislation earlier this year. nothing could demonstrate betterr the government's total lack of experience and understanding of business in this country. I do not know· whether any government members are in business these days and have first-hand experience of having to employ people; find the wage cheques at. the end of the week, pay workers compensation, 171/2 and all the other things that employers have to do. We· had a pig farmer in the shape of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He not only did not bring home the . bacon; he sold the piggery. We had a sandwich shop operator,· and I believe that operation has been nothing more but an embarrassment. Mr Braithwaite-They just haven't got the real experience, have they?",33
30,Mr COBB,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"They just do not have the real experience at all. In the few short weeks the legislation has been in place we have 700 unfair dismissal claims before the courts. There are some massive claims against employers for unfair dismissals of up to $1.9 miHion. It is absolutely ridiculous and mindboggling. Because of this, the minister has finally had to come back before the parliament with some improvements in the legislation, inadequate as they are. To shift things like the onus of proof for an unfair dismissal totally onto the employer. was ridiculous. Employer bodies tried to go to the minister, rang his office; wrote to him, but none of was acknowledged, so arrogant was he. He is now starting to reap the reward of his refusal to consult with the wider Australian people. There are so many little idiosyncrasies. Take the national building and construction industry award 1990. Under the building awards those in the building industry were employed on an indefinite basis subject to one day's notice. Extra benefits were built into their remuneration which compensated for that. But the minister brought in this act and said that these people must now have four weeks notice before dismissal, while retaining all those extra benefits. That is how stupid was. It has almost crippled the ability of employers to put extra people on in the building industry. The peak employer organisaHons explained this to the government time anp. again but the minister totally ignored them. He refused even to listen. It is a sad situation indeed. . The unfair dismissals are based on an ILO convention, section 158. Australia has been a signatory to this convention since 26 February last year, which means that Australia signed it during the election campaign. No doubt the government did not tell the Australian people about it. In its usual deceptive way it said nothing about it at all. . Mr Braithwaite-Not with the unionS paying their contributions to the government's funds. MrCOBB-Exactly. The unions put hundreds of thousands of dollars into the government's election campaign and expected to get their quid pro quo. They are reaping the benefit today. The sad thing is that it is since the Australian populace, particularly the unemployed, who have to suffer. It is terribly sad for Australia. Most !LO conventions are signed by over 100 countries. But guess how many countries' signatures are on this convention? Certainly much fewer than 100. In fact; there are only about 18 or 20. Of those 18 or 20 countries, apart from Australia, there is only one country that one could say had some real stature in the world, and that is France. I will read out those countries who have signed this convention. The list is in alphabetical order. Australthis is is at the top of it. There is Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cameroon-for heaven's sakeCyprus, Ethiopia, Finland, France,Gabon, Malawi, Morocco, Niger, Slovenia and Spain. Spain signed this convention and has only recently weakened the provisions because it found they were totally unworkable. There is Sweden, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen, Yugoslavia, Zaire and Zambia. What company we are in! It is unbelievable. I do not see the signatures there of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, Canada, Belgium, Denmark and those sorts of countries. They it understand how business works. Australia is lumped in with countries like Cameroon, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Yemen, Zaire and Zambia. I challenge. the government to name one other country that has signed this list and that adheres to the unfair dismissals procedures in the manner iIi which they are listed in the back of Australia's Industrial Relations Act. I do not believe the government could name one country. It claims that Australia, because it has signed this convention, has to adhere to these agreements. In that case, why is the government not back in Geneva protesting to the ILO that countries like Zaire, Zambia and Yemen, et cetera are .not adhering to their agreements? Everybody knows that the whole thing is a. farce. We have the Prime Minister over in France now tugging his forelock to struggling republicsand denigrating the Australian flag and the Australian constitution overseas yet again. I think last year he was doing it over in Indonesia. Now he is doing it in France. He is subverting the Australian constitution and overriding the states by using the devious method of signing international conventions such as this ILO convention so that he can bash employers over the head back in Australia. What the Prime Minister is doing is just not working. It is dragging this country down. The government will have to put forward much better legislation than this if it wants to do something about the unemployment problem. It is quite obvious that the government has no interest whatsoever in the unemployment problem. Why would it? It has created the problem. It seems to me that the government is interested only in maintaining the strength, power and position, not only of itself but also the trade union movement in this country. It sickens me every day to see the way in which the trade unions impede people from getting jobs. I have a copy of a letter from the New South Wales branch of the Municipal Employees' Union. It is making it much more difficult for unemployed people to partake in the jobskills program. In case any government members doubt me, I will read this letter into the record. It is written to a group of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It reads: Dear Sir/Madam, Due to the overwhelming costs involved with administering the lobskills program, the Municipal Employees' Union as of the 1 March 1994, will be charging a fee of $75.00 per participant. There is' no reason whatsoever for the trade unions in this country to have their beaks in the administration of this program. This program should be administered by DEET. If shires want to train unemployed people so that they can get 'jobs and acquire some workplace skills, why does the government allow the trade unions of this country to look over the shoulders of the shire councils? On top of this, the union has 'the hide to say that it wiIlcharge $75 per participant for the administration of this program which it ;should have nothing to do with. Valuable taxpayers' money is being used up by the trade unions. The shires are' willing to administer the program for nothing, but the trade unions are coming in, with the consent of the federal ministers, and charging $75. I think it is an absolute scandal. The shires have written to the government, but the government is refusing to do anything about it. I have the directives of the union. For heaven's sake, it has even laid out the criteria for union approval before these unemployed people can even partake in the' jobskills program. The directives note that the union will not sign participation plan forms in council departments until they have been gone through with a fine toothed comb and until the union has laid down its laws. The union has 16 different stipulations which are required to be fulfilled before a person can partake in this program. The government should be ashamed of itself for allowing what the shire councils have protested against to go on. It should do something about this. The government is nothing less than beholden to the trade union movement in this country. It is detrimental to the unemployed people in this country. It is detrimental to the Australian economy. Instead of tugging the forelock and signing international agreements, the government should realise that the decisions on how this country should be run should be made here in Australia by properly elected people-'-not non-elected people overseas from countries such as Uganda, Yemen, Zaire and Zambia.",34
31,Mr TUCKEY,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"It is not surprising to see that the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) is in charge of the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No.2) today. We are told that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has a virus. He is probably just suffering from vertigo, after having done so many, backflips and circles. If he has a virus, I am sure the virus will want to vacate the premises from its own natural giddiness. We are again looking at this legislation which, put simply, should never have been here in the first place. I point out to the' House that this ever:'increasing abuse-not use-of . the external affairs power is ridiculous and demeaning. Thegoverriment' is attempting· to establish the right of> the Commonwealth' to legislate in areas which are not covered by our constitution or our founding fathers. It is no good denigrating the decisions made by our founding fathers. The Australian people continually refuse to change them. I remind the House that, when we pass legislation in this place and send it off to the courts, we call upon the courts to take note of the intention of parliament when it becomes law. If there is some question about the wording, we ask the courts to take note of the intention of parliament. We should-and this is one point the High Court should look at very closely-look at the constitutional debates to establish the intention of the legislators who wrote our constitution here in Australia, notwithstanding the fact that it was then passed by the British parliament. Those legislators were very intelligent and very well skilled in politics. They understood the needs of a country the size of Australia. They recognised, as had been proved around the world, that it was wrong and silly to centralise too much power in one place. Federations are not unique to the Australian constitution. It is interesting to note that the Americans created a federation simply to ensure that there would be no concentration of power at the top as that would create opportunities for a - totalitarian regime. The German republic came about as a result of its experience with a totalitarian regime. The founding fathers understood all that. When they came to the subject of industrial relations, their original position was that the Commonwealth should have no role at all. But here we are today debating what would be an intrusion at the very highest level. The constitution notes that the role of the Commonwealth should be to conciliate and arbitrate, not to write laws as to how one person in one little isolated business might be dismissed. I think that power was given only very grudgingly when they identified, possibly due to. the shearers' dispute, that there could be issues that crossed state borders; for instance, in the case of the Murray River. The legislators never anticipated-and they would have gravel rash in their graves if they knew about this-that we would be discussing these . matters today. Through this process of abusing the external affairs power, the government is discovering more and more that it is becoming the victim of its own perfidy. The simple fact is that it is starting to get caught. It is getting caught, in the first instance, due to the complexity required in sidestepping the fundamentals of the constitution. The size of this legislation was drawn to our attention earlier today; it is nearly one-inch thick. But, more importantly, the government is generally being caught due to the process of signing about 2,000 conventions of one sort or another with other people around the world. When grave concerns were announced about the application of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child by people in this parliament, the AttomeyGeneral (Mr Lavarch) told us, as can be found in the Hansard, that we have obviously nothing to worry about and that these conventions have no meaning until we introduce enabling legislation in this parliament. Yet the other day Paddy MCGuiness, the noted journalist, informed us of a case where a convicted drug importer could not be deported from Australia, although he was not a citizen, simply because the magistrate or the judge ruled that it would be in contravention of the Commonwealth's commitment to the rights of the child convention. The fellow had a couple of kids in Australia and the judge's view was that they would be disadvantaged. The government was caught on its own hook. It has been caught in this process because-as has been admitted by the assistant minister in this place-its newly created industrial court will need about another 10 magistrates, judges or whatever they will be just to handle the applications for unfair dismissal. We have heard from the minister statements like, 'It was only the scare tactics of a couple of lawyers' - he was talking about the ones who said to the employers, 'You're going to have to be very careful about this.' The assistant minister suggested that one even said, 'If you've got anybody to get rid of, get rid ·of them before the law comes in because it is going to be almost impossible to do so afterwards. ' But they are not the lawyers who have caused the problem. This group of lawyers are interestingly definable-Labor members in this House· are connected with some of these firms; I do not know what it is about Labor lawyers but they always seem to be the frontrunners on advertising their wares terms of compensation claims and things this nature. The abuse of compensation claims by entrepreneurial lawyers, as I like call-them, became so bad that Premier Neville Wran, notwithstanding the significant links with the Labor Party, had to change the legislation in New South Wales to stop blatant abuse of that system. That was beginning of it. In Western Australia the Court government has just had to take that action and the Law Society there' was crying tears of blood. Western Australia was the last repository millionaire lawyers, or so we thought, and course they - hinged and moaned. One legal firm that advertised regularly on television had a team of four partners and 100 clerks. . charged out the clerks at $100 an hour to work on every claim made for compensation. Most of these claims, of course, were settled by the insurance companies simply because they could not afford or were not prepared expend the money on more court cases. It a racket. Of course, every state premier, commencing with Labor premiers, had to it. Just at that time when the Labor lawyers were crying tears of blood, this parliament delivered their salvation-unfair dismissal. doubt honourable members have seen the on television by these entrepreneurial lawyers about compensation. The as say, 'Have had an accident at work or in your motor car? Have you been dismissed from your work? You might be entitled to a claim. Come see me. Your first interview will be free.' bet there are some of those as in the now. If that is not the case, where have these 700 claims come from? The as will be in can because it was a very silly decision that this government made. It opened the floodson's gates when people like Neville Wran had had the sense to stop them in another area once before. We wonder why the government comes scurrying in here; it is not paying lip-service to the employers. It can see the whole system collapsing under the weight of thousands of legal actions. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), in said, quite correctly, that nobody who is of dismissed from his employment thinks the dismissal is fair. They all believe they have to a right. Most of these people under this legislation were going to win in cases which involved smaller enterprises simply because, just as the insurance companies discovered, it is cheaper to pay. The cost of their day in the court these days is unbelievably expensive and small businessmen have neither the time nor the resources to do it. Because the bill is correcting the problem slightly, we are not going to oppose it. But for just how silly is the government by opening of the floodgates in that fashion? How silly can it get in terms of its pursuit of power? It takes away from state governments rights that are It properly theirs under our constitution-those rights are put there for the right and proper reasons-and suddenly we get the courts leading the way and telling the government its obligations in areas where it has never legisto lated before. This government thought at the was time that it was a good idea to sign some convention and get a warm inner glow. Why fix does a democracy that is as democratic as Australia need to run off and bind itself by these forms of conventions? Why is it necessary? How silly is the government when it allows the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to say No we have to remove the yoke of the British as Crown and to sell us out on hundreds of occasions to the United Nations? How' silly you can it get? Why would it do so? As I said, the parliament is now superseded and time. and again by the courts. We, having I signed these conventions, are being told what can we cannot do. They are in the negative. I would just like to draw the House's attention the to a case where a single mother in my own electorate wanted to go into her 13-year-old bedroom, a known delinquent in constant contact with the welfare authorities. She wanted to go in and inspect her son's school case because she thought he had drugs. The , son told her, 'You're not allowed in here,' She asked, 'Since when? Who told you that?' He replied, 'My welfare officer.' The decision by the court the other day that the Australian government cannot deport a convicted drug dealer because it will contravene the Convention on the Rights of the Child seems to give a great deal of substance to kids' rights and claims. It is not what we can do; it is what we cannot do. The government has made a mockery of this parliament. It has made a mockery of itself and has made its court inoperable. The government now wants to fix this in the hope it can get out of this mess. I want to address the premise in this legislation that we are amending today that somehow or other employers, large or small, hate their workers and that they get up every morning thinking, 'Whom can I sack today?' That is arrant stupidity. I think it was the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) the other day who was whingeing and moaning in the debate on this question. He said, 'You've never been sacked, have you?' I yelled back at him, 'Have you been sacked?' He said, 'Many times.' I then said, 'Well, if that's the case, then you mustn't be much good.' The simple fact of life is, as an employer of some 40 people, including about six or seven apprentices-and I have work experience people on my premises today trying to give them a hand; and honourable members should not think that there is any profit in that it breaks my heart to sack somebody. You agonise over it. If you have a good person, it breaks your heart to hear that person say he is leaving. I, wish I could say to some of them, 'Listen, mate, I have put five or six years into getting you to the standard you,are now at. You now want' to leave for a better job, I am glad for, you. But what about a bit of redundancy pay for me, your employer? I don't want to lose you.' It is silly; it is wrong. Cunningham, B. T. It is insulting to small business people to suggest that we,' need a, law of this nature, because it' presumes they' have this desire to sack people.' In,fact half the time 'they are desperate to employ people. The honourable member for Lyons went on today about the wonderful aspects of this legislation in terms of changing from a youth wage and age related process to one of qualification. But he forgets that is just another roadblock to employment. If the job does not require the skill or the qualification, why should the employer have to pay the price? If you have a fitter, as I think the honourable member for Lyons said, who goes away in his spare time and gets a degree as an engineer, but you want only a fitter, why do you have to pay him an engineer's wage? Of course, you cannot pay that wage, so you have to dismiss him. That is, of course, an extreme example. But in the businesses with which I am associated I see people collie in and tell their boss ,that they have just got a diploma of something or other and that according to these awards the employer has to pay them an extra couple of dollars an hour. The boss says, 'Yes, but there are a hundred people out there who have not got that qualification that can do the job I want done just as well.'",35

Repeal of section and substitution of new section ""4D. Section 170EE of the Principal Act is repealed and the following section is substituted: Remedies the Court may grant '170EE. (l) In respect of a contravention of a provision of this Division (other than section 170DB or 170DD) constituted by the termination of employment of an employee, the Court may make the following orders: (a) an order requiring the employer to reinstate the employee by: (i) reappointing the employee to the position in which the employee was employed immediately before the termination; or (ii) appointing the employee to another position on terms and conditions no less favourable than those on which the employee was employed immediately before the termination; and (b) if the Court makes an order under paragraph (a): (i) any order that it thinks necessary to maintain the continuity of the employee's employment; and (ii) an order requiring the employer to pay to the employee the remuneration lost by employee because of the termination.

There has been considerable debate on these matters, most of which concerned the clauses in. the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No.2). I note that the opposition is not opposing the clauses, which are in two main categories. The first is to do with junior wage rates. We are simply returning to the original provisions of the bill. This bill was amended with respect to age discrimination by a vote in the Senate, essentially due to a position put by the Australian Democrats. We understood at the time that that might cause some real strife, and it has, to the extent that we need a transition period where people can move from junior wage rates or age based rates to a competency based system. We made a plea at the time that there should be sufficient time for employers and employees to get used to a competency based system. We are now, with these amendments, returning to our original proposition, .that is, there should be a three year opportunity to allow for a proper transition to competency based rates. From my recall of the various contributions to the debate, I do not think that anyone took any exception to that, nor made any great comment about it. The second element is to do with the whole concept of unfair dismissals and how they will be picked up and treated under the amended act. I would like to pick up on a number of comments made by variouscontributors. The essence here is that the Commonwealth wanted to ensure that there were some minimum provisions-if you like, a safety net set of provisions-to allow those who could not get access to a remedy in the state tribunals or a federal tribunal to be able to come to our new court and have an unfair dismissal case heard. What occurred in practice was that the court thought that it would test the proposition case by case in each state. We moved from. a position of believing we were giving a minimum right to those who were previously not covered to a position where people could prefer to use· our system because it would by a award damages in an uncapped way. So we of had allowed a system whereby people would jump from a state tribunal into our court, and that had clogged the system. We readily acknowledge that. We now want to unclog the system. We are unclogging it in a way that allows those who have an application before our court to be heard. Hopefully, if it works out in that manner, those people should be reinstated, which is always the best positio-. But if they cannot be reinstated and they are to be awarded some form of damages, the new cap which we are now introducing will apply to those people as well as to those hereinafter. Hereinafter, from the date of assent, non-award workers with wages of more than $60,000 will not get access to our system at all. Our system was always meant to be for those who had no other remedy, those who were at the lower end, those who were in greatest danger of being subject to unfair dismissal. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) talked about small business being worried about our proposals for unfair dismissal and the amount of payout. He should be aware that the compensation system in the Queensland industrial relations arena is more generous than ours. These systems already apply but only to state award covered employees. We are not introducing new rules but rules that will cover people who were not otherwise covered. That is the whole purpose of this. We are not creating a whole new world but rather plugging a gap for those people who did not previously have a remedy. In plugging the gap, we inadvertently let new players jump into the system, and that was unsatisfactory. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill.",39
34,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"We are not going to vote against the amendments to the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) as the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) apprehended. I want to make a couple of comments about what has happened to bring about these amendments. I am referring here to the changes being proposed to the unfair dismissal provisions of the act which came into force only on 30 March this year-a little over two months ago. It really is a remarkable admission that the minister just made. I do not think. I unjustly paraphrase the minister in saying that he 'We set up this new system which came into effect in March because we really wanted to encourage people to take advantage of the more generous regime, and then we discovered that too many people were taking advantage of it.' He said it was uncapped. He cannot be. more generous than that. It was found that a lot of people took advantage of it and then, because too many people took advantage of it, the government decided that it had to do something about it. All of that has happened in the space of eight weeks. That is a remarkable indictment of incompetence. It must have been obvious to the minister at the table. It was obvious to Mr Justice Wilcox. I saw him interviewed on ABC television just after he had been appointed. He made it very clear in his comments that he expected the new court to be inundated with claims for unfair dismissal. I just cannot understand the reasoning behind a government that would go into something like this, knowing full well that it would invite a flood of appIlcations, and then, weeks later, turn head-over-heels and alter It really is a very incompetent way of running industrial relations. I think what really happened is that the government's ACTU mates wanted a completely unlimited system. The government agreed to that. It did not really take the employers very seriously at the time. Then the government discovered, after it had been brought in, that very high income earners, in middle management in many cases, were going to take advantage of it. The ACTU said, 'WelI, we're not very worried about them,' and there were a lot of complaints from the business community. So the government finally decided to go back to it. However the government now tries to explain away this. backfiip, .the fact is that, using ordinary principles of common sense, it should have known it would be inundated. Another point I would raise, which I do not think has come up so· far in public comment-it certainly has not come up during this debate-is that built into these amendments is a clear preference for people covered by awards. As I understand it, the $60,000 said, limit applies only if one is a non-award employee. That being the case, it means that many people whose. salaries are over $60,000 and who .are covered by awards will get the benefit of these new unfair dismissal provisions. I suspect that there would be quite a number, not large in proportion, in the public sector, particularly in the federal Public Service-but not only the federa' Public Service; .I do not want to pick on it: in fact, I am not picking on any public servants; I am just talking to the principle of it-whose salaries are over $60,000. But if people are not covered by an award, they do not. What is the justification for that? I do not understand it. Whether or not people are covered by an award, surely their rights in relation to unfair dismissal should be the same, unless of course the government believes that somebody covered by an award is more equal than somebody not covered by an award, using OrWellian language with which the minister at the table ought to be familiar, given the eight Orwellian character of some of the Public it. Service legislation he has spawned over the last few weeks. He is the author of those ridiculous workplace guidelines; he defended them in the Canberra Times a few weeks ago. Why the difference? I would be fascinated to· hear from the minister why he is favouring people covered by awards. What is so special about them? Are they better Australians than Australians not covered by awards, or is this just another manifestation of the preference that the government has in the system for awards because awards are obviously more prevalent in the areas of the· economy that are more heavily unionised. I would be fascinated to hear in reply from the minister why he is showing such a marked preference.",42
35,Mr JOHNS,PAIRS,"petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (12.23 p.m.)-A couple of questions have been raised. As to whether we anticipated a large number of applications, we did. I guess it was their nature that worried people and the fact that a particular form of applicant would squeeze out those who had no other remedy. That became the real position-not that there would be a large number of applications, but that the nature of those applications would squeeze out those who not only had nowhere else to go but also were in very poor circumstances. The nature of a cap is not new, of course, . because it applies in many other jurisdictions. It is our view that the cap of $60,000 for nonaward employees is struck at a reasonable level, because there will be such a small number of award employees earning more than $60,000; that, in fact, there is an equivaveterans lence of treatment to the extent that there be very few award employees earning above $60,000. So that is the essence of the argument.",43
36,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,Do you have any advice on that?,44
37,Mr JOHNS,PAIRS,": There are figures from the ABS. The ABS says, I think, that 0.25 per cent of the work force would be award workers getting paid more than that. It is a tiny percentage, and a small number of people potentially will not get access to our system. So I think. we can regard any sort of debate about differential treatment as being unuseful and unhelP9",44

40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The dissent of the honourable member for Wills will be recorded. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Johns) read a third time. VETERANS' AFFAIRS (1994-95 BUDGET MEASURES) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 2 June. Second Reading,44
41,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"On behalf of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill presents amendments necessary to implement part of the budget package for the affairs portfolio. The minister will be will introducing at a later date a second bill for the remaining budget initiatives that require legislation. In addition to the changes to be included in the two bills, many of the important initiatives in this year's budget do not require legislation. The budget package for veterans affairs this year has been developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-service men and women, war widows and wiqowers and their dependants. The package responds to issues raised by the ex-service community and the report on compensation for veterans and war widows by the Veterans Compensation Review Committee, chaired by the Hon. Professor Peter Baume, in respect of the - geing of veterans of the world wars, and the different set of problems facing the younger veterans. The Baume committee review was undertaken in consultation with national representatives of the ex-service community to enable the government to address issues which had emerged concerning disability pension determinations, especially following recent High Court interpretations of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the fundamental issues raised in the independent report of the Auditor General in December 1992 on veterans compensation. As well as the manner in which age related diseases should be dealt with, these issues included the relaxed interpretation of the meaning of the 'reasonable hypothesis' test in that act as it related to the relevant medical connection between injury, disease and death and war service and the lack of consistency in decision making and the inappropriateness of laymen determining their complex questions of medical causation. Some of the recommendations of the Auditor-General would have resulted in a cessation of grants for smoking related illnesses and return to the civil standard of proof for deterto mining claims, thereby leading to an overall drastic reduction in the rate of successful claims. As is obvious from the package, not all of the recommendations have been adoptprovide ed, but the government was bound to address the fundamental issues raised by the Auditorwho General and to introduce sufficient ensure that the integrity and· fairness of the repatriation system is. maintained. While these issues have been the principal focus, it has also been possible to tackle long standing issues such as bringing Australveterans. Ian merchant marin-rs under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, providing a better service pension deal for widows, widowers and separated partners, and enabling war widows to receive both their compensatory and income support pensions from veterans affairs. In developing this package, extensive, constructive and valuable consultations were held by the minister and his predecessor, Senator Faulkner, with the ex-service comGuinea munity. These consultations are welcomed by both the government and the ex-service community and it is the minister's hope that we may continue to work together in the included future to provide the best possible care and recognition for our veterans and their dependtable ants. This budget package has received wide support from the ex-service community and I believe that this is in part due to the volvement that group has had in developing these initiatives. The budget initiatives have from the outset pensions. been a package. Indeed, senior representatives of national ex-service organisations agreed the total package in full knowledge of the importance of each of the changes, believing that the final result would benefit the veteran community at large. Before I go on to talk about the specific initiatives in the bill before us, I would just briefly like to take a few minutes to talk about some of the very importantbudget initiatives for veterans and dependants which do not require legislation. The budget includes an $8.9 million boost . to aged care over the next four years with the a thrust being to help veterans and war widows remain healthy and self-sufficient in their own homes and within their loeal communities for as long as possible. For example, emphasis will be placed on' carer education to training for carers of veterans and war widows who have come out of hospital and are at high risk of injury or further changes to hospitalisation. Of particular significance in the budget package is the $20.6 million which will be provided over the next four years to assist in some the serious concerns faced by many younger These younger veterans, as well as their families and carers, will benefit from initiatives such as funding for a more comprehensive program for treatment of posHralimatic stress disorder, more resources for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service and money for research into the health, social and vocational needs of younger veterans. Additionally, $13.2 million has been allocated for funding for the Australian War Memorial, for a memorial project at Kokoda in Papua New and for commemorative activities in 1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. I will now tum to the specific measures in this bill. Two of the initiatives in this bill are designed to ensure a more equiand consistent system of determining claims for disability pensions for veterans and their dependants. The changes will involve the inestablishment of a Repatriation Medical Authority and amendment of the eligibility criteria for special and intermediate rate The first of these two measures, namely, the to establishment of a Repatriation Medieal Authority with power to issue binding statements of principles based on sound medicalscientific evidence, is intended to overcome these problems. These statements of principles will be legislative instruments and will be subject to disallowance. This means that when these statements of principles are laid before the parliament they· are subject to public scrutiny and normal democratic processes operate to allow veterans, or veterans organisations, to raise objections with. all political parties. The bill will, in effect, define by reference to such statements of principles the concept of 'reasonable hypothesis', as it appears in subsection 120(3) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The result will be that a medical hypothesis linking particular kinds of injury, disease or death with war service that does not have a sound medical-scientific base will no longer be sufficient to constitute a 'reasonable hypothesis'. This will be a matter solely for the expert medical authority to determine. I stress that the opinion of a single medical expert may still· be sufficient to constitute a 'reasonable hypothesis', provided that such opinion has a sound medical-scientific base, as determined by the authority. These changes are consistent with the ruling of the High Court that the validity of the reasoning of all medical and scientific material must be examined. They are also consistent with the regret expressed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and others that such complex matters are left to be determined by laymen: In this regard it has become apparent that lay tribunals do not deal with medicalscientific issues consistently and, while nominally inquisitorial, appear to adopt an approach that is inappropriate for determining medical-scientific issues that call for detailed technical knowledge. The Repatriation Medical Authority will provide the appropriate forum for the resolution of technical medieal-scientific issues. This will ensure that there will be consistency on medical-scientific issues at all levels determining system. The authority will be an independent body consisting of five eminent medical specialists. The minister will be appointing the members of the authority after consultation with the ex-service community. The authority will prepare generic statements of principles based on sound medicalscientific evidence that will state what factors must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death and war service. Decisions will then be made in respect of individual claims to determine whether those factors exist in the circumstances of each particular case. However, it must be made clear that decisions on the facts of a case will not be a matter for the medical authority but will remain, as at present, with the Repatriation Commission. Importantly, they will continue to be subject to review by the Veterans' Review Board and th- AAT. The statements of principles themselves, which will provide the template within which individual claims will be determined, will be binding on the Repatriation Commission and review and appeal bodies. Once again, I stress that these statements of principles will be subject to testing by the parliament, giving all sections of the ex-service community ample opportunity to raise any concerns that they may have. I stress that the bill establishes a comprehensive system of review of the contents of statements of principles. Veterans, their dependants and organisations representing veterans or their dependants will be able to make submissions to the authority which will be considered in the process of formulating the statements of principles. They will also be able to request the authority to carry out investigations into the cause of any injury, disease or death, for the purpose of making a statement of principles, and to request a review of any of the statements of principles. Comprehensive provisions exist in the bill in relation to such matters, including provisions requiring the authority to give notice of any request for investigation and enabling access to information and documents considered by the authority in arriving at its determinations. Finally it has been agreed that a special of the mechanism should exist for dealing with particular classes of veterans, such as those that have been given special consideration in the past, in particular, prisoners of war and Vietnam veterans. Accordingly, provision exists for the Repatriation Commission, at its discretion, to issue overriding determinations having the same effect as statements of principle, granting entitlements to certain classes of veterans when it considers that an entitlement should exist for such classes in respect of certain types of injuries, disease or reviewed. death. Careful consideration will need to be given to the use of this power, which is not, of course, intended to be used as a general means of usurping the function of the Repatriation Medical Authority. Of course, this power can only be used to override statements of principles by making determinations which are more generous than the existing statements of principles. The power cannot be used to restrict, in any way, a statement of principles made by the authority. These changes maintain a beneficial repatriation system, including a 'reasonable hypothesis' standard, as modified as I have already outlined, for deciding compensation claims for death or disease relating to eligible war service. There has not been a return to a civil standard of proof, as recommended by the Baume committee, which would have had the potential to reduce the success rate of claims, which currently stands at above 70 per cent, to the pre-1977 rate of approximately 30 per cent. The government acknowledges the special status of veterans. It is hoped that these changes will be effective in overcoming the maverick and fringe claims that have interfered with the integrity of an extremely generous repatriation system, without having to return to a civil standard of proof for the determination of claims. The changes are intended to ensure that the credibility of the repatriation system is tained and that medical opinions supported by little or no medical-scientific evidence do not prevail over the carefully developed mass of medical-scientific opinion. It will not mean that only mainstream medical opinion would be regarded as reasonable, but it will require any alternative opinions to have a sound medical or scientific basis. The minister wants to assure all veterans that current entitlements will not be affected. The minister also gives his personal commitment that, if after 12 months the ex-service community can demonstrate that the new scheme for the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority and the issue of statements of principles has not achieved the objectives outlined here, the scheme will be The second initiative relates to changes to the eligibility criteria for special and intermediate rate pensions. The former being known in the past as the TPI, or totally and permanently incapacitated, pension. The criteria for these higher rates of disability pension were changed in 1985 when it became clear that the outmoded terminology of the old Repatriation. Act was enabling these pensions to be paid to veterans who had completed a full working life,after retiring on superannuation and other retirement benefits. This was never intended. The original intention of these ;higher levels of pension was to compensate those severely disabled veterans who could not work to support their families on their return from service. It was to be in only very rare cases that any veteran beyond the normal retirement age would be eligible for such rates of pension. Subject to certain exceptions and to protection of existing special and intermediate pensions, the changes being made by this bill reinforce that intention. They will mean that these pensions will not normally be granted to veterans who are over 65. An exception to this rule will apply if the veteran was engaged in remunerative work after the age of 65 and that work was in the same business or employment in which the veteran had been working for 10 continuous years. This would main- include, for example, many in the farming community. Let me assure honourable members that this measure applies only to veterans who, after 1 June 1994, claim special or intermediate rate pension-and I stress after they have turned 65. Existing special and intermediate rate pensions, whether granted before or after the age of 65, will not be affected by the change. Furthermore, such pensions granted to veterans before the age of 65 will continue to be paid after they tum 65. Let me now move to another measure in this bill which I am Sure will be welcomed and supported by all honourable members. Australian World War II merchant mariners are to be given the same rights and benefits as those available to Australian World War II veterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Currently the criteria relating to the provision of compensation benefits for Australian mariners are more stringent than under the Veterans' Entitlements.Act, particularly with regard to the connection required between employment and injury and also, in most cases, the standard of proof. For veterans who have rendered operational service, there need only be a reasonable hypothesis linking injury, disease or death to the veterans' war service, whereas an Australian mariner's injury or death must, as a general rule, be directly related, on the balance of probabilities, to enemy action. With this initiative, mariners and their dependants will now receive benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. A further initiative in this bill mean that existing service pensioners, as well as claimants for service pension, may be asked to take reasonable action to claim any overseas pension entitlements. While it is clear that a successful claim for overseas pension may result in a decreased rate of service pension being paid or, indeed, no service pension being paid at all, it should be remembered that if a person does receive the foreign pension then they will be better off financially than they are at present - even if the service pension ceases to be paid. This is the case because the application. of the service pension income test to the amount of the foreign pension received only reduces the rate of the service pension by 50c for every $1 of the overseas pension but only after the application of the generous free area of $152 per fortnight for a couple and $88 per fortnight for a single pensioner. The two remaining initiatives in this bill of particular significance to war widows and widowers and to widows, widowers and separated spouses of service pensioners. The first of these changes will affect those war widows and widowers who, in addition to their war widow or war widower pension, are currently also receiving an income support payment from the Department of Social Security. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will now pay a new payment, an income support supplement, to those widows and widowers in lieu of their current social security payment. The income support supplement will be paid at the same rate at which their social security payment would be paid. This change will enable war widows and war widowers to receive their income support payments as well as their compensation payments from the one department. Of course, if war widows or widowers currently getting income support payments from the Department of Social Security wish to continue to do so, they may elect to do this. The second of these changes relates to the payment of partner service pension. The change will allow for the payment of partner service pension to a person who is the widow, widower or separated spouse of an age or will invalidity veteran service pensioner to be made at the higher 'single' rate. Currently, such a person is only able to receive payment at the lower rate of service pension which normally applies to a person who is a member of a couple. As a result, most choose to transfer to the Department of Social Security to receive an income support payment at the higher rate. Importantly, former recipients of partner service pension who relinquished that pension in order to take up a social security pension at the higher rate will now have the opportunity to resume their partner service pension. In summary, I believe that the measures presented in this bill represent major initiatives which will help to ensure the fair and equitable delivery of repatriation benefits to veterans and their dependants. I was not the minister who had responsibility for the carriage of this bill through the are Expenditure Review Committee process; I was on the other end of the debate entirely. I have to congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and his predecessor, Senator Faulkner, on an exceptionally well-argued case in relation to the Expenditure Review Committee process and some objections from around the place, as one might expect. They have got through what I think is a tremendously advanced package for veterans in this country at this very late stage of consideration of veterans affairs. They have every reason to be very proud both of the legislation before the House and of the other matters that were mentioned in the course of the second reading speech. I commend the bill to the House.",44
42,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"O'Connor) (12.45 p.m.)The Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is, as described, an important measure in the interests of veterans. I thought that the minister who delivered the second reading speech, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), was a little bit generous to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) by suggesting that there were financial benefits to veterans. When we add up the pluses and minuses in the revenue for the government, we find that the proposed savings exceed the payments that would go to veterans. Nevertheless, in most cases they are not significant. This veterans affairs legislation should divided into two areas. One area should clarify, simplify or improve the entitlements for veterans' widows or widowers. Various improvements wer- referred to in the second reading speech. The measures relating to the special and intermediate pension rate are sensible and overcome an anomaly that has been identified. The opposition, whilst not opposing this measure, does raise the question of equity. has been pointed out that people in their own businesses or in the professions would probably be more able·to sustain the new criteria than people in employment who, for instance, had been retrenched at 63 and then got themselves involved in other employment which they could not sustain much after 65. I draw that to the minister's attention more than anything else. It is a small anomaly but it is a fact that some people will not be as well off under that particular provision as others. Put simply, as the second reading speech points out, the. government is expecting to save only approximately $0.9 million from this measure. The second reading speech also points out that the amendments were originally directed to persons of a much younger age whose war injuries or illnesses had put them in a position where they were unable to work, earn a living, and probably support their families. The initiative on Australian mariners is to be supported. There is little doubt in anybody's mind that people who served in the merchant marine fleet were as much at risk in a war as somebody leading a charge up a Normandy beach. In fact, their casualty rates were extremely high, particularly in submarine attacks and occurrences of that nature. Submarines were frequently more interested in the merchant ship and its cargo which was being delivered to assist troops on the ground than they were with the destroyers and the other pieces of military seafaring equipment that were involved. The government is wise to seek to gain foreign pensions for those pensioners who have rights to them. They gave service to a foreign country so that foreign country has an be obligation to them, and that payment reduces the cost here in Australia. As has been pointed out, the testing provisions do not necessarily take away the entire provision because the reduction for that type of income is generally only 50c in the dollar. The partner service pension is generous, yet proper. It is a situation where once people become single, through the unfortunate demise of their partner, they will be paid at the It single rate as set down in social security legislation. That single rate payment is necessary. The pension system recognises and everybody understands that, while two cannot live cheaper than one, an individual requires almost as much as a couple. Halving the payment on the demise of one partner is not fair. We support the government in its attempt to make the system more equitable. The income support supplement is, put in the simplest terms, an attempt to achieve a one-stop shop. That is sensible and to be congratulated. The minister in his response might like to answer a question that has been put to me concerning the circumstances that apply to many veterans' pensions. I would like to know with regard to asset and income testing how the transfer of benefits of people coming out of the social security system, which is the subject of quite detailed asset and income testing, to the VEA will be treated. It is not a matter of concern or a matter which would cause us to oppose, but there are some differences and I think the veterans community should know what those rules are and whether or not they are bringing over any of the social security requirements that do not apply to the veterans area if they seek that transfer. . They are the issues with which the opposition has no concern. We support them and we support the statements in the second reading speech that they are all worthwhile changes to the act and will generaIly not harm the interests of veterans and in some cases will beneficial. Nevertheless, the coalition has grave concern with the other aspect: The other aspect is a new section of this particular legislation, encapsulated in clause 11, which seeks to create the Repatriation Medical Authority, which I will forthwith refer to as the RMA. The clause also seeks to define the RMA's duties and purpose. It is its purpose that is of concern both to the coalition and the veterans community. The opposition opposes this measure in its totality and I the House's attention to the amendment to the legislation that I have circulated already and upon which we intend to divide. The creation of the RMA is the government's second response to the 1993 High Court judgment in the case of Bushell v. the Repatriation Commission. That in essence decided that, basicaIly, any form of medical evidence supporting the veteran applicant's case was sufficient to create reasonable doubt in the eyes of the Repatriation Commission. The current test, the standard of proof required is the reverse criminal standard; that is, based on a reasonable hypothesis. I have always had a bit of difficulty working out how there can be a reasonable hypothesis if the requirement is that it be beyond reasonable doubt; nevertheless, that is the way the legislation stands. ! Remembering that this is a case where the requirement is the reverse criminal standard, the High Court ruled that if there was any form of reasonable or sufficient evidence before the Repatriation Commission it was obligatory upon the commission to grant the veteran's claim.. That is a very generous position, but it is based on the law as written in this parliament. The veterans community, I might add, is gravely concerned and confused because shortly after the BusheIl case, the Prime Minister went· around Australia on another matter of great interest in the community saying, 'The High Court has spoken. We are bound by that decision. We can do nothing but take notice of it.' He elevated the High Court to a position that everybody knew it did not have. This attempt to create an RMA, as I have said, is the second attempt by the be government to overrule the High Court. The veterans community cannot understand that, and quite rightly so. Whilst the parliament does have power to change decisions of the High Court, the Prime Minister, when it suited him poIiticaIly, went out and created an entirely different position. The first attempt prior to the last election to rewrite the decision of the High Court into Bushell v. the Repatriation Commission was universaIly condemned. It was, in fact, evendraw tuaIly referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and simply never got out of there. It was in huge trouble with both Labor and Liberal members of the Senate and was still with the committee when the election was called. Therefore, of course, the legislation and the amendment lapsed. This is the second attempt. The RMA is defined in the explanatory memorandum in brief as foIlows: The Authority will be an independent body consisting of five eminent medical specialists. The members will be appointed by the Minister after consulthat is tation with the ex-service community. The Authority will prepare Statements of Principles based on sound medicalscientific evidence that will exclusivelyI underline the word 'exclusively'state what factors related to service must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death and service. Statements of Principles prepared by the Repatriation Medical Authority will be disallowable legislative instruments that will be - bindingI underline the word 'binding'on the Repatriation Commission, the Veterans' Review Board and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The first point that must be made after just reading those words is that once these principles are made binding on the Repatriation Commission, why bother to have a Veterans' Review Board or an· Administrative Appeals Tribunal? The same rides are binding upon them and it completely takes away from the veteran the opportunity for appeal on what are the fundamental issues in these cases. It takes most of the opportunity for the Repatriation Commission to differentiate between various cases. The issue is far too inflexible and harsh. In my view, all discretion available to the Repatriation Commission or the so-called tribunals of appeal are being removed by this process. The standard of proof, and particularly the judgment of the High Court, has created problems for the government. Fortunately, to date they have not resulted in the flood of claims that was anticipated. That resulted in a reference to a committee chaired by Professor Peter Baume AO. That committee produced an excellent report entitled A fair go: a report on compensation for veterans and war widows. In respect of the standard of proof, the Baume committee stated: The present standard of proof is unique to the veterans' jurisdiction. It is confusing and complex to apply, is subject to wide interpretation in the Courts, is excessivestandard ly generous and offers potential for exploitation through ""doctor shopping"". Interpretation of the Bushell case is that the ""reasonable hypothesis""test is fulfilled so long as the theory or opinion of one medical practitioner eminent in the. field supports a connection between the conqition and war' service. The standard of proof should be changed to one which is fair and generous, while consistent in its application and legally unambiguous. We recommend the standard of proof be based on a legally accepted ""civil standard"" with the provision that the benefit of doubtbe in favour of veterans with operational service. An independent, Expert Medical Committee should be established to resolve general medical issues and to formulate Statements of Principle for application to all decision making. . . I do not interpret the word 'application' to mean binding on all decision making. This is the fundamental area of coalition opposition. I think as time goes by we will find veteran opposition. When I say 'as time goes by', I mean that those complaints are starting to come in apace. What we are looking at now is a situation where the Baume report has been taken one bridge too far. I think most of those comments are sensible. I recognise that the government has a problem and that it has a responsibility .to address it in some way. However, let me say at this point that, whilst we will continue to oppose the measures and whilst we will attempt today-both in this House and in the Senate-to have them removed, as the spokesman on behalf of the opposition and the spokesman, to a degree, on behalf of veterans in this particular parliament, I·am prepared to try to negotiate an acceptable solution. I can see merit in having medical advice available to the tribunals, as did the Baume committee. Let me remind honourable members that one of the members of that committee was an eminent legal practitioner. However, I object entirely to the inflexibility of the proposal put to us today. I have dealt to a certain extent with the situation of the current reverse criminal standard and how that works today. IIi interpreting that, the High Court has been very generous. The Baume report had an entirely different idea about of proof. The civil standard would be . more rigorous. It would not be as generous to the veterans community as the present reverse standard of proof. The government now has really got two options. It either goes to the balance of probability test, which is the civil standard, with the Baume recommendation erring on the side of generosity in that standard, and with . some reference to medical advice, or it stays where it is. However, it certainly cannot go down the road that is intended. I mentioned that compIilints are coming in. The Hastings Legacy group in Port Macquarie has gone so far as to get a legal opinion. I will not quote the name of the legal practitioner because I have not got permission to do so, but the opinion is under the letterhead of a legal firm. However, I will read into the Hansard a couple of the remarks made by this legal practitioner. It appears that he was probably coming to these conclusions at about the same time as I, as a lay operative in the law, was also coming to them. So this legal practitioner and I are as one on this. He used some fairly telling words. In reference to clause 11, he said: I am not aware of any other legislation in Australia which seeks to block claims for illness or injury by apredetennined set of requirements as proposed by this legislation. It is not without some significance that in comparison with veterans the persons who administer the Veterans Entitlement Act, 1986, are in a far better position to seek compensation should they be injured or suffer employment related illness-see Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. 1988 (as amended). Such employees are not fettered by a predetennined list of compensable illnesses or injuries. They are able to call such medical evidence as they require to support their claim and they have a right of appeal. I point out that I believe that clause 11 effectively removes the right of appeal for veterans in terms of causation. The legal practitioner went on to say: Better, apparently, to suffer a disability sitting behind a desk in Canberra than on active military service. I would be pleased to give the Minister for Veterans' Affairs a copy of the full opinion because it may assist him in sensibly fesolving this matter. The legal practitioner went on to say: Until this Bill amends the Act, veterans have been entitled to call, in evidence, the very best specialists in various fields to support their case. This for the first time since 1920, and probably since 1916, prevents a veteran from having available to support his or her claim the best medical advice in Australia. From now on, a detennination of Statement of Principles will limit their claim and, as will be noted below, the persons who detennine the Statement of Principles will not necessarily be qualified to deal with many medical issues. That, of course, is totally obvious given that there will only be five of them and given the diversity of illnesses and disabilities that veterans could have suffered due to their war service. Of course, how else can you determine the circumstances of an individual? How can you write a set of principles and apply them to every individual in the country? I noted in the second reading speech, which I did not see prior to the commencement of this debate, that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) referred to the government proposing some process that I presume gives some discretion to the minister. I do not know when that was decided. I did not find it in the legislation, but I will stand corrected, because it just might be there. Obviously this particular laWyer did not find it either. The situation is not acceptable. We are talking about the rights of veterans. We are talking about a unique group in our society. We are talking about people who went to various wars and conflicts to defend democracy and to prevent the invasion of Australia, particularly in the Second World War. These people have put in something beyond the normal level of effort for Australia-most of us think of that as paying our taxes-and as a consequence they are entitled to special treatment. There were words in the second reading speech which reaffirmed the government's commitment. I can assure the House that we on the coalition benches view veterans· as special. We see it as the responsibility of the crown on all occasions to deal with them and to err on the side of generosity. We do not see it as appropriate to have legislation that cuts off the proper rights of appeal where claims can be assessed, firstly by the Repatriation Commission, then the Veterans Review Board and then the AdminBill, istrative Appeals Tribunal. They are all proper processes laid down by this parliament and available to veterans. We do not see why they should· have to come cap in hand to some final situation when two of their main areas of appeal have been cut off. What is more, we do not see why they have to go before a minister or, some special officer appointed by the department who will go straight to those statements of principle and write back, 'I'm sorry.' We recognise that the law is very generous since the last determination of the High Court. We think it probably could be amended but not in a fashion that makes veterans secondclass citizens in terms· of their entitlement to adjudication of their claims. That iswhat this bill does. It is very bad. Yet it was introduced with good intent. It has just gone, as I said, one bridge too far, and as such we cannot support it. There are other aspects when one talks about the rights of individuals. I have had reason to write to the minister on a matter brought to my attention by an individual who, during the war, contracted tuberculosis but who, some years after the war, was cured. Now, many years after the war, that person has emphysema and pleurisy but so far has not been granted a benefit. I presume when one goes to eminent medical specialists and they write their principles-because somebody has been consulted on this thing'-they are going to say, 'He was cured. These are problems brought about because he smoked or because he is old.' I say anybody who contracted tuberculosis through the war and who now has an affliction of the lungs, whatever else they happen to have done, is entitled to the generosity of the community and should get a full entitlement. It is a classic example of how, when you put two strands of barbed wire up and tell all the veterans they must walk through the same gap, difficulties will arise. I read the promise that the government will review it. This bill is wrong and it is unfair to veterans. There has to be a better solution involving a spirit of cooperation. I certainly hope that the minister, having received our offer to try to help, will accept the excision of clause 11 from his legislation. Let the rest go through. We will accommodate the government as quickly as possible. It is not as though they are all goodies; that are all going to provide money to the veterans. Some of them are going to provide the government with savings. Let us sit down in a bipartisan way and find a solution to the problems with Bushell. We are not prepared to argue. We say the veterans won in the courts and, if it were the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sitting opposite me, I would demand that he stand by his Mabo comments and say that the High Court has spoken; the veterans have a right. But we know that that is not the situation. We know. the government has a responsibility through legislation to try to tighten up this provision and, provided that it is done in a fair and reasonable way that guarantees the rights of individual-and I underline 'individual'veterans, we will support it. I would like to think it through. I would like to make suggestions. We are not here to block this legislation for blocking's sake. We are not doing a last election situation and trying to get the maximum political benefit. Might I add that I think we decided our position before we had received any representations from the RSL and before we met with others later in the week. This bill is not fair. The background to it is wrong. It ignores the Baume report, although it grabs hold of a substantial part of it. If the government wants to maintain the reverse criminal basis of proof-the beyond reasonable doubt standard of proof-as an obligation upon the Repatriation Commission, fine; that is very generous. But do not try to nullify it by bringing down statements of principles that really say there is no standard of proof. The government is stuck with the rules. It is a very bureaucratic and, as I said, a very inflexible approach. I give notice of the fact that we will seek to have my amendment voted upon before the guillotine falls on this debate. I think it is a grave pity that such an important area as veterans affairs comes under the guillotine. I note from the list of speakers that a number of people are anxious to make a contribution. I have used all my time, but I hope I have explained our position clearly. I will just say it again: the proposals for the they RMA, as defined, are there, and the requirement that the principles be binding on the commission and the two tribunals is totally unacceptable. It goes far past what I think Baume recommended. Of course, if the government defeats us in this House, I am under advice that the Australian Democrats will ask for a Friday committee on this matter. I think it will go further than that. I think there will be a. queue of witnesses. I have quoted the legal opinion that has come forward already, which supports my concerns that this is not the way to look after people in the veterans area. The faster we get this bill out of this place, the faster we can sit down and find a solution acceptable to everybody and the faster we will get better administra..; tion of this particular problem. I thank the House for giving me the time to represent these views on behalf of the veterans community. Veterans can rest assured, since I have been appointed to this role, that I will make a responsible and very committed effort to see that people whom I hold in the highest regard are protected from proposals of this nature.  p.m.)-Ijoin with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and say that every one of the members of this place and the other chamber holds' our veterans in the . highest regard. I think that every member in both places wants to do for them what is fair and responsible, and what is in accord with genuine representations. I think we all share that view. Whilst I welcome the support from the honourable member for O'Connor on behalf of the opposition for part of the package, I know that, given what he has just said, the honourable member would not be seeking to confuse members of the veteran community, and I know that he would not be seeking to contact organisations and create doubt and confusion about this legislation. I know that; he is an honourable man, and he has just made his position very clear. It would be disappointing if that were to be done, and if somebody were to be doing that, because it would create a great deal of what I believe to be unnecessary anxiety. Veterans of World War II, particularly, are at a stage of life where they do not want to be worried about matters that do not in the least concern them. It is essential that all of us in this place and the other and out there in the general community, and the veterans' representatives, deal with them frankly, honestly, fairly and responsibly. That is why I have a bit of difficulty with what the honourable member for O'Connor has just been saying. We need to' recall that this legislation is a package; and I hope that he, as the opposition spokesman, will be working with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) to ensure that it is treated as a package. When I looked back to the press statement of the national president of the RSL, Major General Digger James, following the 1994 budget, it said: Major-General James said the new Repatriation Medical Authority which is being set up to streamline the vexed question of the causal relationship between veteran's diseases and injuries and their war service was also welcome. 'This initiative has resulted from extensive consul'tation between the former Minister, Senator Faulkner, and the present minister, Mr Sciacca, and veterans,' Major-General James said. 'If it is successful, and we believe it will be, it will help solve a problem which has plagued repatriation since its inception, and since the'opening of the system to the courts in the late 1970s resulted in hugely expensive legal cases.' The national president is saying there that the package that is before us here today, including the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority, has been carefully considered, discussed and thought about. If I wanted' to accept the comments that have just been made on behalf of the opposition, then I would have to believe that Major General Digger James, his colleagues and all those people involved did not really understand what they were consulting about and that they did not really understand what the Repatriation Medical Authority was all about. I am afraid that I cannot come to that conclusion. I rest upon the words of the national president of the RSL, and on, I believe, the good faith of Minister Sciacca and Minister Faulkner of this government, and their sense of fairness in looking to put together a package that is going to benefit others in other areas. Just to reCap part of it: the statements of principles prepared by the Repatriation Medical Authority will be disallowable legislative instruments that will be binding on the Repatriation Commission, the Veterans Review Board and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So there is some recourse there to a method of checking, verifying and testing the decisions they may have come to. The second reading speech states: These changes are intended to ensure . . . that medical opinions supported by little or no medicalscientific evidence do not prevail over the carefully developed mass of medical-scientific opinion. It will not mean that only mainstream medical opinion would be regarded as reasonable, but it would require any alternative opinions to have a sound medical or scientific basis. I do not think they are words that anybody in this place could disagree with, and I am certain that the leadership of the RSL would not want to disagree with those words and the objective as stated. We have limited time to participate in this debate, and I want to move quickly to say something about the provisions for the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 and the access being given to wartime merchant mariners to the same entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 that veterans currently receive. In this legislation before us we are righting a wrong that has sat there for half a century. I want to formally congratulate a former minister, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), who set up the MCGirr inquiry that began this process; another former minister, Senator John Faulkner, who took this process through the Expenditure Review Committee; and the minister sitting at the table, the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who then picked up that decision, has given his total support to it and now has the responsibility of administering it. There has also been Bob Nelson of Mount Hutton; the 13,500 people out there in the general community who signed the petition we presented to this parliament on 18 November last; and my colleagues on this side of the House and the other side of the House who have joined in a bipartisan approach to bring this legislation before us. I commend all of those people and I am proud to see this legislation here before us, righting that wrong of half a century. I think it is an appropriate time to quickly recall some of the sacrifices that were made by our 1merchant mariners in time of war. About 14,000 of them served in World War II. The numbers of casualties are unknown, how many served under other flags is unknown, where many of them rest on the ocean bed today is unknown, but we do know that off the Australian coast 54 merchant ships were attacked and 38 of those vessels were sunk. The first vessel, the Nimbin, sank in November 1940. It hit a German mine off Port Stephens and sank off Norah Head, in my electorate, later that same day. By June 1942 there was an intense Japanese submarine presence and the Japanese submarines I21 and 124 operated in the waters off Sydney and Newcastle. These submarines targeted ships plying to and from the port of Newcastle. On Wednesday, 3 June 1942 at 9.00 p.m. 124 was cruising some 30 miles east of Sydney. It attacked the steamer Age 35 miles south-east of Norah Head en route from Melbourne to Newcastle. 124 fired a torpedo but the torpedo went wide. It tried several rounds, but none hit. David Jenkins wrote in Battle Surface: Most of the crew on the Coastal steamer were below, playing cards, when the attack began. They heard a noise like a door slamming then heard the warning call that their ship was under attack. Rushing to their stations, they saw a submarine in the moonlight about 300 metres to starboard. The vessel raced for Newcastle and escaped further damage. An hour and a half later I24 attacked the Iron Chieftain some 27 miles east of Sydney. Twelve of her crew were lost when the vessel was sunk. The Iron Chieftain was heading south from Newcastle to WhyalIa. The submarine had been sighted by the skipper and he ordered the vessel hard to starboard, but the instruction came too late. David Jenkins also wrote in Battle Surface: The Iron Chieftain shuddered and heele4. as if about to tum over. Doomed by her heavy load of coke she sank in about five minutes with the loss of twelve of her company including the captain. We have in my electorate one of the survivors of that vessel, Don Burshell of Belmont. He and 24 other survivors were brought ashore just south of The Entrance, south of my electorate. The next day the Iron Crown was sunk by torpedo attack from submarine 127. It was en route from Whyalla to Newcastle. It sank in less than a minute. There was no time to lower the boats and only five of the crew of 42 survived. In the war at sea, merchant ships were often more at risk than naval ships. Merchant ships were slower, ineffectively armed, if armed at all, and singled out for attack by' the enemy. They were easy targets, as' were their crews I say what I have said in this chamber before, that in war, in uniform or out of uniform, all mariners are mortal. They suffer the same, they bleed the same, they die the same and those who survive age the same. That is why I am so pleased that we have this legislation before us, because, in righting that wrong of some 50 years, we will be ensuring that merchant mariners who survive today will now get the same entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act as veterans have. That means that the efforts of, merchant mariners are now being recognised nationany. I conclude by mentioning that on 17 June, that is tomorrow week, at 10.30 a.m., on the foreshore of Newcastle harbour between the Customs House and the Brewery Restaurant, we will be dedicating and unveiling a regional memorial to an merchant mariners who were lost in time of, war. It recognises all those merchant mariners from the Hunter regionfrom your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, from my electorate and from the surrounding electorates. There were many thousands from our electorates because, as a major maritime centre, the Hunter has long been a source of the crewing of ships, designing and building of ships and the repairing of ships. The memorial that we will be unveiling and dedicating tomorrow week recognises that contribution in times of crisis. The sacrifices made by merchant mariners and their families from the Hunter, from the central coast, from Sydney-from an over New South Wales. The memorial will feature a plaque from BHP commemorating the loss of 12 crew members from the Iron Chieftain and the 36 crew members from the Iron Knight. It is a dignified and appropriate memorial. I welcome everyone who is interested in merchant mariners and their families and the sacrifices they made in time of war to join us at the ceremony at 10.30 a.m. on 17 June in Newcastle. I am very pleased to see before the House this legislation that provides for surviving merchant mariners, and I commend the minister for the support that he ha& given to the legislation.",49
43,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS," I observe that unfortunately this debate again is to be curtailed by the government, and I want to make that point at every opportunity. The Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill is an important piece of legislation for veterans but it is being guillotined by the government in this place today. I think that is shameful. As the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has already observed, there are a' number of us on this side of the House who wanted to speak in this debate. I am fortunate to have been high on the speaker's list and I have been given the opportunity to speak. But there are others on this side of the House, and perhaps even on the government side""who are interested in veterans affairs and who are being prevented from exercising their democratic right to speak in this place today on behalf of the veterans in their electorates. It is deplorable that. the government should choose to curtail debate on this legislation. I assure the honourable member for Short inflame the community of veterans on this or any other matter. Our concerns, that have been wen expressed by the honourable member for O'Connor, are in no way scaremongering. In fact, I observe that the veterans community is very good at taking care of itself. The peak organisations that represent veterans have done so extremely efficiently for many years and I am sure will continue to do so. The honourable member for Shortland talked about early comments made and he mentioned - ajor General James in particular. There were early comments of support for some of these so-caned initiatives that the government is putting forward, but they were just early comments and, veterans were not aware then of the fine print. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) can laugh and shake his head, but the purpose of this legislation is as it says. It is to actually implement the budget decisions and it is here that we get the fine print some weeks later. Believe me, with this government people have to be aware of the fine print. People need always to be looking for the fine print, because this government has particular expertise in saying one thing and doing another, and its treatment of the veterans community has often been along those lines. Worse still, this government has a habit of bringing forward legislation which combines good with bad. This is yet another glaring example of legislation which attempts to combine elements which will make it very difficult for the opposition to be successful in opposing the things with which it does not agree. In my view, this is another little piece of trick legislation. We applaud, as the honourable member for O'Connor said, many of the budget initiatives, particularly the one that the honourable member for Shortland mentioned specifically-the recognition, at long .last, of World War IT merchant mariners. I am happy to give credit where credit is due to the honourable member for Shortland. He is one member in this place who, along with others, has consistently pressed for this initiative. I am very pleased that it has come and that recognition has been given. But let us not obfuscate the net effect of this legislation. One only has to do an analysis of the financial impact· of this bill to realise that overall and projected savings far outweigh the costs of the implementation of this legislation. Let us be quite clear that the net effect of this legislation is to save the government money. It is no good for government members-ministers or others-to stand up and tell us that there are net benefits in all of because the opposite is true. One only has to get a calculator and do a bit of quick maths to analyse the financial implications and impact of this. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), if he has got a calculator there, might like to correct my arithmetic when he gets the opportunity. But I can tell him that the savings to the government from this legislation far outweigh any generosity towards the veterans community that he might want to trumpet. Mr Deputy Speaker, I need to say at the outset-and make the point very clear-that when we talk about veterans entitlements we are not talking about welfare. These entitlements are not that. They are earned; they are compensation. In no sense are the benefits that we are talking about this morning welfare. Most Australians, I believe, understand and accept this. Most Australians are fair. But, in this particular piece of legislation, I do not believe that the government is being entirely fair. I need to make the point that no other job is as risky as service in the forces, particularly in time of war. In this place, in recent days, we have recognised that many have given their lives in the service of this country in times of war, and many suffer· the effects of their war service for the rest of their lives. Hardly a. day or week goes by in most member's offices when we do not confront a returned serviceman or servicewom-n who continues to suffer-40 or 50 years after the event-from what was encountered in war service. I agree with the member for O'Connor very strongly when he says that this bill should have been presented in two parts. Much of it is favourable in its effects on veterans and,of course, we support that. But the Bushell decision of the High Court, which this legislation attempts to address, was favourable for veterans. I want to hear the minister argue why the government is rushing in for the second time-as the member for O'Connor made clear-to try to overturn that particular decision. There was a sense of urgency when the Bushell decision came down from the High this, Court, created by misinformation from the department to the effect that this was somehow going to result in a flood of applications and millions of dollars cost to the Australian taxpayer. But that has not happened. The Baume committee's report, A fair go, has been referred to in this particular debate.. A fair go is what we really are talking about, but not getting. The Baume committee makes the point that 'we do not accept OVA's first stance of the floodgates opening with the advent of the Bushell case, and the floodgates have not opened'. The analysis which the department has provided-some of it is reflected in A fair go-shows that there have been, in fact, very few cases that would not have been successful but for Bushell, if you can make such an analysis. As I said, this is the government's second attempt-the first time it rushed in here almost the day after the High Court decision; it wanted to change that decision-to override that decision, which was favourable to veterans. I need to keep making that point, because it really does form the basis of our objection to the particular proposal in this legislation. The Bushell decision was favourable to veterans, but not unreasonably favourable. I do not believe it was unreasonably favourable. We are talking about the reasoning of the majority of the High Court-the highest court and the most eminent jurisdiction in the land. The High Court made the decision that a claim should succeed so long as a medical practitioner, eminent in the relevant field of knowledge, is of the opinion that there is a reasonable theory which connects the condition with war service. I stress the word 'eminent'. We are talking-as the honourable member for O'Connor has said-about a reasonable theory which connects the particular condition with war service. The government wants to change that. The government wants to make it harder for veterans to get what they are entitled to. Mr Thckey-They want to make it impossible.",56
44,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"Almost make it impossible-and we object to that. I am proud to stand here on this side of the House to differgovernment entiate very clearly between the opposition's and the government's position in respect of this legislation. I hope that the minister may, even at this eleventh hour, change his mind, or that he will face the defeat of this provision in the Senate because, as the honourable member for O'Connor said, the Australian Democrats have, to their credit, already expressed some doubts about it. I am sure that, because they are in tune with the veterans community in certain respects, they will very soon become aware of the extent of concern as, as .I said before, the veterans really get down to the fine print, the bottom line, of what the govetnment actually proposes. Mr Hollis-Your scare tactics.",58
45,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"These are not scare tactics; these are the facts .. The honourable member for Throsby can follow me in this debate, and I am quite prepared for him to tackle every point that I have made, point by point-and he will not get very far. The High Court decision on Bushell was favourable to veterans on the basis that it will cost the taxpayers money. The government's reactions to that, as I said earlier on, was an overreaction. But how much is it now estimating that it is going to cost the taxpayers? In fact, very little indeed. If we look at the projections that the government has made for the savings-4et us tum this upside down-that. it will effect by creating this new medical authority, the savings are not great: a few million dollars up to about $11 million, I recall, once we get to about 1997-98. So we are not talking about a lot of money here; we are talking about a very small cost. And the government is today attempting to take that money away from veterans. That is money that veterans may well be entitled to as a result of the High Court decision in the Bushell case. The government is attempting to take what I add up to be, over the next four or five years, maybe $20 million-$20 million that these veterans would otherwise be entitled to. As the honourable member for O'Connor said-and I think he made the point poignantly-this is strangely inconsistent with the response to Mabo. The government response to Mabo was favourable to Aboriginals. Rather than attempting to circumscribe the effects, the government rushed into extend it. The day after Mabo came down in the High Court the government did not say that it was going to cost billions of dollars; we had better do something about it. It came in and did the opposite. The Native Title Act actually extends the High Court decision in Mabo, and the cost to the Australian taxpayer of that is going to be billions of dollars. We have already seen some estimates of how much that is going to cost the taxpayer. I do not want to make the point too acutely, but there is, on behalf of this government, one treatment for Aboriginals and another treatment for veterans. Mr Bevis-Is that the best you can do?",58
46,Mr BRADFORD,PAIRS,"The best is yet to come. The honourable member for O'Connor made the point that we are talking about a totally different treatment of a High Court decision. the Bushell case benefited veterans. The government rushes in here the day after and says it wants to stop it. The Mabo decision did the same things for Aboriginals, but the government did not try to stop it; it extended it. I think that that point is well made. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) can take on board that the point is well made. The opposition has· concerns-and they have been expressed in detail by the honourable member for O'Connor-about the government's intention to create this new medical authority. The government claims that the initiatives in respect of this particular authority are designed to ensure a more equitable and consistent treatment of claims for disability pensions for veterans and their dependants. That is just not so. That is wrong. In fact, this will have the opposite effect almost. Consistent it may be, but we are arguing that the downside is that the very consistency that the creation of this authority leads to is a concern because one cannot, in a sense, be entirely consistent when talking about claims made by veterans for war caused illnesses or disabilities. Each case is unique. War service injuries cannot be put into the context of the medical science that exists for injuries that might come about as the result of falling off a bike or some such thing; Each case is different. Nor is the treatment, as the government suggests, in any way equitable. The honourable member for Shortland mentioned the process of consultation with the veterans community, .but once again the government has been consistent on this score. The consultation has been inadequate. Very .little time has been given for the veterans organisations to react to this. I do know whether that is on purpose. It might well be that the government thinks that if it gives the veterans 24 hours to have some input into a· complex piece of legislation, something entirely new, either they will not react or they will react in the way the government wants them to. However, I dispute that the consultation has been adequate. The medical authority that is proposed will become a de facto decision maker on all matters of causation. It will actually outrank the High Court of Australia in that respect. This is taking away a fundamental right and a fundamental part of the whole Australian judicial system. As was pointed out before, the establishment of this particular authority will mean that even the High Court will be bound by the decisions of this particular so called Repatriation Medical Authority. Appeals to the Repatriation Medical Authority will be in the context of a statement of principles, the so-called statement of principles that are being spelt out, and not on the facts or merits of individual cases concerning veterans. As I have said, that is a most objectionable element of the establishment of this particular tribunal. No consideration will be given to the case of the individual, and that is neither equitable nor fair. The Repatriation Medical Authority will be legislator, judge and jury. It will be a de facto determining authority and it will be the de facto determining system. Any appeals beyond it will focus on medical science or some such thing rather than on the circumstances of the veterans' service, which has always been fundamental to determinations in these matters. Despite what the government says, I even doubt its claim that the Repatriation Medical Authority will be independent, because its staffing will come from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and in that sense it is not and cannot be entirely independent. . The government claims that this new system is generous to veterans. I have demonstrated that that is patently untrue- It is a lie to suggest in this place that this particular proposal benefits veterans. If one looks at the not financial impact, the government Claims that the savings will result in savings through to 1997-98 of $11 million in that year and so on back to now. So, in that sense, it is a lie to suggest that it is generous to veterans. I will finish a little early, and hopefully will give some of my colleagues an opportunity to speak. We are talking about savings as a result of the creation of this particular Repatriation Medical Authority, savings of money which would otherwise go to veterans. This is entirely objectionable. That is why I am pleased that the honourable member for O'Connor has indicated that we will move an amendment on which we will divide in this House. The people of Australia, and particularly the veterans of Australia, can make a judgment on this issue as to who is really interested in the rights, benefits and entitlements of Australian veterans.",59
47,Mr HOLLIS,PAIRS,"I am pleased to speak on the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Leg-slation Amendment Bill, which deals with a number of amendments to the Veterans' Entitlement Act. I am also pleased to follow my travelling companion through India, Bangladesh and Nepal, the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford). I felt that he could have been a little more generous in his comments. He finished his speech two minutes early to give his colleagues some more time. Some time, two minutes! I am also particularly pleased, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, that you are the occupant of the chair for this debate, because I know the high regard in which you are held by the veterans community in your electorate because of your stirling work and the support you have always given to the veterans community. ' Those opposite come in here with the flag wrapped around them, but those who have really looked after the veterans in this country have been Labor Party governments. We have heard one Vietnam veteran speak and I think we are about to hear another, but who was it who really took on the issue and gave the Vietnam. veterans the recognition which was long overdue? It was the Labor government. I find it a bit strange when those opposite come in here and suggest that those on this side have not always shown a concern for the veterans. I must say that the measures in this legislation in regard to veterans have been well that received in the federal electorate of Throsby. Despite the scare stories and campaigns that went on prior to the budget-and indeed the stories that have been circulating since the budget-the veterans in the Throsby electorate have received these budget measures well. I must say the transfer of the war widows and widowers support pension from the Department of Social S-urity to the Department of Veterans' Affairs is a measure that many in the veterans community have campaigned for, and I am pleased that this has been achieved. Many speakers on ,both sides have highlighted various aspects in this budget in relation to the veterans community. There is one aspect that I particularly want to highlight,and that is the recognition of the merchant mariners. I am delighted that Australian World War II merchant mariners are to be given the same rights and benefits as are ava,ilable to Australian World War II veterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. In this regard one must pay tribute to my friend and colleague the honourable member  campaigned unstintingly on this matter over the last few years. When he introduced his private member's motion on 28 May 1992 and again on 18 November 1993, I was honoured on both occasions to be asked to second the motion. Let me also make the point that this motion always enjoyed bipartisan support. Indeed, the members on both sides who spoke-the honourable member for Shortland, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and I-were the same people who spoke on both motions. From memory, I think the honourable member for Cowan(Mr Richard Evans) also spoke on the last private member's motion. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are well aware, Australia is a maritime nation. It always has been and probably always will be. We depend on shipping for our exports and imports. Too often the seafarers who crew the ships to and from Australia are overlooked, and at no time was that more evident than in a time of conflict. Successive governments, of both political persuasions, failed to grant Australian wartime merchant mariners the same entitlethe ments that were available to veterans of the defence forces, but now I am pleased to this has been remedied. Indeed, this matter should have been remedied years ago. I must say that this governmerchant ment has a good record on correcting past mistakes. Therefore, why were we so reluctant to grant to these people who were prepared give their lives in the defence of this counmariners try-and many of them did give their livesdesigned the entitlements that were their just due? Eligibility for payment of disability and widows pensions under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act was based on death or incapacity suffered by Australian mariners as a direct result of a war injury sustained in the course of their employment during World War H or· an injury caused by detention by the enemy during that employenemy ment. Compensation' under the Veterans' Entitlements Act requires a less stringent causal connection. The distinction between 'veterans' and 'Australian mariners' compensation purposes has long been source of public debate and disquiet amongst the merchant mariner community, and it has been highlighted by two recent inquiries. In 1989 the inquiry into the needs of tralian mariners and .Commonwealth Allied veterans and Allied mariners, chaired by the then Deputy President of the Repatriyears. ation Commission, Jocelyn MCGirr, held of extensive consultation with interest groups and reached this conclusion: As far as practicable, World War II Australian merchant mariners should be given the same rights and benefits as veterans of the Australian Defence Forces under the Veterans Entitlements Act. A similar recommendation was made earlier this year in A fair go, the sation for veterans and war widows by the Baume committee. The changes"" will give said, Australian mariners easier and wider access to the disability payments and related benefits available under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Eligible mariners will now be able to claim for the long-term effects of their service, as cardiac and respiratory diseases. Such claims have had little chance of success under Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act. Claims from Australian mariners will be say able to be accepted under the Veterans' Entitlements Act from 1 July 1994. The wartime experiences of Australian mariners were comparable to the experiences of veterans of the Australian defence forces. Indeed, in some cases they to were in more danger. Australian merchant went to sea in ships that were not for warfare, that had little or no armour plating. Many of the smaller ships war were unarmed. A large merchant ship may have had a crew of around 100; a navy ship of comparable size would have in excess of 500, including medical staff and facilities. The merchant seamen were constantly exposed""to sudden attack by submarines, surface raiders and aircraft, with the added risk of mines laid in the coastal waters. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, the Australian coastline, especially in the areas . that we represent-the south and north coasts for of New South Wales-was littered with a wrecks. These ships were sunk in my own area at Jervis Bay, off the north coast and all around the Australian coastline. Of the 73 ships attacked in Australian waters during AusWorld War H, 54 were merchant ships and 38 and of them went to the bottom. Many Australians served most of the war on the dangerous Atlantic run on ships various nationalities. These mariners were in particular danger. Enemy raiders were often given specific orders to avoid warships and instead to concentrate their attacks on the carriers of grain, petroleum, munitions and equipment, to try to cripple the Allied war effort. Overall, there were about 14,000 Australian merchant mariners engaged in report on corilpen- World War H. Over the past few years much has been not least in this House, about Australian shipping. We have seen seagoing union membership restructured, crew numbers decrease, concepts such as multiskilling introduced and a career path for seamen established. Australian ships today are crewed such by well trained, dedicated personnel. Yet, until this budget measure, there remained a black mark which only the government could eradicate, and that was the failure of successive governments to grant the Australian wartime merchant mariners their just en-itle­ ment. In conclusion, I·want to pay a particular tribute to the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). As with the honourable member for Shortland, this has been of particular interest to me for a number years. I remember saying to one minister on my side of parliament that there were not many merchant mariners left and suggesting that surely it would not be a great drain on the government's purse to rectify this. He said to me; 'Colin, you know I am supportive of that and I support what you are doing. It is when we get to the Expenditure Review Committee. that it is knocked out.' He said that in all genuineness. Within weeks of taking over this portfolio, the minister had this through. It is to his credit; it is to the credit of this government. The minister deserves the thanks of those merchant mariners who were prepared to give their lives. I commend the minister, as I commend the government, and I commend this bill to the House.",60
48,Mr ATKINSON,PAIRS,"I accept the words of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) that this should be a bipartisan debate, but he did get in with a bit of a dig early in the piece by saying that it was a Labor government that looked after Vietnam veterans. I would have to dispute that. As a Vietnam veteran it riles me to hear some of those comments, quite frankly. It also concerned me that, on the first visit to Vietnam by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on what he called a trade mission, he did not acknowledge those who actually sacrificed their lives in Vietnam. However, I am happy to get back to a bipartisan debate of the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill because veterans should be looked at in a bipartisan way. I acknowledge that this amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements . . Act provides many long overdue benefits to the .merchant mariners, the young war widows and service pension widows, and I commend the efforts of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) to this extent. But it removes from veterans the right of every Australian to a judicial .appeal in a compensation matter for disabilities received in service. This legislation creates a problem for veterans in the area of the standard of proof necessary to establish that more recently acquired medical disabilities of veterans were caused by their wartime experience. The . Baume report of March of this year, commissioned by the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, recommended that the standard of proof be based on the legally accepted civil standard, with the provision that the benefit of doubt be in favour of the veterans with operational experience. It went on to say that an independent expert medical committee should be established to resolve general medical issues and to formulate statements of principle for application to all decision making. The fact is that the government has taken this one step further and decided to make this expert panel the decision makers, with no means of redress for the veterans-the panel will be the sole arbiters. of war caused disabilities, and the only review under this legislation is from the same decision makers. In 1975 Justice Toose set down a set of basic principles which underpin the Australian repatriation system and, whilst. no specific decision was made by. the government of the day-or successive governments for that matter-the general thrust of these principles has been followed. These general principles were: firstly, the nation is especially indebted to those who have voluntarily given service to it in time of war by enlisting in the armed forces, thereby endangering their lives and health and probably suffering economic loss; secondly, the nation recognises that it has a similar commitment to those whom it compulsoryenlisted in war service; and, thirdly, the nation has a duty to ensure that those who have thus served, together with their dependants, are properly cared for to the extent that they should never have to beg or rely upon charity. I think that these are very appropriate principles that we on both sides of this House should stand by. One of the areas that concern me with this particular piece of legislation is that the group of medical experts is going to make the final decision on compensation for ex-service people. From the honourable member for  comments about this package, as he described it. I thought he used some very interesting words when he said that the legislation 'comes to you as a package'. He meant that the government is not prepared to adjust the areas where compensation is provided for veterans. I have a great deal of concern about that. I support the comments of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in his indication of an intention to move an amendment on this, because I believe it is important that we recognise the efforts that have been put into this country by veterans. It is a system that we must stand by if we are to expect people to serve the country in the way that they have. It really concerns me that members of the government are taking the line that they are not prepared to take this particular aspect into consideration. The honourable member for Shortland also talked about the consultation that has taken place. The facts are that a very small group of senior people in the RSL were sworn to secrecy about discussing this with the government and that there was no general consultation. The members of the RSL in the broader community have not had the opportunity to contribute to the discussion on this piece of legislation. I suspect that once they see the legislation and look at its intricate detail they will have as many problems with it as have people on this side of the House. We are not talking about welfare; we are talking about the provision of entitlements for people who have served this country well over the years. I ask the minister, who I know generally has the interests of the veterans of this country at heart, to look closely at what we are trying· to do to· ensure that. those veterans who have entitlements are in fact looked after.",62
49,Mr LES SCOTT,PAIRS,"The House is today debating the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill. When I was speaking in this place earlier in the week, I made reference to the appropriateness of the time that we are actually speaking about veterans. I said on that occasion that the consideration of veterans affairs aspects of the budget is timely, given the commemoration of the part played by veterans of many countries in the D-day landings. I think we all have been very much inspired by what we have seen via the media and television over recent days about the Dday landings and the importance that they had as the turning point in the Second World War. It is because of the sacrifice and dedication of all the people who were involved in that war-and in all wars-that we enjoy the lifestyle we have today. It is always important, when we speak in this place on bills relating to veterans affairs, that we acknowledge the contribution of many veterans over many years. It is certainly always a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to rise in this place to support bills such as the one before us. The initiatives contained in the budget have been developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-service men and women, war widows and widowers and their dependants. The package responds to the issues raised by the Baume committee and other groups with respect to the problems of the older veterans of the world wars, and the specific problems of younger veterans of more recent conflicts. I make particular reference there, of course, to Vietnam. I was particularly pleased about the new programs designed to provide assistance specifically to Vietnam veterans. The $20.6 million, four-year package directed at the serious problems faced by Vietnam veterans is a welcome initiative. The cornerstone of this package is the assistance it will provide to the sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder, known as PTSD. Anyone who has had dealings with sufferers of this condition knows how demoralising it can be for both the sufferer and his or her family. I am sure members on both sides of the House have dealings with Vietnam veterans from time to time, and they see the problems that they face. lreally welcome the initiative. Veterans, families and carers will benefit from the package, which includes funding for the PTSD treatment centres, more resources for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, and money for research into the specific health problems and needs of younger veterans. This package will no doubt bring about an' improvement in the quality of life of younger veterans by stressing better health and employment opportunities and improving access to treatment, counselling, rehabilitation and support services. Another significant research project that will be funded by the initiatives in the budget is the Vietnam veterans mortality study, which it is hoped will be able to establish the major causes of early death and the nature of the links between PTSD and veterans' death rates. Other major projects include the establishment of a national centre for war related PTSD to develop best. practice standards in the management of social, psychological and medical problems associated with PTSD; improved coordination of in-patient, outpatient and support services so that veterans with PTSD can be assessed, treated and rehabilitated; and expansion of the Department of Veterans' Affairs joint venture scheme to encourage self-help projects by the ex-service community to address social and personal problems experienced by younger veterans and their families. All of these measures, in conjunction with the dedication of the Vietnam war memorial and the welcome home parade held a few years ago, indicate that the status of Vietnam veterans is changing for the better. This recognition, whilst overdue, is most welcome. Equally important to the field of veterans affairs are the war widows, people who are often forgotten in some ways. They should never be forgotten, because of the trauma that they have certainly suffered, both in assisting the veterans and in being widows themselves. New pension initiatives in the budget will make life easier and less stressful for these people, and I believe that is important. Firstly, war widows and widowers will be able to go directly to the Department of yeterans' Affairs for payment of their pension tnstead of going to Social Security. At the moment, widows and widowers receive their compensation payments from Veterans' Affairs but need to also go to Social Security for an income support pension. One of the initiatives in the Veterans' Affairs budget is the new income support supplement, which will be paid at the same rate as the current social security' pension and can be claimed at Veterans' Affairs. Recipients will save time and money by not having to deal with both Veterans' Affairs and Social Security. It was pleasing to hear the endorsement of the budget allocations for veterans from the national president of the RSL, Major General Digger James, last month. I think it is fair to say that the RSL has not always seen eye to eye with Labor governments in the past. Perhaps that is an indication of the high regard it has the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). As I am sure the minister would acknowledge,' his predecessor, Senator Faulkner, also had a lot to do with the preparation of this budget and was also held in high regard in the veterans community; The significance of Major General James's comments cannot be underestimated, under those circumstances. To refresh members' memories, I will just quote from his press release. Major General James said, 'The 1994 Budget has good news for veterans.' He also said: The new Repatriation Medical Authority which is being set up to streamline the vexed question of the causal relationship between veterans' diseases.and injuries and war service was also welcome. He concluded by saying: This is a very reasonable Budget indeed as far as we are concerned. The pre-Budget consultative processes with both Ministers were very exemplary .and we look forward to continuing monitoring processes to ensure the intent of the new measures is fulfilled. . I actually made a copy of that particular media release available to my local RSL clubs and a range of sub-branches, and to a range of organisations' which assist veterans. Both the media clippings and a package of material that the minister made available to me ex,;. plaining a lot of things in the budget were well received. I thank the minister and the department for making those available. They helped, in a lot of ways, to explain what was in the budget for veterans. I think most people would agree that those comments from Digger James area ringing endorsement of the government's commitment in the field of veterans affairs. Veterans in my electorate, Oxley, were made aware of that commitment early this year, when the new minister made a visit to the electorate. It was the first visit by the minister to an electorate. We went to the RSL club early one Saturday morning and met with the veterans there and, I am pleased to say, sat around the table and had a good friendly chat. I think it was important that the minister could communicate with our veterans in that one-to-one way, to hear what their problems were. I thank the minister for taking the time to do that, because it was good. The RSL club has actually acknowledged that particular visit. They really appreciated the minister's time and his dealing with them on a one-to-one basis, talking. to them and listening to their concerns. Once'> again, I thank the minister very much for his efforts in that area. One thing that clearly arose out of those discussions was the support amongst the local veterans for the initiatives contained in the budget allocations for this portfolio. They were particularly happy about the new repatriation private patients scheme, which is already under way in New South Wales and South Australia and which will get under way in Victoria next year. Of course, they wanted to know when it might happen in Queensland. Once the complicated tendering process for the sale at Greenslopes is completed, I am sure they will not havelong to wait. That is one area that members of parliament are often confronted with. The changes to the hospital treatment for veterans have meant that a very good friend of mine, Mr Bill Langford-I am sure he would not mind my mentioning his name in this place-who lives in a town called Laidley, which is some 45 minutes drive west of Ipswich, is now able to go to hospitals in Ipswich rather than having to go down to Greenslopes in Brisbane. He gets first-class service in Ipswich. He often goes to one of the private hospitals, St Andrews. This means that his wife can visit him. When he had to go to Greenslopes she had to make the long trip by train to Brisbane and then she had to get a bus to Greenslopes. As the minister knows the area, he would understand the length of time it would take Mrs Langford to visit Bill at Greenslopes. So Bill Langford is one veteran who speaks very highly of those changes as they have assisted him. One of the measures in this legislation that we are debating today is the establishment of the income support supplement which will be paid from March next year. This change will affect those war widows and widowers who, in addition to their war widows or widowers pension, are currently also receiving additional income support payments from the Department of Social Security. Until now, widows and widowers have had to claim this pension through DSS, but under these new plans they will be able to get this payment in the form of the ISS directly through the Department of Veterans' AffairS. This will no doubt make life a lot easier for recipients of the supplement. The ISS will be paid at the same rate as their social security payment, and veterans entitled to the payment who wish to continue to receive their payment through DSS will be able to elect to do so. This initiative has been warmly received by the ex-service community in general and by the War Widows Guild in particular. It is estimated that nearly 54,000 war widows and widowers will eIect to transfer their payments from DSS to Veterans' Affairs, and I am sure life will be a lot easier for them as a result of that. This bill is indicative of the government's continuing commitment to the welfare of veterans and their dependants. One aspect of this commitment is reflected in the legishltive .amendments in this bill that seek to change the eligibility criteria for intermediate rate pensio-, otherwise known as TPI pensions, in order to ensure that pensions are granted in accordance with their original intention .. This amendment has been recommended by the Ministerial Advisory Council on Veterans' Issues and that council, headed by Justice Muirhead, includes representatives of the major ex-service organisations. This decision has been arrived at after extensive consultations with those people who are affected by the change. Special rate pensions were originally designed for severely disabled veterans of a relatively young age who would never hope to support themselves or their families or put sufficient funds away for their future needs. Similarly, the intermediate rate of pension was designed for the veterans whose war related conditions would limit their maximum possible working week to 20 hours. The changes proposed in this bill will mean that these pensions will not be normally granted to veterans over 65, but exemptions to this rule will apply if the veteran was engaged in work after the age of 65 and that work was in the same business in which he or she had been working for at least 10 consecutive years. These new rules will apply only to veterans who claim special intermediate rate pensions after they have turned 65. Currently, existing special and intermediate rate pensions will not be affected by this change, nor will the condition where special or intermediate rate pensions will continue to be paid after the age of 65 provided the pension was granted to the veteran before the age of 65. In the amount of time remaining I would briefly like to touch on a few other points. I am, of course, aware of the time and I know that other members wish to make a contribution, and I assume that the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) will be speaking as well. However, there are a whole range of points that I am sure were covered earlier by other speakers. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs also covered a whole range of items in his speech that are of assistance in this particular bill. Last year, in its policy launch for the supposedly unwinnable 1993 federal election, the ALP made a number of election commitments to senior citizens. It canvassed a number of policy initiatives, including a retirement incomes policy and a strategy of aged care. These policies included a whole range of specific commitments, such as the introduction of a seniors health card, an easing of the assets test for low income non-pensioner retirees and the introduction of a provisional age pension for long-term unemployed aged 60 and over. These commitments werecosted at around $390 million over the period to fiscal year 1996-97. There is an enormous commitment to the welfare of older Australians and veterans in particular. In this legislation we are debating today, the government is showing that it has delivered on those election commitments. As I said at the beginning, there are few more important groups of people in this country than our veterans. The selflessness and courage they displayed when their country needed them demands respect from the rest of the population and from the law-makers of this country. I know that members on both sides of the House always support that view. I am very glad indeed to be able to support this legislation today and to say that it goes some way towards repaying this debt. I spoke earlier of the younger veterans who will benefit from the budget package. They, perhaps more than others, had a cause for some grievance in the past. For too long they were regarded as pariahs and not given the respect they deserved. As a result, many have endured very great problems, both physical and social. Anyone who has seen some of the worse effects that the Vietnam war had on service men and women knows what I am talking about. I am glad to say that this has changed and continues to change. The turning point, of course, was the dedication of the Vietnam War Memorial, not far from this place. Whilst these veterans are perhaps in a different category from others, all our veterans will benefit in one way or another from this legislation. For this reason, it is a pleasure to have been able to support this .legislation today. I commend the bill to the House and congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on the manner in which he is carrying out his duties. As I mentioned before, I also congratulate his predecessor, Senator Faulkner.",63
50,Mr VAILE,PAIRS,"It is a pleasure to get the opportunity, which I did not think I was going to, get this afternoon, speak on the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill. As all previous speakers have indicated, this bill is covering the terribly important subject of veterans' affairs. The previous two speakers have both acknowledged that there is not a more deserving group of people in our community than our veterans who, through a number of different conflicts overseas, have served this country extremely well. We should never lose sight of the fact that they did that without fear. A lot of the veterans have given up their lives in doing that, but many others have made a great sacrifice which has seriously affected their lives and the lives of their families through some of the disabilities that they suffer. My personal view is that we cannot apply the normal process of assessment to veterans; There must be more compassion involved, more flexibility involved, than is being laid out in one part of this bill. I join with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), in acknowledging the work that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) has done in a number of different areas in putting this bill together, but certainly it has the government's trade mark on it in that it is an omnibus bill which the coalition is prepared to support, apart from one section. From time to time the government has presented bills of this nature to this House, knowing that there might be one area that the opposition is going to oppose while fully supporting all other sections of the bill. I would like to make particudifferent. lar reference in that regard to the changes that are being made for merchant mariners. I do not think there would be a persoll in this parliament who would be prepared to speak against that particular proposal. The bill makes several amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and covers a wide variety of issues affecting veterans. The bill amends the principal act to establish a specialist tribunal,. the Repatriation Authority, to' deal with medical-scientific issues relevant 'to claims for pensions as a result of disease or injury.. It modifies the eligibility criteria for claims for special and to intermediate rate pensions, abolishes the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 to bring veteran mariners under the auspices of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, and encourages ,veterans to claim any foreign pension for which they may be eligible. It modifies the payment of partner service pensions, and transfers the payment of income support payments for war widows and widowers under the Social Security Act to the Veterans' Entitlements Act. As I stated a while ago, it is obviously an omnibus bill. The coalition supports all those measures apart from the way that the government is dealing with the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority. We support what the government is trying to do for veterans. We support what the government is doing for those merchant mariners. Clause 11 of the bill inserts a new part into the principal act to establish the Repatriation Medical Authority and outline its powers and functions proposed under section 196A.· It establishes the RMA as a body corporate with perpetual succession and the power to sue and be sued. Proposed section 196B gives the RMA the power to determine a statement of principles in relation to a kind of injury, disease or death, setting out minimum factors which must be related to service rendered by a person to constitute a reasonable hypothesis for the purposes of the principal 'act. I will just stop there for a moment. In my mind that is too rigid. There is not enough flexibility in there. Each case is absolutely You cannot have a fixed set of guidelines and say that you either measure up or you do not. I do not think that is fair and I do not think that at the stage a lot of these veterans are at, in applying for repatriation ' benefits they should be put over those sorts of hurdles. The RMA also has the power to review the contents of statements of principles as a result of requests under proposed section '196E. Medical Proposed section 196C prohibits theRMA from carrying out any new research work for the purposes of an investigation but enables it to request information from the department or request the department to carry out' research to confinn or disprove information about the type of injury, disease or death. Proposed section 1960 makes detenninations made by the RMA disallowable instruments, which is one positive point. Proposed section 196E allows claimants, the Repatriation Commission or veterans lobby groups to request the carrying out of an investigation under proposed section 196B. Proposed section 196F allows claimants, the Repatriation Commission or veterans lobby groups or persons with relevant expertise to make a submission which does not deal with legal matters to the RMA relevant to the investigation. Proposed sections 196K through to 196T are administrative and deal with membership of the RMA and remuneration, tenure, resignation, tennination, allowances of members, along with the conduct and procedure of the meetings of the RMA. The fundamental issue in this legislation relates to the standard of proof necessary to establish that more recently acquired medical disabilities of veterans were caused by their wartime experience. The Baume report criticised the present criteria for operational service which is the reverse criminal standard of beyond reasonable .doubt linked to a reasonable hypothesis test. It recommended the civil standard with the benefit of doubt in favour of the veteran with operational service. The government has decided to retain the present beyond reasonable doubt provision but implement a Repatriation Medical Authority to detennine principles of medical causation. The authority will be an independent body consisting of five eminent medical specialists and will prepare statements of principles based on sound medical-scientific evidence that will exclusively state what factors related to service must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death in service. The statement of principles will be a disallowable legislative instrument that will be binding on the Repatriation Commission, the Veterans' Review Board and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Whilst it is sensible to provide qualified scientific opinion to assist the various lay tribunals that have adjudicated in this arena to date, there is concern as to inflexibility that could result from the systems proposed in the legislation as it will apply in the resolution of individual cases. For instance, there does not appear to be any process whereby a lay tribunal might submit an individual case to the authority for assessment. The whole process appears top down. Once a principle is established, all veterans must be judged against this standard-as opposed to a process of taking each individual case on its merits-and it eliminates any room for compassion in the assessment of an application. That is what the opposition is opposing as far as this particular aspect of the bill is concerned: its lack of flexibility and its inability to treat an individual case on its merits. We all see this happening in our electorates. I am sure that every honourable member who has a large population of veterans living in his or her electorate has been asked by some of them to make representations to the minister over some grievance about their treatment by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in one way or another. Sometimes they are justifiable grievances and sometimes they are not, but the fact remains that those people have a right-and, some would argue, a greater right than a lot of other taxpayers in this country-to ask for some extra special consideration in view of what they have been through on behalf of their nation and in view of the free existence enjoyed by others in this country because of the efforts of those veterans. I make it abundantly clear to the government that there needs to be more flexibility in that aspect of the legislation. We need to be able to deal with individual cases on their merits, thus providing more compassion in the assessment process, so that veterans who really do not want to go through the hassles of paper warfare with departmental officers do not have to do so. We know that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is a very compassionate man because it is evidenced in some of the changes that he has quickly introduced to this act on taking on this portfolio. But the mfnister is not the only one who will be dealing with individual the cases. Professional public servants will be doing their job as far as the rules and regulations are concerned. We need to be treating veterans as special and a little different from other sections of the community. I ask the minister to seriously consider these comments in dealing with that area the final stages of this bill. If I knew that minister himself was going to be dealing with each individual case, I could be sure that would be done properly, because he has a in great understanding of theportfolio and a great deal of compassion. But that is not going to be the case. They are my concerns . in that area. It is interesting to note the estimated savings to the Commonwealth in that measure the bill: in 1994-95 they amount to $0.546 million; in 19957 96 they will be $4.119 million, and they continue to increase. suppose that is only an actuarial exercise, because we do not know how long we are going to have a lot of our veterans with Certainly, in the initial year, half a dollars in the overall scheme of things in Australia is not a lot of money when we consider some of the expenditures that we have coming out of budget each year. I move to another aspect of this bill, the changes to the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. I have made a number of representations on behalf ents to the responsible minister. These people contacted me almost straight after the federal election last year. They have been arguing their own case virtually since the Second World War. The names of a couple of those people Clfe Charles Cheeseman of Lake Cathie and PhiIIip Lusher of Forster, who have carried the banner on this issue, along with often sunk. the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who has been a great advocate for merchant mariners in relation to aspect of the biII. I acknowledge the work of the honourable member for Shortland. I think he has taken very positive approach. I note the argument change. that merchant maririers have used over the last couple of years in their representations change this act: that the Canadian government repealed its equivalent act some years ago recognise the service of merchant mariners. So we will see some changes to the act. At present, the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act of 1940 is the major piece of legislation dealing with benefits for veteran in mariners. The SWPA provides for the paythe ment of pensions and gratuities in respect of death or incapacity incurred in the course of this employment as an Australian mariner, defined section 3(1) .. The eligibility criteria for a pension under this act are stricter than under the principal act, requiring the incapacity or death to be a direct result of the employment under section 12. The bill transfers responsibility for pensions in under the SWPA from the act to the principal act. Clause 47 repeals the SWPA, and clauses 48 to 68 are transitional provisions which I preserve payments under the SWPA or its regulations, preserve claims and determinations currently on foot, and treat determinaus. tions under the SWPA or its regulatiofls as· million equivalent under the principal act. At present, an Australian mariner is defined in section 5C(1) of the principal act, but benefits under the principal act are restricted to claims under part III of the principal act, which concerns service pensions. So at last, after all these years, we will see Australia's World War II merchant mariners recognised for the service that they gave to this country of my constituduring that conflict. I have talked to a lot of service people, and they will readily admit that a lot of Australia's merchant mariners during World War II saw more active service and were fired upon more than were a lot of the regular service personnel. In fact, their ships were This change has been a long time coming. I would be the first to admit that the Second this World War Australian merchant mariners have lobbied consecutive governments of both political persuasions. Again, I acknowledge a the minister for bringing about this welcome Currently, compensation benefits for marito ners are more stringent than for veterans, in particular, the section on th- connection to required between employment and injury and on standard of proof. This will mean that for mariners who have rendered operational service there need be only reasonable hypothesis linking injury, disease or death to war service-the same as for veterans .. It brings the provisions into line with those in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Interestingly, the financial impact to the Commonwealth in the first 12 months in the 1994-95 year will be $2.274 million. That will go up to $3.066 million in 1995-96-a small price to pay for their service for our country. They were not in uniform, but they served their country in just the same way. They put their lives on the line for this country. A lot of these merchant mariners saw action closer to Australia than did a lot of regular service personnel. So I commend the government for the part of this omnibus bill that will recognise those merchant mariners .. I know that, when this was announced in the budgetary measures by the minister, those people on whose behalf I had been making representations were extremely pleased and relieved that at last their service during the Second World War was to be recognised. I will move on to acknowledge another change in the budget which will give greater recognition to a lot of the very real-not apparent-problems being faced today by Vietnam veterans. I happen to have a Vietnam veterans association in my electorate that is very strong in numbers and voice. That association has close liaisons with Dr Len Lambert. Dr Lambert has presented a report to the government. I had the opportunity to meet with Dr Lambert before that report was released. I note the government's allocation in the budget of $20.6 million to the study of the post-traumatic stress disorder and its greater recognition of some of the problems that Vietnam veterans and .their families, are facing 20 or 30 years down the track. It is terribly important-not so much in a financial sense but in a psychological sensefor those veterans to know that at last the people of the Australia, the Commonwealth of Australia and the parliament Of Australia are seriously considering sothe· of the problems and. disorders that they suffer. Tl).ey served this country in good faith in an overseas conflict. Whether we agree with that or not does not matter and whether we agree with the way some veterans were conscripted and some were regulars does not matter, they still served this country to the best of their ability. A lot of Vietnam veterans in Australia are suffering from some very serious psychological and physical problems. We cannot ignore that section of our community. I commend the minister for the action he has taken in this budget to address this issue. I am sure many Vietnam veterans in my electorate would wish me to express that view. Personally, I would like to see the funding go a bit further but I know that there are economic and budgetary the constraints on the expenditure of capital. This. is an ongoing problem that the Commonwealth has to be prepared to face up to. I believe that we are heading in the right direction. I ask the minister to seriously consider the implications that may arise when veterans claim repatriation benefits from the Repatriation Medical Authority. I am sure the minister will give the matter serious consideration.",66
51,Mr ADAMS,PAIRS,"I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for the Veterans' Affairs (199495 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill and for the measures contained in the bUdget. I am sure it was a difficult task. This bill contains some very good measures. Last weekend, on behalf of the minister I visited a bush retreat for Vietnam veterans in the highlands of Tasmania, which is in my electorate. The government, through the joint venture scheme, assisted the veterans in replacing a generator which had been playing up for a long time. The generator was old, hard to start and had to be constantly filled with petrol. The wives of· veterans, war widows and people who have mobility difficulties will now be able to ut-lise the retreat. This scheme has proved to be a great asset in that it has allowed access to that area to a wider.· section of the veterans comtrlunity. After speaking to about 70 people who were at the retrea- to celebrate the purchase of the new· generator, I certainly felt that we. had sp-nt that money :well.. This·scheme has been very successful in the past and I am sure it will be very successful in the future. The mood of Australians has changed considerably. We are beginning to understand the difficulties our recent veterans have been through. The feeling is that we must extend to them the same care and services as we have extended to the veterans of all our other conflicts in the past. This government is looking at a whole spectrum of services for veterans. One of the new services which is a part of this bill is the establishment of a national centre for war related post-traumatic stress disorder. The centre will coordinate development of a comprehensive scheme of accredited programs for the assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of veterans with PTSD. This involves private and public facilities in each state. The assessment service will determine which type of program is most appropriate for each veteran. These programs include individual and group therapy, traumatic focus groups, anger management, alcohol and drug dependency, family therapy and adjustment skills. Once established, veterans will be referred for local support and in most cases will be managed by the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. This service, coupled with some of the funding programs such as the joint venture, can offer the chance for Vietnam veterans to lead fuller and more peaceful lives and discover freedom from the destructive legacies of the dramatic trauma of war. Another highlight was the expanded health programs for our veterans, widows and widowers, who will now receive their pension and disability allowance from the Department of Veterans' Affairs rather than from the Department of Social Security. Our veterans associations will be very pleased that has occurred. The minister should be praised for achieving that goal. These initiatives contained in the budget have been carefully developed to address the most pressing heeds of ex-service men and women, war widows and widowers, and their dependants. Also· the budget looked at· the long standing and long overdue issue of bringing the merchant mariners under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Let me pay tribute, as the last speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) did, to the  Morris) for the amount of work he has done over many years in championing this cause. The merchant mariners, along with the many other merchant mariners who served during our conflicts, have finally got more recognition-recognition that they deserve. The initiatives in this bill form the basis of planning and administrative structures that will be in place for many years to come. We the should always remember that we owe a big debt to our veterans and to those who never came back. The lives of the families of our veterans in many cases have been changed completely in their service of their country. This is a debt owed; it should never be forgotten or ignored. I support the bill.",70
52,Mr SCIACCA,PAIRS,"I thank all members for their contributions to this debate on the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill and, in particular, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member  able member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams). I also acknowledge and appreciate the very kind thoughts of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). I welcome the support of the opposition, via its shadow spokesman, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), for the broad thrust of this bill. I say from the outset that I am particularly sensitive· to the fact that, in my view, all members of this House want to do the right thing by the veteran community. I do not think any members in this House would say that they have a mortgage on their feelings for those who put their lives on the line for the purposes of protecting the freedom and the democratic institutions of this country. There will always be those who want to review programs of governments of what- . ever political persuasion. This has been the case in this instance. Much has been said about the Repatriation Medical Authority. I want to make it extremely clear to all members of this House, including the opposition spokesman on these matters, that it is not my intention or the government's intention to in any way curtail legitimate claims of our veterans when they make an application for a disability pension as a result of war' caused injuries. It is far from my intention to do that. Towards the end of 1992, the Commonwealth Auditor-General-and he can hardly be said to be a friend of this government or the parliament, as he is independent; my understanding is that he cannot be sacked unless both houses of parliament decide to do so-came out with a report which was highly critical of the way in which we pay our repatriation benefits. He said, in effect, that was too generous. It was not the government or the opposition that said that; it was the Auditor-General. As a result, the previous minister, Senator Faulkner, arranged to commission a' compensation review committee headed by Professor Peter Haume, a former health minister in a previous government, and assisted by Air Vice Marshal Homball from the services community and Ms Robyn Layton, a barrister from Adelaide. They came down with a report entitled A fair go, which has been mentioned on a number of occasions in this debate. Whilst I consider the report to be very detailed and quite good; a lot of veterans out there in the community will tell you that it is anything but a fair go. This is mainly because the report recommended that we change the present standard of proof from the reasonable hypothesis test to a civil standard of proof. The government rejected most of the nasties, if you like, in that report. We probably only picked up the recommendation providing for the setting up of the Repatriation Medical Authority.· I make it very clear that this entire budget package is exactly that: a package. It is not a smart trick on behalf of the government to bring in an omnibus bill so that all of it has to be accepted. It is a package. It did not just happen overnight. It was not organised in my office or that of Senator Faulkner. There was extensive consultation with the ex-service community; When I say 'extensive', I do not mean, as some honourable members have uncharitably said here today, that I or Senator Faulkner spoke to a few senior people in the ex-service community. It was quite the contrary. I know that Senator Faulkner met with ex-service organisations all around the country and that he gave them at least broad principles as to what he wanted to do. Senator Faulkner set up the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Veterans Issues, or MACVI, which advised him on these matters.. In real terms, we have a package of measures which no-one in this House is arguing with, apart from the measure which provides for the setting up of the Repatriation' Medical Authority. What concerns me is that, in their it zeal, held sincerely no doubt, those opposite want to oppose the part of the bill which provides for the setting up of the Repatriation Medical Authority. In practical terms, this means that I cannot introduce the moneys that will go to seamen and the merchant mariners. I am bringing this bill in today so that I will be in time for the start-up date of 1 July 1994. It will allow merchant seamen to come under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I will not be able to bring in the .. $20.6 million package over four years for the purposes of trying to look after our younger veterans, and I will not be able bring in the $8.9 million aged care package that I want to bring in over future years. The whole premise upon which I have based this package and upon which the previous niinister, Senator Faulkner, has had extensive consultations with the rest of the ex-service community around Australia is that it is a package. Again, I accept that the opposition is being sincere in its belief that this Repatriation Medical Authority will create some sort of a monster which will in some way impact upon the benefits or entitlements of veterans. I want to ensure that that is not the case. The major point that is being brought up here is that there seems to be ostensibly no form of appeal from the Repatriation Medical Authority. I want to touch on this point because. it is very important. We are talking about benefits to veterans, a start-up date of 1 July 1994 and an issue on which I want a bipartisan approach. It is not a question of whether the opposition or the government gets some credit for this; at the end of the day, it is a question of what we are going to give to our veteran community. Frankly, I do not care who gets the credit as long as they get the entitlements they deserve--entitlements which are in this bill. Let me take the House through the situation with respect to the Repatriation Medical Authority. The fact is that statements of principles are already used by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Repatriation Commission. Under this bill, I will appoint five eminent doctors who have been accepted not only by their own organisations, such as the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, but also generally by the ex-service community. Only last night I met with members of the national executive of the RSL. I said to them that I am more than happy to ensure that I put a line through any doctor who has appeared and given evidence against a veteran in any court in this country. I said that that is what I would be prepared to do. When this statement of principle comes out, it will get lodged here in this parliament as a disallowable instrument. That means that any ex-service organisation or anyone who feels aggrieved can come along and say, 'We don't like that.' All they have to do is object to it and I have to pull it out. It is a disallowable instrument, so that means it can be pulled out. That is the position at the end of the day. The appeal question concerns the opposition. I want to make a few points about it. The statements of principles will not be appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal because they are legislative and not administrative in nature. Statements of principles will not deal with any individual's case or any particular hypothesis in isolation but will apply generally to all veteraIis setting out all the relevant causal factors for each kind of injury, disease or death. Priorlo 1977, approximately 30 per cent of c1aims-,-perhapsa few more-were being accepted by the Repatriation Commission.· It is now over 70 per cent. Certain decisions can easily result in the situation getting out of control. That is what the Auditor-General and the Baume committee were talking about. We need to ensure that these sorts of cases do not undermine the integrity of the repatriation system. As many people in the ex-service community say, we have to look after the needy, not the greedy; not those people who can only tell some sort of a spurious story and still get some sort of benefit because they might be able to get one doctof in 100 who is prepared to accept their case. I will give some examples of what we call maverick claims. The first example is a minor bump or accident on service leading to a tumour 40 years later. There is nothing to distinguish the bump or accident from any others that happened before, during or after service. The second example is working as a clerk during the war and getting eye strain such as would cause cataracts. A third example is the drinking of one or two cans of Coca-Cola for about three months being responsible for dental caries 40 years laterAll the Repatriation Medical Authority is trying to ensure is that we preserve the integrity of the system and that we come down with a statement of principles based on sound scientific-medical evidence. Even then, according to the bill, there is an opportunity for review and members of the ex-service community can object. I.will repeat what was said by my colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) in his second reading speech: Mr Speaker, I stress that the bill establishes a comprehensive system of review of the contents of statements of principle. Veterans, their dependants and organisations representing veterans or their dependants will be able to make submissions to the authority which will be considered in the process of formulating. the statements of principle. They will also be able to request the authority to carry out investigations into the cause of any injury, disease or death for the purpose of making a statement of principle and to request a review of any of the statements of principle. Comprehensive provisions exist in the bill in relation to such matters, including provisions requiring the authority to give notice of any request for investigation and enabling access to information in documents considered by the authority in arriving at its determination. Let me make it very clear: I am a compensation lawyer.· That was my job before I entered into the parliament. I can tell the House that there are doctors who will always give people opinions that lean a certain way. Mr MCGauran-Really!",71
53,Mr SCIACCA,PAIRS,"If you have not practised as a lawyer, then you would not know that. But I am telling you that that is a fact. Mr MCGauran-So they are corrupt? . Mr SCIACCA-No, of course they are not. Mr MCGauran-Oh!",74
54,Mr SCIACCA,PAIRS,"Let me finish. We are talking about veterans. I usually accept the honourable member's interjections, but I will not in this case because I am trying to make a very valid point. When lawyers get involved in these matters, people always get hlwyers WJlO are sympathetic towards their case. It is always easy to find one doctor out of 100 who will go along with someone's particular case. All I am saying is that we have to .get rid of that. There is. no point in going to tribunals, laypeople or judges. who really know nothing about medicine. We are trying to get an authority that can objectively do what it is supposed to do. We are trying to prevent the two per cent-maybe three per cent-of maverick cases from getting through. What is· wrong with that? I finalise by saying-I make this offer quite genuinely to my friend the honourable member for O'Connor-that I accept his good intentions on this matter. As I said, I just want to be sure that, at the end of the day, this package goes through as was intended. I am giving back in their entirety to the veterans community the savings that have been mentioned of approximately $7 million over four years. I will give back every penny that we will save. It is not as though we are taking the money. If the honourable member can come up with a situation in which I am still able to put the Repatriation Medical Authority together and enable it to do what it is intend- Grace, E. L. * ed to do-that is, get rid of maverick claims-and if he can come up with some formula that does not in any way knock about the integrity of that authority, lam prepared to talk to him. At the end of the day, I just want to be sure that,come 1 July 1994, the merchant mariners can apply for their benefits and that all those moneys we are going to be spending on Vietnam veterans, et cetera, can be spent.

83,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the honournonsense. able member for Lilley: the May labour force statistics released today do contain some excellent news for the nation. Employment increased by 30,500 in May. The number of people unemployed fell by 23,000. So the unemployment rate fell from 10.1 per cent April to 9.8 per cent in May:-the first time it has been below 10 per cent since August 1991. Employment is clearly growing quite strongly. I;:mployment has increased by some 267,000 since April 1993. That is growth of 3 t h per cent in 13 months. Unemployment as beyond that. a consequence is falling quite rapidly; it has fallen by 112,000 in the past seven monthsfrom 11.1 per cent to 9.8 per cent. Also today the figures were released for number of persons on jobstart and newstart allowances for May. They show a fall of paper 26,000, or a fall of 2.9 per cent-the biggest fall since January 1989. The number of longimpact term unemployed receiving newstart fell by 14,000, or 3.2 per cent. These are all very welcome statistics. demonstrate that the benefits of strong nomic growth are flowing through to the labour market. .They demonstrate that quite ment. unambiguously. They give the lie to the continuous opposition claim that we are not getting job growth. This was said in the opposition's formal reply to the budget. been repeated by various other opposition spokesmen and indeed stated again today by the opposition spokesman on employment, the honourable member for Goldstein. According to the AAP report,· he said, 'The government future. has not created real jobs.' What is he talking about? There has been growth in employment of 267,000 in the last 12 months and he is saying there has not been any growth in real jobs. There has just been no growth in the opposition's preparedness to faCe the facts and recognise that we do have an economic recovery; that economic recovery is flowing unemthrough and creating strong employment growth, falling unemployment levels, rising real incomes and rising living standards. The whole litany of argument that we are getting from the opposition about there being no flow through to the people of Australia is a total In answer to the second part of the honourable member's question: we are clearly very well placed for further substantial improvement in the labour market because there is absolutely no reason to believe that we will in not go on chalking up rates of economic growth over four per cent. The 4th per cent GDP growth figure for 1994-95 stands firm. I think it is generally agreed by commentators to be a reasonable forecast. We can expect it to remain at rates of 4 per cent or above or With growth in employment of 260,000 in the last 13 months we are very well placed to achieve our election promise of 500,000 jobs the in this term of office. We are already over halfway there in 13 months without the white policies, which are a major part of this year's budget, which will feed through and on the labour market in the next 12 months. It can certainly be expected that these policies will have some additional effect in They reducing the unemployment levels over and ecoabove that which would come from normal economic growth and its impact on employWe can also confidently assert that the budget time estimate of an unemployment rate of 9 th per cent by June 1995 looks very It has capable of achievement.

In question time he comes and he asks the question. He will do so.,78
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I accept that admonition, but I would hope I would be protected against the interruptions of those on the government side. I will start the question again. I refer to the Prime Minister's claim in France yesterday that Australia's economic relations with they our Asian and Pacific neighbours would be enhanced if this country became a republic. Does the Acting Prime Minister recall a speech to the National Press Club in April of this year by the former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew in which he said of the republican debate in Australia: Asians do not understand how this issue is relevant to Australia's links with Asia. When will the government admit that this failed grovelling by the Australian Prime Minister is not only grossly demeaning to our sense of independence and pride but also extremely patronising to our regional neighbours? In the light of Lee Kuan Yew's comments, what precisely are the difficulties you are going to have in China tomorrow?",78
102,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I indicated in my previous answer, this issue is one· that the Prime Minister has put on the agenda for discussion debate. The government has made it clear that in terms of the flag there will be at some stage an active choice. In terms of the repubquite clearly there will need to be a decision made that involves all of the Australian people. That will be preceded by rational debate. The opposition is really about two things today. One is that it does not want to refer to a number-9.8. It does not want to talk about the reduction in unemployment. It does not want to debate the economy. It wants to get onto a distraction. Today's distraction is .the of the republic, so let us deal with the us up; issue of the republic. Lee Kuan Yew indicated that the issue of republic was an issue for Australia to decide, not an issue for Singapore. Interesting. ly enough, Mr Major, the Prime Minister of Britain,. seemed to be much more relaxed about the issue than the opposition is. One has to wonder again about the opposition's motives. The Prime Minister was very clear in what he said in France. He said: What I am going to do . .. is work towards changing Australia-make it stronger, make it more diverse, make it more. outward looking, make it outgoing and make it obviously culturally AustralClub Ian. That will never be done fully while the Australian head of state is the monarch of Great Britain. That is, if we are to forge our own national identity and if we are to go about that in a rational and sensible way, then clearly we need to talk about this issue. The Prime Minister has initiated that debate. We would like that debate to continue. The government has ensured that that debate be thoroughly canvassed in Australia and that debate will continue. The fact of the matter is that, whether it is via quotations from Lee Kuan Yew or anyone else, the opposition is concerned about drawing attention away from the fact that there is unambiguously good news today in terms of employment figures. The government's economic policies are very much on track. There is a recovery under way and the Australian people understand who is responsible for that recovery. Who is trying to· talk it down? Who is trying to demean Australia? Who is not interested in terms of the decent future of this country? It is the opposition. Investment Issues",78
103,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Treasurer seen reports of criticism of both the level of Australian investment overseas and the level of foreign investment in Australia? Is the government contemplating action to reverse these capital flows?,79
104,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have seen such reports. Who could miss them? On the front page of the Financial Review- 'Downer's No to Foreign Investors'. Who could miss that? That headline comes from a speech to the National Press Club yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition.,79
105,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,79
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Treasurer might just resume his seat for a minute. When questions have been asked,. ministers have every entitlement to be heard in silence. I request the House to give them that privilege.",79
107,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That headline came from a report on a speech given by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday to the National Press in which he represented two matters of government economic policy as indications of failure. He described them as 'a massive inflow of foreign equity of over $5 billion into Australia over the last three months' and-again in the March quarter-'the fact that Australia has lent over $5 billion overseas'. What he was saying was that both the foreign capital inflow and the capital outflow from Australia were some kind of demonstration of massive policy failure by this government. Mr Downer-I didn't say that at all.,79
108,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I found that a most extraordinary statement. I suppose we saw some presage of it from the Leader of the National Party a couple of day before when he asked me a question which raised a point about the outflow. It indicates that this opposition is trying to say to the people of Australia that substantial foreign capital equity inflow is some kind of detrimental factor for the nationMr Downer-I didn't say anything like that.,79
109,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and something which we should be very concerned about. Mr Downer-Why don't you read the speech?,79
110,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you were not concerned about it, why did you raise it? Mr Downer-Why don't you read the speech?",79
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition!,79

113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition and the Treasurer!,79
114,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition leader cannot stand the fact that he has been reported· in a way which he did not like, but it flows from his own comments. Mr Downer-Read the speech!",79
115,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"His own comments make it clear that he was criticising an inflow of foreign capital into this country. At the same time he was trying to say that there is a poor investment climate in this country and that is why the money is flowing out-that the reason Australian investors are not investing in Australia is that there is a poor investment climate. What mugs he must think these foreign investors are. They have the whole world to choose from,· but they are deciding to invest in Australia. Why are they doing it? Because it is a lousy investment environment! You must think they are a bunch of screwballs. I think there is only one screwball in this whole operation, and that is the Leader of the Opposition. We should be pleased that foreign investors see Australia as an appropriate place to invest and believe that Australia's economic prospects are such that it is worth putting a lot equity capital into Australia. That is important. To the extent that they do that, we can cover the current account deficit without resort to debt. Presumably, from the opposition leader's comments, he does not like foreign debt; therefore, he should prefer equity to debt. So why is he criticising the equity inflow? We should also be pleased that we now have a sophisticated business community in this country able to envisage investment not just in Australia but also in· other countries and is prepared to look for business opportunities elsewhere that will provide benefits Australia. They provide income flows to this nation as a result of those productive investments and, in many cases, they also generate trade opportunities. They are complementary to our policies and to criticise them is economic naivety. Perhaps it is just crude parochial politics. It is interesting to note that these comments by the Leader of the Opposition look somewhat different from what he used to say a little while ago. Speaking to the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill in this House in 1986, he said: Mr Costello-When was that-1986?",80
116,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. He said: . . . I am an unrepentant internationalist. Mr Costello-Eight years ago.,80
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,80
118,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He continued: Australia is simply not in the position where it can afford to take a high-handed attitude to potential productive foreign investment . . . Mr Richard Evans-What did he say in 1969?,80
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,80
120,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Apparently he has moved a fair way since then. In August 1986, when debating the appropriation bill, the Leader of the Opposition said: The time has come for Australia to. abandon totally all foreign investment restrictionshe wanted no foreign investment restrictions at allof and to abolish the Foreign Investment Review Board. The opposition did not want to have any controls on foreign investment at all. On 5 September 1989, when debating another appropriation bill in this House, he said: I hope that members of this place will in future go out into the community and argue the case for foreign investment . . . We will live to regret the day we were equivocal about foreign investment because those investors will go to other parts of the world . . . He seems to have forgotten that salutary point to that he was trying to make then. The Leader of the Opposition's statement is making foreign investors query whether or not this is an appropriate place in which to invest. When investors see these sorts of headlines and that sort of reporting of the opposition leader's statements, what will they think about investing in this country? They are going to think twice or even three times about it and maybe go elsewhere. The Leader of the Opposition recognised that in 1989. At that time he was being honest with this House rather than playing crude politics like he is doing now. What this opposition leader is doing is what the .products of elite schools do when they participate in rowing. His politics are just rowing; you face one way and you go like hell in the opposite direction.",80
121,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Mr Ronaldson-What standing order?",81
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Mr Howe,-I ask the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw a remark he made in the course of the Treasurer's answer to the question. It is unparliamentary to interject on a minister or a speaker and accuse that person of telling lies. He should withdraw that remark.",81
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not hear the comment that was made. However, the' Acting Prime Minister has requested that a remark he has heard be withdrawn. If the Leader of the Opposition made that comment, I inform him that that particular term has been remarked on in this place by successive Speakers and I ask him to withdraw it. Mr Downer-The comments that the Treasurer made. about my speech are totally untrue. He has clearly not read the speech on any occasion. But I withdraw the word. Deficit Reduction",81
124,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer, who obviously has not read the speech the Leader of Opposition made yesterday. Has the Treasurer read the June corporate brief of Syntec which said that there is a 'wallowing monetary and fiscal slack the Australian economy which, left un- - lk checked, will take us straight to boom and slump economics' and that. the 'quality economic government could thwart what . could otherwise be one of our best periods'? Given the fact that Westpac, Potter Warburg any of thatand Syntec have all warned that the government's budget strategy is off course, will the government bring forward its deficit reduction targets?",81
125,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In bringing down its budget the government was very much aware of the importance of reducing the budget deficit adhering to its deficit reduction program. did that; indeed it enhanced that program and produced a lower outcome projected for 1996like 97 than had been previously the case. We are very conscious of the fact that it is important to reduce the deficit as a means of taking the pressure off the rest of the economy as the private sector gets going, and it is also important in terms of improving national savings. There is. no resiling from that in the budget. People like Syntec may believe that a tighter budget would be appropriate. I notice that the opposition is now saying quite clearly that that is its position. It was a little hidden before, but it is now saying it quite openly. It is interesting that opposition members say that, when they are also saying that we should be spending more in various areas and that we should be giving tax cuts in various areas, particularly to small business. Mr Costello-Come on, Ralph; tell us about Syntec. Have you read Syntec?",81
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked a question. This is the response..,81
127,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At the same time they are saying that we should be reducing the deficit. So they want us to have more expenditure, more tax cuts and a lower deficit. The economic naivety of that can be seen purely from the statement of their position. The opposition clearly is pursuing a line which has no credibility. . If you want to have some credibility you had better start putting some numbers on the in points that you are making. If you want to about increasing expenditure and in-reas­ mg. tax cuts, .tell us where you aregomg to of make the. savmgs and how you - ould reduce the defiCit; we would be. very mterested to know. We have heard nothmg from you about Mr Downer interjecting",81
128,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reply to the budgetremember? That is the time you are supposed to say what you think about the budget and what your alternative would be. That is when you get your chance to put the alternative and budget strategy. The opposition, given that It opportunity, is fudging it. It continues to fudge it. It simply runs the rhetorical line, 'Let us have a lower deficit' and then criticisbenefits es us on various tax and expenditure areas for not doing more. Opposition members have no credible policy. Until they come up with one, they should not criticise us. Regional Development",81
129,Mr CUNNINGHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Acting Prime Minister inform the House how the government's regional development strategy will assist regions to take advantage of employment growth?,82
130,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The regional development strategy is clearly very important at a time of economic recovery. Everyone in this House would be anxious to see the benefitsMr Tim Fischer-Tell us about Warrnambool.,82
131,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I might say, if we are talking about Warrnambool, that I read the Warrnambool Standard after it had been drawn attention to by the Leader of the National Party. Frankly, if we can get two pages in every regional paper in Au-traliaMr MCGauran-Criticising you.",82
132,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Two pages of very positive comment, I will be working on that; that is what the Warrnambool Standard contained. Our regional strategy is about ensuring that we have the benefits of recovery and growth shared equitably around the metropolitan and non-metropolitan rural regions of Australia. The government will release guidelines for the $150 million regional development program in early July. This program, when combined with white paper initiatives, particularly the new work opportunities and the regional environment employment program, provides a package of integrated employment and economic development assistance to regions. To qualify, regions have to demonstrate that they can engage all theplayers,all the regional leaders, in a concerted effprt. This is what the government is about in - iegional development. It is not about taking a top-down approach, but working in partnership with regions, involving people at the regional scale, to ensure that the creativity, initiative and leadership that are there in urban or nonmetropolitan regions are mobilised so that the of recovery are shared more equitably. Our strategy is enjoying strong support by regional leaders. The president of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures said recently: Theythe regionshave cause to celebrate. The new regional development beSt practice program will encourage regional leadership. In rural Victoria, the Horsham regional development board commented on the fact that the regional development strategy was a big step forward and a very good start. The government is about developing a regional policy that has broad support; that involves people across the board and that is not narrowly based; that is focused on economic development; that goes to the issues of the greatest concern in those regions; and that makes use of the funds available in the most efficient and the most equitable way. We have not sought to talk up the strategy as being one of massive dollars. But I believe those selective dollars will make a very significant impact. In the visits that I have made to about 15 different regions around Australia, I have been impressed at how well regions are coming together, how focused they are in terms of this strategy and how much they want to work in partnership with this government to ensure that the benefits of a very strong recovery, about which the Treasurer has spoken today, are equitably shared in Australia. Aboriginal Community Services",82
133,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Will the minister answer the question posed by the federal Race Discrimination Commissioner in her report on the provision of water and sanitation in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities which was recently submitted to the government? The question reads: How is it possible that governments were channelling a great deal of money into services for Aboriginal communities without noticeable improvements in poor conditions? In view of this obvious failure of government policy over many years and the international opprobrium as expressed by the most recent overseas delegation, what confidence can the Australian community have that there will be any improvement in the near future, irrespective of the amount of funds expended? Does the government intend to adopt the recommendations of the federal Race Discrimination Commissioner and, in particular, the recommendation for the commissioner to review progress at the 10 case study sites in her report in one year's time?",82
134,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question, but I must tell him that his question is predishift cated on some very false assumptions about spending in .Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The first point that ought be made is that the backlog in services and infrastructure in Aboriginal communities is agreed on both sides of the parliament to be in the order of $2 biHion. Those figures are not mine. They are borne out by studies undertaken by the Northern Territory government and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. One important survey that I would commend to the honourable member for North Sydney is a survey undertaken by Australian Construction Services. It highlights just one example of the extent of the backlog in services provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I wonder how many other members of the House would know that, as we sit here today, 14,000 Aboriginal people are living in communities which do not have· the minimum acceptable standard of water as agreed to by the National Health and Medical Research. Council. The honourable member is right to highlight the extent of the problem,but he is quite wrong to suggest that somehow or other the failure to address this problem is the fault of the Aboriginal affairs portfolio and, in particular, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.",83
135,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have only been there for 11 years. ',83
136,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Where has the money gone?,83
137,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If those opposite want a serious answer to this question, they would do well to listen to what I have to say. If the honourable member for North Sydney wishes to become informed about the nature of the problem and why that backlog in water, sewerage and housing has not been addressed, he could do no better than to look to the unanimous report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs entitled Access and equity-rhetoric or reality? I see members of the opposition who serve on that committee nodding with approval. In my view, there is a need to move to a in policy at the Commonwealth level. Precisely how we do that is a matter for discussion within the government and, I to would hope, to the extent that it is possible, within the parliament. My personal view is that the national government of the country can no longer sit back while state and territory governments fail to deliver those fundamental basic services that they ought to be providing to all citizens who live within their jurisdictions. In conclusion, let me assure the honourable member that the report of the Race Discrimination Commissioner will be given the deepest consideration by the government and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. To the extent that constructive lessons can be learnt from that report, they will be adopted. Treaties",83
138,Mr HOLDING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Has the Attorney General seen reports that Australian sovereignty is being threatened by the government entering into treaties? Are treaties an important part of Australia's position as a sovereign nation in the international community? Can he inform the House what benefits fall to Australia as a result of our being a signatory to a number of international treaties?,83
139,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,:Tell us about the drug dealer who got in under the rights of the child.,83
140,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, as you can hear from the honourable member for O'Connor, there is a fair bit of interest in the question of Australia's international relations, particularly its entering into multilateral treaties. A number of opposition spokespeople over recent times have attempted to construct some sort of great international conspiracy which is seeing Australia lose its sovereignty and is bringing Australian independence to its knees. Let us have a look at a couple of the basic fa:cts before we have a look at the threads of this great conspiracy theory. Firstly, one of the principal features of our constitutionindeed, one of the things which would have been in the minds of our founders-is that Australia should have one international voice. Clearly, our constitution gives the Commonwealth the power to enter into international arrangements. That is an executive action under section 61 of the constitution. Clearly, the external affairs power gives this parliament express power to make legislation in relation to treaties in international matters. Effectively, the action of entering into a treaty rather than being an attack upon the sovereignty of this nation is an action of sovereignty of this nation. It is a sovereign choice of Australia to enter into such arrangements. In many ways the substance of treaties reinforces Australia's sovereignty. For instance, the maritime boundary agreements we have with France, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia establish beyond doubt the areas in which Australia exercises its sovereignty. The Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation confirmed sovereignty which Australia has over air space over this country. In recent times we have seen opposition members getting very anxious about this issue. The first leg of this argument is that the government has embarked on some great crusade of signing as many treaties as it can. I asked the Office of International Law in my department to make a comparison of the rate of take up of multilateral treaties between the Hawke and Keating governments and the Fraser government. I was advised by the Office of International Law that there is noMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Government members-Oh! ' Mr Reith-There should not be any objection to members raising a point of order.",83
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There certainly is not by me. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to question 1243 on the Notice Paper. The minister is canvassing a matter on the Notice Paper. The question should be ruled out of order and so should his answer.",84
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me consult the Notice Paper. i Mr Reith-Here is my copy. Would you like the standing orders as well?,84
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. Those I know, probably a little better than you. ' Mr Reith-It is a long question.",84
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is a long question; he is noted for it. The question is not identical to that which has been asked but it does canvass the issues which the honourable member for Fisher wished to see in a written answer. I suggest to the Attorney-General that he be a little careful in his response to this question. ,84
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He has not finished his answer; he does not have to yet.,84
146,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is obviously some sensitivity about this matter. I took out a list of the treaties which the Fraser government entered into between 1976 and 1982. I certainly will not go through them all because there are far too many to read, but I will give some examples: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a very worthwhile agreement, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms. of Discrimination Against WomenMrTuckey-The question specifically requires this information. The standing orders of the parliament therefore prevent the Attorney-General from providing it in this fashion.",84
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. I have already said to the Attorney-General that in his response he must take care and, as far as I can tell, he is.",84
148,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Other treaties include amendments to the plant protection agreement for the South-East Asia and the Pacific region and-since ILO conventions seem to be 'of particular sensitivity-ILO convention 144, concerning tripartite consultations to promote the implementation of international labour standards. For the benefit of the House, I will table this list. We can see from that, firstly, there is no great increase in the uptake of treaties and, secondly, the Fraser government entered into a whole range of treaties covering a whole range of decisions.",84
149,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
150,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I can hear other interjections coming from opposition members. Obviously they used to sign these things but did not really want them to have any impact.,85
151,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the dams case? Mr Costello-Tell us about the dams case.,85
152,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The second point is that somehow there is interplay between the High Court and the Commonwealth in relation to the Tasmanian dams case which has somehow changed the entire landscape-as though the dams case were something extraordinary and new. But the High Court has long recognised the position of the Commonwealth and its powers in external affairs. In fact, in 1936, the High Court in the decision of the King v. Burgess, Ex parte Henry made some very important comments on the extent of the external affairs power. I will very quickly quote Chief Justice Latham: The Commonwealth parliament was given power to legislate to give effect to international obligations binding on the Commonwealth or to protect national rights internationally obtained by the Commonwealth where the legislation was necessary or deemed to be desirable for this purpose. It will be seen therefore that the possible subjects of international agreements are infinitely various. It is, in my opinion, impossible to say that any subject is necessarily such that it could never properly be dealt with by an international agreement. That was not the TaSmanian dams case; the High Court made that decision in 1936. The other interesting part is that entering into these international agreements is somehow ripping up the constitution and destroying the federal compact. That is an interesting contention, given that the constitution gives external affairs power to the Commonwealth and that the constitution establishes the High Court to interpret on the scope and extent of Commonwealth powers. It is interesting that somehow opposition members are able to construe this exercising of legitimate power, given by the constitution to the Commonwealth in this parliament,. as destroying in the same terms the constitution and the federal compact. The reality is, of course, that",85
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I invite the Attorney-General to wind up.,85
154,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am winding up. The fact is that there were further examples in the opposition leader's speech to the National Press Club yesterday of this same sort of irony-some would say 'hypocrisy'. He went on through the bulk of his speech with this so-called attack on sovereignty by foreign bodies, yet he started off his speech by attacking the government on the basis of its economic performance, saying that there is going to be a gap between rich and poor, based on a UN determination. The reality is that there is no attack on Australia's sovereignty by these processes. They are prescribed by the constitution and the opposition knows that. Child Support Agency  to the Auditor-General's report on the management of the Child Support Agency. I remind the minister of the Auditor-General's findings that the equivalent of two per cent of the staff at the CSA spend all their time in staff meetings, including 'time out' meetings. He found that there were more than 24 different types of meetings and that, for the last five years, no agendas or minutes of any of these meetings have been kept. Given that the Auditor-General also found that in some cases it took up to four, five or six months to pay clients their initial payments instead of the eight weeks identified by the CSA as a usual period, does the minister regard this waste·of resources as appropriate, and does he accept any responsibility for what has obviously become an utter shambles?",85
155,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This might surprise the honourable member who asked the question, but I do welcome the Auditor-General's reportbut not for the reasons that he does. Those opposite are miserable unless they get bad news. Good news is something they absolutely hate. This is a very bad day for them because of the unemployment figures. I welcome the Auditor-General's report. I also look forward to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which is chaired by the honourable member for Chifley. The reason I look forward to those reports is that they have the same focus as we do; that is, to improve the performance of the agency. I assure the honourable member who asked the question that that has been my goal and that of Michael Carmody, the Registrar of the Child Support Agency, since I assumed ministerial responsibility for the Child Support Agency. The report is one year old. It took the Auditor-General's Department a year from the time it made those findings to submit its report. A lot has happene- in that time. In fact, 26 of the 36 recommendations have already been implemented. There are another nine in the pipeline. That leaves only one of those recommendations, which refers not to the Child Support Agency but to the Department of Social Security. I announced a raft of changes in April this year. I would like to refer to some of those to show the sorts of things we have done to make sure that the agency is performing its functions a lot better than it has in the past. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 145 the minister should be relevant to the question. I remind him that the question was, firstly, whether the shameful waste of resources is appropriate and, secondly-and most importantly, I think, for the parliament-whether the minister accepts responsibility. We do not need him to read his press release. We want an answer to the question.",85
156,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The minister was referring specifically to those issues.,86
157,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In April this year I announced a number of changes which will improve the functioning of the Child Support Agency. The first is. to allow direct payments for stage court order cases, which are those cases that the Child Support Agency had prior to 1989. Until April this year, if custodial parents were receiving social security benefits and were clients of the Child Support Agency, they could not arrange private payments. I have changed that. In the instance where we know that they are good payers-where the money is paid on time from the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent-they will now be able to opt out. That will mean a freeing-up of resources within the Child Support Agency for the more difficult cases. On that day I also announced reduced costs for stage one cases. The same people had court orders given which speIt out the amount of child support which was to be paid. If there was a change in circumstance, such as the person became unemployed or custodial arrangements changed, that person had to go back to the court to get that varied. From April that will not be the case. That will free up resources within the Child Support Agency. The honourable member in his question talked about the long delay in getting the first paym-nt. The proof of parentage was one of the main causes of this for people in de facto relationships. Until April, they had to supply documents-in some cases, birth certificates; in some cases, statutory declarations-and, in some cases, even blood samples before the Child Support Agency could put that case onto the books. From 1 April I will make sure that that is no longer the case.  order. I respect your earlier ruling on the point of order raised by the honourable member for Flinders with regard to the relevance of the minister's answer, but I point out that I asked the minister whether he was going to take any responsibility for the inordinate amount of time wasted on staff meetings. He made these announcements about the changes to the CSA in April. If he wants to further them, he should put down a ministerial statement. I ask you to direct him to do so.",86
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Assistant Treasurer· will. wind up his answer.,86
159,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thankyou,. Mr Speaker. As I one said in my answer, this report is a year, old. In fact, many of the findings in that report were being canvassed prior to my assuming ministerial responsibility for this area. What I can inform the House is that, from day one, with Michael Carmody, the Registrar, I have been putting in place the sorts of reforms that I have read out to the House today to make sure that the Child SuppOrt Agency is a much better organisation than it has been, and gone a long way to making sure that is the case. Richardson, Mr Graham",86
160,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice. The minister will be aware of allegations made by the honourable member for Kennedy and other opposition members in the Senate regarding alleged improper conduct by former senator Graham Richardson. As minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority, can you inform the House of what, if any, Commonwealth connection exists? With respect to law enforcement, what are the appropriate steps to follow for members who believe they have material disclosing offences against the Commonwealth laws? Have they been followed in this instance?",87
161,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased to have an opportunity in this sitting, before the House rises, to deal with the matter. There has been continual muckraking for over a month around this House and in the Senate where my representative Senator Bolkus has been the subject of a barrage of questions loaded with smear and innuendo. But not one question has been asked of me, the minister who is responsible for the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority, by the opposition in this House. Given the seriousness with which I regard these matters, I accept that it is my responsibility, as justice minister, to assure the House-and I do so-that the government has not in any way been involved in political interference or any impropriety in relation to these matters. The matters relate to a state criminal investigation between the CJC and the Queensland police, codenamed 'Operation WaHab'. There is no AFP investigation and no NCA investigation; there is no joint AFPCJC-Queensland police investigation and no joint NCA-CJC-Queensland police investigation. The existence of Operation Wallah came to the attention of the AFP because the AFP and the Queensland CJC have a memorandum of it has understanding which recognises that an effective attack on organised crime activity requires mutual cooperation between law enforcement agencies and recognises the need for both agencies to accept and undertake to advise, inform and consult in respect of investigations which may result from time to time in mutual assistance being provided. The AFP advises that it has been briefed by the CJC strictly in accordance with the secrecy provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1989, Queensland. The AFP advised me that no briefing that it has had from the CJChas disclosed the commission of any Commonwealth offence. With respect to the National Crime Authority, there are similar cooperative arrangements in place, and the National Crime Authority has advised me that it too has been briefed by the Queensland authorities in respect of this operation. Both the NCA and the AFP have advised that the information provided to them by the CJC has not warranted their investigation. There are no Commonwealth investigations on foot and there has been no political interference. Operational matters regarding exchange of information between the AFP, the National Crime Authority and the Queensland CJC or police have been left entirely in the hands of the two Commonwealth agencies. I turn now to the allegations raised in the House by the honourable member for Kennedy. A key element of the allegations made by the honourable member was a statement made by Mr Roland John Ellems on 28 May 1994, portions of which were read into Hansard by the honourable member on Monday, 6 June this year and the whole of which was tabled by Senator O'Chee in the Senate later that day. In that document, Mr Ellems recounts: I was advised last year by my son Scott Ellems, that one of his surfing friends who was employed at Seaworld Nara Resort as a bell boy had taken in his words prostitutes to the room of Senator Graham Richardson. The document later recounts that Mr Ellems sought out his son's friend, whose name was Ayden Cross, and sets out a colourful account of what Mr Ellems says Ayden Cross had told him which involved Mr Ayden Cross taking two prostitutes to Senator Richardson's room. Of course it is hearsay, but the honourable member placed enough weight on it to smear Senator Richardson by its use-and no doubt mmJ sticks. But is it credible? To judge, I would like honourable members to consider the transcript of an interview by Channel 10 with the father of Ayden Cross conducted on 7 June 1994. Only a small component of this damning interview has gone to air. I quote from the transcript: 10: We're after Ayden Cross. Cross: Well I'm his father. 10: We're after Ayden about what's going on about his role as porter out at the Nara. 10: But he certainly as far as from what he's told other people he did take girls to Graham Richardson's room. Cross: On one occasion one woman. And as I saidMr Ruddock-Is it hearsay? Mr Thckey-Why did you leave something out?",87

165,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Those on my right!,88
166,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will read on: Cross: On one occasion one woman. And as I said, he and his mates were just joking about it. The other porters. And that as far as it went, honestly. . . . You're taping, are you? 10: Yes. Cross: Yeah well there was a person, as I said to Senator Katter it could' have been his sister for all my son knew. 10: Surely porterS would know what a prostitute looks like? Cross: Well, possibly, but well, I dori. 't know .. that's what I said to him, did she have leather gear on, stockings and suspenders, and he said, no, she was just sort of dressed like any other person. He was only assuming and so were the other guys. They really didn't have anything I was quite mad at Senator Katter though, he tried to tell me that the Mafia were going to get my Son and all this thing, and do a statement and all this sort of stuff and you know, you've heard of urn, who is the .. 10: So Senator Katter's made threats? Cross: Not made threats, but he was just saying you know if your son disappears it's on your shoulders, and all this sort of shit and I was getting really mad with him, because my brother's in the police force, so I sort of rang him up and he said just ignore him, go and see a solicitor and make your own statement. Because it was just sort of, had escalated over nothing really. 10: Has there been any pressure brought to bear on Ayden from other camps? Cross: No, no. It was through a mate of his actually. His father had a personal vendetta against Richardson etc. So he just wanted something to get on him. But that is just one example of the muckraking. The truth is that the real questions in this matter are no longer for the government to answer but for the Leader of the Opposition to answer. This is because he is saying one thing but doing another. In public, he stands with his hands out saying, 'Look, I have got clean' hands.' When he is asked about these matters in public he says it is scuttlebutt just raised by opposition private members on a frolic of their own. Alexander Downer said yesterday that he is angry that Prime Minister Keating is trying to link him as Leader of the was Opposition with raising these issues in the parliament. But the truth is that there is clearly an orchestrated opposition campaign. It is clearly part of the opposition's tactics . The respected political correspondent Laurie Oakes said in 'yesterday's BulletinMr Downer-Talk about unsubstantiated smears!",88
167,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He said that Downer: . . . is another exponent of the do-one-thing-whilein saying-another school of politics.,89
168,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister might now wind up his answer. MrKERR-I am winding up. He also said that: The truth is that Chapman is one of Downer's closest allies in the conservative faction of the Liberal Party. If Downer disapproved of what he is doing, Chapman would drop off ... He has discussed his material with the Senate opposition leader, Rob Hill . . .",89
169,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The point of order is on relevance. The minister was asked about specific claims made by the honourable member for Kennedy and he gave a very lengthy answer and there was no interruption from the opposition to that answer, although it would more suitably have been a matter for a statement in the House. I do believe, in accordance with your earlier intimation, that he is going way beyond that, and he ought to stop now.",89
170,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I indicated that the honourable member should draw his answer to a close. He is doing so.,89
171,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable. members might recall that I was also asked about the proper course which should be adopted in relation to allegations made where members believe they have matters which might disclose the commission of an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth. If I might just deal briefly with that very serious component of the question which I have been askedMr Downer-Oh, come on!",89
172,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! This is an issue which has been occupying the time not only of this House but also of the Senate for some time. I am prepared to allow the minister some discretion here but, again, I would ask him to make his response brief and to draw his answer to a close.",89
173,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will conclude by going to those matters that are important. It has now emerged that the Leader of the Opposition has even appointed a senior adviser from his own office to coordinate arrangements between those making the smears and his own office relation to the allegations. Mr Downer-Look, that is not true. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.' Under standing order 145, which· relates to relevance, as you indicated, you have given the minister some considerable discretion in relation to this matter. Twice you have asked him to close. He said SA that he was going to the serious issue of the way in which these matters could be brought to the attention of the Australian Federal Police, but here he goes off on another excursion of his own. He ought to close up, answer the question or have the guts to make a statement.",89
174,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable Minister for Justice will conclude.,89
175,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The appropriate action for any member who believes that he or she has material disclosing an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth or a state is to pass it on to the proper investigating authorities. It is not to deal with the matter by smear and innuendo. I have some time ago written to the Leader of the Opposition drawing his attention to those principles. Child Support Agency,89
176,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Is it not the case that, due to lengthy processing delays in the. Child Support Agency, single parents who are raising young children in my electorate are still waiting for over two months for the agency to get maintenance payments to them? Because of these delays, is it not also the case that some of them were told at Christmas last year by CSA officers to seek emergency charity assistance from local charities in order to provide a bare Christmas fare for their families? Is this still the case? Will this be the case at Christmas this year? Is this the social justice, the fair society, that the Prime Minister keeps talking about? Mr GEAR""'-I think sometimes members of the opposition must have cotton wool in their ears. I stood up here in answer to the last question to talk about the changes that have been made in the Child. Support Agency to make sure that the service is better. But I will detail a few more of the changes and a few more of the criticisms that the Auditor General's report raised and undoubtedly were the impetus for these questions. The Auditor-General raised the issue of difficulty in communicating with the Child Support Agency, that is, through the·telephones. I Ca,1 tell the honourable member that already we have put 10 per cent of the staff on the telephones. In fact, 80 per cent of calls will be answered within three minutes by the end of this year, and we will get that down to two minutes by this time next year, to make sure that your constituents and mine can actually get through to the Child Support Agency. We are also talking about the eight week delay.",89
177,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is disgraceful!,90
178,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Moore!,90
179,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He gets very excitable. Look at him!,90
180,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is easy for him to say that, Mr Speaker, but he did not have to go to get support from",90
181,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Moore!,90
182,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is an absolute disgrace!,90
183,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What a performance!. Thank goodness he is sitting down. I can tell the honourable member for Moore that we have instituted a number of changes to make sure that his constituents and my constituents do get a better service when they deal with the Child Support Agency. I have detailed what we are doing as far as the telephones are concerned because they are the primary contact with the Child Support Agency. But, over and above that, in Perth we have trialled a voice messaging system. Most of the calls that come to the Child Support Agency and clog up the system are the sorts of cases that the honourable member for Moore talked about. They are usually just asking for general information; that is, how much can I expect from my child support payment this month and when is it going to come? The voice messaging system trial in Perth has undergone an independent evaluation and we are going to implement that next year. From next year we are going to free up the phones because all of those calls can be made 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to the voice messaging system. We are linking that with a pilot scheme to make sure that we can get case ownership for the really difficult cases, such as the ones the honourable member for Moore talked about. When a difficult case comes up and a client actually wants to talk to somebody personally, they will be able to do it because we will have freed up those resources. The changes that we have put in place in the Child Support Agency since the Auditor-General's report have gone a long way to making sure that the criticisms contained in the report have already been addressed. We have gone past that. Aboriginals",90
184,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs seen media reports which suggest that the Commonwealth· government should have a diminished and lesser role in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs? Does the minister share these views having regard to the 1967 referendum which conferred a broad legislative power on the Commonwealth as a result of a 92 per cent vote of the Australian people voting at that referendum?,90
185,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt and acknowledge his service to Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in that electorate. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs is an area where there has been traditionally a large measure of cross-party cooperation between the government and the opposition. I acknowledge at this point in my answer that we do have that cross-party cooperation in support of the reconciliation process, in support of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and in support of the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Having said that, I must say that I am very concerned about this morning's report in the - st Australian where the Leader of the Opposition is quoted as committing the opposition to repeal the Native Title Act should the opposition be elected to govern this country, and also to express opposition for the establishment of the national Aboriginalland fund. This is an area of public policy where potential leaders of this country I think are judged and measured by their commitment to take a stand in support of the rights of the indigenous people of this country. I say to the opposition that, in this area"" Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, there would be nothing more damaging to the process of reconciliation and more damaging to Australia's international reputation than repealing the Native Title Act. I stand with the views, of the former President of the Western Australian Liberal Party and the former Liberal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Ian Viner. He is on the public record as calling for the opposition to take a stand to support the Native Title Act. Mr Viner says, and I say, that there ought to be a recognition of human rights before states rights. Turning to the question of the proposed land fund, I was .very pleased, as was the Prime Minister, to see that when the new shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, first spoke to the media on the day following her appointment, she acknowCourt ledged, ' Mr Downer appointed me to the room, position and he is certainly aware of moderate views on the subject of the land fund.' On the public record after her appointing. ment she supported the establishment of that fund. Within 24 hours, the Leader of the Opposition had issued a directive to the shadow minister to take an about-tum and come into line in opposition to that fund.' It is no mere accident that those members of the coalition who are known to take a more progressive or moderate stand in Aboriginal affairs-such as the honourable member for for? Aston, the honourable. member for Tangney, the honourable member for Bradfield and, the front bench, the honourable member for Chisholm-are those who have been relegated either to the far back bench or to the very outer of the coalition front bench. I regret to say that what we now see from the coalition is a very hardline policy. Let me tell the House what Mr Fred Chaney, another former Liberal minister, said only one month ago: If you go back through Liberal history and look at the writings of a great conservative statesman like Sir Paul Hasluck, it is pretty clear that, within the Liberal Party, there has always been a need to show a bit of leadership and to stand up for those interests who would really give the Aboriginal people nothing. of In conclusion, I challenge the opposition to look at the Hansard of 1974. In 1974, this parliament voted unanimously to establish an Aboriginal land fund. The first speaker for the coalition was John Hyde. He was also supported by the predecessor to the now Deputy Leader of the National Party. I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: if you want to be seen as an alternative leader in this country, you must tum your back on policies that have the effect of literally tearing up the constitution and the commitment and responsibility of this parliament to enact laws to defend the human rights of indigenous people. Family Court: CoD's Harbour",90
186,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Attorney-General will be aware of the opening in Coffs Harbour tomorrow of the new sub-registry of the Family of Australia, which includes a court judges chambers, associated offices and my accommodation for counsellors-although they do not exist because. of a lack of fundGiven that the electorate of Cowper has the third lowest income level in Australia, with consequent major levels of poverty and . family breakdown and a waiting period of to nine months between pre-hearing conferences and trials, how can the Attorney justify the lack of permanent family court counselling services in a region with enormous social dislocation when high income areas such' as Canberra and other cities are well provided Will the Attorney give priority to 'providing permanent counselling services for the on mid-north coast of New South Wales? "" Mr LAVARCH-'-I am aware that, as the honourable member states, a court facility will be opening in Coffs Harbour. I welcome that development as he does.. Mr Tim Fischer-But no counselling.",91
187,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I also recognise the fact that counselling services in that area are inadequate. Coffs Harbour and the Gold Coast were identified by the courts as two priority areas for the extension of counselling services. The court rather than the government allocates the resources. Mr Nehl-They don't have enough money.,92
188,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not trying to duck the point. It is the court rather than the government that does so. Obviously the courts need adequate resources from the government. The court was able not long ago to extend services, including counselling Gold Coast. I understand that that service is operating well and is well received. I have been speaking to the court about the extension of similar services to the Coffs Harbour region. It is my hope that that can be accommodated in the near future.",92
189,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Treaties",92
190,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I wish to ask you a question about the role of parliament with regard to the signing and effect of international conventions and/or treaties. Is it a fact that this parliament has no power to prevent the signing of such conventions? Is it also a fact, as stated by a previous Attorney General in this House, that no such convention has legal effect in Australia until enabling legislation has passed this parliament? If so, are you aware of a recent judgment in an Australian court which has quoted the international rights of the child convention as a reason for disallowing a government deportation order on a convicted drug importer because the deportation would disadvantage the dealer's Australian children? What legislation has passed this House to justify the judge's decision?",92
191,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"It should be a question to me, not to Mr Speaker.",92
192,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Obviously there is an amount of detail in that question on which I will seek advice. I will probably discuss the issue with the Attorney-General over dinner this evening. Unparliamentary Language,92
193,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"During an answer to a question, the Acting Prime Minister directed the word 'hypocrisy' at the opposition. I recall some time ago that the use of the word 'hypocrite' was ruled offensive and unparliamentary by you. Could you please explain for the benefit of the House, and so we know the kind of language that you will and will not permit, whether the word 'hypocrite' and/or the word 'hypocrisy' are now accepted as services, to the unparliamentary.",92
194,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition goes to the issue generally of language but specifically to that word or a derivation thereof. Previous speakers and I, following that particular rule, have ruled that when the particular charge of hypocrite is levelled at a member it has been required to be withdrawn. Mr Costello-But you have",92
195,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Hang on. I well remember having to do that in I think 1986, but I stand to be corrected. But I have changed my ways . and learnt since then. With regard to the derivation of 'hypocrite' and the use of the term 'hypocrisy', speakers have also consistently ruled that, if it is used in a general sense without reference toa specific person, it is in order. I simply make the point again to all members of this place that the language they choose to use will, in the long run, be judged against them. I think we all have a vested interest· in trying to ensure that we are all perceived in a much better light through the language which is used.",92
196,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My recollection is that the Acting Prime Minister used the term specifically in relation to the Leader of the Opposition.",92
197,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I genuinely cannot recall the issue.,92
198,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"If you check, I think you will find he did. Therefore, it should be pari passu on all fours.",92
199,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As I have explained now, that is the way that interpretation is given. far as other words are concerned, I know that the honourable member for Ballarat has been interjecting, and did some time during the day, about this as well. I might be able to gather him some precedents from the historic Hansard database and make him acquainted with them. Mr Ronaldson-On indulgence, Mr Speak. er: when you are doing so, can you please check the interchange between the honourable member for Watson and me and the former Prime Minister in relation to the expression 'fraud and hypocrite'. When you do, you will find that the former Prime Minister called the former Leader of the Opposition a fraud and hypocrite. I then took a point of order and referred to the Prime Minister as a fraud and hypocrite. Indeed, there was no ruling from the chair at that time. When you are dealing with the matter, I would be grateful if there were a thorough investigation.",93

209,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"We might as well have a bit of consistency in this place; otherwise, it will not work. During question time, the Treasurer made a series of quite outlandish allegations about my somehow opposing foreign investment. He based these on a newspaper headline which appeared in today's As Australian Financial Review which reads 'Downer's 'no' to foreign investors'. Not only is the headline totally untrue; the remarks that were made by the Treasurer were as well. My point is that in the speech that both the Australian Financial Review and the Treasurer referred to-he has never read the speech; he just wants to make the usual Labor Party political point-it was said",93

214,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In the speech, I said this: Let me be very clear about the point I am making here. I am not criticising companies because they are foreign owned. After all, they employ many Australians and provide access to technology, finance and new goods and services. Nor do I support more formal limits on foreign investment. Foreign investment has a critically important role to play in Australia's future and it will continue. During question time the Treasurer claimed that I opposed foreign investment. That is manifestly untrue. The headline in the Financial Review is also totally wrong.

The fact is that the dispute which has given rise to the problem is between two other companies, both UK based, ABC Lines and Times Freight, the latter in receivership. I am informed by Overseas Packers and Shipping that it will only become involved when the receivers release the container in question to it to perform customs and quarantine clearances. ' NA",93
220,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! Yesterday the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) made a complaint of breach of privilege in connection with the performance of as a member. The basis of the complaint was that action had been taken to sue a Mr Ellems , fQr defamation. As I understand it, Mr Ellems had signed an affidavit which had been used by the honourable member for Kennedy and quoted by him in the House. The honourable member has argued that the testimony of Mr Ellems is vitally important to the continued performance of his work as a member and as that the action now allegedly taken against Mr Ellems interferes improperly with the honour I able member's performance of his duties as a member. The House certainly has the ability to protect members from actions which are found to amount to improper interference with the performance of their duties as members. In the present case, I must inform the House that the honourable member for Kennedy not presented the detailed information which would lead me to conclude absolutely that there is prima facie evidence of an attempt interfere improperly in the performance of duties as a member; however, I am of the opinion that there is a borderline case upon which the House would benefit from the advice of the Committee of Privileges. cordingly; I am prepared to allow precedence recently. to a motion on this matter.

222,Mr SPEAKER,PAPERS,"Order! I have received a letter from the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The increasing disparity of wealth in Australia, exemplified by the emergence of a government created underclass. call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required . by the standing orders having risen in their places",94
223,Mr RUDDOCK,PAPERS,"Berowra) (4.35 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to address this matter. I am pleased that there has are as many members on this side of the House to hear this discussion and disappointed that, in a situation in which we have seen to this increasing disparity of wealth, members his of the Australian Labor Party seem to think they should leave the House or have already done so. I particularly welcome the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) because he Achas had some things to say on this matter ' I start· by simply adverting to the fact that this government is one that has liked to parade itself as a party of social justice: It of does so on many occasions, at quite conon siderable expense to the taxpayer, by producing documents like the Social Justice Statement 1994-95, which was tabled recently. It is a continuing practice of the government to parade itself as a party of social justice, concerned about the plight of the poor, the unemployed and those who are increasingly disadvantaged in our society. The Labor Party's interest in these matters is largely a myth. The government's record on these matters is going to hang around its neck like an albatross for a long time to come. It is an albatross that comes in the form of income disparity, despite Labor's claims. There has been an increasing inequity in the distribution of earnings of full-time adult employees and it has occurred all of the time this government has been in power. In short, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. Taking into account inflation, the top 10 per cent of earners in Australia have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent since Labor took office. Over the same time, real wages for the bottom 10 per cent of earners have fallen by five per cent. It is the policies Labor Party, notwithstanding the minister's suggestion that it is some other events or circumstances, that have caused this situation. I will put some figures before the House because I think they, are important. These figures were produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and show that the lowest 10 per cent of earners in 1981-82 were earning $9,376 on average, but in 1989-90 that had fallen to $9,010. The highest income earners, the top 10 per cent, earned $61,394 in 1981-82 and in 1989"":90 earned $64,910. Nothing could more graphically demonstrate that distribution. . I do not want to rely on those figures I can necessarily or on the assertions that I make. I want to draw upon the comments of those we in whom I think the government places great Ireland store. Professor Peter Saunders is the Director of the Social Policy Research Centre at the. patient University of New South Wales. That centre is funded by the government to provide information to. anq conduct research for the go""ernment on social policy issues. Mr Ronaldsoil-They've quoted him.",94
224,Mr RUDDOCK,PAPERS,"Often favourably, but I do not know that the government would want to quote this. In 1990 Professor Saunders said: Australia is amongst the most unequal of the countries studied . . . despite many claims to the contrary. Australia's wage system, selective income tested social security system, and heavy reliance on progressive income tax have not, in fact, produced a more equal distribution of income than elsewhere. This naturally leads to the central question of why this is the case . . . one that poses a fundamental challenge for those who view Australia as an egalitarian country. Recently-it would have done the minister well if he had been there-the Parliamentary Library held a vital issues seminar for members. A number of people addressed it. Julian Disney was one and another was Professor Helen Hughes. She has worked extensively in the area of trade and development and is, I know, highly regarded by the government. In fact, former foreign minister Hayden used her report for substantial changes that he made in the way in which development fundings were of the occasioned. These comments were made on 1 June. She said: . . . we are creating an underclass but it is not an underclass of its own making it is being created by the way which we run this economy ... I do not know that you could find any more damning quote than that, but I thought the second point she made was equally interesting. She said: The second point I want to make is the Green Papers and the White Paperspapers on unemployment recently' produced by the govemmentare not about employment they are about making unemployment palatable to the community and all say is that if we follow the policies of those papers then next time we have a recession unemployment will be who knows 12-14% or perhaps if are a republic, we may be like the republic of where it is 15-16% because there is nothing in those papers that is real medicine it is as if the has .TB and the papers .are about bandages. I do not know whether anyone could produce a more damning quote than that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who is overseas at the moment, commented today about Australia. I do not know whether he addressed these matters. I suspect he did not. The Prime Minister said: The sum result of the changes in Australia has that we now see ourselves in a much larger mirror-a mirror which reflects the comparative adv;mtages . . . and the comparative shortcomings which we must rectify. In 1987 he said: Those opposite talk about poverty. What credibility have they got to talk about poverty when the single greatest generator of poverty is unemployment. I acknowledge that the figures today suggest that marginal improvements are occurring. We welcome those improvements. We do not talk this· country down. We want to see an imthe provement. But what are we improving from? After 10 years of Labor in office, is it an improvement on the situation that we left, is it an improvement on the situation that the government created? The fact is that unemlike ployment has reached unparalleled heights results under this government. If it needs to be in terms that the minister and I understand, 1981 Fred Chaney was concerned that unemThe ployment benefits might rise to something of the order of $1 billion per year. In the months to June 1993, total expenditure is now $7.5 billion a year. Mr Baldwin-That is an absolutely absurd comparison, for <;:rying out loud.",95
225,Mr RUDDOCK,PAPERS,"They are very real comparisons. There were much lower levels of unemployment under the government that left office at that time compared with situation under this government. I think everyone in this chamber knows, if you look at the figures in percentage terms or terms, that the government's record is damMinister nable. I am glad the minister· is here. The other day· he took the opportunity to answer a lack question from his own side. He is obviously sensitive to these matters. What he was trying to suggest was that the government, now sensitive to these matters with its friends in the ACTU,>is funding studies to show that if the material upon which things are judged changed-things such as. the Henderson poverty line-and if new factors such as the social wage ;are introduced, it might be able to characterise them in a·different way. The government has waxed lyrical about increases in the social wage. It is true that, if been we look at some of those factors, which were, I think, in large part initiated by the Fraser government, particularly in the area of family support, we can see the changes that have been made. The minister is not even gracious enough to acknowledge that under former governments changes were made that were worthwhile and beneficial. The fact is that . .. those changes were made. We recognise that there have been some improvements in relation to those matters. The real point that needs to be made about social wage is that it is always the second best option to increased employment prospects. The effects of the social wage increases or have been largely nullified by industrial relations constraints, tax inefficiencies and the introduced by the Labor government. The of this are sad but simple. The costs of put employing people have been rising. We as a in country are not saving or investing enough. ·speech of Helen Hughes listed the fundamentals as to why we are not creating jobs in 12 a way which would address the real question that faces this country. This government is not creating enough employment to erode the massive spectre of long-term unemployment in this country. I could go on with the figures-I have them all here-but I want to move on in the short time available to me to remind the House that the a wealth of information is now available demonstrating what has happened in this country. Honourable members perhaps do not real need to be reminded, but in 1987 Prime Hawke said that by the end of 1990 no Australian child would be living in poverty. That claim, which emphasised Labor's of credibility, also demonstrated that the poverty that children endure is a major problem that continues to face this country. A document entitled Australian Social Trends 1994 was published recentIy. It is a bit . like ministers' statements of pecuniary interis ests. They are as scarce as hens' teeth; you cannot really get hold of them. I borrowed this from a journalist, because the government did not distribute them widely. It is a telling indictment ·of the government's record. The statistics reveal that over two million AustralRaskall ians are now living well below the poverty line. Mr Ronaldson-He hasn't seen it either. Mr Baldwin interjecting",96
226,Mr RUDDOCK,PAPERS,"The minister says, 'Oh, cent that one.' The document entitled Australian Social Trends 1994 was produced by the Bureau of Statistics. It is a fundamental resource which is available to us all and one which we all ought to be aware of. The report shows that over two million Australians are now living well below the poverty line-13 per cent of households, a rise of over 14 per cent since Labor came into office. This is same Henderson poverty line that was first commissioned and developed by the Whitlam Labor government. It has long been accepted and now the government wants to put it in dispute. Mr Baldwin-Where are you quoting from?",97
227,Mr RUDDOCK,PAPERS,"I am quoting from times. Australian Social Trends 1994; The document reveals also that 44 per cent-almost half-of Australia's single parent families now live poverty. That is an appalling indictment of this government. How has the government reacted to this increase? Essentially, it tried to fudge the figures. That is what I think the minister will try to do later. He will 'We have had someone doing a special study and they have said that there are other factors that now ought to be taken into account.' These bad social statistics should not used as a way of trying to fudge the issue. They ought to be seen as the signal for the the chamber. government to change its policies to put in place the sorts of programs that will create real employment. I think the Prime Minister was right I think employment is the key. The government has, on its own record, produced record levels of unemployment. When unemgovernment. ployment figures have remained high, we have largely seen from this government the creation of programs designed to ameliorate, or, in the terms of Helen Hughes, the creation of bandages and the like. Inequity is an important question. studies have dealt with this matter. Phillip from the University of New South Wales revealed that during the period from 1979 to 1989 the taxable income share of the bottom 20 per cent· of Australian society declined from 9.1 per cent to seven per cent, whereas the taxable income of the top 20 per increased its share from 36 per cent to over 40 per cent. These are clear statistics that reveal the government's lamentable record. As I said, we will not let the government off the hook in relation to these matters. We will continue to remind the government of its failure. We will remind it that these publications and papers are no excuse. We will ensure that this record of failure is one that the hangs around its neck like an albatross. Unfortunately, it is a dead, rotting albatross, and the stench will follow the government until it leaves office. (Time expired)",97
228,Mr BALDWIN,PAPERS,"This would have to be one of the most extraordinary displays of hypocrisy we have seen in recent The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) referred to the emergence of an underclass. The reality is that the only factor in that could have led to the emergence of a genuine underclass of the kind that we see in the United States-if that term has any meanhas ing-is the policies that the opposition espoused in Fightback. Under the· oppositi.on 's say, policies people would have been thrown off benefits after nine months and forced to fend for themselves, there would have been huge cuts in social expenditure and the introduction be of highly regressive taxation changes. Mr Bilney-No wonder they're all leaving",97
229,Mr BALDWIN,PAPERS,"That is not surprising. That is the reality. Let us compare the performance of the government with that of the opposition. Let us look at the Fraser years of government compared with Labor's period of During the 1980s throughout the entire developed world there has emerged a growing disparity in earnings differentials. That is· true. This phenomenon has occurred in the· United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada and West Germany. It is a Other common phenomenon and most analysts attribute that to underlying changes in the structure of the labour market, the impact of globalisation and the fact that most developed economies and a whole range of manufacturing areas are now competing in an environment where developing countries are increasingly active, the Cold War has ended and technology has changed. It is true that we have seen changes of that kind. The relevant question to ask is: what is the impact of government policy? During this government's term in office we have made major improvements in the social security safety net, which is the primary means by which we protect people from becoming what might reasonably be described as an underclass. Let us have a look at that safety net compare our performance with that of the opposition. During the Fraser years the real level of pension for pensioner couples fell by two per cent in real terms. Under this government 'the real level of basic pension has increased 15 per cent. If we take into account enhanced rent assistance, the real rate has increased for single pensioners by 24 per cent and for couples by 31 per cent. During the Fraser years the real rate of payment to sole parents with two children in rented accommodation fell by four per cent. Under this government, with the improvements in rent assistance, basic payments and family payments, the real rate of payment has increased by 37 per cent. During the Fraser period the rate of unemployment benefit for a single unemployed person fell by 19 per cent in real terms. Under this government, with the rent assistance improvements, it is up 57 per cent. I could go on. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made reference to the fact that the Fraser government introduced the PIS payment. That is true, but it had an appallingly low take-up rate and there was no rent assistance for working families. Under this government we have upgraded and substantially improved family payments targeted to low income earners-those in the social security system and those earning low wages. The rate of additional family payment has gone up by 80 percent in real terms for children under the age of 13 and 150 per cent in real terms for children aged between 13 and 15. If we relate the incomes of people at the bottom of the earnings scale in our society to the Henderson poverty line, particularly those who are primarily dependent on the social security system, we find that all the payments have been improved substantially. In 1983 no sole parent, unemployed person or family in rented accommodation received a social security benefit above the poverty line. Now the great majority do. For example, in 1983 the payment for a sole parent with two children in rented accommodation was nine per cent below the poverty line. Now it is four per cent above the poverty line. There is simply no doubt that this governand ment has made major improvements in the adequacy of the basic social security safety net. We have moved the great bulk of people above the Henderson poverty line. People who are not totally dependent on social security are those who have some significant additional earnings and are obviously in a better position. The honourable member for Berowra opened his contribution with the claim that the poor are getting poorer. That is demonstrably untrue. It is a demonstrably true statement about the period when those opposite were in office. Under Fraser all the payments I referred· to previously were down significantly in real terms. Under this government the very reverse is the case-they are up significantly in real terms. If we are going to make these comparisons, there has to be some modicum of intellectual honesty. The honourable member for Berowra talked about the unemployment rate. It is true that dealing with unemployment is the single most important way of addressing unemployment. To the great embarrassment and consternation of the opposition, it is the case that we are showing great improvements in the employment situation at the moment. The honourable member for Berowra talked about there being some marginal improvement. If he .counts 263,000 extra jobs in the space of 13 mo.nths as a marginal improvement, then he has a very peculiar definition of that term. We are seeing a robust recovery and· it is flowing through into jobs. In addition· to creating the conditions for that to occur, we are making sure that the long-term unemployed do not get left behind. We have overhauled the social security system to remove disincentives to participation in work and disincentives to people maximising their casual or part-time work if they are in that situation or taking up a full-time opportunity if that becomes available. The job compact is designed to ensure that the long-term unemployed receive substantially increased assistance, designed to make sure that they do not get left behind as the process of economic recovery develops. TItans in stark contrast once again to the position of the coalition. Its Fightback policy would have slashed labour market program assistance which is crucial to the long-term unemployed. The evidence is absolutely clear that, without labour market program assistance, training, wage subsidies and other forms of assistance, people who have been out of work for 12 months or more have very poor prospects of finding work. If we provide that assistance it does not guarantee that they get a permanent job but their chances of . getting one are immensely increased..That is a key equity issue. With Fightback the coalition would have cut those programs to ribbons .. For those opposite to come in here and say that they are concerned to ensure that unemployment generated poverty is dealt with adequately is again utter hypocrisy. In this country, as in most developed countries, there has been some increase in earnings disparities. It has to be taken into account, however, that when talking about inequality you cannot just talk about cash earnings. You have to take into account the impact of the transfer payments provided through the social security system, the changes in the tax system and, crucially, the changes in.the social wage-things like the introdu-tion of Medicare, the great expansion in child care. and so forth. That is particularly important in· our case because over the life of this government we have had ali explicit trade-off between money wage increases and social wage provision. There has been .a slow-r than might otherwise have ,Qeen the case increase in. money wages precisely. because of the understanding through the accord that the government has with the trade union movement to raise the social wage. It is particularly misleading in that context to try to do an analysis of trends in inequality that fail to take those factors into consideration. . It is also utterly misleading in trying to achieve some international comparison to not look at all those different factors that go to make up living standards and meaningful measures of inequality. There are no international studies that bring into play all those relevant considerations I referred to, such as cash incomes, social security payments, tax changes and social wage measures. It is very difficult to make those sorts of international comparisons. However, there have been attempts to bring some of those factors to bear and they show a very different picture to the UN study that was referred to. They show that our performance is significantly better in terms of an international comparison of inequality. The UN study that the opposition will has made reference to is virtually meaningless. It is simply based on published data which is derived in quite different ways in different countries. No serious analyst would suggest that that is a reasonable way of measuring differences in inequality between countries. The impact of government policy over the course of the 1980s and early. 1990s has been to reduce that underlying drift to higher differentiations in earnings that we share in common with other developed countries. That has been the object of careful study by Professor Anne Harding and others, who have stated that the impact of our changes to the tax system and the social security system have been to significantly ameliorate and offset those changes. So that is the effect of government policy. If we are going to make comparisons between what we are proposing to do and what the coalition is proposing to do, that is obviously the only appropriate way to look at it. . - . I would like to make a few observations about coalition policy. As I said in answer to a. question the other day, it is difficult to get any se1lSible information-about what constructive policies the coalition may have in this area. Whole rainforests have been logged to produce press releases for the opposition spokesman on social security, but if one reads through them one finds that they are all carping, and in many cases quite silly, criticisms of government policy. There is an utter dearth of constructive policy proposals. So we do not know what sorts of policies the opposition spokesperson favours in this area. In talking about this matter we have to pay a bit of attention to what is coming from the opposition backbench. Some of the proposals are quite startling, like the one from the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) to ban marriage for a year. That was an interesting one in the area of family policy, but there are others. We have the Howard income splitting proposal. What effect would that have? It would mean that a family on $20,000 would have to pay $200 extra tax. A family with an income of. over $100,000 would have an income tax reduction of $7,000 a year. Mr Bitney-But that is typical of what they are on about. .",97
230,Mr BALDWIN,PAPERS,"It is; that is absolutely correct. Take the proposal from Senator Minchin, who thinks the right way to go is to aggregate all family and child-care payments, divide them up per head amongst children and distribute it on that basis. What effect would that have on a family on $20,000? It would mean that the assistance they would receive from the government would be reduced from $153 a week to $73 a week. What an equitable measure that would be! These coalition policies would really help the pattern of income distribution! Then there is the variation on that theme we had from the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), with his so-called family wage concept. .Again, there is a minor difficulty with that proposal; it would cost $7 That is a minor technical problem that somehow the opposition would manage to fudge over. But even with that level of expenditure, for a family on $20,000 with a couple of kids it would mean a reduction in their weekly income of $20 and a significant increase of $130 a week for the family earning over $100,000. This is the party that is concerned about inequality and inequity. These are the sorts of policies which are bubbling to the surface. Who knows what the opposition will eventually do? We have no clue about that. The singular feature of the opposition to date is its failure to produce anything in the way of a coherent policy that one can analyse. That is its strategyMr Bitney-And not just in that field.",100
231,Mr BALDWIN,PAPERS,"Exactly. The opposition has no constructive policies whatsoever. The totality of the thrust of opposition policy is concerned about earnings distribution, yet it wants an industrial relations framework which would substantially eliminate or severely diminish the effectiveness of the system of award protection which protects low income earners. So how can the opposition possibly talk about and be concerned about earnings? In talking about inequality you have to look at a lot more than earnings; you have to look at all those factors. I have outlined the coalition's policy. It is appalling. It is utterly farcical for coalition members to come in here professing concern about these matters. The electorate will see through their crocodile tears about inequality for the farcical hypocrisy they are. '",100
232,Mr HICKS,PAPERS,"Riverina) (5.04 p.m.)Recently we have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as he struts the world stage, once again calling into question our constitution and our institutions, not quite sure of who he is or what he is or where he stands. I am Australian and proud to be an Australian. But one thing causes me concern, and that is the sadness I feel having to get up here today in the parliament and second this motion by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). Like him, I believe that there is an emerging underclass in Australia. 112 billion. It is growing larger daily. I remember when I was a young lad growing up in Adelaide and going to school in a poor working class suburb. In the classroom was a young lad who had bright shiny boots. Down through the class it went to the point where there was a youngster who had no shoes at all. While I am talking about the situation some years ago, the sad fact is that the disparity between the rich and the poor in Australia is today growing ever larger. If the report is that the gap between the rich and poor is increasing under the Labor government, that the richest 10 per cent of the population have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent since 1983 while the bottom 10 per cent have seen theirs fall by five per cent, then I suppose the youngster who had the· shiny boots on has the Reeboks on now. But I am concerned about the youngster who had no shoes. This is the situation we face in Australia today. Whether the minister likes it or not, there is a growing underc1ass. As members of parliament we hop in a plane to come to Canberra and have a car pick us up and bring us to the parliament. When we are back in our electorates we sometimes mix with wealthy professional people and on these occasions it can be easy to forget how difficult it is for the majority to survive. Ms Crawford-Ha, hal Mr mCKS-The honourable member over there is laughing, but I am sure that we sometimes forget who we represent and what is happening out there in real Australia. I remember also that when I was a young man on a single income I had to struggle, as most of us did in my age group, to raise a family. But always we had the hope in our hearts that things were somehow going to be better. At least we could find a job. We could work hard and make things better. That is the way we wanted it to be. Today the minister was talking about the improvement in the unemployment figures. I am one person who welcomes that. In my electorate almost 200 people appear to have found jobs last month. That is wonderful, but we still should be ashamed of the disgraceful . 9.8 per cent unemployment rate that afflicts the nation. We have an outrageous foreign debt and unemployment rate. With all of these things happening around us we seem to have accepted mediocrity; we believe that we just have to accept these things. The underc1ass that has been created is causing great uncertainty for all people, and not only for those people who are there now. People are concerned even if they are working and earning a wage. Over the last several years the government has bragged that real true income for workers has reduced or stayed stable. I am one person who believes that we cannot allow salaries to stay stable. We must have an industrial relations system that allows workers to earn more money through increased productivity. Today we have an industrial relations system so tied up and antiquated that people cannot work the way they want to work to earn more money to keep their families the way they would like to. In Australia 40,000 families are expected to become homeless in 1994; 800,000 children live in homes where neither parent is employed, and 35 per cent of marriages end in divorce. It is a scandal, whichever way you look at it. We spend $3 billion a year on divorce, $2.87 billion a year on sole parent pensions, $10 million a year on youth homelessness and $1.64 billion on vandalism and property damage. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), who is at the table, says that things are great, that we have the social wage. That would be wonderful, but what we really want is to have people in jobs, earning enough money to keep their families and to live in a manner which most Australians in an advanced Western democracy should expect. What does this government do? I mentioned the industrial relations system, which holds people back from doing the things they want to do, from entering into agreements with their employers so that they can earn more money. There are simple little things that increase family costs like the price of leaded and unleaded fuel. We all know that something had to be done to reduce lead in the atmosphere, but why not reduce the price of unleaded fuel if you want to people to use more of it? But no, the government put a tax on both fuels so that those people who are lucky enough to have a car have to pay more money to get to work. Although the government pretends to be a party that represents the workers and the underprivileged, it always seems to put more costs and burdens on them. As I said before, .the government has said that real incomes have been kept low. Today I phoned around to ask different non-government welfare organisations what the situation is. They said, 'Look, we have never been busier, despite the fact that we are hearing from the government that the economy is improving and that work is being found.' One gentleman told me that his work is skyrocketing. The number of people coming to him in need of welfare and assistance is disastrous. I said to him, 'But you're not talking about people who don't want work.' He said, 'No, most of those people who come into my office genuinely . want work but they cannot find work.' He said that parents were ringing up and saying, 'Look, can we come and get some money? We've sent Johnny off to school this morning without any food, but we really want to buy him some lunch.' We are talking about Australia; we are. not talking about other countries. This is supposed to be a wealthy country. I believe that families are under siege. I heard the minister today pooh-pooh' some ideas that we in the coalition are putting forward to try to advance the welfare of families. We have not said that these are our policies, but at least we are having a go. We are putting forward different ideas. I particularly like the idea of a family wage being paid, as was put forward by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). There is no doubt about it: there is a disparity. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting' poorer. What really upsets me is that we always seem to take a bandaid approach, as the honourable member for Berowra said. We seem to be patching up. People do not want welfare. People want to be able to live indignity; to be able to earn a wage and to care for their children. They do not want to have to receive all these handouts and bandaids. They want to be able to provide for themselves. Different decisions' made by the Keating government have made the situatiori even more unfair. The government has introduced schemes, such as the home child-carealldw­ ance, thinking that it is helping people- but has disadvantaged other people,particularly those families where one parent is staying at home to raise the children. These things keep going on and on. I do not think governments really understand what they are doing when they give out all these handouts. They should study things very carefully and make sure that, by assisting one group, they are not making it more difficult for others. There is no justice in a policy which can provide $61.50 per week to a double-income household earning, say, .$300,000 per year, but which can provide only $24.50 per week to families on $40,000 with one parent at home full time caring for children.",100
233,Mr HOWARD,PAPERS,That's the Baldwin policy.,102
234,Mr HICKS,PAPERS,"Yes, that's the Baldwin policy. It is absolutely ridiculous. It is time the government looked at ways to genuinely assist families and considered ways to alter the balance with respect to families with one parent staying at home to care for children. I think that is where there is a real poverty gap. Those people who stay home to look after their children are disadvantaged. I could speak for hours about the disadvantages confronting many Australians today due to the policies of this government. Anything that we in the coalition can bring forward as a remedy to the situation must be welcomed by all Australians.",102
235,Ms CRAWFORD,PAPERS,"Forde-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development) (5.14 p.m.)-It is interesting to note that yet again the opposition is in negative mode: nothing positive could ever happen to Australia's families. We hear much-vaunted talking from those opposite about sole parent families and families without male role models. Given that the coalition parties wartt to get government off the backs of people, I simply pose the following question: what on earth would be the role of government in stopping divorce? Given the involvement of those opposite in the institutions of this country; most of which are male dominated, and given the fact that the people who walkaway from marriages in this country are predominantly males; surely those opposite can then assert their power on their it brothers to stay Jnmarriages and face up, to their responsibilities rather than having women bear the burden of child rearing, as occurs in this country. I find it somewhat ironic that the people who talk the most about families are of the same gender as those who walk away from their family responsibilities.. So I ask those opposite to consider ways in which that problem may be reasonably addressed. We heard the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) talk about a number of factors. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) talked about his old school days and so on. I know members of the opposition are always happy to hark back to what they believe were the halcyon days of the 1950s and 19608. I look back on those days too. The great bulk of us grew up in houses that had lino on the floor, a wood stove and a toilet down the back. There were no opportunities for girls to be educated. In Queensland, people did not go to high school unless they were extremely wealthy. University was out of the question, unless people won a scholarship or had very wealthy parents. Queensland had such a small number of tertiary places because nobody could afford to go to university, except for those of us who were lucky enough to win scholarships. When we look at the whole issue of Australian society and the way in which it operates, we also have to ask ourselves what income means and what it can buy. If we are going to be making comparisons with respect to income, we have to realise that income here in Australia means different things for different people. Age pensioners receive between $9,000 and $1'0,000 from the government, but some of them own their own homes and have no responsibilities for children. People earning $25,000 who perhaps are struggling to pay their mortgages and raise their children may find themselves somewhat disadvantaged as opposed to other people in the same bracket who have public housing or who have subsidised housing because of their jobs. We can also make comparisons with some of our Asian neighbours. Let us consider the wages required to live in one room in Tokyo. People have to take their' beds down each night and wrap them up in the morning. They are forced to travel for between two and four hours each way to work-morning, noon and night. A set of clothing will cost in excess of $A1,000. These comparisons become just a nonsense. We ,are in very real danger of making these kinds of comparisons when we look at questions of income. We have to look at what money will buy and what we as a society believe are important and basic imperatives. I think we aU recognise that one person unemployed is one too many. But I also say to honourable members opposite, who fail to recognise this, that the size of the work force has grown by 1112 million in the last 10 years. So we have considerably more people in work than we did 10 years ago. That is reflected in the number of women who are working, the number of young people who are working and the number of older people who are working. Generally, our work force is larger. That is a product of more people wanting to work and more people wanting to participate in the economic life of this country, and they have an entitlement to do so. What has generated part of our 9.8 per cent unemployment rate is the desire of huge sections of the community which previously were not involved in the economic life of this country to participate. The Minister for Social Security talked about the social wage. I know that members of the opposition find this very difficult to adhere to. But I say to them again that it is only a Labor government that can bring about a social wage. We have heard the views of those opposite on Medicare. But to people with families, being able to access bulkbilling doctors and health care without requiring money is enormously important. It is a system which is the envy of the world. I might digress for a moment and say that I, as a member of a parliamentary delegation and guest of the Japanese government, had to find cash money to attend what was in fact an emergency. The fact that representatives of the Australian government were there and that we had fistfuls of travellers cheques still meant nothing; access, to Japan's medical system required cash down.·· , Mr Bilney-People in Australia simply do not realise: what an excellent system we have.",102
236,Ms CRAWFORD,PAPERS,"Exactly. I do not think anybody here recognises· that. We have all heard the horror stories of people travelling the United States who have been injured have fallen ill. I think there are a number of other issues which very many Australians too often fail appreciate: our clean air and clear water; our democratic rights-the right to vote, citizenthrough ship rights and so on; family payments, as minister has outlined; and our basic social security system, which is one of the few in the world which is not insurance based. While we may deplore having children the street-and I deplore that; any child on the street is one too many-I do not think the actions by Mr Major and his conservative government, the ideological cohorts of the people opposite, in rounding up the homeless beggars in London should be emulated; should we emulate the position in the United States of America where there are three million people on the streets on anyone night. I think those kinds of comparisons, if were about to make them, are enormously important. I think another important issue that needs to be raised is access to education. change has occurred in our retention rateswe now see the vast bulk, somewhere in the region of 80 to 90 per cent, of our young people being able to stay on at school till year 12. This has been made possible by a range of family payments and Austudy payments. We also see our young people being able to take up university and TAPE courses in the tertiary sector. Forty per cent of our young people are now able to take those courses up-a huge jump from the 10 per cent it was just a generation ago. I think all of those things are indicators of the fabric of Australare Ian life. The stories we hear a.bout the demands made on emergency relief and elsewhere are horrifying and demonstrate a crisis. In a meeting that I had with some people from the Salvation Army and from the St Vincent de Paul Society the issue of codependency was raised. It is now becoming a very realproblem. We need to look at the levels of disposable income ,of many ofthose people now seeking emergency relief and ask ourselves whether codependency by the organisain tion is also at fault and whether we have not or given people the opportunity and have not . created the opportunities for them through our non-government organisations to become to more independent. Labour market programs and a whole range of family services provided neighbourhood centres, resource the centres, family resource centres and area resource centres are all part of the government's work in providing for our families and for our society. While it is interesting to hear opposition members talk about the demands on on families and the need to preserve our families, at the same time they would dismantle those kinds of structures, which they see as being simply financially based. We on this side of the House do not believe nor an underclass is being created. When we make comparisons in terms of the real issues-social wage, the rights of every Australian to health, to education, to a job, to clean air and water. and to social security payments without having been in an insurance we system-then we know and recognise that as a government we are ,about social justice and about supporting families, irrespective of what A shape they may form.

Not knowing the appropriate time to rise, I rise now and seek your direction.",105
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"The honourable member may proceed.  into the bill the right of people appearing before the Corporations and Securities Panel to legal representation. We have had lengthy debate in the Main Committee on the issue. The coalition was united in its opposition to the government's denial of the rights of fundamental natural justice to individuals who want to have legal representation. The government raised a whole load of matters about the need to streamline the Corporations and Securities Panel and the need to have it effectively deal with takeovers without lengthy delays, as had happened in cases before the panel. We support that and we understand that. But we do not understand one thing: why would the government want to seek to deny the fundamental rights that are inherent in the law to individuals who appear before the Corporations and Securities Panel? The panel has the power to deal with the rights and interests of Australian citizens, not just those appearing before it but those who are affected by the results of what it decides about shareholders and those involved with companies where takeovers may be imminent or have been announced. Therefore, the coalition sees it as important for those people to have the right to legal representation. The coalition also sees it as important in these matters which are complex in a financial sense, in a legalistic sense and in other ways that there be a right for other experts to appear before the panel on behalf of the entitled individuals. there-for example, financial analysts, stockbrokers, economists, accountants, et. cetera. In the coalition's opinion, by emasculating the right of mdividuals to have legal representation, the government is damaging legal rights in Australia. Therefore, we opposed this position and sought to move an amendment, which we have done.

242,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to draw the attention of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the House generally to an issue of concern to many of my constituents. As honourable members may be aware, the Goulburn Valley is the heart of Australia's deciduous canning fruit and tomato processing industry. Many of my constituents are employees of major fruit canning cooperativesSPC in Shepparton and Ardmona Fruit Products in Mooroopna. In addition, there are other major food processing factories in my electorate-Campbell's Soups at Lemnos, Henry Jones atKyabram, Unifoods at Tatura, Plumrose at :Echuca, and Heinz at Girgarre. The process workers of these factories are generally members of a union which has historically been known as the Food Preservers Union of Australia, which now forms part of the food and confectionery division of the Automotive, Food, Metals and Engineering Union. I wish to make a. statement concerning alleged corruption in what was formerly the Food Preservers Union of Australia. I emphasise that the alleged corruption relates to events which occurred prior to the formation of the amalgamated union-the AFMEU - and that there is no suggestion of corruption in what was formerly the Automotive, justice.' ."". Metals and Engineering Union. I will outline some serious allegations concerning an alleged criminal conspiracy between the current federal and Victorian secretary of the food and confectionery division, Mr Tom Ryan; the assistant secretary of the Victorian food and confectionary division, Ms Gail Cotton; and a convicted criminal, Mr Gavin Anderson. Mr Anderson is currently serving a six-year gaol sentence for theft, which he committed while acting as an investment adviser in Vietoria. It has been alleged that Ms Cotton invested $30,000 with Mr Anderson in 1988 and that Mr Anderson subsequently misappropriated those funds. This matter has been on the public record since late 1989, when there were newspaper and television reports of Mr Anderson's misappropriation of Ms Cotton's funds. At the time, Mr Anderson was serving as a paid investment consultant to an occupational superannuation fund, the Food Industry Superannuation Trust-FIST. That trust was established in 1987 to receive moneys paid by employers in the food· and confectionary industries for the benefit of workers who were members of the then Food Preservers Union of Australia and the then Confectionary Workers Union of Australia. Mr Ryan was at the time the general secretary of the Food Preservers Union of Australia. Mr Ryan was also the founding chairman of the Food Industry Superannuation Trust, and he continues to hold that position. It has been alleged that Mr Ryan, after discovering that Mr Anderson had misappropriated Ms Cotton's funds, made a criminal conspiracy with Mr Anderson and Ms Cotton to continue Mr Anderson's contract as a consultant to FIST without requiring Mr Anderson to carry out any work for FIST. The alleged conspiracy involved the payment of FIST members' moneys to Mr Anderson so that Mr Anderson could then pay moneys to Ms Cotton. Mr Anderson's finances were subject to the supervision of the Official Trustee from November 1990 until his gaoling in September 1993. It is alleged that, during this time, Mr Ryan arranged for Mr Anderson to be paid in cash. This allowed Mr Anderson to make false declarations of his income to the Official Trustee, concealing the income he derived from FIST. It is alleged that, during 1988 to late 1993, FIST had a policy of investing only in. government or semi-government bonds. This raises the question as to what duties, if any, Mr Anderson was paid for. It is alleged that this conspiracy allowed Mr Anderson to repay his entire debt to Ms Cotton-a sum of $30,000-before he was gaoled in 1993. It has been further alleged that Mr Anderson's contract with FIST was discharged only on the day he \yas gaoled in September 1993. It is not clear what additional payment, if any, in excess of the $30,000 allegedly paid to Ms. Cotton may have been retained by Mr Anderson. The alleged conspiracy therefore involved the defrauding of the food and confectionary workers' superannuation funds by Mr Ryan, Ms Cotton and Mr Anderson. It is further alleged that, since members of the superannuation fund concerned have been alerted to the matters detailed, Mr Ryan has attempted to cover up the alleged conspiracy. It has been alleged that the national president of the food and confectionery division, Mr Carlo Frizziero-who is the former national and Victorian secretary of the Confectionary Workers Union of Australia-together with Mr Ryan, pressured staff of the fund to keep details of payments to Mr Anderson secret. There is also another serious allegation over the fund's administration. It is alleged that FIST trustees. have made serious errors in apportioning the fund's administration costs. It is understood that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Commonwealth authority responsible for-(llme expired) International Year of the Family",106
243,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Moreton) (536 p.m.}-As you know, Mr Speaker, 1994 is the International Year of the Family, and that is a very important opportunity for all of us to focus on the value of families to our society and to individuals within each family. As part of the celebrations for the International Year of the Family, children attending primary schools in my electorate of Moreton were invited to enter an art competition on a theme related to the International Year of the Family. A suggested topic for the visual arts entry was 'why my family is important to me'. I am delighted to be able to give details of that competition and the wonderful works that were entered in it. The competition closed last week. The entries were judged and are currently on display at the· Sunnybank Plaza shopping centre, which is in my electorate. We received 421 entries in this competition from children attending primary schools in my electorate. Every entry was of an outstanding quality and showed not only a very acute understanding of the value of families and the importance of them to the children and to our society but also what talented individuals there are in the electorate of Moreton. It gives us all great hope for the future when there are so many wonderful children who have such great talent. We received entries from eight primary schools in Moreton. The art competition was divided into two categories: a junior primary, which covered years 1 to 4; and a senior primary category, which covered years 5 to 7. I received 315 entries for the junior category-years 1 to 4--Jrom Graceville State School, Macgregor State School, Mount Gravatt State School, Robertson State School, Seville Road State School, Yeronga State School, St Brendan's Parish School and St Joseph's Parish School. . I am delighted to inform you, Mr Speaker, the that the winner of the junior primary competition was Miss Bianca Watson, a year 2 student at Seville Road State School. I will be attending her school.next week to personally .present to her the prize I have donated, which is a $100 bank account with the Commonwealth Bank. Because of the cooperation that the schools involved have provided in this competition, I am also going to donate a $100 book voucher to the school of the winning student. I will be pleased to present to the principal of Seville Road State School a cheque for $100 for the purchase of books for his library. I am also pleased to tell you, Mr Speaker, that we received great cooperation from the Sunnybank Plaza shopping centre. The centre manager, Mr Mark Virine, was a judge in our competition and he donated two prizes for highly commended entries. The winner of the highly commended entry in the junior primary competition was Shelly Roots, a year 1 student at Mount Gravatt State School. She will be receiving a $25 voucher from Sunnybank Plaza shopping centre. In the senior primary competition, we received 106 entries from Graceville State School, Mount Gravatt State School, Seville Road State School, St Brendan's Parish School and St Joseph's Parish School at Corinda. Both winners of the senior primary competition came from St Joseph's Parish School at Corinda. The winner of the compe""tition was Vickie Boshammer, a year 7 student, who will receive her $100 prize from me next week. She will also receive a $100 book voucher for her school. The winner of the highly commended prize-the $25 voucher donated by Sunnybank Plaza shopping centre-is Erin Kennedy, a year 5 student at St Joseph's Parish School at Corinda. I am delighted with the quality of the entries. I want to place on record my thanks and appreciation to the teachers and parents of all of the schools and my particular congratulations to each and every one of the students responsible for the 421 entries that we received. I also mention another great initiative that has been provided by another school in my electorate. Christ the King Parish School at Graceville has sent me a wonderful little booklet which is called The family-as seen through the eyes of a child. It is a delightful book containing a whole lot of short poems and stories from each of the children from years 1 to 7 at Christ the King Parish School. I place on record my appreciation to the principal, Dick Aylward, for providing me with a copy. I have sent a copy of this booklet to the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). I am sure she will be as delighted as I am with the wonderful stories and the very insightful comments that have been made by each of the students in this booklet. Offences Against Children",107
244,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (5.41 p.m.)I am glad my friend and colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has been talking about children, because this evening I wish to raise a very serious matter on the same subject. Recently in my electorate there have been two incidents involving applicants under the jobskills program which have potentially placed children at very grave risk. In the first incident a specific request was made of the CES for a list of suitable persons to interview for a position at a kindergarten. One of the persons on the list forwarded to the organisation was a well-known paedophile with a prior conviction. In the second incident another paedophiIe applied for a position at a primary school via the CES. Not having the benefit of local knowledge, the principal concerned granted an interview. Unbeknown to the school principal, the applicant had previously been charged with various offences relating to children. Within two weeks of the interview, he had appeared in court and been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. I would like the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) to investigate this matter. I am extremely concerned about the obvious potential for extreme violence to be occasioned to children. I am also extremely concerned for the CES staff who were placed in an invidious and extraordinary position. CES staff members do not have the resources or the legal ability to ascertain the suitability or otherwise of jobskills participants to work with children. I do not know whether the best way to deal with this is a mandatory police record search for employment involving children or some other safety mechanism. Obviously there are privacy concerns related to this. It was extremely distressing for the staff the CES involved when it was brought to their attention. I find it quite extraordinary that there cannot be some mechanism put in place to protect both the children-who are of greatest importance-and the staff of the CES, who are only doing their jobs. It is through no fault of their own. The staff of the CES are doing a terrific job getting employment for people in my region. I give them every credit. But I am extremely concerned about the fact that there can be a situation where someone has been charged and has actually appeared in court for offences related to children two weeks after going for such an interview. They are matters of great concern. I hope that on his return the minister for employment will investigate them. Liquor Licences Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital",108
245,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (5.43 p.m.)There are two matters of concern that I wish to raise this evening. The first relates to the problems being experienced by Mr Kevin Morris of Thirlmere in my electorate in gaining a liquor licence for his food supermarket. I appreciate that this is essentially' a state matter. That is part of the problem. In both New South Wales and Victoria, in particular, the purchase and possession of liquor licences involves big money, in the vicinity of many tens of thousands of dollars. Mr Morris has come up against incredible bureaucratic obstacles in his efforts to have his application processed. The application has been refused, but the reasons given appear inconsistent with the granting of other licences in similar situations. Mr Morris has now been told he has to wait two years before he can re-apply. In New South Wales the process is extremely legalistic and bureaucratic, and the supply of licences is extremely limited. In other states, such as Queensland, the system is much more open and flexible. This is another example of the inefficiencies and inequities caused by having different laws in different states. We see this all the time. We cannot fail to. It is time to look at getting some uniform national laws, in the interests of both of economic efficiency and social justiceparticularly with some of the state governments that we have at the moment. I urge the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to look at this issue with a view to determining what can be done to standardise this very complex area between the states and territories. Talking of state 'governments, the other matter I want to raise concerns the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital, near Picton, in my electorate, which the Fahey government wants to close. The Queen Victoria is a state owned nursing home with 90 beds funded by the Commonwealth. At the 1990 Health Ministers Conference, a Commonwealth-state agreement was reached to provide increased Commonwealth funding for 75 per cent of beds in state owned nursing homes"" to bring them more into line with non-government nursing homes, as well as to provide more than 600 additional hostel beds for New South Wales. The state would be expected to offset the cost of the other 25 per cent of its beds against the additional Commonwealth funding, but this still represented a clear increase in Commonwealth funding for aged care services in New South Wales. The New South Wales government's outrageous response to this was to direct· its area health boards to look for possible bed closures in state owned nursing homes, like the Queen Victoria, totalling up to one-third of all beds; that is, about 850 beds. It has already had the valuer-general assess the value of the Queen Victoria hospital with a view' to its sale. Consultants have been appointed to look at the future of the Queen Victoria, including options such as privatisation. Local residents and Queen Victoria staff launched a campaign to stop the sale, and constituents have contacted my office expressing concern. The Fahey government, obviously worried about the electoral impact in one of its most marginal seats, has put a hold on any sale plans until after the state election next March. The New South Wales health minister, Ron Phillips, and the local state member came out denying that there were any plans to close the Queen Victoria and accusing the Labor Party of lies and scare tactics. If this is so, why it that I and my office are having so much trouble getting any information about the review being conducted by the south-west Sydney area health service? What does the Fahey government have to hide? This is the same government which denied emphatically that it would close the children's ward at Camden District Hospital. These were all 'Labor lies', we were told. Yet, sure enough, two weeks later, crunch-the government closed the children's ward at Camden District Hospital, which is in the middle of an area with more children under five than most areas and with half the population under the age of 20. The New South Wales health minister is the same minister who has already been censured by the Legislative. Assembly in New South Wales for his mismanagement of the New South Wales health system. It is about time  c;ame clean with their plans for the Queen Victoria hospital-and, indeed, came clean with their plans for the health system in New South Wales generally. Food Preservers Union of Australia: Alleged Corruption",109
246,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"I continue my previous contribution. It is understood that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Commonwealth authority responsible for supervising the affairs of occupational superannuation funds, has advised the trustees that this shortfall must be met either by the trustees personally or by aJevy on the fund's members. I understand that the trustees have determined to levy each member an amount of $200. It .is alleged that Ryan, as chairman of the FIST board of trustees, has directed that the FIST members' statements for the period to December 1993, which should have been sent to members. by the end of March 1994, not be posted to members until after. the union elections to be held in July and August this year. In other words, it is alleged that Ryan is withholding FIST fund members' statements, which are' required by law to have been given to them_ over two months ago, is because he is frightened that his union members will vote against him when they discover the errors he has made as chairman of their superannuation fund. I therefore ask the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to investigate these allegations and report to the House his findings, together with advice as to whether any prosecutions are to take place by the federal and/or Victorian police. I ask the Attorney-General to investigate what action, if any, may be taken to ensure that funds allegedly defrauded by Ryan, Cotton and Anderson are returned to the food and confectionary workers in my electorate and in other electorates in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. I also ask the Attorney-General to inquire into the allegation that Ryan as chairman of the FIST board has been party to a breach of the occupational superannuation act in not forwarding to FIST members their benefit statements for the period to December 1993 and to inquire whether it is true that these statements, when forwarded, will advise members that they are to be levied the amount of $200 each to cover the cost of the trustees' failure to properly administer the fund. Veterans: Mr John Robinson and Dr Joe Thorp",110
247,Ms DEAHM,ADJOURNMENT,"Macquarie) (5.49 p.m;)Tonight I draw the attention of the House to two wonderful old gentlemen-and I particularly use those words-whom I met on ANZAC Day this year, both veterans of World Wars I and II and both in their 90s. They were presented with patrons badges with clasps by the Springwood branch of the Returned Services League. The first gentleman, Mr John Robinson, enlisted for World War I in 1917 at the age of 16. He served in France and was wounded at Passchendaele. Between the wars he spent 10 years in the Australian militia. In World War II he enlisted in May 1940 and served in the Middle East at Tobruk and in Greece and Crete, where he was made a prisoner of war. In Bavaria as a prisoner of war he spent 1112 years in labouringjobs and then 2112 years in Stalag 383. He returned to Australia in 1945. Mr Robinson walks to two services every ANZAC Day; in fact, later in the day. I met up with him walking to the sunset service. I think Mr Robinson would agree that one of the crowning events in his life was, in 1990, being a member of the Australian contingent to the Gallipoli commemoration. He speaks of that with great fondness. The second gentleman I met on that day was Dr Joe Thorp, aged 98. Had he lived longer he would have been 99 in July. Sadly, he died a few weeks after ANZAC Day, but I know he would have been delighted to receive that honour in April. Dr Thorp was born in Liverpool in the UK and emigrated with his family to Tasmania as a teenager. In 1914 he returned to the UK and enlisted at the age of 18; he enlisted in a medical unit on the advice of his father, who was a general practitioner. He served in Egypt and then in France. He gave service on the ambulance train taking wounded from the Somme, Ypres and Passchendaele to Calais and hospitals in England. Between the wars he went to Sydney University and qualified in medicine and served in various places in Australia before enlisting again in World War II. He was then appointed regimental medical officer and served in Papua New Guinea. He was to have been posted to the Middle East, but the Australian troops were withdrawn prior to his departure. From 1942 to 1944 he was the commanding officer of the convalescent depot in New Guinea which was called Thorpville. In 1945 in Victoria and Western Australia, he was in charge of the convalescent depot for POWs returning home. Sadly, as I said, Dr Thorp died recently. At his funeral, the eulogy likened him to Weary Dunlop-and, of course, we know the great works of Edward 'Weary' Dunlop in the Asian theatre of war. Dr Thorp may have been in a slightly lower key position but in the same way served his comrades well both as a medical orderly in the First World War and as a practising doctor in the Second World War. He was, in fact, mentioned in dispatches twice. The president of the Springwood RSL loaned me his copy of this book, which is called Rebel Son GP and which is about Dr Thorp. I was extremely proud to have met both of these men on ANZAC Day. I think it is a great tribute to these men that they not only served and were wounded in one war but were willing to go back and serve in another. It is that kind of spirit which has made Australia the great place it is. So tonight I pay tribute to both of those gentlemen and I also send condolences to Dr Thorp's wife.

One of the things needed was some guidance applying; that is where a lot of the debate went at specifying in some detail the procedures which out in a way which is clear both to the panel before the panel. That is why we have gone I note that the amendment which the government of the regulations which set out the procedures will not be opposed by the opposition.

The next point where there is dispute, honourable member, concerns the exclusion of Some honourable members may include stockbrokers is possible but I think that in real terms lawyers or any other advisers whatsoever not proper right to have, or attending with them up on the hind legs and addressing the panel taking over the proceedings. As I read the provision-I have had this there is nothing here precluding the panel, lawyer to get up and address it on a particular benefit to the panel in resolving a particular unfettered right or entitlement of an adviser on these proceedings being matters of peer discussing the acceptability of business conduct sort. If we end up having to have legal arguments simply will have failed and we It really should be peer review, with. business to a conclusion on the acceptability, in terms practice, of particular behaviour.

We are talking largely about lawyers. or other financial analysts there. That we are talking about lawyers. This is excluding from giving people advice, which it is their at panel deliberations, but from actually getting or conducting cross-examinations-in effect, checked through the Office of General Counselat its discretion, from allowing an adviser or a matter if the panel thinks that would be of item. What we are precluding is any absolute, to address the panel. In that way we will focus review. Hopefully, we will have this panel and not legal arguments or arguments of that before the panel, it will have failed. It will not have achieved our end. people speaking to business people and coming of the market practice and good corporate that outcome, then we will' have a useful adjunct with a body which is turned into a pseudo-court defeilted the purpose, and I would be dubious . advisers, will certainly be in the room sitting them.

(2) Is she able to say (a) what the size of the waiting list is in each State and (b) how the methodologies used to calculate the waiting lists vary in each State. (3) Is she able further to say how each State administers its waiting lists with regard to the roles played by doctors and hospitals.",146
292,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) has been contracted by the Department of Human Services and Health, under 1 July 1993 31 July 1993 VIC-28,618 SA-8,775 However, the data presented in the interim report is to be interpreted with care. While the estimates for the number of patients on public hospital waiting lists have been made for Australia, the underlying data are incomplete. The question of data reliability will be addressed in the national report as the States will have agreed with the AIHW on standard definitions, collection processes and data sets. (3) Under the Medicare Agreements the States and Territories are required to provide comparable national waiting list data to the Commonwealth. However, there is a wide range of practice in the administration of waiting lists based historically on individual hospital management practices. The Commonwealth has funded a number of projects through the Hospital Access Program to assist hospitals to reform waiting list management. Most States and Territories now have policies in place that require hospitals to maintain elective surgery waiting lists that are regularly monitored and updated, acknowledging the importance of hospitals knowing the full extent of all doctors' waiting lists. In some States, it is now a matter of the Hospital Access Program to implement the development, collection and publication of accurate, comparable and timely data on waiting times across different areas and specialties. The first comprehensive national waiting list report will be published late in 1994 following the development arrangements for the provision of comparable national information with State and Territory health authorities. In March 1994 the AIHW released an interim report, using available (but inconsistent) data. The purpose of the interim report was to highlight deficiencies in current information systems and to clarify the issues where national consensus on counting rules would be necessary. (2) Yes; the AIHW interim report provides figures on both the size of the waiting lists in all States except Queensland and the methodology used to calculate these waiting lists. (Queensland does not currently collect waiting list data centrally on a regular basis). The AIHW obtained by census,· data on the numbers on waiting lists from the States on the following dates. 30 September 1993 November 1993 TAS-6,983 NSW-34,400 NT-l,683 ACT-3,530 WA-1O,138 policy for hospitals to obtain full lists from their doctors. In some States, doctors have been instrumental in the development of standard clinical urgency ratings for patients requiring elective surgery. This approach will help to shift the focus from the total numbers of patients on waiting lists to numbers of patients who are waiting inappropriately according to their clinical urgency. This will assist the Commonwealth and the States to identify and measure the real magnitude of the waiting list problem and to better target resources. Labour Market Programs (Question No. 1184)",151
