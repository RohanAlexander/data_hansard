2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that Child Endowment received by families has declined relative to average earnings so that today it is about 20 per cent of its value in 1949. The Interim Report or the Australian Government's Commission Into Poverty recommended a substantial increase in Child Endowment as a way of alleviating poverty. This report pointed out that increased Child Endowment deserved priority and would be advantageous to the community in the long run. It specifically recommended increasing child endowment from 50 cents to $1.50 for thefirstchild; from $ 1.00 cents to $2.00 for the second child; from $2.00 cents to $4.00 for the third child; from $2.25 cents to $7.00 for the fourth child; and to $8.00 for subsequent children. Your peuuoners humbly request that the Government increase Child Endowment in the September Budget. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mrs Child, Mr Clayton, Mr Mathews and Mr Staley. Petitions received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable, the Speaker, and members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of respectfully showeth: That the proposed 'free' free at all and will cost four out of five Australians more than the present scheme. That the proposed scheme is discriminatory further erosion of the civil liberties of Australian citizens, particularly working wives and That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalised medicine which will lead to gross waste and inefficiencies in medical services and will ultimately remove an individual's right to choose his/her own doctor. Your peddoners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your pedtioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ellicott, Mr MCLeay and Mr Riordan. Petitions received. Social Services To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: PETITIONS That inflauon which now besets so many countries today and in Australia is now at the rate of 14.4 per cent per annum is most seriously affecting and making life intolerable for those least able to take corrective action to maintain their position, namely, pensioners and those now retired living on fixed incomes. Child Endowment Whilst the Australian Government is giving effect to its elecuon policy of making $1.50 per week pension increases each Autumn and Spring such actions have been compbtely nullified by the stated rate of inflauon. This fact of life impels your petitioners to call on the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to: Make a cash loading of $5 per week to those pensioners who have little means other than the present inadequate pension eroded by inflation. That each Autumn and Spring the increase in social security pension payments be not less than $3 per week to ensure that within a reasonable period the Government's policy pledge to affix all pensions at 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings be achieved. In order that money may go to areas of greater need the Tapered Means Test ceilings of income and assets be frozen. To allay the concern of social security recipients as to their future when in 1975 the means test has been abolished and replaced by a National Superannuation Act that there be an assurance by the Australian Government that the said Act will provide a guaranteed rninimum income to social security recipients based on the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' Federation and that of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, namely, the payment of 30 per cent of average weekly earnings adjusted from dme to dme in accordance with figures issued by the Commonwealth Statistician and published quarterly. And your pedtioners, in duty bound, will ever pray, Australia by Mr Graham, Mr Riordan and Mr Thorburn.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge the Government (1) to grant at least SlOm immediate emergency aid to the Sahelian region of Africa and conunue to assist in the long term agricultural of the region and (2) to take a leading part in initiatives up world food and fertiliser funds at the World Food Conference in November.

To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Your petitioners believe in the principle that every Australian child, irrespective of the school he attends, is entided to economic suppon for his basic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian Government through taxation. Funher, they believe that this economic suppon should be in the form of per pupil grants which are directly related to the cost of educating an Australian child in a government school. Your petitioners believe that in addition to this basic per pupil grant additional in cases of educational disadvantage, but they believe that the appropriate instruments for reducing economic inequalities are tems which deal with with schools. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that, as an interim measure, the Government will immediately increase the current grants being made to children in non-government schools to at least SO per cent of the cost of educating children in government schools, thus enabling the non-government schools to continue to exist and fulfil their function of educating Australian children. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Clayton. Petition received.

Petition received. to alleviate the suffering of Self-Government for the Australian Capital Territory To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned residents of the Australian Capital Territory respectfully showeth: (1) That Australian citizens are already governed to an excessive extent, and to introduce machinery to provide self-government for the Australian Capital Territory would exacerbate this situation. (2) That the cost of providing self-government for the Education Australian Capital Territory will have to be borne by residents of the Australian Capital Territory, and that self-government should not be instituted without consulting by means of a referendum those who will have to bear the cost. (3) That any provision of self-government would be meaningless unless it received popular support from the residents of the Australian Capital Temtory, and the measure of the extent of this popular suppon could be best obtained by means of a referendum. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge the Government not to proceed with the introduction of self government for the Australian Capital Territory until the residents of the Australian Capital Territory are consulted, by means of a referendum, on the issue.

That any such prisoners would face great difficulty in reintegrating into society on release. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge the Prime Minister to make known publicly to the Indonesian authorities when he visits Indonesia the concern of Australians about the pUght of Indonesian poltiical prisoners. And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will every pray. by Mr Jacobi. Petition received. Industrial Solar Energy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the world's supply of fossil fuel is limited, and that research into alternative sources of energy is urgent. That nuclear energy is a source of dangerous pollution, and contains inherent threats to the very existence of mankind. That solar energy is increasingly acknowledged as a possible alternative, and deserves the type of research for which Australia's suited. That the problems of harnessing solar energy could well be solved if efforts ergy research were applied to it. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will reduce its current spending on atomic energy research, and urgently set aside sufficient funds for meaningful research into industrial solar energy, and take whatever steps may be necessary to see that this research is begun with the shortest possible delay. by Mr MCLeay. Petition received. NA Mr Georgi Ermolenko",19
3,Mr GARLAND,NOTICE OF MOTION," I give notice that, as provided by standing order 133, on the next day of sitting I will move: That the Minister for Foreign Affairs be censured and the Prime Minister call for him to resign because of his indifference or negation of human rights in Australia as exemplified by his actions in the matter relating to Georgi Ermolenko, the Russian violinist who, being an adult, while in Australia subject to the full protection of Australian law made known to the Rev. Lance Johnston, Priest of the Church of England and sub-warden of St. George's College, Crawley, of the University of Western Australia, and the Rev. Berthwick, Priest of the Church of England and Tutor in Philosophy of the University of Western Australia, and Harold John Badger, Director of the Melba Conservatorium of Music, Melbourne, his desire to stay in Australia. Whereupon the Minister 1. Knowing on Sunday II August 1974, while he, the Minister, was in Penh, that Ermolenko wished not to return to Russia, failed to take steps 2.

18,Mr GARLAND,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes . I have been misrepresented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Willesee) in the Senate. I refer to his speech in the Senate on 13 August 1974 as reported at page 847 of the Senate Hansard. The Minister was referring to a meeting that was called by him in connection with the Ermolenko to which I referred earlier when presenting my notice of motion. First, in speaking of this meeting, the Minister said: Mr Garland was not invited but he turned up and so did a between lot of other people. I received an invitation from the Perth office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at my office at 11.45 for the 12.30 meeting. Secondly, the Minister elsewhere in the debate misrepresented me by saying that I got on the bandwagon. I make it clear that I heard about this matter at 1 p.m. on Sunday, 11 August, and took no public action until 6 o'clock on the afternoon of of Tuesday, 13 August, after I had been unable to any assurance from members of the MinisDepartment that they were satisfied that Ermolenko was speaking his mind freely.

Suspension of Standing Orders Mr Snedden- I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving that this House, having been assembled, do not adjourn until a full debate",24
35,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! I ask the Leader of the Opposition to resume his seat for a moment. I think he would be aware that the Standing Wilson, 1. B. C. Orders provide that first he must get the callTellers: that is, first, he must address the Speaker seeking the call-and if he does that he will certainly be in order. I am not trying to stifle the Leader of PAIRS the Opposition. I just want to put the proceedings Corbett.J. Erwin, G. D. in order. Mr Snedden- I called to you and I understood that you called me.",24
36,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"I call the Leader of the OppoStaley, A. A. England, J. A. sition.",24
37,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES," I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving that this House, having been assembled, do not adjourn until a full debate on the economy, industrial relations and unemployment is concluded. This House has been assembled for 2 purposes, the first relating to the Trade Practices Bill and other to the Roads Grants Bill and the I National Roads Bill. Both the Roads Bills can be taken as one matter and the Trade Practices Bill It is another matter. The likelihood is that the whole proceedings on those matters can be dealt within a very short period oftime.The Government chose to call this Parliament togetherMr Nixon-At great expense.",24
38,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"As I am reminded by my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland, it was at great expense. Let us not overlook that there is great expense in calling the together. But the fact is that today, 23 the Parliament is assembled in the form of the House of Representatives and while this House is assembled, with all its members here, if is no discussion of the major matter occuthe attention of every man, woman and in Australia, it will be an abandonment an abdication of the true role of the House of Representatives. There must be a debate on these major issues. The Government should not think that it can assemble the House and then use the march of numbers to prevent question time-a n action more lacking in courage we have never seen in this House-or that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), who has remained silent and refused to give any leadership because he does not know how to, can ask that all questions be put on the notice paper to try to save embarrassment. There has not been an occasion in the memory of this House when, the House having been assembled in the monung of the first day of an ordinary sitting, there has not been a question time. It has not happened before. That the Prime Minister should take action not to allow question time merely shows that he is determined that there will be no discussion of economic matters by the Parliament. So that those who take an interest in the affairs of the Parliament may know what is happening, let me say that under the Standing Orders there is provision for a matter of public importance to be raised. The way in which a matter of public importance is raised is for the person wishing to raise it to write to the Speaker. Under the Standing Orders there is provision, after the Speaker reports to the House that a matter of public importance has been raised, for the matter then to be debated for up to 2 hours. On every occasion on which this House sits there is the opportunity for a matter of public importance to be raised. The reason for that provision in the Standing Orders is that the people who put together the Standing Orders and the people who have lived in this Parliament over the years have always recognised that if this Parliament is to represent the people the matters that are concerning the people should be debated. The matters that are concerning the people today are unemployment, industrial disputes and strikes and the lack of confidence in the community, and those were the very things which were contained in my letter to the Speaker raising a matter of public importance. The Parliament having been assembled, would have expected that the matter of public importance would have been debated. One F. would have expected that the Government would have said: 'Yes, we will answer. We will say what we think about those things'. Instead that, members of the Government Party take a coward's retreat and use their numbers to prewas vent the discussion of the matter of public importo tance. The Leader of the House (Mr Daly), who is sitting at the table, probably intends to ten us once again by saying that if we have the temerity to move for the suspension of Standing Orders in order to debate these great national issues, these things that threaten the living dard of the Australian people, he will by the march of his numbers take action against the Opposition in the Senate, where the numbers are different, then says: 'There will be debate in the national Parliament, in one of the Houses', members of the Government Party and a number of misunderstanding commentators and members of the media will say that we are obstructing. We are not obstructing. We are determined that these matters will be ventilated. If we did not do that we would be abandoning our responsibility to the Australian people, and we will not abandon our responsibility to the Australian people. We are determined that these matters should be debated. What are the facts that we find? The Treasurer of this country (Mr Crean) is a broken man. He is as broken as the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard). 'It is impossible', says a member of the Labor Party. Mr Daly- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I respectfully suggest that the Leader of the Opposition is getting a little wide of debating the question why the Standing Orders should be suspended. He is going into detail.",24
39,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The Chair has always been very flexible in these matters, but I ask the right honourable gentleman to keep to the motion and why the Standing Orders should be suspended.",25
40,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"One reason why we should have a debate on this matter is that the Treasurer is a broken man. We have not heard anything from him as to economic direction. All we have heard is that the Treasury is to be the scapegoat for the dereliction and failure of the Labor Party in Government. Meanwhile, the Treasurer says not a single word in order to state his views or to defend the Treasury. The Treasury may have its faults, but it is not to blame for what has hapone pened. What an extraordinary performance we have had from the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. Cairns). He is the only person in the Government who is speaking on matters economic. But this is his track form: A month ago he was saying of that we would face 350,000 unemployed. He was disbelieved then. A week ago he said that there no need to trade off unemployment in order contain inflation. He was applauded for that. A week later he says that there will be 150,000 to threa200,000 unemployed and that the system is to blame. The system in Australia is the democratic process, the Parliamentary process, and if that is to blame we need a debate about it here. The sysstantem is the institutions in this country and the major institution in Australia is the democraus. If tically elected Parliament. If the democratically elected Parliament comes together it should not be deprived of the opportunity of exposing what has happened and what has not happened. When the Parliament comes together it should be allowed to expose the lack of confidence in the community resulting from the conflicting statements which Ministers make. We have had statements made by the Deputy Prime Minister which conflict with other statements he has made at othertimes.We have had the Treasurer (Mr Crean) and the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) making statements in total disagreement. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) declines to say anything at all. He is unwilling to submit himself to questioning by this Parliament, by the media or by his own side. Honourable members opposite could also have asked questions at question time. The Prime Minister has said that what he will do is to take refuge in a television studio and there, in the silence of studio, surrounded only by his own people he will have the capacity to say something, edit it, do it again and rehearse it so that out will come something which he reckons will represent his views. Is that the way in which this country be run? How can people have confidence in that, when we are not being given the opportunity in this place to question and to probe? There has been a total abdication",25
41,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The right honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded?,26
42,Mr ANTHONY,NOES, I second the motion that there should be a suspension of Standing Orders to allow a full and complete bate on the economy and industrial affairs. The Opposition is making a sham of this Parliament. Government supporters-Hear ! Hear!,26
43,Mr ANTHONY,NOES,"I mean the Government is the making a sham of the Parliament. But the Government supporters are going on it will not be long before they are in opposition. They failing into complete disarray. We even wonder sometimes who is going to be the Prime Minister from day to day. This Government is making sham of Parliament. It called us back at great pense to amend 2 Bills which represent a comthat promise arrangement between the Opposition ently and the Government. A week ago the Govern the ment was saying that the Senate was acting as an obstructionist House and was frustrating the Government. Yet the Government is now honourable accepting the amendments moved in the Senate the mark. because it is not prepared to face up to the Australian people with the tactics it was pursuing to have more and more central power in Canberra. We are all gathered in this Parliament today but the Opposition is given norightto express its points of view. Question time has been dispensed with- a very rare performance in this House. The Opposition has asked for a debate on the economy and industrial affairs when the country is gripped in one of the worse economic and industrial crises ever. The nation is clamouring for leadership. The people want some indication from the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) as to what the policies of the Government are, but they are hearing nothing. All they see is the Prime Minister acting like the titular head of the nation while the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns) goes ahead and makes more and more statements each day. Obviously he is the man the with all the execuuve power while the Prime Minister is nothing more than a constitutional mark. He does not give the leadership which this country desperately needs at the moment. Yet we hear and read in the newspapers of growing is to concern and unrest, meetings being organised and fear in the hearts of people, and we wonder just where the whole situation is going to end. Inflation is running rampant, there is a shortage of goods, petrol is unavailable. Surely this is atimewhen this House ought to be given the opportunity to have a full and comprehensive debate on these matters instead of members being stifled the way they are. The 2 that the House has been brought together to consider can be handled in a matter of minutes. Why not allow the Prime Minister to make his denationwide address here in this Parliament instead of on television next week? Is he frightened of criticism? Is he frightened of counter points of view being put forward? There are counter points of view. Everybody is concerned about the statements which are emanating from President of the Australian Council of Trade way Unions and the Deputy Prime Minister. The Deputy Prime Minister talks about the system as are the cause of the Government's trouble. Of course, last week the Senate caused the trouble, and a few weeks before that it was foreign capia tal and multinational corporations. Now it is exbeing said that the system should be changed; we ought to have a socialist system. Apparthe only way to control inflation is to put whole economy into a straitjacket.",26
44,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I think the right gentleman is getting a little wide of,26
45,Mr ANTHONY,NOES,"Thes e are the reasons why we believe there ought to be a full debate. Let the Treasurer (Mr Crean) get up and put his point of view. He is not game or he is frightened that his Department will be further discredited by members of his own Government. It is a shocking state of affairs when the Treasury is being denigrated and downgraded publicly and being used as a scapegoat, as the Leader of the Opposition said, for the inadequacy and incompetence of this Government in its management of the economy. The economy is in the worse mess we have seen it in. We just do not know where this Government will finish up in its handling of the economy. A Budget will be presented in a few weeks time, but surely today would have been a wonderful time, by way of preamble to the Budget, to have a debate about how the people are feeling and for the Opposition at least to express what I believe is the majority view of the Australian people, who have just about completely lost confidence in this Government and its handling of economic and industrial matters.",27
46,Mr DALY,NOES,"Grayndler-Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House) (11.12)-This motion arises out of the failure of the Government to allow the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) to embark on a propaganda campaign earlier in the day. The matter of public importance on which debate was disallowed had all the contents of a censure motion against the Government, but it is significant that the Leader of the Opposition was not prepared to move a censure motion. I will tell the House why. Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, if the Government will give us time we will move the censure motion now.",27
47,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! Mr Snedden- MrSpeaker ,27
48,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The right honourable gentleman will resume his seat. I have warned the right honourable gentleman that he cannot just get up and burst into a speech. He must get the call from the Chair.  censure motion anyhow.,27
49,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The honourable member for Kooyong will remain quiet while I am addressing the chamber. The fact is that the right honourable gentleman got up without getting the call. He must ask for the call from the Chair. Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, I ask for the call.",27
50,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"You did not ask for the call at all; you got up and made a speech. If the right honourable gentleman wishes to get the call he must say that he is rising on a point of order or that he is seeking leave to make a statement. If he is rising on a point of order it must relate to the procedures and general practices of the House or to the Standing Orders themselves. Mr Snedden-As a point of order, I respond to the specific point made by the Leader of the House. I give notice that I will move that the Government be censured for its abandonment of the parliamentary system.",27
51,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! There is no point of order involved. If the right honourable gentleman has been misrepresented I will give him the opportunity to make a personal explanation as soon as the Minister finishes his contribution.,27
52,Mr DALY,NOES,"I advise the right honourable member that 4 days ago members were told that a meeting of the House ofRepresentatives would take place today, but only 47 Opposition members could stagger in here today. Others are not in their electorates; they are rambling around the world all over the place. Mr Donald Cameron-You are a liar. Some of them are in hospital.",27
53,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The Minister will resume his seat. I warned the honourable member for Griffith not so long ago. I have just about had him. I have given him a lot of latitude. I ask him to withdraw and apologise for his outburst. Mr Donald Cameron- Mr Speaker, in compliance with your request and out of respect to you as a person",27
54,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! There will be no qualifications. I am asking the honourable member to withdraw and apologise. Mr Donald Cameron- I withdraw, but there are men in hospital, not wandering around the world, as the honourable member for Grayndler said.",27
55,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I give the honourable gentleman his last chance to make an unqualified withdrawal. Mr Donald Cameron- I withdraw- I said that.,27
56,Mr DALY,NOES,The Labor Party had to give the Opposition 10 pairs today. For the division this morning eight of our members had to leave the House because of the absence of members of the Opposition who are condemning this Government but are not prepared to come here and debate the great issues. Mr Xatter- I rise to order. The Leader of the House is giving an entirely wrong impression. Many of our members are ill in hospital.,27
57,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! No point of order is involved.,28
58,Mr DALY,NOES,"Unti l I goaded the Leader of the Opposition, he wanted to introduce an urgency modon on which he knew there would be no division and therefore the insignificent numbers of members who followed him from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Canberra to gobble up members of the Government would not be revealed. We have given 8 live pairs to the Opposition. Two or three members of the Opposition are ill, as has been said, and several are overseas. But in the division this morning the Opposition could muster only 47 votes. Yet it claims its members are the ones who care about the economy. They know as well as I do that their motion is phony. The Leader of the Opposition now has a deathbed confession. He is writing out a motion to cenroads sure the Government. I goaded him into it. The full 47 Opposition members will stagger into this place and will show the motley collection of people who say they ought to be governing the country. Some members of the Opposition are not presemblance pared to come to the Parliament. It costs money to get them here. The Leader of the Opposition, as I said, flew in from the alligator country, alerted all and sundry and told the Press and radio people. But when he got here he found had only 47 members behind him and he was prepared to move a censure motion which he says he is now going to do. He will have a chance to do so in the Budget session. He will tell House that he is now going to move a censure motion. Even at this stage I have to write out the ideas for him. He is a real bright leader. He now scribbling out a dreadful motion to controuble demn the Government. We will shortly see whether the Opposition is able to muster up 48 a crisis. Some members of the Opposition are not in Senate. their electorates. Some of them could not be bothered to come back here to debate the great issues that the Leader of the Opposition mentogether tioned. They had 4 days to get here. One chap not here because he could not come by air. could have walked from his electorate to this place in 4 days, but he could not be bothered coming along. It is of no use for Opposition members to say they do not know why this motion is being put on. In another place those obstructionist old gentlemen on the opposite of the chamber have stopped Bills being passed. Mr Killen- I rise to order. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to rule whether a member of this House is entitled to reflect in that fashion upon the members of another chamber.",28
59,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"The Standing Orders are quite clear. It is quite correct, as the honourable member for Moreton has said, that it is not within the province of members of either House to reflect on members of either place. Mr Nixon- I take a point of order. The reason we have come back here is to debate the amendments to 2 Bills which are to be accepted by the Government and not because we are being obstructionists in the Senate.",28
60,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I call the Leader of the House.,28
61,Mr DALY,NOES,"It is a most important matter for which this House has been called together today. It deals with trade practices, national roads and grants. The Bills affect the lives and welfare of countless millions of Australians. In addition they deal with many practices that were mentioned today concerning inflation and all that goes with it. It is vital that this Parliament discuss them. In another place that obstructionist Opposition which has thrown overboard every of decency and democracy is forcing the Australian people to suffer unless we put this legislation through today. Even Senator Steele Hall-the only Liberal in the Senate-sai d that it the is 'bloody minded obstruction'. He said in the he Senate that the Opposition is endeavouring to not make it unworkable and whatever might be wrong with the economy today he put it at the doorsteps of those who support the Opposition in the another place and members of the Opposition know the reason for this. As Senator Steele Hall said: 'Australia would not function if the Senate is Opposition had its way'. That is why there is in the economy today. He went on to say: 'This blind antagonism to anything that is in government will never be the basis for a new lease of life for liberalism.' He went on to criticise the Opposition in regard to its activities in the Yet today we have called this Parliament to discuss legislation dealing with conis tracts, arrangements and understandings in He restraint of trade, monopolisation, exclusive dealings, resale price maintenance and all these kinds of things. The Leader of the Opposition, who has fallen for his own propaganda, wants to grandstand on issues which he knows have nothing to do with the debates today. We gave him side his opportunity to move his censure motion. We gave him his opportunity to do all these things. His proposition is a phoney one because many of his members have not turned up for the sitting. The Labor Party has won 2 successive elections. The people have endorsed our policies. The ALP has been resisted on every occasion by those who sit opposite and by the obstructionist people in the other place. I can understand the rumblings of discontent from the other side of the Parliament. Honourable members opposite have never accepted that they are not the government. They are a government in exile and will be for a long long time to come. They have never accepted that fact. They are trying to run the Government from another place and from that side of the chamber. They would not get a new idea if the Labor Party did not have regular elections so that they could pick up some of the ideas which we put forward. I have got the Leader of the Opposition writing out a censure motion of the Government because he could not think of it himself. Everybody knows that the Opposition is a complete rabble, is worn out and is disunited. In another place it is comprised of a lot of doddering old supporters who are holding up democracy and progress. In this place, as I look at some of the temporary occupants of seats opposite, I think it would be a good idea to have an election, whenever it might be held, in order that they might disappear into the limbo of the forgotten. Let the public never forget that on this day, when it is vital that Australia have certain legislation passed, only 47 members of the Opposition were prepared to come to Canberra to debate it. One or two are ill, but a lot of them who could have been here could not be bothered coming back from their world trips or jaunts or wherever they might be. That proves how phoney the proposition and everything associated with it are.",28

70,Mr ARMITAGE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I have sought the indulgence of the House and, in particular, of yourself, Mr Speaker, in order that there may be no misrepresentation as to the intent of my vote in the last division. When the division bells commenced to ring I was engaged in an important telephone conversation. I came into the chamber, bringing with me some work which I wanted to read over as it is work which is very vital to my constituents. Unfortunately I naturally sat in my normal seat after I had walked into the chamber. I did so without realising that the Government forces were voting no on this issue. I wish honourable members to keep in mind that I could not hear the debate and that I was speaking on the telephone when the division was called. Also, when I came into the House I was reading correspondence which vitally affects my constituents. I wish to make it clear that it was and always has been my intention to vote with the Australian Labor Party, the Government of Australia. NA Suspension of Standing Orders",30
71,The Clerk,MOTION OF CENSURE,"Notic e has been received from the Leader of the Opposition that on the next day of sitting he will move: That the Government be censured for in avoidance of the processes of debate in the House of Representatives when the country is alarmed about unemployment, industrial strikes and the vacuum in leadership, and properly expects that these issues be debated.",30
72,Mr SNEDDEN,MOTION OF CENSURE," I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the immediate debate of the notice of motion given by the Leader of the Opposition on 23 August. I move this motion because it is quite clear that the Government has taken a conscious decision that it will, in no circumstances, allow the major issues of the day to be debated in this Parliament. The Leader of the House (Mr Daly) chided me for not moving a motion of censure of the Government. What he did not know was that it was my intention progressively to expose the decision of the Government not to allow debate and that when we reached the stage which we now have reached I would move that the Government be censured for its cowardice in being unwilling to debate matters and for its gross dereliction of duty by not allowing the issues which concern the public to come up for debate. This combination of cowardice in the face of fire and the Government's dereliction of duty in not taking action to protect the Australian people is the reason why the Government should be censured. That was the next step in the procedure. Let me just recount what the procedures have been today. We assembled here at 10.30 a.m. According to Standing Orders the first item on the agenda should have been questions without notice. Mr Speaker, you called for questions without notice but, before a single question could be put, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in accordance with what he can do under Standing Orders-wha the would normally do three-quarters of an hour after the House sits-aske d that all questions be put on the notice paper. I ask the Whips, please, to have their conversation behind the Chair. Under the Standing Orders, the way in which the business of the House proceeds after questions is for the Prime Minister to ask-no t to move-that further questions be put on the notice paper. By convention that is done three-quarters of an hour after the House assembles. Today, before a single question was asked, the Prime Minister took that escape. It was a cowardly act. He wants to avoid answering questions about the differences of opinion between Ministers in his Cabinet. He wants to avoid trying to reconcile their differences. Most importantly, the Prime Minister wants to avoid being put in a position where his answers can be taken to be putting him either on the side of the Treasurer (Mr Crean) or on the side of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS). He wishes to avoid being seen to be holding the view which he does hold, if in fact he does hold a view. Nobody knows whether the Prime Minister has a view. For reasons that are apparent, I decided that the best course of action was to take advantage of the Standing Orders which provide that a matter of public importance can be called on for debate. The intention to raise a matter of public importance is notified by letter to you, Mr Speaker, and under the Standing Orders the debate on the matter can proceed for 2 hours. The practice of this House, since I was Leader of the House and made the arrangement with the then Opposition, has been that in each sitting week 2 hours will be allowed for the discussion of matters of public importance. That arrangement has subsisted since I was Leader of the House some years ago and has worked very well. There was a reasonable expectation therefore, having regard to the Standing Orders, that today we would have a 2-hour debate on the matter of public importance which I raised and which asked the Parliament to discuss the vacuum in leadership, unemployment and the lack of confidence in the community. Despite the normal practice that has existed in this Parliament over a period of time, the Leader of the House immediately stood up and moved that Government business be called on, and therefore stifled any consideration whatever of the matter of public importance which I raised. Of course, the Opposition voted against that proposal. But the march of numbers defeated us. The Opposition has been denied questiontime.It has been denied the opportunity to debate the lack of confidence in the community and unemployment which ranges in estimates by the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) and the Deputy Prime Minister from 150,000 to 200,000 people. People will be out of work; there will be social dislocation; and personal harm will be suffered by those unemployed people and their families. But we are not allowed to debate this matter or to ask the Government what it proposes to do to prevent this from happening. Are we to be asked to join those lemmings and walk over the cliff? Are the 150,000 to 200,000 people just to be abandoned? The Prime Mmister, who is now in the House, is putting suggestions to the Leader of the House. Why does he not stand up like a man and state in debateMr Lynch-He hasn't got the guts.",30
73,Mr SNEDDEN,MOTION OF CENSURE,". . . what his views are, instead of having his dummy record them?",31
74,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF CENSURE,Order! A moment ago a point of order was taken in regard to reflections made on members of another House. What I said in that respect also applies to members of this House. I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,31
75,Mr SNEDDEN,MOTION OF CENSURE,"We therefore proceeded in a proper manner. As I have said, we were denied the opportunity to ask questions and the opportunity to raise a matter of public importance. Then I moved for the suspension of Standing Orders so that this House, having been assembled, would not adjourn until there had been a full debate on economic issues, unemployment, the vacuum in leadership and so on. We voted against the Government's proposal that we proceed with the business of the House. In other words, we voted for the suspension of Standing Orders. But again the march of numbers defeated us. So we have now arrived at the stage at which I have moved a censure motion on the Government. Under the Standing Orders debate on the motion must be set down for the next sitting which will be Budget day, presumably, unless there is another panic call for a sitting of the House. My notice of motion is as follows: I give notice that at the next sitting I will move: That the Government be censured Tor its avoidance of the processes of debate in the House of Representatives when the country is alarmed about unemployment, industrial strikes and the vacuum in leadership and properly expects that these issues be debated. We have taken the next step of moving for the suspension of Standing Orders to allow that debate to proceed immediately. We have to win the vote on the suspension of Standing Orders if we are to debate this matter. Of course, we know that we cannot win the vote because the march of numbers will apply against us. The way by which the debate can proceed is for the Government to agree to the suspension of Standing Orders. It is a long-standing principle of this Parliament that when a censure motion is moved the House proceeds with that matter immediately. The Standing Orders provide that any Minister can announce that the Government accepts the censure motion and it will then take precedence over everything else until it is disposed of. The Government, through the Leader of the House when he was speaking, invited the Opposition to move a censure motion. He did it because he wanted to chide the Opposition, but the fact is that he made that invitation without knowing that I was going right through the process to develop this point. Now let us have the debate on the censure motion, or does the Government lack the courage to do so? The Leader of the House said that the Oppobecause sidon does not have the numbers here. I think that 10 members of the Opposition are not here. The reason for that is that this sitting, called debate the Trade Practices Bill and the Roads Grants Bill, need not occur today. There was need for it at all. It would not have held up government in the slightest way. It will take some time for the trade practices legislation to come into operation. The fact that the Bill was not passed today would not make one iota of Parliament, difference because the Government could have proceeded with the setting up of ments anyway. It will still be necessary for the Roads Grants Bill to wait until the Senate approves amendments which the Government unemployement intends to move in this House. So it occasions Government nothing to have this sitting. I was unwilling to call back people who had gone overseas. They had waited until the adjournment of the House to go overseas and their business while the House was not sitting. Some honourable members went into hospital to have operations while the House was not sitting, and I did not intend to get them out of hospital for this purpose. But the Government must have known that something was likely to happen beratio cause it kept its members back from overseas and out of hospital. Furthermore, it advised its members to come here on Wednesday because the Government expected a strike on What did the Government do?",31
76,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF CENSURE,Order! The right honourable able gentleman's time has expired. Is seconded?,32
77,Mr ANTHONY,MOTION OF CENSURE, I second the motion. Mr Riordan-Littl e Boy Blue!,32
78,Mr ANTHONY,MOTION OF CENSURE,"Yes, you are pretty blue you will be bluer by thetimewefinishwith you. It should not have been necessary to move this motion but the Leader of the House (Mr Daly), in his usual smart alec way, challenged the Opposition to move a censure motion. The Opposition did not want unduly to take up thetimeof the House today. It wanted to debate a matter of public importance, so that the matter could be debated publicly and so that the Parliament could be used as a safety-valve for free expression in this country. But the Opposition was criticised for even wanting to do that. Apparently it was supposed to move a censure motion. I can well imagine that the Government would feel that a censure motion might be moved against it it is in such a mess and in such disarray, because there is such a vacuum of leadership and because there is such industrial chaos in the to country, but the Opposition felt that this was not the appropriate time for a censure motion. Howno ever, as the Leader of the House wants to force the issue, we believe we ought to have a debate and we are prepared to have a debate. In a minute when the Leader of the House goes on with his normal tirade about taking up the time of this let him not accuse the Opposition, because he is responsible for this motion to the arrangesuspend Standing Orders. What chaos the country is in! We see rising at the rate of about 4,000 the a week. Even Ministers are predicting that the number is likely to rise to 200,000 or 250,000 by early next year. Unemployment is growing in country areas. Indeed, it is much worse there than in the capital cities. But of course this do Government never shows any sympathy to those people outside the metropolitan areas. Forty per cent of the population exists outside the capital cities and at the moment 52 per cent of the unemployed are in those areas. Only 26 per cent of the vacancies are in country areas. In other words the of people applying fbr jobs to the number of vacancies is about 4 to 1. This situation is deteriorating rapidly as economic circumstances in rural industries-primary , mining and seconThursday. dary-ge t very much worse.",32
79,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF CENSURE,I remind the right honourgentleman that the motion is that the Standthe motion ing Orders be suspended.,32
80,Mr ANTHONY,MOTION OF CENSURE,"Yes, Mr Speaker. I am pointing out the deteriorating situation in regard to the economy, the industrial situation and the vacuum of leadership. There is a vacuum of leadership. One would almost think that the Prime Minister was in exile at the moment. It is difficult and to find him giving any point of view. It is quite obvious that the Left has taken over this Government. Two very alarming statements have been made in the last 24 hours by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS). They have said that the present system needs changing. Apparendy one system they wish to change is the free expression of this Parliament by the use of its full debating facilities. They want to change the capitalist system, attack private enterprise and to replace it with socialism, with Government control and Government involvement. They are on the march. They are ruthless and determined. They are going to crawl right over the top of the Prime Minister to achieve their aspirations. If it drives the Prime Minister mad, well and good. He could resign if he wants; they do not care. We had the ludicrous situation today of a public announcement in the Press that the Prime Minister has no intention of resigning, yet.",32
81,Mr HUNT,MOTION OF CENSURE,Yet.,33
82,Mr ANTHONY,MOTION OF CENSURE,Yes. Next week it might be a different picture. The situation is serious. We are prepared to censure the Government. We want to have this censure motion debated immediately. I know of no time in my political career when the situation has been more dangerous or more critical than it is at the moment. One would expect a responsible government to have the courage to allow such a debate to take place.,33
83,Mr DALY,MOTION OF CENSURE,"In my view both the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) and the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) ought to be members of Actors Equity. We have heard the same old record, the same old arguments and the same old tactics. The leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country Party came to this Parliament this morning and put forward a motion which had all the semblance of a censure motion. But it was framed as an urgency motion on which there would not have been a vote, no doubt. They even sought an agreement on how many speakers there would be. The reason for that is that 14 members of the Opposition, including 4 shadow Ministers, are away. Members of the Opposition never had a thought about a censure motion until they were goaded into it earlier by me. Even then you cannot please the Leader of the Opposition. He gave notice that he would move this motion on the next day of sitting. He now says that he wants to move it today. Why does he not make up his mind? Did he want to move the motion today? Why could he not follow Standing Orders? He is trying to make the best of a bad job. As he always does, he fumbled the opportunity earlier in the day. He now comes forward with this second rate proposition seeking to air, he says, all the things that are wrong in the community. If we debated the Bills, which he said would go through in a few minutes, we would find that they have far reaching effects on the matters he has mentioned. The Bills are of tremendous importance. Why should we take the Opposition seriously when 14 of its members will not come to Canberra to fulfil their responsibilities? They are rambling around the world, in Asia and in other places, and will not front up. Why should we put up with a censure motion today when members opposite would be shown up as not having the numbers? Why, we even loaned them one of our members a while ago and they were still a mile behind. What a joke Opposition members make of a censure motion. They know they do not have the numbers here and they do not care what is happening. They are more inclined to go holidaying than anything else. It costs money to get this Parliament together, but it was called together today because the trade practices and roads legislation have far reaching effects. The Country Party growls about our bringing its members back here in order to debate roads legislation which allocates countless millions of dollars for people throughout the country areas and other districts. The Leader of the Opposition fumbled his chance earlier. As I said he would not get a bright idea unless we told him one now and again. He is staving off discussion on the Bills we are to have before us today. The Opposition in another place has altered the Trade Practices legislation in such a way as to deny the people the benefits of it. But the Government in the Senate obtained an absolute majority in the vote on that legislation. There were so many loopholes in the previous legislation that the Leader of the Opposition knew that those whom we sought to bring within the confines of our legislation would escape if it were not passed. He is making this last ditch stand under the guise of great national issues to stave off imminent defeat like the defeat he suffered at the Joint Sitting of the Parliament a few days ago. The Leader of the Opposition believes his own propaganda. When you start to believe what you write yourself, you are nearly around the bend. He thinks that all the things he is saying are right. He never wanted the Trade Practices legislation and he resents the fact that the Senate has passed it. He is trying to delay it in every way possible. He will try to keep up these tactics all day because he does not want to debate the issues contained in the Bills that have been returned to the House of Respresentatives. The Government will make him debate the Bills today. If four of his shadow Ministers will not return to Canberra for this parliamentary sitting, why should we worry? When he was making his speech on this modon, his Whip was talking to a colleague. The Leader of the Opposition had to tell his Whip to sit down and listen to his words of wisdom. If his own Whip will not listen to him, why should anybody else? We are told that it is a long standing principle that a motion of censure should always be debated immediately. We did not want to disappoint the Leader of the Opposition. He wanted to have it debated on the next day of sitting. Why should we disappoint him? But I point out that that is not always the practice. The Government lays down when these motions will be dealt with. This motion will be dealt with at the time at which the Leader of the Opposition gave notice for it to be brought on, that is, the next day ting. We are not going to let him stave off the debate today and his moment of decision and destiny, when he sees the legislation that he does not want passed-the Trade Practices legislationpassed through this Parliament. We will bring him to book today. No matter what tactics he employs today, he will not put off the Government in bringing forward the debate on these Bills. I suppose nothing has a more far-reaching effect on the community than the issues we bringing forward today. They relate to the tection of all consumers in the country and cover things such as advertising, manufacturing processes, the quaUty and quantity of goods and m a dozen and one ways will give protection the people of this country-protectio n so sadly denied because of the obstruction in another place. Let me ask members of the Australian Opposition. Country Party: Do you not want to discuss tncks national highways today? Do you not want to as discuss the expenditure of $ 1,126m over the next 3 years? Do you not want to make provision for financial assistance for the States for road contry struction and maintenance, transport planning and research? I ask them to stand up and be counted. Do they not think that such matters are important? I point out to honourable members that in another place members of the Opposition stopped the passage of this legislation. Do members of the Country Party not want to congoing struct rural arterial roads, developmental rural local roads, urban arterial roads and roads? Do members of the Country Party not think that they are important? Why should the Government put off the debate on such important matters for a phoney proposition such as that moved by the Leader of the Opposition when he never thought of it today until we suggested that his motion contained all the ingredients for the moving of a motion of censure? He was not game to move such a motion today because of the lack of numbers on the Opposition side. It is no good the Leader of the Opposition telling us that he had a second idea. He never gets a first idea, let alone a second one. So it is never any good for him to say that he was going to move such a motion today. If he thinks he is going to do this all day, he is in for a terrible shock in that respect also. I ask the Leader of the Australian Country Party: Do you not want to discuss legislation to improve road safety, legislation which benefits the city and country dwellers and which will pay particular attention to primary industry? We of sithave seen the Leader of the Australian Country Party rising in the Parliament today trying to defer consideration of these matters and talking as if he is the protector of people in the country. No wonder a former Prime Minister said that he lost the election because of the Country Party. But I take a bit of the blame off the Leader of the Country Party because the Liberal Party could have lost the election on its own without him. The situation is that these matters will be discussed in the Parliament today. Do Opposition members mean to say that they do not want to are discuss trade practices, the manipulation of proprices and the exploitation of consumers? Do they mean to say that these things are not important at this very moment? Why should the Government fall for the trick that the Leader of to the Opposition has put forward today? I direct my remarks again to the Leader of the As I say, he is up to his old stalling again. His philosophy is: Put it off as long you can; put it off even in the event of a Joint Sitting; put off legislation endorsed by the Australian people. When he knows that he is beaten, to stall, to put things off and go to court and appeal against decisions. He was stalling right up to the last available minute in regard to the 6 Bills passed at the Joint Sitting recently. Today we have seen the same old tactics and the same old approach by the Leader of the Opposition. I repeat that if the Leader of the Opposition was to move a censure motion, which everyroads, body knows that he was not, do Opposition beef members mean to say that four of his shadow Miriisters would have been away from the Parliament? They would not have been absent from the sitting of the Parliament if they took the position seriously. Also thirteen or fourteen of the Opposition members would have not been absent if that were the case. Mr Speaker, you know as well as I that the Leader of the Opposidon never even thought of moving such a motion. He just wrote out a censure modon, was not game to move it, and thought he would back out because of the lack of numbers. I say that ifit does come on today, of which I am extremely doubtful, all pairs are off and the public can see the lack of support the Leader of the Opposition has for any motion he puts up, with his members rambling around the world everywhere. The Leader of the Opposition is on an obstructive mission. Like his Senate colleagues, he likes to stop everything. That is precisely what he is doing and is going to do as long as he possibly can. We do not fall for that proposition, nor for the phoney arguments of the Country Party, the great defenders of the rural people. They do not want money for roads; millions of dollars they do not want. They want to hold it up for every possible moment. Those who sit opposite and cry about the poor people and exploitation and the economy, today do not want us to discuss trade practices; they just want to put up their phoney propositions of censure on the Government. The worse feature of this is that the Opposition came here this morning and was not prepared to move a motion of censure of the Government. If that is the case, do honourable members opposite mean to say they are going to try to stop this being debated all day by the obstructionist tactics they are going on with? The situation is, and you well know it opposite, and so does the Leader of the Opposition, that you did not have the courage today to move a censure motion on this Government because you knew it is supported by only two-thirds of your members. Mr Killen-Nonsense .",33
84,Mr DALY,MOTION OF CENSURE,"The honourable member says nonsense. He is lucky to be talking to his Leader. They have met only since they came back and the Opposition met. So what would he know about what the Leader, of the Opposition is thinking? I suggest to the people of Australia today that this Parliament has been called together for one purpose, to discuss trade practices, national roads and all that goes with them. I suggest to members opposite, if they are fair dinkum in their approach to problems, that it is nearly time they got their members to attend. They have had plenty of notice. To come forward with phoney censure motions after this Government has had to intimidate you also into taking action, and then Want to move it when you gave notice of it for another day, you really do not know where you are going at any stage. The situation therefore is that we object to this motion. We shall not support it and it will be opposed when the vote is taken.",35

TRADE PRACTICES BILL 1974",35
86,Mr ENDERBY,NOES,Canberra-Minister for before the House. Manufacturing Industry) (12.12)- I refer to the message received this morning from the Senate concerning the Trade Practices Bill. I move: That,36
87,Mr WENTWORTH,NOES,"I rise on a point of order, Speaker. I draw your attention to standing 110 which reads: A motion of which notice has been given or ment which expresses a censure of or want of confidence the Government and is accepted by a Minister as a or want of confidence motion or amendment shall, until disposed of by the House, take ness. A moment ago the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) accepted the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) as a motion of censure. He so described it.",36
88,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. I am quite aware of what standing order 110 implies. The fact is that the motion was not accepted by a Minister. I am informed by the Clerk of the House that that is so. There is no point of order involved because the motion was not accepted by a Minister. Debate interrupted. NA,36
89,Mr WENTWORTH,OBJECTION TO RULING," I move: That the ruling be dissented from. I will put the motion in writing. Mr Speaker, I have moved dissent from ruling because it seems to me that standing order 110 is perfectly clear and specific. It states: A motion of which notice has been given or an amendment which expresses a censure of or want of confidence the Government and is accepted by a Minister as a censure or want of confidence motion or amendment shall, until disposed of by the House, take precedence of all other ness. I point out to the House that the phrase 'A motion of which notice has been given' has been satisfied. A motion was moved and notice of it NA was given by the Clerk at the Table. It was accepted by a Minister- I understand that the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) is a Minister-and it was accepted as a censure or want of confidence motion. I heard him say at the table a moment ago",36
90,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. The matters being debated by the honourable member for Mackellar are of a hypothetical nature, not an actual nature, in that no such motion was moved. Only notice of a motion was given. Therefore no such motion is, or has been,",36
91,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The matter before the Chair is a motion of dissent from my ruling. The ruling I gave was similar to the point of order that has been taken, but the subject before the Chair is a Mr motion of dissent from my ruling. I call the order honourable member for Mackellar.",36
92,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"The honourable an amendmember for Corio (Mr Scholes) probably has in not been in the House long enough to understand censure the Standing Orders, but fbr his benefit I shall it is read again what standing order 110 states. It precedence of all other busisays: A motion of which nouce has been given . . . Notice has been given; it was given earlier this morning by the Clerk at the Table. I know that the honourable member for Corio is not terribly experienced in the Standing Orders, so he had better have another look at standing order 110 because it states: A motion of which notice has been given . . . The words are perfectly plain. The honourable member for Corio should refresh his memory by reading them. The motion has been accepted by a Minister. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) in fact is a Minister. Mr Kelly-You would not think so.",36
93,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"You may not think so but he is a Minister, and at the table a moment ago he described this motion as a motion of censure. He did this on more than one occasion. Furthermore, he said that it had been moved by the your Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) in answer to his challenge to move a motion of censure. Therefore it has been accepted as a motion of censure. I want to refer to the reason for the in wording of standing order 110.1 think the reason is perfectly plain. The reason for the wording is it is that there may be moved a motion which is not busiformally a motion of censure and which is not a motion of censure in form but which nevertheless implies censure, and if a Minister accepts such a motion-shal l we say a motion about turtles or something like that-as a motion of censure, it becomes a motion of censure. This has been the procedure in this House on many occasions in the past when, for example, governments have fallen when defeated in a motion for the adjournment of the House. They have accepted defeat on an adjournment motion as a motion of censure. If a Minister describes any motion as a modon of censure it becomes what in political terms is known as a hanging matter and if the Government is defeated on such a motion it is duty bound to resign. Mr Killen-The Scullin Government is an example.",36
94,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"My friend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) reminds me that the Scullin Government fell on a motion for the adjournment of the House. This is something which is quite common not only to our Parliament but to the House of Commons also. A Minister can accept any motion on any matter, however trivial, as a motion expressing censure and, if the Minister so accepts it, a government defeated on that motion is in honour bound, and I think constiutionally bound, to resign. But, if a motion expresses censure verbatim, as the motion that was before the House does, its recognition as such by a Minister in terms of standing order 110, obligates the House to dispose of it before it embarks on any other business. These words are perfectly plain. There is no doubt in my mind as to what they mean, why the standing order has been drafted in those terms and what it implies.",37
95,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I remind the honourable gentleman that I am aware of what standing order 110 implies. My ruling was that the motion was not accepted by a Minister. The honourable gentleman has to apply his motion of dissent to that ruling, and I ask him to do so.",37
96,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I am indebted to you, Mr Speaker, for focussing my mind on your ruling, but in order to make my argument clear I naturally am skirting around the periphery of what",37
97,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable gentleman has been skirting for some considerable ume. I ask him to get past the hem of the argument.,37
98,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,". . . with great prescience, you recognise as the main point of the whole thing. Did the Minister for Services and Property accept the motion as a motion of censure? The Minister described it as such. He used the words 'motion of censure'. Furthermore, the motion was moved in answer to a challenge by the Minister to move a motion of censure. It was accepted and recognised as such verbatim by the Minister at the table. On more than one occasion, as Hansard will show, he described it as a modon of censure. Mr Kelly-He will alter that.",37
99,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"He tried to alter Hansard once. I do not think he will try it again, with all due respect to my friend. I think the Minister burned hisfingersonce when trying to falsify Hansard and he will not do it again.",37
100,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I ask the honourable gentleman to keep to the motion before the Chair. The motion is one of dissent from my ruling that the Minister did not accept the censure modon.,37
101,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"He not only accepted it but also accepted it verbatim by describing it as a censure motion. The text of Hansard will show that he so described it. But it is not necessary to go to the text of Hansard in this case because the modon of censure was moved in response to the challenge which the Minister issued at the table. He said: 'Will you move a motion of censure? You do not dare to do so'; whereupon the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) did exactly that. The motion was moved in answer to a challenge. The challenge was accepted and the acceptance was recognised by the Minister, who described it as a modon of censure. As I have said- I have gone back into the history of this-it is possible for a Minister to accept a motion of censure and to describe as a censurable thing a mere trivality such as the adjournment of the House or a mere matter of procedure. If it does, then the motion becomes a motion of censure. But, when it is, verbatim, a motion of censure and when a Minister has recognised it as such, this kind of ambiguity does not arise. The conditions precedent in standing order 110 have all been satisfied. Notice has been given of intention to move a motion; it is a motion of censure verbatim; and it has been recognised as such by the Minister at the table. I do not think there is any need for me to labour the point.",37
102,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,What about the tapes? Do you think we ought to check what the Minister said?,37
103,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"It has been suggested, although I think it is perhaps unnecessary, that we should check the tapes. I do not think that this is necessary. In the past Hansard has refused the Minister's pressure to falsify the record, and I do not see why it should not do so again. I will trust Hansard. I think that the Minister has burned his fingers once and that he will not try it again, however dishonest he may or may not be. It appears to me to be unnecessary to check the Hansard tapes. The Minister has described it as a censure motion. Really, even this was not necessary because notice of the censure motion was given in answer to the Minister's own invitation which was made at the table. The case is perfectly clear.",37
104,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Is the motion seconded?,38
105,Mr STREET,PAIRS, I second the motion. This is a matter of great moment because of the state of the nation today. Mr Enderby-What has this to do with dissent from a ruling?,38
106,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"It relates to the consequences of the motion of dissent from a ruling. I draw the attention of the House to page 550 of the 'Australian Senate Practice', where a former Senate leader, Sir George Pearce, is reported to have expressed this view: When a government is challenged on a motion of censure, if the motion is bona fide and not merely put forward for the Barnard, L. H. purpose of wasting time, the government under challenge does not proceed with legislation or with major acts of administration. That is the time-honoured custom in all countries where British Parliamentary practice obtains. Mr Enderby-What did he say about wasting time?",38
107,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"I take up the Minister's interjection. Apparently he considers that the Opposition's efforts this morning to have a debate on the economy are a waste of time. The point is that we are talking now about the definition of 'acceptance', as 1 understand it, and this is related directly to your ruling, Mr Speaker. Standing order 110 states quite clearly that once a Minister accepts a motion of censure it takes precedence. Many honourable members, including myself, were in the House when the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) clearly indicated his recognition of the notice of motion given by the Leader of the Opposition as a motion of censure. So, as I understand it, what we are debating now is whether recognition of a notice of motion of censure, which was clearly done by the Leader of the House, constitutes acceptance of the motion. In view of the importance of this special sitting of the House and the opportunity it provides to have a full debate on the economy, I ask you, Sir, to reconsider your interpretation-becaus e that is what it amounts to-of whether recognition of a notice of motion, which I think everybody agrees has happened, is an acceptance of the motion. Mr Daly-Why do you not debate the big issues? What are you stalling for?",38
108,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"We want to debate the big issues. The great issue facing this country today is the state of the nation and the state of the economy. That is exactly what we want to debate. That is the whole purpose of the notice of motion which has been given by the Leader of the Opposition. All I am asking you, Sir, to do is to interpret the recognition of a notice of motion of censure as an acceptance of the motion and then, following the practices of this Parliament, to allow the debate to proceed. Motion (by Mr Daly) put: That the question be now put. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon . J. F. Cope) Ayes 55 Noes 47 Majority 8 NA Armitage, J. L. Jacobi, R. Jenkins. H. A. Beazley, K.E.

115,Mr ENDERBY,NOES," I move: That the amendments be agreed to. This Bill was first introduced into the Parliament on 27 September 1973. It has now been looked at by both Houses on many occasions. It is a most important Bill. It will, for the first time, provide Australia with an effective law dealing with restrictive trade practices. It will also provide, at the national level, long overdue protection for consumers and customers against a wide range of unfair practices. It is desirable that the legislation be brought into operation as early as practicable, particularly having regard to its relevance to inflation. As we know, that is one of the reasonsMr Ellicott-The Opposition does not oppose these amendments, if it is of any assistance to my friend.",44
116,Mr ENDERBY,NOES,I am indebted to my friend. Mr Ellicott-There is no need to make a long speech.,45
117,Mr ENDERBY,NOES,"It is not a long speech. With too many price fixing and other restrictive arrangements in this country which are working in the wrong direction as far as efforts to counter inflation are concerned, it is desirable that the legislation be brought into operation with minimum delay and that these practices be stamped out. Some of the provisions prohibiting restrictive trade practices will not become effective until 4 months after the commencement of the legislation, but price fixing arrangements will be prohibited from the outset. The Government has made it clear that i i is quite prepared to give close consideration to and, where appropriate, to accept amendments that will improve this Bill. Our objective throughout has been to obtain the best possible law because it has to be a law which is effective, yet at the sametimenot provide unnecessary problems for industry. A number of amendments were made to the Bill in the Senate. Some of these were moved by the Government, and some were moved by the that Opposition. There was a large measure of acwhich ceptance of the amendments in the Senate, the amendments leave the basic structure of the Bill intact. They largely concern refinement or further clarification of the meaning of particular provisions. The following are among the matters dealt with by the amendlegislation ments: The commencement provision is changed to provide a 4-month staging in period for the price discrimination provision and to make the prohibition of price fixing agreements effective from the date of commencement of the legissome lation. Changes are made in the restraint of provision in clause 45 in regard to the onus to borne in determining whether an agreement outside the prohibition by reason of its insigEnderby) nificant effect on competition. A new provision included in the monopolisation provision, clause 46, to assist in determining whether a corporNovember, ation is in a position substantially to control market for the purposes of that provision. A change is made in clause 76 to emphasise a stricter standard of proof, appropriate to the nature of the proceedings, and the penalty provided will operate in proceedings for pecuniary penalties. A new defence is provided in clause 85 for a natural person-bu t not for a corporationwhere the person acted honestly and reasonably and in the court's view ought fairly to be excused. A new provision-claus e 156A-is included providing for disclosure to a party, by the Commission, of documents that tend to establish the party's case. The remaining amendments are mainly of a technical or drafting nature. The amendments are acceptable to the Government, and I have moved that the Committee accept them so that the Bill can become law. I conclude my remarks by saying that I am sure that my honourable fnend will share my view that Australia has been without effective anti-restrictive trade practice legislation for a very long time, for one reason or another. Two of those reasons have been legal challenges in the courts and pressure on governments-previou s governments and this Government-by strong, powerful, vested interests. The proposals for a stronger effective law came, in modern times, as long ago as 1962 when Sir Garfield Barwick began to espouse the need for legislation of this kind. But for one reason or another it was not forthcoming. Ineffective legislation was produced in 1965. The genesis of this Bill, which we hope will become law today, was in September of last year when the original Bill was introduced by the Whitlam Labor Government. I am sure that all honourable members will agree in the fight against inflation any legislation is effective, strong and workable will play and a very important part. Some history of significance is being made today when, as we hope, matters of this Bill becomes law.",45
118,Mr ELLICOTT,NOES,"This on trade practices, when it passes into law, as it may well do later today or tomorrow, will not cure inflation. It will not have any real effect on inflation. The Opposition, in a constructive way, either will agree to or will not oppose of the amendments which are before the trade Committee. The fact is that the Government be brought in this legislation last September, as the is Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr has said. At thattimethe Government is forced this legislation through the House. The legislation then came before this House early in and at that time it was again sought a to bring reason to bear on the Government so that the legislauon might be considered in a reasonable atmosphere. Unfortunately, that was not to be and finally the legislauon was forced through this House. We know that the history is that by April this year it was brought back and introduced into the Senate. We know that on that occasion it came back with some 110 amendments and that those 110 or perhaps more amendments were the result of consideration of the Bill by the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) in the light of matters brought up by the Opposition. When this Bill came before the House again in July it was debated and we suggested again quite a number of amendments. There are 24 amendments before this House today and, of those, some 18 or 19 were proposed in this House and opposed by the Government at the time. The Bill then went to the Senate, it was debated, and the Government then accepted those amendments. Two or three amendments, particularly those relating to clause 76 of the Bill, cause the Opposition some concern. It will appear to honourable members if they look at the Bill that that provision relates to the onus of proof in proceedings brought by the Government to recover penalties. Those penalties can amount to up to $250,000. The Opposition took the view, and still takes the view, that it is fair enough that in such proceedings there be proof beyond reasonable doubt of any particular breach. The Government resisted that and finally was forced to amend clause 76 in such a way as to require strict proof. By that we understand the Government to mean proof beyond reasonable doubt. Apparently the Government still wishes this question to remain in a state of doubt so that the courts will have to consider it. In other words, although the Government appears to agree with us in principle it insists on a clause which will not clarify the matter at all. We will not oppose those particular provisions. As to the others, we will agree with them. The particular ones to which I refer are those numbered 14, 15 and 16. The Minister has referred to the fact that we have had trade practices legislauon for some time. We on this side of the house do not agree that that legislation has not been effective. One has only to read the reports of the Commissioner of Trade Practices to realise what effect it has had. Indeed many of the pricing agreements in includes this country have already been brought and the fact is that, due to that, this proposed Act, when it comes into force, will have little effect on inflation and prices. The fact is that those in industry who have price fixing agreements have adjusted under the old Act. I draw the attention of honourable members to the report of the Commissioner of Trade practices which was tabled in this House in July this year. There has up to date been effective legislation. There have been constitutional challenges-the y were necessary-and , may I remind the Minister, they were undertaken by the previous Government. It was the previous Government that established before the High Court the wide powers under the corporations power in relation to trade practices. If it had not been for the fact that the previous Government persisted with the validity of that legislation and made it the basis of the Resale Price Maintenance Act, this Government would now beflounderingin a constitutional bog instead of being in a position where it can go ahead with the feeling that this legislation has a great deal of constitutional validity behind it. We will support the amendments other than those numbered 14,15 and 16. As to those, we will not oppose them. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. NATIONAL ROADS BILL 1974 Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Motion (by Mr Charles Jones) agreed to: That the amendments be taken into consideration in the Committee of the Whole forthwith. In Committee Consideration of Senate's amendments. Clause 4. (3) The Minister may declare a road in a State that facilitates, or a proposed road in a State, that would, if constructed, facilitate trade and commerce, or the development of trade and commerce, with other countries to be an expon road for the purposes of this Act, and may revoke or vary such declaration. (4) The Minister may declare a road in a State that facilitates, or a proposed road in a State that would, if constructed, facilitate, trade and commerce, or the development of trade and commerce, among the States to be a major commercial road for the purposes of this Act, and may revoke or vary such a declarauon. Clause 6. (6) The Minister shall not approve a program that a project by way of the construcuon or maintenance to heel of a pan of a national road(a) in the pans of the States of New South Wales and Victoria that constitute the Albury-Wodonga Area for the purposes of the Albury-Wodonga Area Development Agreement a copy of which is set out in the Schedule to the Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1974; or (b) in a place declared by the Minister of State for Urban and Regional Development, with the concurrence of the Minister, to be this Act, Unless the Minister of State for Urban and Regional Development or an officer authorised by the Minister has concurred in the inclusion of the project in the program. Senate's amendment No. 1 In clause 4, sub-clause (3), after 'may', insen 'enter into an agreement with a State to'. Senate's amendment No. 2In clause 4, sub-clause (4), after 'may' insen 'enter into an agreement with a State to'. Senate's amendment No. 3In clause 6, sub-clause (6), leave out paragraph (b), Senate's amendment No. 4In clause 6, sub-clause (6), leave out 'or an officer authorised by that Minister'.",45
119,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES," I move: That amendments Nos 1 and 2 be disagreed to. It will be recalled by honourable members that I introduced the National Roads Bill 1974 into the House of Representatives on 18 July of this year. Although the Bill was passed by the House of Representatives, 4 amendments were subsequently made to it in another place. In the interests of furthering the passage of this important legislation through the Parliament the Government is prepared to accept 2 of those amendments. I shall address myself to them at a later stage. However, the Government is not prepared to accept the first 2 amendments, which relate to the power of the Minister for Transport to declare a road an export road or a major commercial road. The amendments are to sub-clause (3) of clause 4 and to sub-clause (4) of clause 4. Those amendments, if accepted, would have the effect of requiring the Minister to obtain the agreement of a State before declaring 'export' or 'major commercial' roads. Honourable members will know from a readposals ing of the Bill that an export road is one which facilitates trade and commerce or the development ment of trade and commerce with other counwill place tries and that a major commercial road is one state which facilitates trade and commerce or the roafls development of trade and commerce among the accepted, States. As I understand it, the reason for these proposed amendments is because, unlike national highways which are substandally roads connecting capital cities, export and major commercial roads are usually interstate roads. Surely this reasoning does not go to the heart of matter. The Government is providing 100 per cent of thefinancefor these roads-the Opposition is not a growth centre for the purposes of disputing this-becaus e it believes they are truly of a national character. Of course they are geographically located within each State, but surely the important consideration here relates to their purpose and not where they happen to be located. We are all familiar with the great need that exists for the development of these types of roads. Anyone who has travelled from the city to Sydney airport, particularly in the peak hours, will only too readily recognise the congestion that exists there. Roads to ports in many of our cities are similarly congested and thus contribute to the delay in loading and clearing cargo in these areas. In the second reading speech I made when I first introduced the National Roads Bill into the House of Representatives I indicated the general outline of the routes which the Government intended to designate as national highways. 1 did not, however, do that for export or major commercial roads. That is because the Government will, in fact, be consulting with the State governments on the most suitable roads for declarauon. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has already written to the then Acting Premier of New South Wales, Sir Charles Cutler, in this respect, seeking his co-operation with regard to discussions between Australian Government Ministers and New South Wales Government Ministers on the possibility of some of the Botany Bay access roads falling within the export road category, thereby making them eligible for the whole cost of their construction and maintenance to be borne by the Australian Government. If I may, Mr Chairman, I would like to quote the final paragraph of a letter written on 5 June by the Prime Minister to Sir Charles Cutler, the then Acting Premier of New South Wales. The letter deals with things other than roads. In it the Prime Minister said: I also understand that Dr Neilson's repon includes profor accessroadsto Botany Bay. As was indicated in February when the Queen opened Parliament, the Governwill be bringing forward a new road program which emphasis on national highways, including interhighways and expon roads. Perhaps our Ministers cou d discuss the possibility of some of the Botany Bay access falling into the expon road category. If they were this would then make them eligible for their whole cost to be borne by the Australian Government.",47
120,Unknown,NOES,Sitting suspended from 1.1 to 2.15 p.m.,47
121,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,"Mr Chairman, before lunch I was outlining the leasons why the the Government is unable to accept Senate amendments Nos. 1 and 2. Soon after the Premiers Conference, highway commissioners were invited to Canberra to hear an outline of the new arrangements. Bilateral discussions then commenced immediately with each of the State highway authorities to discuss individual aspects of the new proposals. At these meetings State officers were asked for suggestions on individual roads which might be declared as export roads and major commercial roads under the proposed legislation. They have since made suggestions to my officers on these matters. Officers of the Department of Urban and Regional Development and my Department have had discussions with officers and local government representatives in all States on the development of urban local roads programs as follows: New South Wales, 29 July 1974; Victoria, 15 August 1974; Queensland, 16 August 1974; South Australia, 25 July 1974; Western Australia, 26 July 1974; and Tasmania, 14 August 1974.1 think it is important that we take note of the fact that discussions also have been held with Queensland officers over differences of opinion on the alignment of the national highway between Marlborough and Sarina in Queensland which is properly known as the Bruce Highway. On this occasion I came down on the side of the Queensland Government's request. My colleague the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) put a very strong point of view. I was able to assist him on that. All of these consultations only go to prove that I am no czar, as was suggested on a previous occasion. I would prefer to be called the FuehrerMr Nixon-What was that?",47
122,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,"Fuehrer. It is easier to pronounce. But, all jokes aside, whilst there have been many claims from the States that the Australian Government is centralist, this is patently not true because the things we are doing are a clear indication that we are prepared to negotiate, to talk and to have discussions with the States. We have already done that. Many of these things such as conferences and discussions were undertaken long before the Senate made its amendments. I believe that this is a clear cut case of misunderstanding and probably misinterpretation of how far we wanted to go. Under the 1969 Commonwealth Aid Roads Act the definition of'urban arterial road' reads as follows: 'Urban arterial road' means a road or a proposed road in an urban area that is for the time being declared by ister to be an urban arterial road, or an urban sub-arterial road, for the purposes of this Act. Similarly the definition of 'rural arterial road' reads: 'Rural arterial road' means a rural road that is for the time being declared by the Minister to be a rural arterial road for the purposes of this Act. The Minister referred to is me. These definitions were not written into the Act by me. They were written into the Act by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon), the former and last Minister for Shipping and Transport. Mr Nixon- I am a co-operative type. They know I can co-operate with them. They do not believe you.",48
123,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,"They are disbelieving souls. In fact, I believe that these definitions were written in by the honourable member's predecessor, the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Sinclair). So all we did in drafting the Bill was to write in those things which were in previous pieces of legislation which have been acceptable to the States and which have been workable. Therefore, we thought that this was the easy way out of the situation. In the Government's view there is no difference in principle between the declaration of an 'export' road, or a 'major commercial' road and those which the Minister was able to declare without the States' agreement when the Opposition was in power. In summary the position is this: The Government believes 'export' and 'major commercial' roads are important in the national interest. In anticipation of the passing of the legislation we have already sought the views of the States on possible declarations of roads under these categories. All we ask is that the declaration of these roads be on the same basis as other roads already included in this Bill, that is national highways, roads covered by the Roads Grants Bill and the position under the 1969 Commonwealth Aid Roads Act.",48
124,Mr NIXON,NOES,"The Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) said that he prefers to be referred to as a Fuehrer rather than a Czar. Be that as it may, it seems to me that he is like Napoleon because he has just made the greatest retreat since Napoleon retreated from Moscow. The fact is that he has backed right away from the position he took. He went out on a limb but then produced an axe to chop that limb off. As a result he fell crashing to the ground. The Fuehrer across the table is just like the last Fuehrer of history, Adolf Hitler. The analogy can be drawn that whereas Hitler was attacked the Minby bombs in his underground shelter, the Minister at the table has been bombed by telegrams from the States and from local government authorities telling him that they did not like the legislation. Under the weight and fusillade of telegrams and protests from local government associations around Australia- I might say that this was well organised by those associations and my congratulations go to them-the Minister, like his predecessor the Fuehrer of Germany, crumbled. This is the first reason we are back here today. The second reason we are back here today is that the so-called obstructionist Senate, about which the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) was so pleased to talk earlier, has done its job by democracy, the nation, the State governments and local government bodies throughout Australia. Local government bodies ought to recognise now, if they had not done so before, just how important it is that the Senate be as it is and not controlled by the Labor centralists and socialists of this nation who are trying to destroy our democratic system through a process of anarchy. With those few preambles, let me come back to the legislation. I was delighted that the State governments responded as vigorously as they did to the legislation. The Ministers for Transport in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland let the Minister know exactly what they thought of the legislation. I was disappointed that the South Australian Minister did not join the band. However, I quote some words of the South Australian Minister who said: If you think that we are going to let you tell us how much money we have to raise and how we are to spend it even down to local government level you had better have another . . . I delete the expletivethink about it. I tell you straight Charlie this is not on. Those very famous words with all the expletives deleted-and there is a page and a bit of what was said-cam e from the South Australian Minand ister. This was part of a very public telephone conversation between the Minister for Transport and the South Australian Minister. The Minister guarantees for Transport was told in the bar of Parliament House-and about 8 witnesses were presentMinister's exactly what the South Australian Minister thought about him and his legislation. The point is that the position taken by the Opposition Senate following the position taken by the sition in the House of Representatives is ported not only by so-called conservatives tories around Australia but by the radical Labor Minister for Transport in South Australia. If the Minister would like the conversation to be porated in Hansard I will seek leave for that be done. There are quite a few expletives deand leted. There was '(Expletive deleted) drongo, (expletive deleted) this'-al l referring to Minister. It just shows that, away from this ivory tower, the people of Australia recognise that the Senate did its proper job. The Senate did it with this Bill just as it did with the Trade Practices Bill. The proof of that is that the Minister has accepted the amendments.",48
125,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,Order! I draw attention to the fact that the motion is: That the amendments be disagreed to.,49
126,Mr NIXON,NOES,"That is right. We accept the position that the Minister has adopted on this motion. The Opposition will not oppose the Minister's suggestion that we disagree with those amendments. That is a different position from the one we took in the first place because since then the Minister has fully explained the details of the Bill. The whole position would not have arisen if in his second reading speech the Minister had explained exactly what the clauses were all about. If one turns to the Minister's second reading speech one will see that it is a poltiical speech, loaded with political dynamite-perhap s ' bull dust' is a better expression, if I may use such an unparliamentary expression. The fact is that, had the Minister come in here with a straight declaration, an exposition or explanation of what each of the clauses meant, we would never have reached this position. Clause 4 sub-clauses (3) and (4) commence as follows: The Minister may declare a road in a State that facilitates, or a proposed road in a State, that would, if constructed, facilitate trade and commerceThe Opposition sought to include the words 'enter into an agreement with a State to' after the words 'the Minister may'. My advice-this did not come from the Minister's second reading speech-is that the criteria on which a road would be declared are laid down in the clause therefore a State is now in a position to challenge should the Minister go in, willy-nilly, declaring roads throughout Australia with no to the States. So the States are left in a much stronger position than was explained in the second reading speech. Therefore the Opposition does not oppose the amendment.",49
127,Mr UREN,NOES,"The Committee Oppois debating a message from the Senate which supseeks certain amendments to the Australian and Government's National Roads Bill. I believe that this Government is making a genuine effort to meet the views of the Opposition as expressed incorin the amendments sought by the Senate. The to Government is prepared to make concessions to compromise in an effort to get the funds allocated by these BUls to the States, the shires the and the councUs. The Government does not want to see this legislauon-and therefore the provision of funds-delaye d or jammed any longer in this Parliament. Mr Nixon-What is this?",49
128,Mr UREN,NOES,This is a genuine approach. We have been responsible in our approach and as responsible men we want to see the immediate flow of funds to the States for urgent road works and we ask those reasonable men on the Opposition side to have the same spirit. Mr Nixon- I just agreed to the motion. Why are you making a speech? Let us get on with the business. We have agreed to it.,50
129,Mr UREN,NOES,"I am pleased about that. All right, let us get on with the business. Is the honourable member for Parramatta intending to rise? Mr Ruddock-No .",50
130,Mr UREN,NOES,"If an Opposition member does not rise, the Government agrees not to speak either. I just want to join with my colleague and stress one thing. This is an important step that we are making. The control and administration of programs for inner city freeway systems and all other freeways that must be judged on their merits under the urban arterial roads programs are no differentMr Nixon-We are on the National Roads Bill.",50
131,Mr UREN,NOES,"Well, the principle here is that",50
132,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,The question is: That the amendments be disagreed to.,50
133,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES, I just want to say in ple of words that I have been misrepresented.,50
134,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,Would the Minister like to made a personal explanation.,50
135,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,"No, I do not claim that right. As to the alleged conversation between Mr Virgo and me, I have no recollection of the alleged words being uttered.",50
136,Mr YOUNG,NOES,I can assure you Mr Virgo would not use those words. I have known him for a number of years,50
137,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his interjection. Mr Snedden-What did you say to Al Grassby?,50
138,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,What did I say to Al Grassby? You said it was Patterson. Mr Snedden-But it was you.,50
139,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,"No, you said it was Patterson. Mr Snedden-But it was you.",50
140,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,"The facts are that there was a discussion one night- I do not know which night. It was between Geoff Virgo and me. We are very good friends. We were very good friends and we are very good friends. I do not think it is right for somebody to eavesdrop on a conversation in a parliamentary bar and then to record it in some way or another. I thought that what went on in parliamentary bars was the prerogative of the people who frequented them. I wish to clear up one point. We are seeking to co-operate with the States. What I am putting forward to this House today is no different from what was put forward in a prepared statement which was read on my behalf in the Senate. That statement set out in this term what we proposed to do. I believe that the Senate said it was prepared to accept my word of what I would do but it did not know who the Minister would be at some later stage. So, we have put our proposals into legislative form. Amendments Nos 1 and 2 disagreed to.",50
141,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES," I move: That Senate amendments Nos 3 and 4 be agreed to. Sub-clause 6 as originally drafted provided for the Minister to seek the concurrence of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development in respect of road works in the growth centre of Albury-Wodonga and such other places as were jointly declared for the purpose of this Act. The a couSenate's amendment has had the effect of precluding any future growth centres being declared along with Albury-Wodonga. Senate amendment No. 4 precludes the Minister for Urban and Regional Development delegating to an officer his power to concur in the approval of such road projects. Whilst the clause as originally drafted was a logical approach to the question of future growth centres and the delegation of the concurrence power, my colleague, Mr Uren, has agreed with me that we should not let the omission of these provisions stand in the way of bringing the legislation into operation as quickly as possible. It is in this spirit that we accept these amendments.",50
142,Mr NIXON,NOES,"I am delighted that the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) has seen fit to accept this amendment that I moved originally in the House and which the Senate agreed to. I am concerned to hear the Minister say that this precludes any future growth centre being declared. I find that an extraordinary statement. I do not believe it. If the Australian Government is going to try to pretend that clause 6 (b) will preclude the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, who has his own consututional authority and power, from declaring a region fit to be a growth centre, I think we have reached the highest point of plain ridiculousness that I have ever heard. I do not believe the Act in any way derogates the power of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. I think it is nonsense for the Minister to try to pretend it does. Do not tell me that the administrative arrangements of this Government are so confused that it cannot even sort itself out. That was the point in moving the amendment in the first place. I am pleased the Senate once again agreed to the amendment because otherwise the States would find themselves in an extraordinary possaid ition of not knowing who is king of the roads result of legislation going through this House. The Czar has been routed. Now he is crying poor mouth and saying we are blocking Government legislation. It is absolute nonsense to pretend this will stop future declaration of growth centres throughout Australia or the building of roads associated with them. The Government can lation. make its own simple administrative arrangelegislation ments as previous governments have done historically down through the years. I am pleased that the Senate has again proved its real worth the nation by instituting these hope that the people of Australia know exactly what it does.",50
143,Mr UREN,NOES," Mr Chairman, I wish to clarify the situation. The determination of future growth centres will be a joint decision by the responsible Ministers in the respective States and by me as Federal Minister for Urban and Regional Development. So there will not be any problem in that regard. Mr Nixon-Infor m your colleague of that.",51
144,Mr UREN,NOES,"The Minister for Transport (Mr Jones) will clarify his position. There will consultative role with the States and I have my position clear in this regard. There may some technical details to be sorted out. The ministrative arrangements within the Australian Parliament and with regard to the Australian Government are clear on our side. The Minister for Transport and myself, together with our partments, work in very close co-operation, unition like what was probably the chauvinism that existed under the previous Government. The situation that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) forgets is that there has been a revolution in urban and regional affairs. Nothing was done in that field by the former Government for 23 years. We believe that you cannot deal with matters of transport, housing and land use without taking into account their inter-relationship and inter-connection. That is why the Minister for the Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass), the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson), the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development in our Government, and their departments, have worked particularly closely together. I want to remind the honourable member for Gippsland, who was the Minister for Shipping and Transport in the previous Government, of what Mr Jones, the present Minister for Transport, stated on this matter during the last discussion at the Committee stage. He that when Ministers in the previous Governas a ment produced legislation, including measures relating to beef roads, they permitted concurrence. Of course, our predecessors had no policy on urban and regional affairs. Therefore, they that would not want any such legislation, could not understand any such legislation or any reasonable position when we introduced such legisBut we will not delay the passage of this just because the role I was to play has been deleted from it. As Ministers, we have agreed to work together as a team and we have to our guidelines set down. We are not unhappy at amendments. I all with our position.",51
145,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES," Mr Chairman, I wish to repeat what I said earlier when I stated that the Government was prepared to accept the amendments that the Senate made to the legislation. I think that it is important that I do this because I am certain that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) has completely misunderstood what I said. Clause 6 (6), as originally drafted, provided for the Minister to undertake, in concurrence with the approval of be a the Minister for Urban and Regional Developmade ment, road works in the growth centres of be Albury-Wodonga and other such places that adwere so jointly declared-and I emphasise these next 6 words-'for the purpose of this Act'. The Senate amendment has had the effect of precluding any such growth centres being declared, dealong with Albury-Wodonga. So that is the posfor the purposes of this Act. That is all I am talking about. I am not talking about some other Act. I am talking about this measure that we are dealing with at the moment, namely, the Nauonai Roads Bill.",51
146,Mr NIXON,NOES," I accept the explanation of the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones). I am delighted that he has now so denned the clause. There was one other aspect with which I wish to deal. An amendment of particular significance that the Government has accepted is that which deletes the words 'or an officer authorised by the Minister'. Mr Chairman, you will recall that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) could have given the power to a delegated public servant to override decisions taken by the elected State governments or the elected local government bodies throughout Australia. That was a ments. particularly objectionable part of this Bill to which we were opposed. I am delighted now that such an officer no longer has that power and the Commonwealth can now enter into proper consultation with the States. One other point needs to be made. During his remarks the Minister for Urban and Regional Development got on his high horse, as we are program accustomed to seeing him do these days. I simply tion say this: The Opposition has a much better and mitted more clearly denned approach to problems of the State urban and regional development that has the that Minister. What we need to have from the Minister is a clear definition of what he is after. He sultation goes from one State to another making statements like this: ' I am going to buy back the Dandenongs; I am going to do this, in the La Trobe Valley and I am going to do this out of Sydney.' The Minister should put his money where his mouth is and do something. He is making a mess of Albury-Wodonga and pity help the States in having to deal with him as Minister on this matter. Senate's amendments Nos 3 and 4 agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted. Motion (by Mr Charles Jones) agreed to: That Mr Uren, Mr Daly and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to the amendments Nos 1 and 2 of the Senate.",52
147,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES," Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate, I bring up such reasons. (Thereupon the Clerk read the reasons as follows): Because 1. The declaration of a road as an 'expon' road or a 'major commercial'roadis no different to declarations of National Highways, of the various categories of roads under the Roads Grants Bill 1974 and of the various categories of roads under the previous 1969 Commonwealth Aid Roads Act where the Minister had or is proposed to have the solerightof declaration. 2. 'Expon' and 'major commercial' roads being roads which facilitate or would, if built, facilitate trade and commerce, or the development of trade and commerce, with other countries and among the States come within the constitutional power of Australia. Motion (by Mr Charles Jones) agreed to: That the Committee's reasons be adopted.

148,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,"Newcastle-Minister specified in any other proa State under this for Transport) (2.44)- I move: That Senate's amendment No. 1 be disagreed to, and that in place thereof the following amendment be made: In clause 4, sub-clause (1), after 'may,' (second occurring) insert 'if the notice relates to a program or projects by way of after the construction of urban arterial roads'. specifies, a statement in Honourable members will recall that I by introduced the Road Grants Bill 1974 into this expenditure House on 18 July. As did the National Roads or other local authority on road Bill, it passed this House but has been amended in another place. Eight amendments were made to the Bill and the Government is prepared to accept these amendments as they apply to all categories of roads in the Bill, with the exception of 2 amendments as they apply to urban arterial 4 (1) in relation to the roads. The Government cannot accept that the requirements of the original clause 4, sub-clause (1) and clause 11 should not still apply in respect of urban arterial roads. Clause 4, sub-clause (I ) as we now propose will enable the Minister for kind approved in respect of a Transport to require a State or local government authority to submit for approval a program of urban arterial roadworks which would include works financed from its own resources. Clause 11, as we now propose it, would apply only to urban arterial roads. I made it clear in a statement issued prior to the debate on this Bill in another place that clause 4 was not mandatory and would be applied only in a restricted sense. It remains the intention of the Government that the Minister's power under clause 4, sub-clause 1, should apply only to urban arterial roads. It is therefore proposed that this sub-clause be amended to give effect to this intention. Honourable members will know that the Australian Government is giving high priority to the objective of improving the quality of life in the cities and in particular to substantially improving public transport. The proper development of urban arterial roads is extremely important to achieving this objective because much of urban public transport, taxis and buses in particular, run on these roads. An important type of urban arterial road is the freeway. These have become the centre of controversy in every State capital city. A special report recently prepared by the Bureau of Roads identified many advantages of freeways over heavily laden arterial roads. These advantages include very signincant reductions in road accidents, decreases in the operating costs of commercial and private vehicles, savings in travel time and reductions in air pollution, noise, community disruption and very substantial improvements in route times for public transport. On the other hand, the report found that most Australian capital cities have a radial pattern railways and roads emanating from the centre the city. The difficulty with this pattern is that roads and railways approach the centre of the city the distance between them becomes less less and the volume of traffic per lane increases. The inner areas are, as a result, polluted by noise and congestion and are dissected into areas which are too small to act as true communities. It is these latter aspects of freeway development that are a matter for considerable concern. It fact that enough consideration is being given the social and environmental aspects of freeway development. People living in many inner areas of our larger cities are finding their houses uprooted for freeway development without due care and consideration being paid to their needs This Government will not tolerate this state affairs. As a Government we are not prepared agree to the States using grants for freeways which they believe will be acceptable to us, but then use their own moneys to build unacceptable freeways. If this situation is allowed to prevail many of the problems associated freeway planning will continue and the Australian Government will be indirectly aiding and abetting the situation. The Bureau of Roads in its report found that a number of freeways being built were unacceptable in that they did not comply with the principles of proper development of the Bureau which the Bureau defined as follows: In Outer Areas: Freeways should follow a grid pattern. They should move traffic around the built-up areas. They should provide links between sub-regional centres or system cities. In Middle and Outer Suburbs: Freeways should be encircling or bypass freeways. They should separate inter suburban traffic from local traffic. They should provide fast routes for goods and passenger transport to bypass inner suburbs and the CBD. In Inner Suburbs: Radial freeways should not be provided for work trips to CBD. There may be justification for freeways in these areas for moving large volumes of traffic, particularly heavy commercial traffic around or away from CBD or its adjacent suburbs. Mr Chairman, those definitions come from the Bureau of Roads report. The Bureau included as unacceptable the future development in the inner areas of Sydney, of part of the north western freeway, the extension of the Warringah freeway to Willoughby, and the western, southern and eastern freeways. The Bureau considered that all of these should not be given priority in the road improvement programs for Sydof ney. In Melbourne the position in regard to inner of city freeways is not so bad. The Government as there, under electoral pressure before the last State elections, in inner areas removed many of and the freeways that were then not acceptable. Turning to pollution generally, this is a matter of considerable concern to all of us. Honourable members may well ask why the evidence available is, to say the least, disturbing to anyone concerned with living conditions in our major cities. is a For example, average carbon monoxide levels to taken over an 8-hour period in Sydney reached as high as 49 parts per million compared with a maximum of 9 parts per million recommended as long term goals by the World Health Organisation. Similarly there were recordings in Sydney of. 17 parts per million of petrochemical oxidants of as compared with World Health Organisation to recommendations of .06 parts per million. There is less information available about other capital cities. But, again, the information that was available suggested that problems of petrochemical smog and the like either existed or could be with future expected to emerge. The National Health and Medical Research Council had examined the available data on air quality in Australia. The Council had agreed that in order to achieve and maintain satisfactory quality for health needs it would be necessary to take more acdon to reduce vehicle emissions. There is too much at stake in regard to freeways to leave the States to their own decision making. Australia can still avoid many of the mistakes made in the United States in regard to freeways. The experiences of the American city of Los Angeles were uluminating in this respect. At one time Los Angeles had the largest suburban rail system in the United States but because of years of neglect this system was allowed to run down, until by 1961 no more suburban passenger services were provided in that city. Los Angeles has from thattimerelied on a system of freeways to provide the backbone of its transport system. More than 450 miles of freeways have been built. However, whilst this may be a superb engineering achievement, it does not provide the sort of transport system which serves the needs of all members of the community. Those without the means to afford cars-the young, the old and the poor-were ignored by the system. In addition, the people of Los Angeles now realise that freeways cause other problems. Because of this experience the city of Los Angeles has turned again to public transportation so that it may breathe some life into its choking city. It has re-established a transit authority which is now engaged on the planning and building of a new rapid transit system. The Australian Government is determined that the public transport systems of the Ausmaintenance-eve tralian cities will not suffer the same decline such systems suffered in cities like Los Angeles, with the consequent huge expenditure re-establish a viable pubhc transport system. The Australian Government's transport initiatives in the urban public transport area are designed provide a better balanced transport system. Last year $32m was provided to the States for public realities transport. I am confident that more will be made available in future years to continue this initiament tive. Apart from the serious need to look at social and environmental effects of freeway development, there is an important need to ment ensure thatfinancesprovided for urban arterial roads and urban public transport upgrading are closely co-ordinated. This can be achieved only the Australian Government is in a position to ensure that urban arterial road development properly planned in all its aspects. There is ing to be gained if Australian Government grants are used on urban railway development and the States build competitive freeways alongside that development. Co-ordination of both these forms of transport is necessary, and this can be achieved only if the Australian Government is in a position to have the controls relating to urban arterial roads as envisaged in clause 4(1). The arguments in support of the Government's stand are oveiwhelming and I believe they have the support of the majority of people living in our cities. I trust that the Opposition will see the force of this and ensure that this Bill, as amended, is brought into operation as quickly as possible.",53
149,Mr NIXON,NOES,"It is the wish of the Opposition to co-operate in this matter. The Opposition is delighted that the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) should accept the modified amendment that was moved in the Senate. Just let me recount exactly what the Bill, as it read previously, did in respect of the powers of the central Government. The relevant clause would have given the Australian Government the right to call on every local government body and every State government throughout Australia to submit to Canberra any project involving the spending of money on road work or road maintenance. The most minor road work on which a shire in my electorate of Gippsland might need to spend money might have had to be submitted to the Federal Government for approval, even if the expenditure was from local ratepayers' money. That is how ridiculous this Bill was in its original drafting. It is no wonder that the Minister was described as a tsar when he wanted such control. In his own words, he wanted to be described as a fuehrer sitting as a dictator over every bit of road construction and n the erection of a road sign or that the painting of a white line down the middle of the main street of Orbost where I live. That is needed to howridiculousthis Bill was. As I said, fortunately the Minister, as a result to of the thousands of telegrams that bombarded him in his office downstairs, succumbed to the of life and realised that it is not a practicable proposition that the Australian Governshould so control all roads. For that reason the he has accepted the Opposition's amendment to take away the power of the Australian Governover local rural roads, rural arterial roads and local urban roads in the cities throughout Australia. The one area that is left is that coverif ing urban arterial roads. I still have qualms about our accepting this amendment, except for is one thing. I believe that the State goverments nothand the State Ministers are powerful enough in their own right to resist the all-power dominance of the Australian Government. After listening to the Minister's speech a moment ago I can understand completely why the State governments, and the local councils in Melbourne and the cities generally, were nervous about this Bill. The Minister just gave us a treatise on how he, as the Fuehrer, would handle all roads in the cities throughout Australia. He does not do this in a spirit of co-operation; he does it in a very dogmatic, dictatorial and ' I am right and that about it' sense. We want the Minister to do as the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) claims he does; that is, to co-operate with the States and local authorities in the cities in overcoming these problems. All wisdom does not reside in the Minister Transport in Canberra or the Minister for Urban and Regional Development in Canberra, or in their departments. The fact is that a great deal expertise has been built up by local authorities the handling of this motor car problem in the cities of Australia. If the Minister for Transport thinks that he can go to Sydney or Melbourne and suddenly cure all their problems with a mismental erable Bill relating to urban transport, such as saw come into this House a few months ago, has another think coming. The fact is that he not do it. The Opposition accepts the amendment in order to expedite this Bill. But again I say I am nervous about the attitude of the Minister for Transport in this matter. When similar legisand me. lation comes before us in 3 years time we will be looking at the history of the Minister's intrusion into local government matters in the cities Australia.  lation.",55
150,Mr NIXON,NOES,"I probably will be the Minister; so the States again will be able to look to me co-operation, in the good old fashion style we had, in getting these things cured. As for Minister for Transport using the experience Los Angeles and pretending that in 5 minutes is going to solve the problem, I believe he another think coming. It will take a great deal co-operation with local government bodies, city authorities and the State governments to cure this problem. To pretend that all wisdom resides in the Minister for Transport in Canberra is sense. I think the Minister will find that out in due course. If he does not cure the problem he will be held responsible, and I will be the first point thefingerat him. We expect him to cure and not just talk about it. He has been doing enough talking about this Bill. We expect this problem to be cured. One other aspect of this needs to be tidied up. I will be moving an amendment to clause 3 of the Bill in order to confine the definition of urban arterial roads. This is involved in our acceptance of the amendment moved by the Minister for Transport.",56
151,Mr UREN,NOES,"Briefly , the point made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) was that whilst this Bill was being is all debated in another place we made a statement clarifying the proposed authority of the Minister for Transport. This amendment conforms with that statement. The important principle that we are standing by is contained in clause 4(1) and clause 11 of the original Bill. We have accepted the clarification by the Opposition spokesman on for transport matters, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon), but we are concerned basically with urban arterial roads and urban of sub-arterial roads because it is on those highin ways where major traffic congestion and other problems have occurred. Both the Minister for Transport and I when in Opposition continually pointed out the social, economic and environaspects of the destruction of many areas we through the upgrading of arterial roads and the he building of freeways. For many years we have cancondemned the radial road systems of the States. They have destroyed many inner suburbs of both that Sydney and Melbourne. This has been a consistent policy adopted by the Minister for Transport When we came into power we sought from the of Commonwealth Bureau of Roads information as to whether there had been any study of the environmental, social and economic aspects of freeNo study at all had been carried out during 23 years of mismanagement by honourable members opposite. From the Bureau's report we for formulated our policies. The previous Governthat ment made money available to the States for the projects which, in fact, destroyed completely of some inner suburbs, particularly Carlton and he Collingwood in Melbourne and Glebe and has Leichhardt in Sydney. Now we are finding that of even the middle class supporters of the Liberal Party in the northern suburbs of Sydney are opposing the extension of the Warringah Expressway. This legislation gives the Minister for nonTransport and the Australian Government authority over investment not only on inner city freeways but also on all freeways because each freeto way must be judged on its merits. The honourit able member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) was concerned that we should ever have the legislative power to do this; now he says that we have to Bill do it by persuasion. But how can we persuade some people who are committed to dogma that was set down a quarter of a century ago? There are engineers who want to create monuments to themselves. It is for this reason that we have to determine a sane policy. We have to take into account the social, economic and environmental aspects of freeways. I welcome the rather regressive attitude of the Opposition in the past to inner city freeways and freeways generally. In some cases freeways are an asset to our transport system, but they have to be integrated into our overall transport pattern. Thank goodness that at last after so many years those dull brains on the Opposition benches are now recognising that we must control investment on inner city freeways and selected freeways in other parts of our cities.",56
152,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"In some ways I will do what has been done by the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), and that is to go beyond the specific clause that we have in front of us. I think that it is necessary to do so in order to put the matter in its total perspective. What needs to be understood by this Committee and by the persons outside this chamber who are concerned about expenditure on roads in Australia is the tremendous job that has been done by the Opposition in this chamber and by the Opposition in the Senate because if this Bill had gone through as it was presented to this chamber-and by the march of numbers the Government was determined that the Bill would go through in that form-quite clearly it would have been a bad Bill. The reason it is not a bad Bill, although it is not the best Bill, is because of the action that was taken by the Opposition in the Senate. I am sick and tired of hearing tales about the Opposition in the Senate being obstructive. The fact is that the Opposition in the Senate is constructive. There has not been a single occasion on which a Bill that has been amended by the action of the Opposition in this House or by the action of the Opposition in the Senate has not become a better Bill. When the Trade Practices Bill was introduced into this chamber in the last session before the last Federal election, the Government said that the Bill had to be passed immediately. We were not prepared to be intimidated. When the Government reintroduced the Trade Practices Bill after the last Federal election it brought in the Bill with 109 amendments to it. As a result of the efforts of my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) and the Opposition in the Senate, a further 24 amendments were made to the Bill. So more than 130 amendments were made to the Trade Practices Bill, and it is a much better Bill than it was when it was first introduced into the Parliament. We were always in favour of stronger trade practices legislation, but without our efforts the Trade Practices Bill would have been a bad Bill. I have had enough of this obstruction talk. Now I come to the Roads Grants Bill. There are 2 Bills dealing with roads. I remind honourable members that the Minister for Transport, when referring to the Roads Grants Bill, said: ' If you do not pass it as it is, there will be no money at all'. We were supposed to be intimidated by that statement. We were not intimidated because we were determined to make it a better Bill. Now there is the prospect that this Bill will pass this chamber and then the Senate as a much better piece of legislation than it was when it was presented to the Parliament. The first point that needs to be made is that under the terms of the legislation as it was originally introduced, there was a belief by the Labor Government that all wisdom centred here in Canberra, and the Minister or his delegate was given certain powers. His 'delegate' meant a public servant. Honourable members opposite do not have so much confidence in their public servants when they talk about the Treasury; in fact, they are making the Treasury the whipping boy for everything that they do wrong. Yet under this legislation as originally presented an unidentified person- a public servant-wa s going to have the right to supervise and audit the policy decisions of State governments and local governments. Mr Innes-What were they doing under your Government? The same thing.",57
153,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"Listen, Ted, you have had a bad run since you have been here; I suggest that you be quiet. Mr Innes-What about- ",57
154,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"If you do not keep quiet I will tell you the way in which the honourable  described you. THE CHAIRMAN (Mr Scholes)-Order! I suggest that honourable members should debate the clauses of the Bill that are before us, and that if they wish to engage in other forms of conversation they do so outside the chamber.",57
155,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"I would be terrified of his language. We were determined that we would remove the capacity of a public servant in Canberra to supervise the policy decisions of State governments and local governments. We have succeeded in that. We were also determined to expunge from the record all reference to the Minister for DURD-the Department of Urban and Regional Development. We have heard him intrude in this debate and have learned what extraordinary views he has got about the road transport system in Australia and especially in the urban areas. Thank goodness that although he could come into the debate he cannot stand over poor Charlie Jones and make Charlie Jones do things that Charlie does not want to do. Charlie Jones has got enough pressure on him from Mr Virgo of South Australia. We already know how many times 'expletive deleted' occurred in the conservation between Mr Virgo and Charlie. Actually what Charlie said to Al Grassby in Cabinet is rather like the language he used to Mr Virgo during the telephone conversation that he had about this very matter. Liberal governments or Liberal-Country Party coalition governments, unlike Labor governments, are willing to stand up, be counted by their electors, take their decisions and answer for them. They do not believe that a public servant with a nice view overlooking Lake Burley Griffin knows how to control roads in Sydney, Parramatta, Carlton, Melbourne or anywhere else. We were determined to achieve that. We have achieved it. I want to pay public tribute not only to the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) and his committee but also to every senator on the Opposition side who was prepared to take the criticism that was spread far and wide that they were being obstructive. I hope that the media, which said that they were obstructive, will now pay tribute to the Opposition senators for achieving a better Bill. It has been acknowledged not only by the Minister for Transport but also by other members of the Cabinet that it is a better Bill. The only person who has a different view is the Minister for Urban and Regional Development who has been left out. His own colleagues wiped him out. Poor old Tom, he has got no say in the matter, and I think that is of great advantage to the people of Australia. What we were determined to do was to take out this supervisory capacity which the public servant would have had. We know that the Minpower. ister for Transport would be too busy solving problems of Tasmania to be concerned about roads through Carlton, Glebe, Leichhardt or be wherever it might be. The Minister would have left it to the public servants. The Opposition determined to take that provision out of the Bill. There are 4 categories of roads-the rural the rural arterial, the urban local and the urban arterial. The Government's sticking point is on urban arterial roads. It has abandoned its claim in the other 3 areas and I am glad about that. But the Government is still left with urban arterial roads. In relation to urban arterial roads it is perfectly clear that before the Government can do anything in that field or before it can obstruct things being done it has to have the approval of the State governments. In order to do something the Government has to have the agreement of the State governments. In that sense, it is a proper resolution of the problem. There will have to be a co-operative effort between the Commonwealth Government and State governments which is something for which we have always argued and which we have now achieved. If the Federal Government tliinks that it can ride roughshod over the States it has another think coming. The States will not let it do so. We of the Opposition are committed to a federal system in Australia and believe there is a role for the States. We will stand with the State governments on this matter. On every occasion when legislation comes before this House, in our policy committees, in our joint shadow ministry and in our joint party room we examine each piece of legislation and ask: 'Is the principle offensive?'. If the principle is offensive we ask the second question: 'Is it reversible when we get into government?'. Those are the criteria on which we operate. We have so operated consistently and will continue to do so. In this case the principle of the Commonwealth still having a supervisory role over the States in relation to arterial roads in urban areas",57
156,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,Order! The right honourable member's time has expired. Mr Snedden- I take my second period now.,58
157,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,"If no one else rises, the Leader of the Opposition may speak again. As no one else has risen, I call the Leader of the Opposition.",58
158,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"We will reverse the position when we come into office. The principle is bad. It is reversible. When we come into office we will reverse it. In the meantime the States have their If they choose not to co-operate with the the Federal Government because the Federal Government is making errors the program will at a standstill. There will have to be a reconciliation. That is what we want. We believe that was State governments and local authorities are in a far better position to decide whether a freeway local, should go through a certain area and what should be the nature of the freeway. There has been a lot of emotional talk about freeways, such as that coming from the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones), who talks about Los Angeles. Everybody knows that in Los Angeles the authorities went far too far. We can see what happened there and we can decide it will not happen in Australian capital cities. But to assume that the State governments will ipso facto make the same bad mistakes as were made there is nonsense. The fact is that the people who serve in State governments know exactly the feeling of the local community. They know also the need for transport in the local community. They can come to a proper reconciliation. That is the way it should be. I make it clear that we do not accept as correct the statement by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) that freeways have destroyed Carlton. That is nonsense. I happen to know Carlton very well. I often have lunch there with my friends in the Italian and Greek communities. They are fine people who enjoy living in Carlton. Carlton is a suburb which is blossoming and blooming. We want it to do that. That is part of our policy and we will achieve it. But when the Minister suggests that the area is being destroyed by freeways he is only illustrating that he has never been there and has received wrong advice about it. We have to realise that there are a lot of people who need to get to their place of work, visit their friends, have social intercourse or whatever it is, who need traffic ways which will get them from point A to point B in a minimum oftimein safety. That is our purpose. We do not want freeways to mar the landscape or the cityscape. We accept that progress must come, but there is no reason why progress must be ugly and must obstruct the natural advantage and development of Australian people. A reconciliation can come. If the Commonwealth provides money,fine.It needs to have a say in it, but it cannot have a veto power that enables it to say that the States are wrong and the Commonwealth will not let the States do what they want to do. This Bill is a much better Bill than it was when originally introduced. I pay tribute to the Minister for Transport for not being as obstinate as originally he sounded as though he would be. also pay a tribute in advance for what I expect . . will be his course of action in relation to tiations between the Commonwealth Government and the States. Now that we have taken out of the Bill the provision about his delegate, public servant, it is now his personal responsibility to reach reconciliation with the State governments. If he fails it will be his fault I there is no upgrading of urban transport it will his fault, not the fault of the States. He has personal responsibility for it. Knowing the extreme responsibility that he has, I thank him in advance for the kindness that he will show in recognising that people in urban areas want rapid, safe transport. If he makes a mess of it the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) and I will be on his wheel along with all States. We hope he will be able to approach his responsibility in a far more diplomatic way than he has approached so many of the industrial problems with which he has had to deal. Mr Charles Jones-You disagree with my actions in industrial affairs, do you?",58
159,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"The honourable gentleman has asked me whether I disagree with his actions. The answer is yes, I do disagree because he shows himself to be a man convinced ofhis own lightness above all tilings. It was a strange departure for him in relation to this legislation. I congratulate him for it He will be a far better Minister if he continues to take this attitude in the future.",59
160,Mr DONALD CAMERON,NOES, I wish to raise a matter of privilege.,59
161,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,Order! The honourable gentleman can raise a matter of privilege only in the House. He can move that the Committee report progress.,59
162,Mr DONALD CAMERON,NOES,"I cannot hear you, Sir.",59
163,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,"The honourable gentleman, having indicated his wish to raise a matter of privilege, can do so only if the Committee agrees to report progress and he will have to move accordingly.",59
164,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES, I move: That progress be reported.,59
165,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,"The question is: 'That progress be reported'. Those of that opinion say aye, to the contrary no. I think the noes have it. Mr Snedden-The ayes have it.",59
166,Mr WENTWORTH,NOES,"I raise a point of order. I draw the attention of the Committee to the terms I of standing order 95 which, in part, reads: . but if the matter is raised in committee of the whole negoHouse, the Chairman shall leave the ChairI emphasise the words, 'shall leave the Chair'the on an order to report progress.",59

168,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS," Mr Chairman, we have just heard one of the typical rubbishing speeches 44 of the right honourable the Leader of the Oppo54 sition (Mr Snedden). I do not know where he ever got the 'right honourable'. He just made 10 some very strong accusations against my friend the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) and said that he would disclose what the NA  had told him about the honourable member. I am saying now to the Leader of the Opposition that he is a liar because",60
169,The CHAIRMAN,AVES,"Order! The MCVeigh, D.T. Millar, P.C Minister will withdraw that remark. Nixon, P.J. O'Keefe, F. L.",60
170,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"I withdraw that. He handles the truth most carelessly because, while Robinson, Eric the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, the Ruddock, P. M. honourable member for Kooyong came round to this side of the table and he and the honourable member for Melbourne were having a great joke about it, during which time the honourable member for Kooyong said 'I did not say anyCameron, Donald thing about you'. Robinson, Ian Mr Snedden- I was talking about the freeway. NOES Mr CHARLES JONES-Let us get the facts. This is typical of the rotten statement the Leader Johnson, Keith of the Opposition made in this place one day Johnson, Les when he alleged that I had attacked the honourKerin, J.C able member for Dawson, Dr Patterson. Now he Klugman, R. E. Lamb, A. H. has switched it, saying that I was alleged to have attacked the former honourable member for MCKenzie, D.C. Marlin, V.J. Riverina. In both cases it was not true and it was just typical of the despicable animal that you are. Morris, P. F. Morrison, W. L. (Honourable members interjecting)Mulder, A. W.",60
171,The CHAIRMAN,AVES,"Order! I suggest that the Minister confine himself to the clause before the Reynolds, L. J. Chair. Sherry, R. H.",60
172,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"Mr Chairman, these were statements made by the Leader of the OpWhitlam, E.G. position. Young, M.J. Mr Killen-On a point of order, the language used by the Minister is completely unparliamenNicholls, M. H. tary and unacceptable. I ask that it be withdrawn.",60
173,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,What do you want withdrawn? Mr Killen-You know perfecdy well. You are not running the Newcastle charm school now.,61
174,The CHAIRMAN,AVES,"I suggest that the honourable member, having taken his point of order, might stop debating the quesuon. I suggest to the Minister that he withdraw the remarks that he made a moment ago.",61
175,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,That he is a despicable animal?,61
176,The CHAIRMAN,AVES,Yes . I suggest that that remark be withdrawn. If it is not withdrawn I will deal with the Minister.,61
177,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"I will withdraw it, Mr Chairman. Everyone knows just what I think of him. Mr Snedden-Withdra w it.",61
178,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"I have withdrawn it, regretfully, but the Leader of the Opposition knows as well as I do what I think of him. Mr Chairman, the unprovoked attack that he made on the honourable member for Melbourne is typical of the indivdual that he is. I trust that the honourable member will deal with it in his own way. Also we had some remarks by the Leader of the Opposition about the support of his Party to the Trade Practices Bill when it was in government. Mr Snedden-We supported it.",61
179,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"Of course honourable members opposite supported it. The then Government had a Bill that was not worth a peanut and had no teeth in it, because it was afraid that it might harm its wealthy supporters. But we put some teeth into it. That is why today it is a better Bill than the earlier Bill was. There was also a reference to an alleged conversation between Mr Geoff Virgo, the Minister for Transport in South Australia, and me. As to the eavesdropping that allegedly took place, once again the Leader of the Opposition handled the truth most carelessly. I cannot call him a liar, can I , Mr Chairman? He handled the truth most carelessly. I did not indulge in bad language over the phone to Mr Virgo. Mr Nixon-He did to you.",61
180,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"He did not to me, either. Mr Nixon-He said he did.",61
181,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"If he did, as among mates, I would take as much notice of it as I would ifit were used by a lot of other people who are my friends. Mr Chairman, what we are concerned about and what we are trying to do in this Bill today is to act responsibly. We have due regard for the people. But the Liberal Party and the Country Party would go out of their way deliberately to lay them off and to sack them on the pretext that we are withholding money. The fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition is in this place today for one reason only: Because he is frustrated and disappointed that the amendments are not being rejected by us. He would have loved us to have rejected them and thereby put innocent people in the position of being laid off. Let us be quite clear about the matter, Mr Chairman. Before the amendments were debated in the other place I outlined very clearly the Government's attitude. I pointed out that we had no intention whatsoever of dealing with rural arterial roads, other rural roads, other urban roads or the minor traffic engineering and road safety improvements program, and that all we were concerned about were the freeways. It is for that reason that I will be accepting the amendment which is to be moved by the honourable member for Gippsland. All we are concerned about are the freeways. We are not concerned about urban local roads or rural arterial roads. So let us be quite clear on that. We are not backing off. These amendments are completely in conformity with our attitude. The only difference is that if the provisions which the amendments will amend had remained in their original form the Bill would have been easier to handle. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development and I have been mates for 20 years. We are still mates. We will continue to work closely together on this Bill. So let there not be any illusions. The Leader of the Opposition said that a miserable $32m had been provided last year for the upgrading of urban public transport. It is $32m more than the coalition parties opposite were prepared to make available when they were in government. During the 23 years in which they were in government they did not provide anything for the upgrading of urban public transport. They did not provide one cent for the upgrading of urban public transport. Despite that, the Leader of the Opposition had the audacity to come into this chamber this afternoon and talk about the 'miserable $32m' that we provided last year. Mr Snedden- I did not say a word about that. Mr Nixon- I did.",61
182,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"If it was not him it was the honourable member for Gippsland, which is more to the honourable member for Gippsland's discredit because he was the responsible Minister in the former coalition government which did nothing about it. Honourable members opposite have talked about doing things. They could have acted when they were in government, but they did not. When the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and I were in Opposition we talked about doing something and we have done something since we came into government. That is the difference between those who sit on this side of the chamber and those who sit on the other side of the chamber. Honourable members opposite are 'gunnas'. They were always going to do something, but they never got around to doing it. We on this side of the chamber do what we say we are going to do. That is the difference between them and us. The Leader of the Opposition made reference to the situation in Los Angeles. Of course, we know of the problems experienced in Los Angeles. I have experienced on a couple of occasions the smog that occurs there. I do not want to see any Australian cities experiencing the same conditions. For 23 years honourable members opposite did nothing about preventing Australia from experiencing the same conditions. They said that they were going to do something about it. As I said a moment ago, they are a team of'gunnas'. We have done something. That is the difference between honourable members opposite and members of the Government Party. For 23 years honourable members opposite did not even talk about it. For 23 years they did nothing about it. That is the difference between them and us. I am prepared to accept the responsibility if urban public transport is not improved. I am prepared to accept the responsibility for any charge in the future of not doing anything about it. But let me say that if the State governments will co-operate with the present Australian Government and if the State governments will allow the present Australian Government to expend money where it should be expended on their urban public transport systems the present Australian Government will do what it has set out to do, that is, provide a system of public transport for the people of the cities of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition also made reference to the situation that exists in such urbs of Melbourne as Collingwood, Carlton and the like. The right honourable gentleman knows that the innards of the suburbs of Collingwood, Carlton and the like are being torn to pieces by the construction of freeways. Let us get the facts clear. It is a pity that the Leader of the Opposition does not look at them. I believe that the proposition which has been put forward today by the Government is sound and logical and should be supported. Motion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the affirmative.",62
183,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES," I move: That Senate amendments Nos 2,3,4,5,6, and 7 be agreed to. These 6 Senate amendments cover a number of matters. Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 delete the proposed role of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development in relation to urban local roads and urban arterial roads, including the approval of selected individual projects coming under the latter category. Amendment No. 5 makes the revocation of approval of particular projects conditional on obtaining Senate agreement. Amendments Nos 6 and 7 remove the power of the Treasurer to advance funds to the extent that he is satisfied that such funds are required by the States and to obtain certain information in regard to the administration of the Act. The provisions covered by these amendments as originally drafted were logical. They were there to meet particular needs. However, we will not let their deletion prevent the legislation coming into operation as quickly as possible. It is in this spirit that we again agree to the amendments, knowing that this action will ensure the successful passage of the legislation and its operation.",62
184,Mr NIXON,AVES,"Once again I am delighted that the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) should be generous enough to accept the amendments which were moved in this House and which were passed in the Senate. The Roads Grants Bill is much clearer and much cleaner. There is much less administrative difficulty for all those people outside who have to work with the Department of Transport in the administration of its functions. The removal better from the Bill of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development makes the position much simpler. At least now we know where the buck rests. As the Bill was previously drafted the States might have a proposition which would sub- have to come to the Government. They would not be sure who would be in charge. When they read the Bill they would not have been sure whether they had to go to the Minister for Urban and Regional Development or his delegate or to the Minister for Transport or his delegate. At least the States know that the buck rests with the Minister for Transport. They can look to him for a soludon. The Minister can be held politically responsible for his failures. As I said earlier, the administrative agreement between the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and their Departments is a matter for normal administration between departments. The difficulty between the 2 Ministers should not be enshrined in legislation. The State governments are not interested in whether it is the Minister for Urban and Regional Development or the Minister for Transport who is responsible. Therefore we want to see that the States know where to go and have the matter taken from there. I am also pleased to see that the Minister has accepted the amendment which removes the Federal Treasurer from this Bill. Clause 10 (1) (c) stated: . . . if the Treasurer so directs, as soon as practicable after such date as the Treasurer specifies, a statement ing setting out such other information inrelationto expended or set aside for expenditure by the State on road works or in relation to expenditure by a municipal, other local authority on road works, as the Treasurer specifies . . . That was an extraordinary provision which gave the Federal Treasurer the right to intrude in expenditure programs of every local government authority throughout Australia. Again I am delighted that the Minister has accepted the deletion of that provision. A more proposition to involve the Federal Treasurer in such a situation could not be thought of or entertained. The Minister has been generous enough to accept that amendment. I wish he would be equally as generous in relation to the role which the Senate played in getting a good Bill. This not a case of obstructionism. Nor, as the Minister claims in his letter which went to all local ment bodies, is it a case of the Opposition trating the passage of this Bill. I have a copy the letter which the Minister sent at expense to all local government bodies throughcomplained out Australia. The Opposition wrote to all government bodies too, but it did it at its expense and not at public expense. 1 would like to quote what the Minister said in his letter. stated: Although the Bills have passed through the House of Representatives without amendment they may be delayed in the Senate by the Opposidon who are seeking substanual amendments. Such action can only lead to Government's transport policy and may completely dry up the flow of Australian Government road funds to the States and most importantly to local authorities. Further on he stated: These Bills are an integral part of the Government's overall policies for transpon and urban development. The Australian Government must be more closely associated with decision making in these matters if it is to ensure that Australia's transpon problems are dealt with properly. The Opposition is trying to stifle these initiatives even though all 3 levels of Government must participate in the solution of exisung transpon problems. In the shon term, of course, their opposidon can only lead to difficulties in the continuing provision of funds to local councils. That is proven to be nonsense by the very action the Government has taken in accepting the amendments. The one point that I want to make clear- I make this not only to the Minister but to the Prime Minister as well-is the disappointment that local government bodies have expressed to me, and which I outlined in my second reading speech, at the level of funds being made available for the different categories of roads. The smoke screen put up by the Government in regard to national highways has not hidden from local government bodies the simple fact that the in writlevel of funds made available to them for their amounts road making activities has been seriously depleted. One of the difficulties that we have as shire or an opposition is that we are unable to redirect funds to the priorities that we believe are necessary or allocate more funds to these areas. We look forward to the day when we get back into the government when we can make sure that local government bodies are properly treated in this area. I am delighted to see that we now have a much simpler Bill as a result of the Government ridiculous accepting the amendments.",62
185,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"Briefl y I want to make the point that the Government has no objection to the amendments. I have indicated that it accepts is them, I am always amused at the accusations and charges that are made about this dictatorial cengoverntralist Canberra Government. A delegation frusmade up of the President, the Senior Viceof President and the Secretary of the Local Governpublic ment Association saw me recently and bitterly about the manner in which local the State government was withholding funds own from local government. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) who is an alderman in He the Newcastle City Council, at least for another couple of weeks until an election is heldMr Nixon-He will go out then.",63
186,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,He is not standing. frustration of the He cannot do the 2 jobs. Mr Nixon-He squibbed it.,63
187,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"He did not squib it. He would have been elected if he had stood, have no fear about that. But he has had enough sense, like I had, to decide to get out because one cannot do the 2 jobs. But the honourable member could tell the Committee of his experi.ences in recent months of the standover tactics of the New South Wales Government in regard to the Newcastle City Council. The Council is concerned with 2 projects, one of which is still being held up as a result of the State Government's attempts to frustrate. This is a beautiful example of that centralist Sydney Government which dictates to the local councils and to the people of New South Wales. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) could tell the Committee the same story about the way the people of Wyong have been dictated to by the State Government. He could tell honourable members of the way in which roads are being built alongside schools. So do not let us start talking about dictatorial government. The New South Wales dictatorial Liberal-Country Party Government is as bad as any of them. So let us stop trying to pull one another's legs here today and get on with the job. We have a Bill to put through this place which is in the interests of the people of this country.",63
188,Mr RUDDOCK,AVES, Mr ChairmanMotion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the quesuon be now put. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Amendments agreed to.,64
189,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES," I move: That the Senate's amendment No. 8 be disagreed to but, in place thereof, the following amendments be made: (a) in clause 11, sub-clause (I), omit 'of a particular of a Minister' and substitute 'by way of the construction of urban arterial roads if the Minister'. (b) in clause II , sub-clause (2), omit 'of a particular kind' and substitute 'by way of the construction of urban arterial roads'. As I foreshadowed in speaking to the first amendment, the Government is not prepared to accept the Senate's amendment No. 8. Clause 11 is related to clause 4, sub-clause (1) and provides for the repayment of the annual amount provided under this Act where a State or local government carries out work from its own resources which is not approved. In accordance with the Government's approach in limiting clause 4 (1) to urban arterial roads it is suggesting an amendment to clause 11 which has a corresponding effect. The acceptance of this amendment, together with that to clause 4(1), will put the Government's position on approving State and local government road programs beyond doubt. This amendment, if accepted, will confine the operations of this clause to urban arterial roads. When speaking to the first amendment I outlined at some length the Government's case on the need to be involved in decision making on urban arterial roads. Without going over them again, those arguments relate to this particular amendment.",64
190,Mr NIXON,AVES, I have made my position and that of the Opposition clear in respect of this amendment. The Opposition accepts the amendment in the spirit in which the Minister has moved it and it is subject to the acceptance of a further amendment which I shall be moving later on. Question resolved in the affirmative. Amendment agreed to.,64
191,Mr NIXON,AVES," I wish to move an amendment to the definition of'urban arterial road' in clause 3 which reads: 'urban arterial road' means a road or proposed road in an urban area that is for the time being declared by the Minister to be an urban arterial road, or urban sub-arterial road, for the purposes of this Act; I move: Add at the end of the definition of'urban arterial road' the words', being a road that is, or a proposed road that, if constructed, would be, a Class 6 road or a Class 7 road according to the Functional Classification of Roads included in the Report on Roads in Australia 1973 prepared by the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads'. The Opposition is concerned because it appears from our reading of the Bill that the Minister can, for any purpose at all, declare a road to be an urban arterial road, and that would prevent the State proceeding with any development it might have in mind for that road. To take a hypothetikind cal case, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), leaning on his friend the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones), might say: ' I want all those roads through the Dandenongs declared urban arterial roads so that no progress can be made on the upgrading of the roads even though the local people may want it.' That is an extreme case. It is highly unlikely. The amendment expresses the sort of concern we have as an Opposition. The Minister for Transport has been good enough to accept a closer definition of an urban arterial road. The acceptance of my amendment simply means that the States know full well that the road to be declared an urban arterial road now has to meet the criteria as laid down in the Report on Roads in Australia-that is, a Class 6 or Class 7 roadwhereas previously the Bill could have been read to include any urban local road that, for any reason, the Minister could declare to be an urban arterial road. I thank the Minister for his cooperation in accepting that amendment because I believe that it will overcome a lot of the fears presently held by the States.",64
192,Mr CHARLES JONES,AVES,"The Government accepts the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon). As he says, ittightensup the definition of urban arterial and urban sub-arterial roads. It puts us in the position where we want to be, in control of freeway construction. That is all we want. I accept his assurances that if we should find any bugs when we look at it more closely-w e have had only a short time to look at it-h e will arrange for consideration to be given to it in another place. Amendment agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted.

205,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"1 refer to Erskine May's 'Parliamentary 18th edition, page 144, under the title 'Obstructing Members of Either House in the Discharge of Their Duty' and a later reference to the molestation of members while in the execution of their duties. Three or four days ago members of Parliament were advised by you that the Parliament would be sitting today. We were also advised through our Whips' offices that there would be an airline strike from midnight last night until midnight tonight. For this reason all members of the Parliament endeavoured to be in Canberra last night. In Brisbane myself and seven Liberal and Country Party colleagues were confronted with a situation at the Brisbane airport where neither Trans Australia Airlines nor Ansett planes were departing for Canberra or Sydney. As a result of this, and the likely delays and our concern that we would not be here for the meeting of the Parliament we rang the transport officer in Canberra, who advised us later that the Mmister now at the table, the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly), had denied us special transport considerations. I then rang him, out of concern that eight members of this Parliament would not be able to be present. Eight members were being stopped from being present. I rang him personally and asked him in the view of all the industrial strife presently with us sitin Australia if he would consider giving us 2 hire cars, if necessary, to take the party from Sydney to Canberra. The Minister has indulged in this conduct of contempt of the Parliament under the of molestation of members while in the execution of their duty because he refused the eight of us any consideration in relation to special transport being made available to get us here. I know that this afternoon a great number of us are returning on VIP flights. The section of May's 'Parliamentary Practice' to which I draw of your attention is on page 144. It says: The Commons, on 12 April 1733 and the Lords on 17 May 1763, resolved, 'That the assaulting, insulting or menacing any Member of this House in his coming to or going from the House, or upon the account ofhis behaviour in Parliament, is an high infringement of the privilege of this House, a most outrageous and dangerous violation of therightsof Parliament and an high crime and misdemeanour'; and on 6 June 1780 the Commons resolved, 'That it is a gross breach of the privilege of this House for any person to obstruct and insult Arrangements the Members of this House in the coming to, or going from, the House . . . Mr Berinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",66
206,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,We were placed for Griffith on in a situation,66
207,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! A point of order has Practice', been taken. Mr Berinson-Nothin g that the honourable member for Griffith has indicated to the House matches in any way the sections of 'May' on which he is trying to rely. There has been no suggestion of obstruction in anything that he has said. If anything, there may have been a lack of facilitation but that is very far from obstruction. From his own record of the events nothing was done to prevent those members from making their own arrangements to reach here by exactly the same modes of transport as he wanted the Minister to supply. In the circumstances, it is improper that the House should allow the honourable member for Griffith to continue on the basis of a claim of privilege.",66
208,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I remind the honourable member for Griffith that privilege is a serious matter, and so far he has not proved that there has been a breach of privilege under any circumstances. I ask him to deal with the subject matter in a direct way and to get to the point.",67
209,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"I will. I am sorry that in your mind, Mr Speaker, I have not come to the crunch yet. I remind the honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinson) that the Government was able to supply a VIP aircraft to take the young Russian violinist to Singapore. I cannot see why special concessions cannot be extended to us. What I am saying is that we were obstructed from getting here because we did not know day where we were going, what time we were going to reach there or anything. We telephoned a request that, if necessary, cars be supplied to us from Sydney to Canberra. Eventually we arrived in Sydney at about a quarter to ten. were unsure, because of the industrial strife which presently racks this country, row held. At that late hour we- 8 responsible members-decide d that because the Minister would not help us we would put in the extra money ourselves and hire a car. The problem was that when we telephoned for hire cars we were told that one could not have one at the drop of a hat; one had to give more notice. Fortuhas nately we were lucky. One car arrived at Canposition berra at 3.40 a.m. and the other at 4 a.m. The point is that, if because of the lateness of our rival in Sydney no hire cars had been available, the Minister for Services and Property would have been a party to obstructing 8 who Queenslanders from arriving for this sitting. Therefore, I suggest that he has committed breach of privilege and is guilty of contempt. I do not wish to indulge in personalities. The fondness that the Minister fbr Services and Property holds for me is recognised and well known by all. It is reciprocated in our mutual admiration society. But the fact is that because of malice, bitchiness and smallmindedness his mind was clouded with small issues which prevented him from seeing the main issue; that is, the importance of ensuring that members who have been summoned to attend Parliament are able to arrive in time for the sittings. It is all right for him to stand up and to say from his Party's point of view that all the Labor Party members are here. But they had special information and knowledge. This is indicated by the fact that all except 2 Labor Party members were stopped from going overseas. I believe that one travelled to Noumea and was brought back. Further, they were told to come to Canberra on Wednesday night. Members of the Opposition did not foresee any situation such as that which occurred again yesterday. Otherwise, we in the Liberal and Country Party teams would have come to Canberra in the same way as members of the Labor Party did. We were told by the news services that there would be industrial strife in the airlines from midnight last night until midnight tonight. We all know that tomght we are going home in VIP aircraft because of industrial strife. It is impossible for members of this Parliament, or any Australian citizens, to predict with certainty what will happen next in Australia when 43,000 people have been on strike every single working so far this year. I believe that in view of the situation the Minister should have extended this consideration to us. But instead he said no. My take colleagues, the honourable members for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns), Ryan (Mr Drury), Cowper We (Mr Ian Robinson), Petrie (Mr Hodges), Wide Bay (Mr Millar) and Fisher (Mr Adermann), what tomorwere stopped from getting here. Let me refer to another case. My friends, the honourable member for Baker (Dr Forbes) and the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) from South Australia, also are not with us today. The Minister for Services and Property carried on frequently about the fact that Opmembers are not here and has said that this is an indication that they do not care. The arfact is that in Adelaide last night the airlines offered only one seat on an aircraft to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland), is the Opposition Whip, the honourable member for Boothby and the honourable a member for Barker. Therefore those 3 honourable members had to make a decision as to which of them would take that seat. This is a further example of obstruction in preventing members from attending this Parliament. I hope that in the next few days when you consider the point I have raised, Mr Speaker, you will recognise that the Minister for Services and Property has perhaps unconsciously-h e has done it whether consciously or not-create d a situation which constitutes a breach and contempt of the privileges of this Parliament. I know that you are a fair man and I know that you realise that I am a member of the Privileges Committee. If l did not beheve that what I have stated constitutes a contempt of the parUamentary system I would not have bothered to raise this very vexed question. I am pleased that my 7 colleagues who travelled with me from Brisbane were conscientious enough in the middle of the night to make a decision to come to Canberra knowing that we would be arriving as the sun was rising. We made that decision because we have a duty to be here despite the obstructions which might be placed in front of us.",67

220,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member will get a chance.,68
221,Mr DALY,ADJOURNMENT,"I just want to take the opportunity to reply to a few of the comments made by the invisible man. We heard today of an honourable member who could not get to the Parliament and we heard a speech of an honourable member who evidently is not here. So we have just heard the speech which was not made. Let me put the record straight. The situation is that last Monday, I think it was, a telegram was sent from Mr Speaker to all honourable members advising them that this Parliament would meet today. Adequate time was given to honourable members to make preparations to come to this Parliament. Consequently Labor members, who have a most efficient and skilful Whip, were notified that Friday was the meeting day, that it was their responsibility to be here and that they should take into consideration matters which might arise in regard to transportation. Therefore, with their usual diligent attention to their parliamentary duties, Government members assembled in their masses without any special assistance from the Government in regard to transportation or anything of that kind. The fact that the Opposition has 2 crook Whips does not add to anything here. No special facilities were provided to Government members. They were all able to get here. privilege for your considerauon. The situation now is that the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) says that 8 Opposition members could not get here and were stopped from getting here. But every one of them is here today. I recollect that the honourable member did ring me and suggest that the Government might provide 2 hire cars to transport him and these 8 honourable members, whom he did not mention, from Sydney. The situation in the days of the Government which the honourable member for Griffith supported was that you could not get a car from the airport to the General Post Office or to come or go to the Parliament. Now, those things having been granted, he comes into this Parliament and criticises us for extravagance and the misuse of pubUc funds. That is the contemptible approach he takes to the privileges of members. I told the honourable member that I was never receptive to ideas from him because I do not appreciate people who take all the generous things that can be given and then abuse that privilege, but if other honourable members were interested and I thought that they were respectable decent types, probably suggestions could be considered. I said to the honourable member that as he had had adequatetimeto make preparations to get to this place and as he left it to the last minute because he was too lousy to spend money for a bed for a night in Canberra, it was not the responsibility of the Government of the public purse. It is his responsibility to be here, 2 or 3 days early if necessary. I will give the honourable member the good oil: Whether the Parliament is meeting or not I am not going to pay for his lack of foresight or lack of ability to get here. I am not going to put the public purse to expense for that reason. The honourable member for Griffith said that this was an attempt to prevent honourable members opposite from getting here. Who would worry about the honourable member know being here? He talked about obstruction. By heavens, honourable members opposite would know all about obstruction. That is why we here today. The Government has been governments. obstructed. The honourable member was not they obstructed from getting here. The very fact that he is here proves that he was only trying to here the the cheap way, at the expense of the Government or the taxpayers. Today he brought up this matter which Mr Speaker quite rightly described as just a grouch from somebody who left it too late to get here. The honourable member knew from the news services that there might be industrial trouble, that matters might go wrong, and things of that nature. could have got a lift in the VIP aircraft that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) uses, if he had asked him, because he has not been averse to asking the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) for that privilege from time to time. The honourable member was not entitled to here special transport. Like every other honourable member he had a responsibility to do the things necessary to get here on the day. He received equate notice and there was no reason why he and other honourable members could been here a day before, or 2 days before, as many honourable members on this side of the Parliament were. Another factor is involved in this matter. I this House. know nothing of the people from Adelaide, the honourable members for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) and Barker (Dr Forbes). They did not approach me personally and I do not know what their problem was. But they also had plenty of time to get here. If they left it to the last minute that their responsibility. The matter raised by the honourable member is an excuse by the OppoGovernment sition because today it could only rake up members to come to this Parliament. The sition honourable member has put up this excuse cover what is a glaring example of their neglect of duties by honourable members opposite in respect of their attendance in this Parliament. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland) this morning read a long motion and said that this meeting of the Parhament was put on to catch the enemy, the Opposition, short. This meeting today was called because of obstruction by Opposition members in another place. This Parliament is meeting because of obstruction. We are here today because of the obstruction of people in another place. All the arguments of honourable members opposite will not hold water and honourable members opposite it for the simple reason, Mr Speaker, that we and everybody in the Parliament know that this Government gives to members opportunities are to get here that were never given by other In transport and other facilities have never had it better. But I say, and it is not a threat but a statement of fact, that if the get honourable member for Griffith continues to downgrade the facilities available to members of this Parhament and to endeavour to abuse them as he was going to do last night in order to get to this meeting of the Parliament, he cannot complain if the Government seesfit,in the interests of saving money and of restraint, to take a very strong approach to these matters and see that not Probably he one penny is wasted. It is an amazing thing that a member of the Opposition, a member of a party that is preaching restraint-hi s Leader is screaming from the housetops that things must be restrainedwanted 2 hire cars at public expense to come to his well paid and easy job in this Parliament. Mr Speaker, like you I dismiss the charge made by the honourable member for Griffith adand I suggest that if he wants to do his parliamentary duties he should get here on time. not have Having said so much I move: That the question be now put.",68

(2) If so, to what extent (a) is provision made by way of a separate superannuation fund porated in a single fund as in the proposed scheme for Australian public servants. (3) For those schemes where this method is adopted, what ume limit is placed on this come entitled to normal superannuation eligibility. Mr Crean-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The information sought is not available for private tor schemes. All six State Governments have superannuation schemes that make separate provision for those employees considered to be of lower medical standard at entry to the scheme. (2) (a) The Western Australia State Government Superannuation Scheme makes such a provision by way of a separate Provident of which are held as a pan of the State Superannuation Fund, (b) All the other five State Government schemes provide for employees of lower medical standard to be included proposed scheme for Australian public servants. (3) The times at which members of the schemes referred to in 2 (b) become entitled to full superannuation eligibility are as follows: New South Wales, Victoria-Attainmen t of age 60. Queensland, Tasmania-2 0 years of scheme membership or age 60, whichever is the earlier. South Australia-1 4 years of scheme membership or age 60, whichever is the earlier. Superannuation Schemes: Private Enterprise Mr Snedden asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Can he say the extent to which superannuation schemes in private enterprise provide for the person to claim a lump sum on retirement. (2) For those funds for which such a lump sum is available, can he say whether acceptance ofit reduces the pension that would otherwise be payable or is the lump sum a refund of a contributor's payments. Mr Crean-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A survey examining the characteristics of 703 private sector superannuation schemes with a total membership of over 281,000 persons, undenaken in lace 1972 by the then Depanment of Labour, obtained the following information in answers to questions about NA upon notice were circulated: were payable on normalretirementin schemes covered in the survey: Medical Standard (QuestionNo. 16) Numberof per cent of Benefit schemes schemes superannuation funds in private Lump sum only 430 61 superannuation entitlements of Pension only 18 3 Combination of lump sum and pension 49 7 and (b) are such people incorLump sum or pension at the employee's discretion . . 141 20 Variable at the discretion of 65 9 category of person before they beTotal 703 100 secable(2) The informadon obtained in the survey does not ena precise answer to be given to this question. Bush Fire Brigades (Question No. 18) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Services Account the assets and Property, upon notice: (1) How many Government propenies in non-metropolitan areas are serviced by bush fire brigades. (2) Where are the properties located. in a single scheme as in the Mr Daly-The answer to the right honourable member's quesuon is as follows: To answer a question of such scope, fully and accurately, would take an inordinate amount of time and effon because: (a) Such information is not onrecordand is not readily available; (b) All Australian Government Departments would have to be consulted; (c) It would be necessary to estabUsh whether each property is serviced by a bush fire brigade or an urban fire brigade. For example, in New South Wales alone, (Question No. 17) approximately 4,000 Australian Government properties are dispersed throughout the State and are serviced by numerous urban brigades and 2,485 bush fire brigades scattered throughout ISI municipalities; (d) This problem is rendered more difficult by the fact that: (i) practices in this regard vary from State to State; and (ii) the boundaries of the areas of responsibility of the different types of fire brigades do not necessarily follow any established demarcation line such as local government boundaries. If the Leader of the Opposition would care to indicate the reason for the question I shall study the matter further to ascertain whether the inordinate amount of time and effort involved is warranted or, alternatively, to investigate whether there is some other way of assisting him in this the form in which benefits matter. Cockburn Sound: Naval Facilities Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Is there an understanding with the British and United States Governments that their naval facilities to be established at Cockburn Sound.",70
237,Mr BARNARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are long-standing arrangements under which ships from the navies of friendly and allied countries visit each other's ports and facilities, by permission in each case of the host Government. When the facility at Cockburn Sound is completed I would expect that under these arrangements there would be calls there too from ume to time by ships from friendly and allied navies, including the UN and RN. No arrangements beyond this long-standing practice have been entered into or are contemplated. North West Cape Communications Station Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) What will be the total esumated annual cost to the Government as a result of the arrangements for the manmng and administration of the North West Cape Communications Station following his announced on 10 January 1974.",72
238,Mr BARNARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The total annual cost to the Australian Government for the manning and administration of the North West Cape facility is estimated at $600,000 of which $30,000 is directly attributable to the maintenance of Australian personnel at North West Cape. Theremaining$550,000 is for the normal pay and allowances of the personnel located at the base. Army Base: Western Australia Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Did he state on 7 March 1974 that no plan to establish an Army base in Western Australia is being considered by the Government. (2) Did he also sayrecentlyin Western Australia that such a plan is in fact under consideration.

(4) What stage has (a) considerauon (b) planning or (c) establishment reached in each case.",72
239,Mr BARNARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) In my response to the question without notice asked by the honourable member for Stirling on 7 March 1974 (Hansard page 140) I indicated that there were no plans for development of an Army base as such in Western Australia. I made it quite clear that what was under auon was the acquisidon of a ity of Yampi Sound as part of the Government's poUcy in relation to the defence of continental Australia. The area would be used for Joint Service Advanced Tactical Training. (Question No. 19) I personally inspected a possible location last March and any statements attributed to merecentlyin thisregardrefer to the acquisition of a training area. Some development would ofcourse be necessary to provide facilities for training exercises. Forces will be able to use the (3) and (4) There are at present no proposals for new major Defence establishments in Western Australia but a number of exisung facilities are being improved or modified in the course of the normal works program. Work is proceeding on the construction of the naval support facility on Garden Island in Cockburn Sound and present planning envisages completion by the end of 1978, except for the Armament Depot and Jetty and the large ships wharf. The expansion and redevelopment of Learmonth Airfield is also in hand and completion is scheduled for September 1974. Immigration Planning Council (Question No. 24) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: (Question No. 20) (1) Has the Immigration Planning Council recommended that the migranr intake be increased to 135,000. (2) If so, has the Government agreed to this proposal; if not, why was the proposal rejected.",72
240,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The reply to the right honourable member's question is as follows: negotiations in Washington, as (1) The Immigration Planning Council at its meeting on 18 March 1974 considered the labour market situation at that time and recommended an immigration program for 1974-75 based on a gross settler arrival figure of 135,000 persons. (2) The program for 1973-74 was 110,000. The Government has announced that it will aim for a total intake of not more than 80,000 during the current financial year, of which assisted migration would be not more than 40,000. This is considered appropriate in the existing circumstances. Illegal Immigrants (Question No. 23) (Question No. 25) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: (1) Did his predecessor state on 30 March 1974 that the Labor Government had inherited 18,000 illegal immigrants from the previous government. (2) If so, how many of these were located in each State. (3) What are the equivalent ngures for each State now.",72

The figure of 18,000 was based on a departmental estimate of the number of persons who since 1 January 1965 had either entered or remained in Australia in circumstances under which they had become 'prohibited immigrants'. Disconsider- tribution by States is not available. large training area in the vicinArevisedestimate, as at 30 June 1974, is 20,000-21,000.

Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Pan 6 of the Navigation Act and the Navigation (Manning and Coasting Trade) Regulations govern the carriage of passengers by foreign vessels on the Australian coast. (2) Section 286 of the Navigation Act 1912-1973 provides that where no licensed ship is an unlicensed British ship over an unlicensed foreign ship.

Naval Personnel: Foul Weather Clothing Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Has the Navy received any complaints about the quality of its foul weather clothing issue. (2) Is it generally considered vided by the Army and the Air Force.",76
246,Mr BARNARD,OTHER RESEARCH PROJECTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Very few complaints have beenreceivedregardingthe quality of foul weather clothing issued to Naval personnel. (2) There is no evidence that the foul weather clothing provided for Naval personnel is in any way inferior clothing provided for members of the other two Services. Certain specialised garments of heavier materials are issued to members whose duties involve exposure over to heavy rain or spray, but the normal Naval foul weather clothing used by the large majority of Naval personnel very similar to that provided made from material to a Defence Specification which is common to all three Services.

248,Mr BARNARD,OTHER RESEARCH PROJECTS,"The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) No. The train is used by civilian passengers also. (2) and (3) During 1974 I understand the train has carried an average of 130 naval Point to Spencer Street and 15 for the return trip. I am not aware how many civilians have used the service. (4) No charge is made to the Department of Defence. Passengers are required to purchase a return ticket at their own expense. (5) Alternative arrangements would entail cost to the Department of Defence in terms offinanceand manpower. (6) There are buses at HMAS 'Cerberus' provided for duty travel. They are not to cater for leave travel. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) What is the target strength of the Naval Police. (2) How many Naval Police are there at present. (3) How many of these have been transferred from other duties to alleviate the shonfall.",82
249,Mr BARNARD,OTHER RESEARCH PROJECTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The target strength of the Naval Police is 365.

(QuestionNo. 171) (2) l f so, to which works and studies was he referring. (3) Which of those works or studies specifically recommend the extension of direct controls to non-bank financial intermediaries. Mr Crean-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) There were a large number of theoretical works and empirical studies produced in the 1950s and 1960s which deal with the subject of non-bank financial institutions and it would not be practicable to makereferenceto them all. The publication 'Bibliography of Australian Finance 1900-1968' issued by the Reserve Bank in 1971 contains a bibliography of some of the works and studies undertaken in Australia. The publication of the Federal Reserve Board, Washington, in 1965, 'Monetary Theory and Policy: A Bibliography' is a bibliography of some of the studies undertaken overseas. However, specific attendon might be drawn to the following major (Question No. 201) works and studies: J. G. Gurley and E. S. Shaw: 'Money in a Theory of Finance', Brookings Institution, Washington (1960). 'Financial Aspects of Economic Development', American Economic Review, September 1955. D. Patinkin: 'Financial Intermediaries and the Logical Structure of Monetary Theory', American Economic Review, March 1961. J. Tobin and W. C. Brainard: 'Financial Intermediaries and the Effectiveness of Monetary Controls', Cowles Foundation Paper No. 194, Yale (1963). G. Clayton: 'British Financial Intermediaries in Theory and Practice'Economic Journal, December 1962. W. L. Smith: 'Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Controls', Quarterly Journal of Economics, November 1959. R. W. Goldsmith: 'Financial Intermediaries in the American Economy since 1900', Princeton for National Bureau of Economic Research, 1958. Reserve Bank of Australia: 'Flow of Funds, Australia', Staff Paper and subsequent supplements to Statistical Bulletin. W. P. Hogan: 'Monetary Policy and the Financial Intermediaries', Economic Record, December I960. (3) Many of the major theoretical works relating to the activities of non-bank financial intermediaries are concerned with showing the ways in which these activities can influence of monetary and economic conditions rather than exploring the practical policy implications and making recommendations thereon. However, a recommendation that direct controls be extended to non-bank financial institutions is implicit in a number of works, such as those undertaken by Gurley and Shaw and G. Clayton, which are generally accepted as major studies in this area. Government Office Accommodation Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Services and Property, upon notice: Does the Government intend to pursue a target of 75 per cent ownership of Government office accommodation within 10 years. Mr Daly-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. This is a target figure. tive can be achieved will depend on the resources which it will be possible to allocate to it. Army: Rottnest Island Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Has the Government completed its examination of the possibility of releasing land under the control of the Australian Army on Rottnest Island. (2) If so, what is the outcome. (3) If not, when is it expected that the examination will be completed.

252,Mr BARNARD,OTHER RESEARCH PROJECTS,"The answer to the right honour(Question No. 233) able member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) Rottnest Island consists of some 1800 hectares of which the Army currently controls some 50 hectares centred around Kingston Barracks. The area is used extensively for military training purposes, particularly by the Special Air Service Regiment and Army Reserve personnel. In addiuon, a number of parcels ofland previously under Army control and totalling 56 hectares was offered to the Western Australian Government in 1969 but the transfer did not eventuate because of differences of opinion on value. The extent to which the objecIn June, the Prime Minister wrote to the Premier of Western Australia proposing, in respect of the areas originally offered in 1969, to dedicate them, subject to conditions to be mutually agreed upon, for tourism, park and recreational purposes to be vested in trustees under Section 54 of the (Question No. 236) Lands Acquisidon Act. The Army occupied land continues to be required for defence purposes. However, the Prime Minister has asked the Premier for details of how the Western Australian Government intended to use the areas on Rottnest Island, including the areas occupied by the Army, and has proposed an indepth study, which would have regard to all interests involved, with the object of arriving at a mutually acceptable solution.

260,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OTHER RESEARCH PROJECTS,"I am informed that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As at 29 July 1974 there were 173 persons in the Geelong employment district receiving special benefits due to retrenchmentsresultingfrom Government action in relation to structural adjustment. have not been completed, when is Superannuation Fund: Distribution of Surplus (Question No. 478) Mr Hunt asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Will he ensure that (a) all who contributed to the Superannuation Fund during the period in which the surplus was amassed will share in the disbursement in proportion to their contributions, (b) any person who resigned, retired or was retrenched and accepted a lump sum settlement, during or after the period of the assessment, will not be disadvantaged and (c) where applicable, former members' dependants or estates will not be disadvantaged. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Distribution to contributors to the pension scheme and pensioners of the surplus disclosed by the Tenth Quinquennial Investigation of the Superannuation Fund as at 30 June 1972 will be made in accordance with the Superannuation (Distribution of Surplus) Act 1974. The Act, which received the Royal Assent on 11 April 1974, adopts the principles of the 1965 legislation for the distribution of the surplus in the Fund as at 30 June 1962. (Question No. 432) The answers to the three points raised in the question are: (a) The persons who are ehgible to participate in the distribution are defined in section 3 of the Act. The allocation between eligible persons will have regard to actuarial principles and practice and take into account all matters relevant to ensure that the allocation is on a fair and reasonable basis. (b) In accordance with the Act, a person whose obligation to contribute to the pension scheme commenced before 30 June 1972 and ceased on or before 10 April 1974 and who resigned or retired and received a refund of his contributions or was retrenched and accepted a lump sum payment, will not participate in the distribution. (c) Where an eligible contributor or eligible pensioner has died, the amount of any entitlement will be paid to the widow or, where there is no widow, to such other person or persons as the Superannuation Board determines.

262,Mr WHITLAM,OTHER RESEARCH PROJECTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. South Vietnam: Financial Aid Mr MCKenzie asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Did representatives of the Australian Government take pan in a secret meeting of the World Bank in Paris during the period 10 to 14 October 1973 called for the express purpose of raising a large loan for the use of the Thieu Administration. of (2) If so, has the Australian Government made any subsequent commitments to the World Bank, or any of its agencies, concerning such aid. (3) How much of the proposed contribution of $27m by to the Asian Development Bank will go to the Thieu Administration in the form of long term loans with special conditions, and what are the special conditions. (4) Is it a fact that both the World Bank and the Asian claims Development Bank have each made a firm decision not to give any aid to the Provisional Revolutionary Government. (5) If so, does any decision by the Australian Government Medical Hospital to contribute funds to the World Bank and the Asian State and Fund claims claims Development Bank which are then made available to one administration only in South Vietnam conflict with the provisions of the Pans Peace Agreement which clearly recog35 28 nises that the two administrations in South Vietnam are to be . . 18 18 treated with strict equality. 14 7 (6) Wiil he take steps to see that, infinancialmatters affecting South Vietnam, the Australian Government will 21 adhere strictly to the provisions of the Paris Agreement as 23 undertaken in statements by the Prime Minister on 28 January 1973 and IS March 1973. 15 15 Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable 23 20 member's question is as follows: (1) Representatives of the Australian Government 11 15 attended a meeung of interested donor countries in Paris on 16 October 1973 to discuss the possible establishment of an 5 5 aid group for Indo-China. The meeting was not secret and did not discuss the raising of any loan for South Vietnam. (2) No. 20 4 6 3 (3) Australia's proposed contribution of $US27m to the 5 5 Asian Development Fund will be used by the Asian Development Bank in accordance with agreed procedures to extend loans on concessional terms for projects in its poorer 5 3 member countries. It is not possible, therefore, to say what 5 2 percentage of these funds might go to any particular recipient. Loans made from the Asian Development Fund bear an 14 21 interest rate of 1 per cent and are repayable over 40 years, with a grace period of 10 years. 2 4 (4) The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank can lend only to member countries. Any country which is a member of the International Monetary Fund can apply for membership of the World Bank and any country which is a member or an associate member of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, (Question No. 513) or a member of the United Nations or of any of its specialised agencies, can apply for membership of the Asian Development Bank. The Provisional Revolutionary Government is not currently a member of either the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank. It is therefore not eligible for loans from these institutions. In practice, neither the World Bank nor its affiliate the Internauonal Development Association have extended any loans to any of their member countries in Indo-China. (5) and (6) The Australian Government is not a party to the Paris Agreements but has stated its support for them as offering the best prospects for peace in Vietnam. The contribution of Australian funds to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, pan of which might subsequently (QuestionNo. 521) be channelled to South Vietnam, would not conflict with the provisions of the Paris Agreements. While the Agreements refer to the 'two South Vietnamese parties' (i.e. the Provisional Revolutionary Government and the Government of Vietnam), they do not do so on the basis of any assumption or stipulation that the two South Vietnamese parties have the same international legal status or are to be treated with strict equality by others. It is relevant that the International Conference on Vietnam held in Paris in March 1973 saw fit to include in its Final Act a penultimate sentence which read: 'Signature of this Act does not constitute recognition of any party in any case in which it has not previously been accorded. ' This was an imponant provision, required as much by North Vietnam, the PRG, the USSR. and China (in relation to their non-recognition of the Government of Vietnam) as by the Umted States, South Vietnam, France, Britain, Canada, etc. which do not recognise the PRG. Australian aid to South Vietnam is not directed exclusively to the Government of Vietnam. The Australian Government has also provided aid to areas under PRG control through multilateral bodies such as the Indo-China Operational Group of the International Red Cross and the United Nations Childrens Fund.

I added that Australia had made its opposition felt in relation to the recent French tests and that it was no less opposed to Chinese tests. (4) I have on numerous occasions reiterated the Government's pohcy of total opposition to the testing of nuclear devices in the atmosphere by any State. For instance, as recently as 17 and 18 June and 8 July 1974 I have expressed my opposition to such testing terms, namely, that the tests conducted by both countries are a matter of deep concern to the Australian Government (5) and (6) See answer to pan (4).

State Decentralisation Subsidies Mr Snedden asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to criticism that has been directed towards the Government because of its treatment of State decentralisation subsidies as normal operating income of companies and thereby liable to tax. (2) What is his atdtude to the criticism that this hampers the decentralisation promotion Mr Crean-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Representations have been received on this matter. (2) In reply it has been pointed out that the Australian Government and the several State Governments provide a wide range of subsidies to enterprises for various purposes. Where these subsidies take the are required to be brought to account as assessable income; where they come in an indirect way, for example, through reductions in the prices of inputs, they would automatically be reflected in income levels. There is nothing contrary to equity or good sense in this. Whatever their form, the subsidies result in an enhancement of the financial posidon of the enterprises which benefit by them and it is proper that they pay more tax accordingly. It would certainly be anomalous if subsidies like a pay-roll taxrebatewere exempt from tax while the additional income generated through other kinds of subsidies continued to be subject to tax in the ordinary way. It has also been pointed out allowed under the old export incentive scheme were included in assessable income up to the time the pay-roll tax was transferred to the States and that the grants based on notional pay-roll tax which have replaced the rebates are similarly treated. There would be some inconsistency if the Austrahan Government taxed rebates given under its own jurisdiction but exempted those given under State jurisdiction. Finally, I mention that State schemes of pay-roll tax rebates have the effect of encouraging a dispersed approach to decentralisation. The policy of the Australian Government, on the other hand, is one of promoting the accelerated growth of selected centres. on a pilot basis for a period Department of Minerals and Energy: Council for the Single Mother Management Consultant Firms (Question No. 790) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Minerals and Energy, upon nodce: (1) For what purpose has the Department used management consultantfirmsin the last 12 months.

Industrial Relations: Inquiry Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: When will the Government establish the promised inquiry into all aspects of industrialrelationsin Australia.",104
287,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,VICTORIA,"I am informed that the answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: There remains a pressing need to consider what might be done to promote sound and effective cies in Australia in the longer term and to ensure that the machinery and the procedures for implementing policies are the best that can be devised. However, an inquiry to investigate and report on means of achieving these longer-term objectives cannot be undertaken until there is a greater degree of stability in the current state of industrial not be achieved until legislation to remendy existing deficiencies in the Conciliation and Arbtration Act is passed by both Houses of this Parliament. Accordingly, it is in the hands of the right honourable gentleman and his party to determine when the inquiry will proceed.

(2) Has his attention been drawn, for example, to the anomaly that the Government has created whereby regular servicemen and servicewomen who have completed three years effective full-time service on or after 7 December 1972 are eligible for a loan no matter where they served. (3) Will he give an assurance that the Act will be amended to meet the ex-servicewomen's request.",104
288,Mr LES JOHNSON,VICTORIA,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) Upon taking office in 1972, the Labor Government undertook a comprehensive review of the then War Service Homes Scheme and made several major changes which were incorporated in the Defence Service Homes Act 1973. Among other things, the changes included an extension of the eligibility provisions to include a person who has served on continuous full-time service as a member of the Defence Force, not being service that ended before 7 December 1972 and, during that service, has, whether before or after that date, completed three years' effective full time service as such a member. This extension which was foreshadowed in the Prime Minister's elecuon policy speech, was brought about because of the Government's decision to abolish conscription into the armed forces and to fulfil its stated aim of introducing conditions of service that will attract and retain regular service personnel in peacetime. In the course of the review, the question of extending the Defence Service Homes Scheme to members of the Citizen Military Force and the Women's Forces, who served in Australia during the 1939-4S War, was considered, but it was decided that, for the time being at least, there would be no change in the eligibility conditionsrelatingto service in (Question No. 563) these Forces in the 1939-45 War. The matter is, of course, being kept in mind for consideration along with other possible future changes in the Defence Service Homes Act, but as it involves a question of future Government policy I cannot give any indication whether the Act will be amended to cover service within Australia during the 1939-45 War. Nuclear Weapons Testing by China and Russia (Question No. 660) Mr Garland asked the Minister representing industrial relations polithe Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) Did the Government deliver protest notes to the Chinese and French Governments on 18 June 1974 for exploding nuclear devices in the atmosphere; if not, what form of protest took place; if so, were the notes in the same terms, relations.

United Nations University  the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) What is the United Nations University. (2) What is Australia's attitude to it.",105
290,Mr WHITLAM,VICTORIA,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Suggestions about a United Nations University were first put forward by the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, in 1969. In 1972 the 27th General Assembly authorised the establishment of an International University which would consist of a Headquarters and Coordinating Centre together with a decentralised system of associated and affiliated universities throughout the world. In 1973 an offer ofafinancialcontribution of US 100m from Japan gave impetus to the project, and in November of that year a General Assembly resolution adopted a charter for the University and approved that its headquarters be located in Tokyo. Unlike the traditional concept of a post-secondary or graduate institution providing training of an educational and professional nature towards the granting of degrees to persons of a certain age group, the United Nations University is visualised as an inter-connected world-wide system of academic institutions devoted to advanced research and training, through an interdisciplinary approach, on problems of human survival, development and welfare. The official languages of the University are to be the official languages of the United Nations: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish and Russian. (2) The Australian Government supported the United Nations General Assembly Resolution which adopted a charter for the University and located the headquarters of the University in Tokyo. The University Council, in its first Session, has given preliminary consideration to the University's priorities and has made an appeal for funds. The Government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, is following the Council's deliberations with sympathetic interest, but the question offinancialsupport has been deferred until the University's objectives and organisational structure have been defined in more detail.

(2) If so, has the Advisory Group suggested measures to improve international and national contacts between young people. (3) If so, what are these proposals, what action has the Australian Government taken on them, and what further action is proposed.",105
292,Mr WHITLAM,VICTORIA,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The United Nations Secretary-General's report on the 'World Social Situation of Youth: Its Needs and Aspirations' has not itself resulted in the establishment of an Advisory Group. However, a General Assembly resolution on the question of'measures to be taken to establish channels of communication with youth and international youth organisations' adopted in December 1972, approved the convening of an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Youth, which met from 20 to 28 August 1973. (2) Yes. (3) The Secretary-General in his report of 4 February 1974 endorsed a number of recommendations arising from the Report of the Advisory Group, which relate to measures to improve international and national contacts between young people, as follows: (a) Promotion of development education and public information programs, the encouragement of contact between youth organisations at the international level, and of youth participation in the service of the (Question No. 698) United Nations and United Nations programs. (b) Assistance to Governments and United Nations organs, especially the regional economic commissions, to prepare systematic programs and series of projects to increase the involvement of youth in national development and in the promotion of human rights, with particular reference to the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. (c) Exchanges among bodies having special social and scientific knowledge of concerns related to youth, and the establishment of research projects on youth and eduction curricula on human rights, particularly in the UN University. (d) Elaboration of programs for seminars and symposia on youth within the framework of the program of advisory services of the United Nations, by: (i) The Commission on Human Rights (ii) The Commission on the Status of Women (iii) Regional Economic Commissions. The Australian Government is studying these recommendations. The Secretary-General has proposed that additional meetings of the Advisory Group question funher in 1974 and 1975. ILO Convention on Occupational Cancer Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: When will the Government ratify the ILO Convention on occupational cancer.",105
293,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,VICTORIA,"I am informed that the answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: I am flattered that the right honourable member would expect a decision as to ratification of ILO Convention No. 139-Occuptiona l Cancer, 1974 to be imminent within a matter of weeks after its adoption International Labour Conference on 24 June 1974. As yet copies of the authentic text of the Convention have not been received by my Depanment. As soon as copies are available they will be forwarded for advice regarding current law and practice and expen views regarding ratification to the appropriate federal and state authorities, the subject matter of the Convention being applicable is therefore too early to indicate when a decision can be made regarding ratification. I can advise, however, that the Australian Government delegates to the Conference voted in favour of adoption of both the Convention and its accompanying Recommendation. Briefly, the Convention commits tation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers concerned to determine periodically which carcinogenic subsunces and agents should be prohibited or controlled; to replace them where possible by non-carcinogenic or less harmful substances and agents; to reduce both the number of workers exposed to carcinogenic substances and agents and the degree of such exposure to the minimum compatible with safety; to prescribe protective measures; to provide workers with all the available information on the dangers involved and on the measures to be taken; to monitor exposed workers' health during the period of employment and thereafter; and to give effect to these provision by laws or other methods. I welcome the right honourable member's question which indicates some awareness of the significance of the work of the ILO. For its pan, the Government attaches considerable imponance to the ratification of ILO Conventions and since taking office has taken positive action to improve the poor record which Australia previously had in this respect. No doubt the right honourable member will be aware that 7 ILO Conventions have been ratified in the past 21 months including 3 Conventions dealing with basic humanrights.Moreover, Australia was thefirstcountry to ratify Convention No. 137-Doc k Work, 1973; the ratification took place on 25 June 1974, exactly 12 months after the Convention was adopted. Australia has now. ratified a total of 40 ILO Conventions and continuing action will be taken funher to improve our ratification record.

(2) What is the total area of rain forest in the District.",107
297,Dr CASS,VICTORIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I sought information on the matter from the Queensland State Minister for Lands and Forestry, the Honourable W. A. R. Rae, M.L.A. He has advised me that it is not possible to provide precise figures without a great deal of research in the field to establish the original limits of the rain forest and the purpose of any clearing that has been conducted.

The economies against daily hire are an important factor here. At present one bus from 'Lonsdale' and Maribyrnong, both normallyfilledand supplemented necessary by Service transport are being personnel to Williamstown.

As the Australian Dairy Industry Council is not a statutory body, I am not able-and indeed I would not wish-to intervene in the internal arrangements of any organisation set up by the industry itself. (2) Government policy provides, in relation to statutory vacant marketing boards, for adequaterepresentationof primary producers and for professional experts, where appointed, to be independent of vested and/or conflicting interests. Within Mr that general policy I believe that membership of statutory boards should comprise those most competent to assist the particular industry. This applies to the Australian Dairy Produce Board.

The Community Mental Health, Alcoholism and Drug Dependency Program is based on the Mental Health and Related Services Assistance Act 1973. It provides for 100 per cent Australian Government funding of community based mental health, alcoholism and drug dependency projects in 1973-74 and 1974-75, and allocates $7.5m for that purpose in each of those two years. After 1974-75, the Community Mental Health Program will be encompassed by the more broadly based Community Health Program. The latter Program provided SlOm on a 100 per cent Australian Government funding basis in 1973-74. Australian Government funding of capital costs under the Community Health Program in 1974-75 and 1975-76 will be on a 75 per cent basis. Islanders Both Programs enable Australian Government financial (Question No. 369) assistance to be provided for the capital costs of community (rather than insututionally) orientedresidentialfacilities for the mentally ill and intellectually handicapped, and for alcoholics and drug dependent persons. Indeed, substantial Australian Government capital assistance was provided under those Programs in 1973-74, for such facUities. (a) Fiji, (b) Tonga, (c) WestTwenty-seven projects including or involving the provision of land or buildings for hostel accommodation for mentally ill or intellectually handicapped persons were approved for Australian Government funding. These projects attracted a total allocation of over $3.7m. An additional $154,000 was allocated to another nine projects involving the furnishing and equipping of existing premises for use as hostels for the mentally ill and intellectually handicapped. Over $lm was allocated to another eleven projects that included the provision of hostel accommodation for alcohoUcs or drug dependent persons. With regard to the Victorian situation, it is relevant that, because of the Australian Government's desire to have the States' co-operation in these Programs, projects are not generally funded unless they are sponsored by the State authorities. The Victorian proposals originally submitted for 1973-74 contained only one project involving residential accommodation. As announced in my press statement of 9 May 1974, (Question No. 417) $964,000 of the original 1973-74 allocation of $2m to Victoria under the Community Mental Program was not utilised by that State and was re-allocated to other States. Shortly after that statement, the Victorian Minister of Health requested Australian Government funds for the purchase of two properties-on e at Balwyn and the other at Middle Park-for use as mental health hostels. On 11 June 1974,1 approved the allocation of $1,270,000 for that purpose, under the Community Health Program. The question of future support forresidentialaccommodation of the mentally ill and intellectually handicapped has been considered by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission and is dealt with in its 'Report on Hospitals in Australia', which was tabled in Parliament on 10 April 1974. It is a matter of some interest that Victoriarefusedto participate in the hospital statistical study carried out throughout Australia as background to that Report. The Government is giving detailed consideration to the recommendations in that Repon. 30 June 1973, the States Grants Registration of Drug Addicts (Question No. 420) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: Does he suppon the view that there should be a national register of drug addicts.",111

309,Dr CASS,VICTORIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, according to press releases. This pollution was the subject of litigation between the US. Jusuce Department and the Reserve Mining Company. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) Official US. sources are reported as indicating that tailings from the Silver Bay plant contain 'iron, manganese, phosphorous, chlorides and other substances'. An article by Louis Goth in the New York Times of 9 June 1974 refers to 'asbestos-like substances which may cause cancer' but these are not mentioned by the official sources nor in geological of the area. (5) No other information is available to my Department on the overseas activities of Armco to indicate whether the company has followed desirable or undesirable environmental practices. (6) Yes. The Department ofHealth has advised that State Mines Departments and Divisions of Occupational Health undertake occupational hygiene surveys in plants where asbestos is an atmosphere contaminant. SerLarge industrial organisauons which process and fabricate asbestos normally provide biological and environmental monitoring programs. The West Australian Department of Public Health has investigated the health status up to the present time of . workers at Wittenoom Gorge Mine which closed in 1966. Until the present ume 137 cases of asbestosis have been recognised in Wittenoom miners. Ofthose surveyed 23 are known to have died, including S from pleural mesothelioma and 4 from carcinoma of lung. Further cases of both morbidity and mortality can be expected. AusThe National Health and Medical Research Council in November 1973 endorsed its Draft Model Asbestos Reguladons. The States are still considering adoption of these Regulations. Establishment of a Bureau of Animal Health Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Does the Government intend to establish a Bureau of Animal Health; if so, when.

310,Dr EVERINGHAM,VICTORIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The matter is primarily one for the Minister for Agriculture. However, the honourable member will be aware that, as foreshadowed in its Rural PoUcy Speech, the Government has recently announced that it will establish a Bureau of Animal Health. (2) & (3) The Government's announcement indicated that the Bureau will be established within the Department of Agriculture. Australian Film and Television Board Mr Giles asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Has the Government announced its intention to replace the Film and Television Board with an Australian film authority. (2) Does the Government see the danger of appointing people who may have a vested interest on to such an authority. (3) What protection can smaller firms in the smaller States expect from such an authority. (4) Has an audit been made of the expenditure of the FUm and Television Board; if so, has it been made pubUc; if not, why not.",113
311,Mr WHITLAM,VICTORIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) It is not the Government's intention to replace the FUm and Television Board with an Australian film authority. (4) The Australian Council for the Arts and its seven constituent Boards are presently pan of the Depanment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and details of their expenditure are subject to audit and repon to the Parliament by the Auditor-General. The reports made to the Parliament are in turn subject to examination mittee. SimUar conditions will apply to the Australian Council when it becomes a statutory authority. Burdekin Dam Project: Feasibility Study Mr Bonnett asked the Minister for Northern Development, upon notice: What is the current state of progress of the feasibility being undertaken by the Government on the Burdekin Dam Project.",113
312,Dr PATTERSON,VICTORIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government together with the Queensland Government established a Burdekin Project (Question No. 504) Committee in September 1973 to set in train and supervise a comprehensive program of investigations into the potential for development of the resources of the basin on the Burdekin River and its tributaries for industrial, mining, urban and agricultural uses, hydro-electricity generation and for flood mitigation. The investigations cover aU feasible storage sites and water uses and, accordingly, should be distinguished from a feasibUity study of the Burdekin Dam Project alone. be transferred to the Department As informadon becomes available the Committee will examine potential development options for various needs. During 1973-74, the Burdekin Project Committee initiated engineering studies at varying levels of detaU on potential storage sites on the Burdekin River. Preliminary investigations were carried out on suitable storage sites on the Belyando, Suttor, Cape and Campasperivers,tributaries of the Burdekin River. Groundwater investigations in the basin during 1973-74 included test bore drilling and geological mapping. Commercial irrigation trials were carried out at Millaroo Research Station on a range of potential production possibilities. A new field research station was established on the right bank of the Lower Burdekin River to test the potential, under simulated commercial conditions, of soil groupings (Question No. 514) not present at the MUlaroo Research Station. Soil surveys on the right bank of the Lower Burdekin River have been commenced as well as an assessment of the salinity and fertility status of these soUs. Catchment erosion and land capabUity studies were also commenced and appropriate mapping studies are in progress. Representative erosion measurement stations have been installed. A start has also been made on possible environmental consequences of various development options and on the potential for industrial development in the Burdekin Basin. The 1974-75 program of investigations will entail a continuation of the broad spectrum of investigations commenced in 1973-74, with relatively more emphasis on investigations into the potential for industrial development in the basin and neighbouring areas of economic influence. It is also planned to commence investigations during the coming financial year into the potential for hydro and thermal power generation in the Burdekin Basin. The scope of the 1974-75 program of investigations will depend on the extent of financial allocations by the Australian and State Governments. Public Service Act: Disciplinary Provisions (Question No. 545) Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon by the PubUc Accounts Comnotice: Does he support the recommendation by the Joint Council of the Australian Public Service for changes to the disciplinary provisions of the PubUc Service Act to prevent unnecessary restriction being placed on the private lives of public (Question No. 531) servants.",113
313,Mr WHITLAM,VICTORIA,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: The PubUc Service Board has not yet completed its examstudy ination of the recommendations by the Joint Council for changes to the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act and Regulations. The Royal Commission into the Australian Public Service will also be considering the subject of discipline. The Government will consider in the light of its policy any recommendations on the disciplinary provisions which the Board or the Royal Commission, or both, may make. The right honourable member will be aware that it is the policy of this Government that public servants should have the maximum possible freedom to exercise the social and politicalrightsenjoyed by other citizens. Consistent with this approach, I announced on 2 June 1974 that the Governor General had approved a regulation made by the Public Service Board to repeal Public Service Regulation 34(b) which prohibited public comment by public servants on administrative matters. Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: Does the Government acceptance for the establishment of intake centres for alcoholics or people affected by alcoholism; if so, when will it provide such assistance.",113
314,Dr EVERINGHAM,VICTORIA,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The Government's recognition of the urgent need to provide financial assistance as well as persons suffering from mental illness and drug abuse, is reflected in the provisions of the Mental Health and Related Services Assistance Act 1973. That Act authorises Federal grants of up to $7.5m each year in 1973-74 and 1974-75 fbr approved projects under the Commumty Mental Health, Alcoholism and Drug Dependency Program. After June 1975, such assistance vided, but under the more broadly based Community Health Program. Not only intake and assessment centres, but also community oriented facilities and services for the treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics have been funded under the Community Mental Health, Alcoholism and Drug Dependency Program. In 1973-74, allocations were made for the following projects deahng wholly or panly with alcoholism: Australian Foundation on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Blacktown Main Community Centre Parramatta Main Community Centre Sydney City Main Community Centre Bondi Beach Shop Front Centre Hillsdale Shop Front Centre Manly Main Community Centre Chatswood Main Community Centre Wollongong Main Community Centre Hurstville/ICogarah Main Community Centre Newcasde City Main Community Centre Sydney City Mission, Surry Hills Salvation Army, Sydney Way Back Committee-Wester n Metropolitan Region Salvation Army Women's Hostel Salvation Army Men's Hostel Preston Assessment Centre Moreland Hall Family Care Centre Fitzroy Detoxification Centre Victorian Foundation on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Queensland Brisbane Supervised Hostel Brisbane Supervised Hostel Ipswich Supervised Hostel Townsville Supervised Hostel Toowoomba Supervised Hostel Brisbane City Outpatients Assessment and Treatment Clinic Rockhampton Supervised Hostel South Australia Adelaide Regional Referral Clinic Adelaide Rehabilitation Centre Alcoholism Adelaide' Drop-In' Centre (Question No. 555) Tasmania Community Services (Mental health, alcoholism and drug dependency), Hoban. the need for financial assistCouncil of Nature Conservation Ministers (Question No. 583) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for the Environment and Conservation, upon notice: (1) When has the Council of Nature Conservauon Ministers met. for the treatment of alcoholics, (2) Who has attended the meetings.

(12) Is trapping recommended by the World Health Organisation on older vessels of this type.",115
321,Dr EVERINGHAM,VICTORIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I ) and(2)Yes. (3) 18 and 26 June 1974. (4) Rat droppings and gnaw marks of rats were found in the mid section and forepeak, but none in the holds. It was estimated that the rat population was about ten. (5) On 19 June 1974 it was decided not to fumigate the ship with hydrocyanic acid gas because(a) 1080 poison baiting had resulted four carcases and seven baits had been partially eaten. Another carcase wasrecoveredseveral days later. (b) Infestation was limited peak of the vessel. (c) The vessel was due to be fumigated mide for grain pests under the Expon (Grain) Regulations. This fumigation also kills rats. (6) Baiting is considered successful if a large proportion bodies of dead rats is found after a has been eaten. (7) A Quarantine Assistant Grade 3 belonging to my Deinternational partment inspected the holds under the Expon Regulations and issued a fumigation order on behalf of the Australian Department of Agriculture. (8) The standard rat guards used by this vessel were acceptable under Quarantine (General) Regulations. Guards, however, in high winds may become displaced. An officer my Department ensures that when this occurs the guards are resecured. (9) (a) and (b) No. It wasreportedon 26 June that the M.V. 'Lorana' were faulty, or not in position so that refuse had spilled over on to the deck attracting sea gulls. I understand that gulls were not seen to eat or take away food scraps. As this could occur in these of the vessel was ordered to take action to prevent spillage of refuse and the drums were emptied early on the following day by the Fremantle Port Authority. (10) Under the name of 'Pennleader', the vessel called Gladstone (Queensland), Chittagong, and Singapore before sailing to Fremantle. The owners renamed the vessel 'Lorana' while at Singapore. (II ) 1 understand the vessel is a converted tanker but unaware of its age. (12) The World Health Organisation in its publication 'Vector Control in International Health' 1972, does not specifically mention methods of vector (includes rodents) control on older vessels. Ships are considered as warehouses or hotels, or as a combination of both, simUar to those on land. Ships continually move from place to place and in so doing may transpon insects, rodents other place where they may become established. The World Health Organisation considers that the presence of rodents on board a ship depends on the following factors(a) sanitary conditions in the pons entered, their degree of infestation and, area in which the port is situated; (b) the nature of the cargo taken aboard; (c) the general state of cleanliness of the ship. In regard to trapping, WHO advocates this method of control for rodents taken aboard modern rat-proof ships with cargo. It is only successful in very Umited infestations and if it is appUed very soon after the infestation occurs. Massive infestations are best handled by sanitary measures and a program of poisoning using anticoagulants or acute poisons as dictated by conditions. On some occasions fumigation with toxic gases (hydrocyanic acid gas, for example) may be used but this is a dangerous and inconvenient technique that is best reserved for use when the whole ship can be subjected to fumigation. My Department accepts these guidelines. Perth Airport Incinerator (Question No. 729) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, in the recovery of upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that the incinerator at Perth Airport has not been used for certain periods; if so, for what periods, and to the mid section and forewhy. (2) How is international aircraft garbage disposed of in with methyl brothe event of incinerator faUure. (3) Has the Department received complaints concerning dumping of international aircraft garbage on the Belmont of rubbish tip, or any other tip, in the Perth area; if so, what cenain number of baits action was taken. (4) Does the Department know of cases of the dumping of aircraft garbage on rubbish tips in the Perth (Grain) area; if so, what action has been taken.",116
322,Dr EVERINGHAM,VICTORIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Four incinerators have been installed for use at Perth of Airport consisting of one gas-fired and three wood-fired units. The Department of Transport isresponsiblefor the operation of these incinerators and my Depanment does not keep a record of breakdowns. It has always been possible to dispose of gaUey waste by incineration at anytimeof day or lids on drums of refuse on night. (2) If one incinerator becomes unserviceable, international aircraft garbage is incinerated in one of the other circumstances, the Master units. (3) The Depanment has received no substantiated complaints and the Committee that enquired into quarantine at Fremantle and at Penh Airpon in March 1974 was unable to at establish that international aircraft garbage had been dumped on the Belmont rubbishtip.Consequently no action has been taken in this regard. (4) The Department knows of no cases and the Comam mittee was satisfied that there was no evidence of international aircraft garbage having been dumped on rubbish tips in the Perth area. No action, therefore, has been taken.

These include such things as a suggested administrative iginal and Islander health organisations, the provision of funds for the expansion and extension of existing dental services, the training health fields. The recommendations are included in a report of the proceedings of the Workshop which is being prepared and should be made public in the near future. Grants to Local Government Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Are grants made direct from the Government to local government under the Mental Health, Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Scheme. (2) If so, under what conditions are these direct grants made.",117
325,Dr EVERINGHAM,VICTORIA,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Although Federal grants may be made direct to local government authorities under the Community Mental Health, Alcoholism and Drug Dependency Program, no grants have yet been made to such authorities. With the objective of co-ordination of plications received by the Government for grants to bodies other than State authorities are considered only in the light of advice from the State authorities, and such grants are usually made through the State authorities.

326,Dr EVERINGHAM,VICTORIA,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The survey undertaken by the National Health and Medical Research Council into the smoking habits of Australian school children, a comprehensive study involving over 26,000 children, has been completed. The first phase, consisting of a short re-run of the questions asked in the sur(Question No. 773) vey conducted in 1969, was carried out in June 1973 and the second, the main in-depth analysis, in Septenber-October 1973. (2) Preliminary data from the first phase are currently being analysed and tables prepared. However, results of the second, in-depth, part of the survey will not be available for some time, due to allocation of data processing priorities in the Department to other areas.

The Australian production of (QuestionNo. 175) safflower, because of agronomic problems, has progressively declined over recent years from 3,241 tonnes of oil in 1968-69 to an estimated 1,767 tonnes in 1973-74. Imports of safflower oil in the same period have decreased from 1,957 tonnes to 1,119 tonnes (11 months only). Conversely, the production of sunflower oil has increased greatly from 2,370 tonnes in 1968-69 to an estimated 27,520 tonnes in 1973-74 while imports over this period have been negligible. However, details of each margarine manufacturer's formulations and the specific end uses of poly-unsaturated oils are not available.

However, future demands for umber in Australia as a whole were prepared for the FORWOOD Conference, and presented in the Repon of Panel 6-Marketing . The estimates of demand on a State by State basis which follow have been derived by assuming that the demand for umber in each State will be proportional to the populauon. Estimates of population in 1975 and 1980 on a State by State basis were obtained from the Common1977 1978 1979 wealth Year Book for 1972 and linear increases over this period were assumed. 0.6 0.4 0.2 (6) In the next five years no significant change is likely to 885.1 873.4 861.7 occur in the level of employment in the forestry and timber industries with the exception of logging.

Employment of Overseas Citizens Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: (1) What governments have made formal inquiries of the Government concerning special arrangements for their citizens (a) to work for periods of (i) 6 months or less and (ii) more than 6 months and (b) to migrate to Australia for specified employment since 2 December 1972. (2) What stage have consultations on these inquiries reached in each case.",129
343,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEMAND FOR TIMBER IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I am informed that no formal inquiries have been received since 2 December 1972 from any overseas government seeking special arrangements for their citizens to (a) work temporarily in more than 6 months and (b) to migrate to Australia for specified employment. There was one informal sounding about short term seasonal employment but this was not followed up formally by the Government involved. Inter-Departmental Committee: Development of System of Social Indicators in Australia Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: What progress has been made in the development of a system of social indicators.",129
344,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEMAND FOR TIMBER IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: I refer the right honourable member to my answer to question 765 on 19 September 1973. A meeting of the Working Group of the Inter-Departmental Committee, referred to in that reply, was held late last year. It was agreed at that meeting that Depanments should give detailed consideration to the conceptual framework for social indicator development, focussing on areas of particular concern to them. This process is now nearing completion and it is intended that the Working Group should meet again shortly. As the right honourable member is no doubt aware, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been taking an active interest in this area, and a meeting of the OECD Working Party on Social Indicators is to be held in Paris on 8-11 November. We shall wish to take into account discussions at that meeting in the further developments of the Australian social indicators programme. As I said in my earlier reply, however, this is a most complex project, and I would not therefore expect significant results in the shon term. National Advisory Council on the Needs of the Minister for Overseas Trade in Disabled (Question No. 747) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) When will the Government establish the promised National Advisory Council on the Needs of the Disabled. (2) Will he take action to avoid further delays in its establishment. (Question No. 359)",129
345,Mr HAYDEN,DEMAND FOR TIMBER IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government had indicated its intention to establish a National Advisory Council on the Handicapped. However, some months ago it was decided that the appointment of the Advisory Council on the Handicapped should be delayed until the Repon of the National Rehabilitation and Compensation Inquiry was completed. (2) Volume 1 of the Woodhouse Repon was tabled on 10 July 1974. It is expected that Volume 2 of the Report, which deals predominantly with Rehabilitation aspects, will be tabled during the Budget Session. The terms of reference and composition of the proposed National Advisory Council will be determined and announced after Volume 2 of the Woodhouse Repon has been received. Australia for periods of up to or Social Welfare Commission (Question No. 749) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) What was the intended role of the Social Welfare Commission as at 2 December 1972. (2) What changes have subsequently been made to its (Question No. 741) intended role. (3) What is its present role. (4) What is to be its future role.",129
346,Mr HAYDEN,DEMAND FOR TIMBER IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2), (3) and (4) While no specific mention of the Social Welfare Committee was made in 1972, its principles are implicit in the Government's pre-1972 election statements on the need for a total community approach to welfare. The creation of the Social Welfare Commission in 1973 is one pan of the Government's program to achieve these aims. In answer to the hon. member's question about the role of the Social Welfare Commission and any changes planned for that role, I would refer him to Section 14 of the Social Welfare Commission Act, which states: 14. The functions of the Commission are(a) to ascertain, and report to the Minister on, the social welfare needs of the community and to make recommendations to the Minister in respect of those needs; (b) to make recommendations to the Minister for furthering the achievement welfare plan, including(i) recommendations of priorities in relation to social welfare programs; (ii) recommendations for the development of social welfare programs on a regional basis with localised administration; (iii) recommendations for participation in the implementation of social welfare programs by representauves assisted; (iv) recommendations for the co-ordination of the social welfare activities of organisations, including State, local government and voluntary organisations, involved welfare; (v) recommendations for the adjustment, from time to time, of social changing community circumstances and attitudes and the state of the economy; and (vi) recommendations for avoiding the duplicauon of social welfare programs and for promoting the maximum efficiency and effectiveness of the community social welfare effort; (c) to estimate, and report to the Minister on, the likely cost of proposed social welfare programs and to advise the Minister on the relative priorities to be given to the implementation ofthose programs; (d) to keep social welfare programs under constant review and to re-assess and evaluate those programs in the light of experience; (e) to propose to the Minister measures to give all organthe isations, including State, local government and volunimpose tary organisations, concerned with social welfare access to available information and technical assistance; (f) to consider, and report to the Minister designed to provide implementation of social welfare programs; and (g) such other functions in connection programs as the Minister approves. That role has not been changed and I do not foresee that it will be changed in the future. Management Consultant Firms Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) For what purpose has the Department used management consultant firms in the last 12 months. (2) Which firms have been used. (3) What was the total cost.",129
347,Mr HAYDEN,DEMAND FOR TIMBER IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL,"The answer to therighthonourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The Department of Social Security has not used management consultant firms for any purpose in the last 12 months. However, the Department arranged, on behalf of the Social Welfare Commission, for Mr R. Myers of the University of New South Wales to plan and conduct a training course for Social Planners. Mr Myers was paid an amount of $1,200. Australian Assistance Plan: Administration of a nationally integrated social (Question No. 847) Mr Chipp asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) Who is the officerresponsiblefor administering the Australian Assistance Plan.

(5) What is his experience in Government financial methods. (6) What is his classification. in the provision of social",130
348,Mr HAYDEN,DEMAND FOR TIMBER IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: welfare programs in the light of (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) Responsibility for administering the Australian Assistance Plan rests not with one officer but with the Director-General and officers from various divisions of the Department of Social Security. These officers include qualified and experienced social workers, accountants and clerical/administrative officers. Textiles: Restriction on Imports (Question No. 859) Mr Bourchier asked the Minister for Overseas Trade, upon notice: (1) Withreferenceto his Press Release of 30 July 1974 in which he referred to the prompt action taken in controlling import licence on goods from Taiwan, does he propose to the same control on the other countries mentioned as promptly as the action was taken on Taiwan; if not, why not. (2) Will it be necessary to waste taxpayers moneys on a long trip to visit these countries, and thus to delay the action by months, when a simple restriction on imports would solve on, measures the immediate problem; if so, why. skilled staff for the successful (3) Will he consider imposing immediate restrictions on imports, and then discussing the matter with the countries with social welfare concerned. Dr. J . F. Cairns-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The Textiles Authority's report of 5 July 1974 on certain items of apparel (Industries Assistance Commission Report No. 20)recommendedthat the Australian (Question No. 791) Government take acuon to restrain the level of certain knitted and woven apparel items entering the Australian market from Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, India and China. In accepting and acting upon the Textiles Authority's findings andrecommendations,the Australian Government has had regard to its rights and obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles (The Textiles Arrangement) and the Australia-China Trade Agreement. Taiwan is not a party to the GATT or to the Textiles Arrangement and the Australian Government has no bilateral trade commitments to Taiwan. The Government decided, therefore, to give effect to the Textiles Authority's findings andrecommendationsconcerning Taiwan by means of import licensing controls. India, the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong, like Australia, are signatories to the Textiles Arrangement. The Arrangement provides for the application of restraints on trade in textiles products subject to certain provisions, including the need to consult with signatory member countries whose expons would be action. In the case of China, the Textiles Authority recommended that restraint action be taken only in respect of imports into Australia of cenain knitted products. Having regard, inter alia, to the reciprocal most-favoured-nation provisions of the Austraha-China Trade Agreement, the Australian Government considered that the only was to consult with the Chinese authorities to seek to reach a mutually acceptable level of restraint on trade in the products concerned. Department of Minerals and Energy: Research Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Minerals and Energy, upon notice: (1) Will he provide a list of all grants, to any organisation or individual, that are provided from moneys appropriated to his Department, or authorities under his control, to undertake research.

The major fields are radiation chemistry, nuclear physics, plasma physics, engineering aspects of the nuclearfield,nuclear materials and research employing techniques such as neutron diffraction. Inco: Nickel Projects affected by proposed restraint (Question No. 214) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Minerals and Energy, upon notice: (1) Has the world's largest nickel producer, Inco, decided to curtail its exploration and development activities in any part of Australia. responsible course of action (2) What Australian nickel projects is Inco involved in. (3) If Inco has decided to curtail its activities, will any of these projects be terminated as a result of Inco's decision; if so, which projects, and where are they located. Mr Connor-The answer to the right honourGrants able member's question is as follows: (Question No. 71) (1) There has been no communication from the company to the Government on this matter. 'The Australian Miner' on 27 September 1973 reported the President of Internauonal Nickel Australia Limited (a subsidiary of Inco) as saying that press reports that the company was closing down its Australian exploration and development branches were distorted and that the company was not pulling out of Australia. (2) The company has been principally involved in investigation of a lateritic nickel deposit about 50 kilometres north of Rockhampton, Queensland, and of a sulphide nickel deposit at Widgiemooltha, Western Australia. (3) The 1973 Annual Report of BHP., which is associated with Inco in these projects, stated: 'An extensive programme of testing of the lateritic nickel deposits near Rockhampton in Queensland was completed during the year. Studies indicate that commercial development will not be possible at current price levels which were adversely affected by currency changes. 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 At Widgiemooltha in Western Australia the exploration shaft in the sulphide deposit was placed on a care and $ $ $ maintenance basis.

Mr Garland asked the Minister for upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn io an article in the Army Journal No. 295 of December 1973 calling for some changes in Army uniforms. (2) If so, would he give consideration to this question and advise me of the result.",132

Suggestions received from any source are examined by the appropriate Army authorities and implemented if found to be acceptable and practicable. Enquiries are currently being made to establish whether there the current orders of dress. Defence: Australian Industrial Involvement Mr Garland asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) What has been the result of the Government's intention to place a greater proportion of Defence orders in Australia, referred to by him in a speech to the Industrial Mobilisation Course at Westernport on 12 February 1973. (2) Does the current strategic situation still provide an opponunity to develop the industrial sector as an integral part of the nation's defence potential. (3) Is it yet possible to give any details of likely Australian industrial involvement in the production of equipment which has been under consideration since the Government was elected. (4) Is it still the attitude of the Government for a Service to accept on occasions some constraint on the technological complexity of its systems in order to make better use of Australian industry; if so, what are some examples of this. (5) Has it been the experience of the Government while in office that in some cases Australian equipment has cost more than imponed equipment; if so, what are the significant examples.",132
351,Mr BARNARD,DEMAND FOR TIMBER IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL,"The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1) In 1973-74, 62.3 per cent of defence equipment expenditure was local, compared to 58.1 per cent in the previous year when the majority of expenditure had been committed or incurred by the previous government. (2) Yes. (3) In April this year I announced the Government's intention to proceed with the acquisition of four new major equipments namely 2 new destroyers for the RAN, 8 Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft for the RAAF, and 53 modern medium tanks and 45 fire support vehicles for the Army. Contractual negotiations for the supply of these equipments are now proceeding and at an appropriate future time. I to be able to give details of Australian industrial involvement arising from these major purchases. (4) The process of evaluation provides for each major equipment of system to be considered on its merits, the final selection providing the Services with the best overall result in terms of operational performance, deliverytimescale,prodArmy Uniform uct support and Australian industrial participation within the (Question No. 676) financial constraints under which we operate. Hence it is not possible to give specific examples as each decision is taken on Defence, the totality of factors involved. (5) Australian defence production is nearly always for much smaller quantities than is the case in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. This contributes to higher unit costs. Nevertheless, apan from the obvious benefits resulting for our defence preparedness, there are considerable advantages in the employment given in highly skilled operations and in the introduction of new technologito the honourable cal processes.

352,Mr BARNARD,DEMAND FOR TIMBER IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL,"The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) and (3) On August 8, 1974 the Secretary-General of the United Nations was informed that, in response to his request for an increased contribution to the United Nations Force in Cyprus, Australia was prepared to provide a military contingent consisting of an independent rifle company of 170 men and appropriate headquarters and suppon elements to serve for a period of six months from their date of arrival in Cyprus. A reply indicating whether or not the United Nations wishes to accept ihis offer is now awaited. (2) The decision to make the offer was taken by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence. (4) On 22 July 1974 the Secretary-General of the United Nations convened a meeting of all Governments already contributing contingents to UNFICYP (including Australia by virtue of its civil police contingent), announced that he was seeking to double the present strength of UNFICYP to about 5000 men and asked representatives to indicate whether their governments could increase the size of their contingents. (5) If the Australian offer is accepted and if the UN mandate continues to be renewed, it is expected that as a general rule Australian personnel would berotatedon a six monthly basis. (6) The Austrahan Army now consists entirely of volunteers. Conscription was abolished when the former Liberal/CP. Government was defeated. A specific unit together with some individuals would be nominated for Cyprus duty and all members of that unit would be expected to participate in the assignment. Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice:(1) Has he received representations from the Shire of Wangaratta expressing concern at a reduction in the amount of funds becoming available for local government roadworks particularly in view of the floods that have afflicted the area in 1973 and again in May 1974. (2) If so, has he accepted the points put forward by the Shire. (3) Has he rephed to the Shire; if so, what was his response.",132

In deciding the amount of road assistance to be provided to the various States and for particularroadcategories, the Government had regard to the recommendations of the Bureau of Roads in its 'Repon on Roads in Australia-1973' , the Government's other expenditure commitments, including its other major transpon initiatives, and to Road Grants the general state of the economy. It also took into account the views of local government as expressed by the State Local (Question No. 888) Government Associations and the National Council of Local Government Associations since the Minister for Transport released the report of the Bureau of Roads last December. The Australian Government's acceptance of the full cost of the construction and maintenance of the national roads system, instead of 80 per cent as proposed by the Bureau of Roads, will allow State funds, previously earmarked for roads now covered by this category, to be available for allocation by the States for otherroads,such as rural arterial and local roads. Having regard to these factors, the Government does not intend to increase the level of grants already decided on for roadworks in rural areas.
