Motion (by Mr FISHER), by leave, proposed - That the proceedings in Committee os the Loan Bill 1912, which lapsed yesterday, be relumed, and that the House, at a later hour this day, resolve itself into a Committee of the for the further consideration of the Bill .",14
1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to order. offer no objection to the restoration of the Loan Bill to the business-paper, and told the Prime Minister last night that I would not do so, but the proper procedure should be followed, and, in my view, it is necessary to begin the consideration of the measure de novo.",14
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Standing order 235 is conclusive. It saysI f the proceedings of a Committee be inteT-ppted' by a count-out, followed by an adjournment of the House, the House may order the resumption of such Committee on a future day on motion with notice, and the proceedings shall be resumed at the point where they were so interrupted. Question resolved in the affirmative. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. TASMANIAN MA IL CONTRACT-SEMI OFFICIAL POSTMISTRESSES-REPLIE S TO QUESTIONS-RENTA L FOR OFFICIAL OFFICES-T-COUNTRY TELEPHONE LINES.",14
3,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General if the correspondence relating to the Tasmanian mail contract is yet available to honourable members ? ,",14
4,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am not sure that the contract has yet been signed, but as soon as it has been signed there will be no objection to honourable members seeing it. The only alteration of the old contract is. that a port at which steamers might have been required to call, but at which, as a matter of fact, they never did call, has not been made a compulsory port of call.",14
5,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Has the Postmaster General taken into consideration! the position of the postmistresses who are in charge of' the semi-official post-offices, whose' tenure of office is uncertain, and whose pay is inadequate? Is it the intention, of the Department to make these positions more secure, to increase the salaries attaching to them, and to improve the conditions under which the work is performed ?",14
6,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I dealt rather fully with the whole subject the other day when speaking on a motion for the adjournment, of the' House, moved by the honourable member for Richmond, pointing out that the effort has been made, when semi-official post-offices have been converted into official post-offices, to give those who have been irÂ» whole charge of them other Government employment, such as the conduct of allowance I offices; but that these persons cannot be brought intothe Public Service except by compliance with the provisions of the Public Service Act. I am very sorry for those who, after having been engaged for many years in conducting postal business, find themselves without employment, but as the Act stands it is becoming increasingly difficult upon the conversion of semi-official post-offices to find Government work for those who are in charge of them, and I am afraid some of them will have to be left without, employment.",14
7,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"In reference to a number of questions placed on the notice-paper on Friday by myself and other honourable members, and in connection with which the Minister of External Affairs said the desired information would be forthcoming as early as possible, when does the Postmaster-General think that he will, be able to furnish the information?",15
8,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am not acquainted with the questions to which the honourable member refers, but the standing instruction, when a reply of that kind is given, is to get the information available as soon as possible.",15
9,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"In view of the minimum revenue for official offices being practically retained, does not the PostmasterCeneral think that the elimination of the semi-official offices a weakening, rather than a strengthening, of the effective administration of the service?",15
10,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I must say that the question is open to argument. It was decided before I took charge of the Department, but on the whole, the question being considered from all sides, I believe that the proper thing was done.",15
11,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,"the Postmaster-General, ufon notice Whether he proposes, as suggested from time to time, to amend the law so as to permit of the cheaper construction of telephone lines in country districts, firstly, by using poles cut from sound varieties of timber available locally, and secondly, by permitting the use of shorter poles <except for crossings) than those specified in existing schedules issued by the Postal Department to contractors?",15
12,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In replying to this question I think I may be permitted to stray a little from the wording of the official reply. The honourable member for Wannon and several other country members tiave consistently appealed tp me in connection with this matter. The estimates for the construction of some of these lines, when submitted to me for final decision, have alarmed me; and, in order, to get over the difficulty' of having all this' work done by departmental officers, I have asked the people in all the local centres to assist me in obtaining labour, so that the necessary telephonic connexions may be carried out locally, and thus save much expense. Up to the present there has been a very poor response; but, at the same time, during the twelve months I have been in office, some 45,ooo miles of telephone lines have been constructed, the greater percentage of the work being done by departmental officers. In view of the high cost of the poles, and the necessity to obtain them, in most cases, from one particular portion of a State only, and, in some cases, to obtain them in one State and send them to another, I called a committee together, consisting of the Chief Engineer, the engineers of Victoria and New South Wales, with one of the Central Office staff, to go fully into the question. I placed my own views before that committee; and the result of the investigation is that it has been agreed to carry out the work substantially on the lines suggested in the question. For example, it is intended, except when crossing roads, to reduce the height of the poles from 20 feet to 12 feet, and, in the case of crossings, from ao 'feet to 18 feet. Local timbers, where there is any reasonable guarantee that they will last for 'ten years, will be utilized as far as possible; and it is hoped by this means that we may be able to carry out many of the works that have been delayed for financial reasons. PREFERENCE TO UNIONISTS.",15
13,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Referring to the answer given to.me by the Minister yesterday regarding the putting of certain^ questions to temporary clerks employed in the Government Statistician's Office, I wish to know if similar questions have been put to those doing temporary clerical work in the other Departments of the service? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I have given no instructions at all in this matter. The Government Statistician is empowered by law to ascertain the condition of all classes of the people, and he follows the means suggested to him by his own ideas.",15
14,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Are these questions being put to the temporary employees in the other Departments? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I do not know anything about that. NA PROHIBITIONS.,15
15,Mr BAMFORD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"In view of their great importance, will the Minister of Trade and Customs take into consideration the advisableness of publishing,' as a Parliamentary paper, so that they may be available to honourable members, the books known as Secret Remedies and More Secret Remedies t",15
16,Mr TUDOR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I shall lay copies on the table, and will consult with the British Medical Association, and, if I can get permission, I will move that they be printed.:",15
17,Dr CARTY SALMON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question with reference to the very interesting statement he made yesterday concerning the admission of undesirable and useless drugs into the Commonwealth. In his very praiseworthy efforts to protect the public interest, has he taken any step to prevent newspapers which contain advertisements of these useless articles from being sent through the post-offices of the Commonwealth ?",16
18,Mr TUDOR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I have not taken any step in that direction, because that is, I think, outside my province.  action then.",16
19,Mr TUDOR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is the duty of the Postmaster-General, I think, to prohibit certain newspapers from being sent through the post. If he were to prohibit the newspapers which contain these advertisements, I believe that you could count on the fingers due to ill-nutrition? of one hand the newspapers in Australia which would not be prohibited from passing through the post.",16
20,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Does not the Minister of Trade and Customs think that the giving of full publicity to the character of advertisements and the ingredients of doubtful patent medicines will induce newspapers to be more cautious in accepting advertisements regarding such medicines ?,16
21,Mr TUDOR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Yes , I believe that many of the newspapers which do take these advertisements have erred in the past. It is quite possible, as the honourable member suggests, that the giving of greater publicity to these things will be beneficial, not only to the community, but to newspapers, and that people will advertise more on the lines of the advertisements which we allow to come into the Commonwealth, and not make the exaggerated claims which they set forth in the press today. DISEASED IMMIGRANTS.",16
22,Dr MALONEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Has the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs been drawn to a statement in the press that on the immigrant ship Irishman there are cases, particularly of measles, which have developed pneumonia. In view of the vast number of deaths caused by measles in comparison with those attributable to small-pox and plague, will he see that these immigrants are not allowed to mix with the poorer portion of the population, and so spread a very infectious disease?",16
23,Mr TUDOR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"In the newspaper of yesterday, and also of today, I read a statement to the effect that the Irishman is coming to Melbourne, and that there has been another severe outbreak of measles on board and other diseases resulting therefrom. I am in consultation with the Director of Quarantine, with a view to seeing what action can be taken to prevent a recurrence of what occurred on her previous arrival here, and, if possible, to make her owners liable for apparent neglect on their part. I think that the vessel could not have been properly fumigated, because there could hardly be two outbreaks on the same vessel in following trips.",16
24,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Has the Minister of Trade and Customs noticed in the press an intimation to the effect that, in the opinion of some medical authorities in Adelaide, the severity of the outbreak of measles among the children oh the Irishman was Will he inquire whether the shipping authorities are responsible for the ill-nutrition, or where the responsibility really lies?",16
25,Mr TUDOR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The responsibility would not lie with the Quarantine or Customs Department if the children on the vessel were ill-fed. It would lie, I presume, with the Immigration Department, that is, with the States, in this case, and the Board of Trade should also be informed. As we do not control navigation in any shape yet, I do not think we have power to interfere. All that we can do is to quarantine the vessel it she does not comply with the conditions laid down in the Quarantine Act. Measles have not yet been made a quarantinable disease. If the amending Bill was assented to by the Governor General yesterday, it is quite possible that we may have greater power now than we had previously, but the matter of nutrition is outside the province of the Quarantine or Customs Department.. PUBLICE SERVICE ACT.",16
26,Mr BAMFORD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I desire to ask the Prime Minister if it is the intention of the Government to introduce during the session a Bill to amend the Public Service Act?,16
27,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,It is.,16
28,Dr MALONEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeIs it the intention of the Government to amend the Public Service Act so as to enable the various Departments to secure the services of citizens who have had experience and acquired business knowledge in the outside world, instead of the present method of recruiting the Service from youths up to 21 years of age who have had no business experience outside, and thus tend to become departmental machines?",16
29,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"This matter will be considered in connection with the other the session closes. amendments of the Public Service Act now in contemplation. NATURALIZATION: ENROLMENT. External Affairs, upon notice",17
30,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs a question relatStates ing to naturalization and enrolment. I am. informed that in September, 1905, the AtCommonwealth torney-General of the Commonwealth gave an opinion that within the State of Queensland the wife of a man who becomes a the necessary space? naturalized subject of the King within the meaning of the Commonwealth Franchise Act of 1902 is entitled to enrolment on the Commonwealth rolls of the State, and New that since then the Chief Electoral Offitralia. cer in Queensland has intimated, that no wife of a naturalized man who becomes of naturalized after he is married can be enexhibit rolled unless she also becomes naturalized. Has that ruling or instruction been, given received under the authority of the Home Affairs Department, and, if so, has any question been put to the Attorney-General, especially having reference to the opinion given by the Attorney-General in 1905? Mr KING. O'MALLEY - I shall give noticethat information tomorrow. COMMONWEALTH BANK.",17
31,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to make provision for collecting the savings Of men who are engaged on Commonwealth works remote from banks ?,17
32,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I know that the Goister vernor is considering this matter, and I think that he has taken some steps towards making provision for the cases of those people engaged on works such as railway River district? works and who frequently move from one boring point to another. INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS  Treasurer, upon noticeOn what date is it his intention to introduce a Bill to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and provide that the possession of a house used as a home shall not prevent a person obtaining the old-age pension?",17
33,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Attorney-General's Department has been asked to draft the necessary Bill. It is not possible to namethe date on which it will be introduced, but it will come before Parliament before' SAN FRANCISCO EXHIBITION. I Mr HEDGES asked the Minister of 1. Whether he has received a reply from the in answer to his proposal that arrangements should be made for a suitable display of products at the Exhibition to be held at San Francisco in the year 1915? 2. If so, will he make arrangements to secure",17
34,Mr TUDOR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is1 and 2. No reply has been received fromi South Wales, Victoria, and Western AusSouth Australia and Tasmania have decided not to be represented, and Queensland is opinion that there should' be an Australian under the control of the Commonwealth, and is prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government. When the other replies are the question of the participation of this Government will be further considered. THE MERRIE ENGLAND.",17
35,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"for Mr CANN) asked the Minister of External Affairs, upon Whether the steamer Merrie England, recentlywrecked on the coast of Papua, was insured; and, if so, for what amount?",17

40,Mr KING OMALLEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is All additions to the main printed roll appear on the Supplemental Roll, which w contain enrolments effected up to issue of the writ for an election. In view of the provisions of the Electoral Act, it would not be lawful to permit an elector to vote whose name does not appear on the list of voters certified by the Returning Officer.

LOAN BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 6th November (vide page 5118): Schedule.  proposal before us is important in view the fact that the Government, and the party behind it, who have always opposed borrowing, are now resorting to that policy. I was somewhat struck by the attitude of some honourable members opposite who glory in the fact that such legislation has been introduced. Their jubilation is not cause the Government have arrived at a wiser frame of mind, and are adopting the inevitable system of borrowing, but berowing. cause, instead of borrowing from outside sources it is proposed to raise the money from our own people. Those honourable members seem to think this a master stroke, whereas every thoughtful man realizes that if the result of borrowing from the outside is to give us more than we have to pay, must be profitable to the community.",18
41,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I direct the honorGovernment able member's attention to the fact that question before the Chair is the schedule, to which he must confine his remarks.  not say what I wish to say on I shall defer my remarks until we reach the third reading of the Bill.",18
42,Dr MALONEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Melbourne) [ n . o . do not intend to take up very much of the Funds. time of !the Committee, .but I notice ,a reference in the schedule to a sum >of .,Â£-153,000, which, I understand, will earn It the occurs to me that it would be an excellent as thing to deal with that - amount under the system of the Guernsey Island note issue of the to which I have previously referred. In - other words, instead of borrowing this money at interest we should issue notes for the property upon the plan adopted in will the case to which I refer. As there is so i ll much noise I think I shall leave my rethe date of the marks to another time. Schedule agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report Motion (by Mr FISHER), by leave, proThat the Bill 'be now read a third time.",18
43,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Franklin) [ n . 2 ] . honourable .members have already pointed out, the introduction of this Bill marks an absolutely new departure, and the House should thoroughly realise wSat it is doing - It has been somewhat amusing to listen to some of the speeches made during the debate, and to note how extremely .anxious the honourable member for of Hunter, in common with other honourable members opposite, was to point out that this Bill does not propose the ordinary or common garden variety of loan. We have been told that it proposes merely that we should borrow from ourselves through the Trust Funds, and the honourable membeber for Hunter, with other honourable members on his side, have assured us that they are opposed to the ordinary system of borThese honourable members apparently have failed to realise the situation. This House has deliberately given its approval to the construction of many public works, the expenditure upon which it' will be absolutely impossible to meet from the Trust Funds because those funds will it have gone. I take the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, upon which we have just started work, and I say that if the are in earnest in connection the with that undertaking, and I believe they are, it will be necessary for them in the immediate future to go to the open market borrow money, exactly as the State Go the schedule, vernments have done.",18
44,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Not when we have j - I Â£4,000,000 or Â£5,000,000 in the Trust",18
45,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"We shall not have ,Â£4,000,000 or Â£^5,000,000 in the Trust Funds. We have no reason to doubt the statement of the Minister of Home Affairs that he intends to construct the line I have referred to at the rate of a mile per day from each end. Estimating the cost of construction on the basis of the Government estimate of Â£10,000 per mile for the Pine Creek to Katherine River railway, the amount required to carry out the intention of the Minister of Home Affairs will be very considerable. There is no reason to believe that the Western Australian line will be constructed at a very much cheaper rate than the line referred to in the Northern Territory, but assuming that it will cost between ,Â£6,000 and ,Â£7,000 per mile, and that is probably an under estimate, the expenditure necessary upon it will far more than absorb the moneys available for the purpose in the Trust Funds.",19
46,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Not at all. Has honourable member calculated what the amount will be?,19
47,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"We are face to face with a very grave position in Australia today, and we cannot expect that the whole of the money now in the Treasury will remain there. The tightness of the money market in Australia at the present time is more marked than it has been for many years, and has not been equalled since 1893.",19
48,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What nonsense !,19
49,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I say there has never been a period since 1893 when the interest rate reached 6 per cent, in the city of Melbourne, as it is today.",19
50,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member is now going into a general discussion, but he must confine himself to the Bill.",19
51,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I thought that I was doing so. I am dealing with the position in which we shall be under this Bill. It is proposed to draw from the Trust Funds, and I say that the utilization of moneys in the Trust Funds, the Commonwealth note issue, and local borrowing in Australia are very largely responsible for the greatly enhanced price of money today. It is impossible to borrow to any considerable extent in the city of Melbourne today at under 6 per cent., and that rate of interest was not previously reached since 1893.",19
52,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member's credit must be very poor if he cannot do better than that.,19
53,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Perhaps my credit is quite as good as that of the Prime Minister.,19
54,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,There is abundance of money to be had at 5 per cent.,19
55,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Prime Minister should know better than that. No one can borrow money today in the city of Melbourne at 5 per cent. Money is tighter today than it has been at any period since 1893. The Municipal Council of Sydney is today giving 5 per cent, for loan money, and that is 'a higher interest than it has been necessary for any large corporation to pay for many years past. I say that the increase in the price of money is due to the extent to which local money has been utilized. This Bill is only the forerunner of similar measures that will be required to finance the undertakings to which we are committed, and the Commonwealth will be compelled to borrow in the open market in the very near future. I , therefore, say that all the the ""hifalutin"" to which we have listened about borrowing from our own Trust Funds is only so much platform oratory. The Prime Minister would not make such statements, and his colleague, the leader of the Senate, said only a fortnight ago",19
56,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member is now going beyond the scope of the measure, and I ask him. to confine himself to it.",19
57,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I do not wish to go beyond, the scope of the measure, but I think that as this Bill refers to money in the Trust Funds",19
58,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member will not be in order in continuing that line of argument. He must confine himself to the clauses of the Bill.,19
59,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If you, sir, will pardon me for saying so, I listened very patiently yesterday to honourable members discussing quite freely the whole question of the difference between borrowing from the outsider and from the Trust Funds.",19
60,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,On the third reading of a Bill a discussion is limited. The honourable member must confine himself to the Bill itself.,19
61,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I point out that the system we have adopted of taking from the banks moneys which they previously had in circulation, and borrowing from the fund so created instead of borrowing abroad, is largely responsible for the enhanced price which, during the last six months at any rate, the people of Australia have had to pay for the money they quired. This enhancement of value is inhas creasing every day. I contend that the vantage we have gained by the adoption the system referred to, and which I admit is considerable, is counterbalanced three or fourfold by the enhanced price which our people have had to pay for money. I think the estimate is given that today about the capital value of property in Australia is under mortgage.",19
62,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,-The honourable memquire ber is now entering upon a general discusAustralia sion which should have taken place upon return us the second reading of the Bill.,20
63,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I shall content myself with pointing out that under this tem of borrowing from our Trust Funds, are depriving the local banks of the that they otherwise would have.  keep a gold reserve?",20
64,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"They have not kept up their original gold reserves to this extent. There is now locked up in the monwealth Treasury a certain amount of gold, and if the money market goes on tightening the Treasurer must expect banks to make upon him a very considermoney able demand for gold in redemption of notes held by them. The Trust Funds, therefore, will be getting smaller and smaller.",20
65,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable memthat ber is now dealing with the general tion.,20
66,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I shall only say .that it is all moonshine to' say that we are not borrowing when we are raising money this way from the Trust Funds. The pubable lic works which we shall have to undermoney take are such that no matter what Government is in office borrowing will be necesTrust sary, and as sure as the sun will the heavens tomorrow, so surely will the Government of the day have to tread the same old road to the same old pawnshop if these works are to be carried out.",20
67,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"South Sydney) [11.13] I desire very briefly to put my views in regard to this measure. The position that we have a Trust Fund which is graduadopted ally growing. Any surplus revenue which the Treasurer has is paid into it, as well as any profits from the note issue and monwealth coinage, and there is now a position before us to borrow money .from that Trust account. Is it not a more statesmanlike action on the part [188] reTreasurer to borrow from an account that been created by this Parliament, and to adpay into that trust account interest on the of money that we borrow from it, just as we should have to pay interest to a banker",20
68,Mr SAMPSON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Stil l it is borrowing.,20
69,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is like borrowing from half one's wifej it is "" all in the family."" By means of the money that we propose to raise in this way we are going to accertain land and property in Western which I understand is likely to per cent.",20

We shah. sysP y 3 i Per cent, interest to the Trust a we Fund in respect of interest on the loan, money and we shall also pay into the Trust Funds the additional 2 per cent, profit that we make on the investment. In the light of these facts I fail to see how any one could object to the third reading of this Bill. No criticism has been levelled against Comthe Government regarding this proposal to cause me to lose my faith in the soundness of the proposition. This is certainly a prothe posal to borrow, but it is like taking from one pocket and putting it into the another. No one outside is to get any interest from the Commonwealth. If we pay the interest into the Trust Funds that interest will accumulate, and I am satisfied the simplest individual will be able to understand the difference between borrowquesing from a Trust Fund to acquire property for public purposes",20
72,Mr SAMPSON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Does the honourable in member think that the Government will be to obtain from Trust Funds all the they require for public works?,20
73,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,No ; but we have in the Funds sufficient to meet the particurise in lar requirements of this Bill.,20

76,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Government are takis ing a stand which should have been at the inception of Federation. If it had been I do not think there would have been any cause to complain of tightComness of funds in any Department. I have propleasure in supporting the third reading of this Bill, believing it to be in the interests of the country and to reflect great of the credit on the Treasurer.",20
77,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Darling Downs) [11.17]. - The last speaker very properly admitted. that this was the initiation of a loan policy. The only distinction he makes between the Government proposal and that ofraising a straight-out loan is that for the time being while we have money to the credit of the Trust Funds there is no occasion to go outside to borrow. He admits in effect that when we have to build a railway costing Â£4,000,000 it will be necessary to go outside.",21
78,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Order .,21
79,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Prime Minister stated yesterday,21
80,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member will not be in order in replying to a debate that took place yesterday.,21
81,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I do not propose to do so. The Prime Minister promised to make a statement showing where the moneys were to come from.,21
82,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It will come out of two Trust Funds-partl y out of the note Trust Fund, and partly out of the general Trust Funds.",21
83,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then there will be plenty of money available for some time to come. It is rather interesting to know that the Government are initiating a public loan policy, and I do not think the honourable member for South Sydney can deny that that is really what is being done. The gold reserve comprises some millions of inoney raised distinctly from the banks, and held by the Commonwealth to secure the note issue. The money so obtained is to be loaned for the execution of public works in Australia.",21
84,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member is now going outside the scope of the Bill.,21
85,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I think we are justified in asking where the Â£[529,526 for which the Bill provides is to come from.",21
86,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The position I take up is that on a notice of motion for introducing a Bill, as well as on a motion for the second reading, there is ample scope for the fullest possible discussion on the general principles of a measure. When a Bill goes into Committee certain matters are decided, and even at the report stage there is ample opportunity for discussion, but on the motion for the third reading honourable members must confine themselves to the contents of the Bill itself. general discussion at that stage would not be in order.",21
87,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Bill provides that the Treasurer may from time to time borrow certain moneys under the provisions of the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, and that Act empowers the Treasurer to issue stock which can be taken up either by the public or by the Government itself. I am not, therefore, going oufside the terms of the Bill. When we look at that part of the measure which authorizes the raising of this money out of the Trust Funds of the Commonwealth, we must recognise that it is not restricted to the Trust Funds. Some honourable members seem to be under the impression that it is restrictive in that respect. But that view is not correct.  correct.",21
88,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member is in error. _ As a rule he is very accurate, precise, and choice in his language, but on this particular occasion he is making a mistake. The Bill goes beyond what the honourable member supposes. The honourable member for South Sydney realized the position much more accurately when he said that after the Trust Funds were gone, we should have to go to the public.  power to do that.",21
89,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,But it authorizes the Treasurer. ,21
90,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is the first time that I have known the honourable member to offend in this respect. First of all, it was suggested that the Bill merely authorized use to be made of the Trust Funds, but now we hear, for the first time, from the Prime Minister that the moneys used for the purpose of securing the note issue are going to be utilized for carrying out the public works of Australia. I am not questioning that policy now. I am merely stating the fact-that the Prime Minister has announced, for the first time in this connection, that we are going to utilize for these purposes moneys intended to secure the note issue.",21
91,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I could get quite enough from the other amounts in the Trust Funds.,21
92,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I doubt that.,21
93,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then the honourable member is quite wrong. A Mr GROOM - If the Treasurer tells me that he can do what he states, of course, I accept his assurance.",21
94,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I have nearly twice as much as we require.,22
95,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then the Treasurer is going to divert money appropriated for other purposes ? For instance, I find that there is a very large sum devoted to naval defence purposes. I presume that the Treasurer is not going to use that money for investment purposes.",22
96,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,No ; but we shall have quite enough for naval purposes.,22
97,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then there is over Â£[1,000,000 appropriated for old-age pensions. Surely the Minister is not going to devote that money to investment purposes. Out of Â£15,000,000, Â£[9,500,000 is money for the security of the note issue, and the other Â£5,500,000 is all that is available. We have already authorized Â£3,000,000 of loan. So that the Treasurer will not have an unlimited amount in the Trust Funds for these purposes. We must be frank, and admit that we are now initiating a loan policy for the Commonwealth. I hope that it will be carried out on sound lines. Probably these will be the lines on which all future loans will be effected. That is to say, money which is going to be borrowed by the Commonwealth will be allowed to be borrowed, provided that it is invested in the permanent works of the Commonwealth, and provided also that the loan is accompanied by a sinking fund, so that there will be a chance of its being deemed within a stipulated time. is exactly the policy which Sir George Turner laid down in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth. That policy, however, was rejected. Had it been followed from the beginning, we should have had our post-offices and telephone system in a much better condition today, and our public works would have been advanced materially. We are beginning to see that it was a proper policy to initiate.",22
98,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member should recollect that we had over -Â£[6,000,000 of surplus revenue which we could have spent on post-offices.",22
99,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member forgets that some of the States of Aus- course. tralia were in a very straitened condition at that time.,22
100,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Order ! Will the honourable member confine himself to the question ?,22
101,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am not allowed to go into the question raised by the honourable member for Cook. To-day, however, we [188]- 2 are establishing a very sound policy; and I must congratulate the honourable member for Cook and others supporting it, and thus making a distinct cleavage in the matter offinanceby recognising that, as regards capital permanently invested, it is a proper thing to borrow and make the expenditure a charge, not only on the generation which commences the works, but on future generations in proportion to the benefits conferred.",22
102,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Cook) [11.26] - I should like to make my own position clear in regard to this matter. I do not subscribe to the general statement often made in opposition to borrowing money. I think that there are occasions when borrowing can be justified in one's private affairs, in one's business arrangements, and in regard to the affairs of the nation. Some little time ago I wished to buy a house. I did not happen to have sufficient money to pay for it forthwith.",22
103,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,A chronic complaint.,22
104,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Accordingl y I arranged to borrow an amount for the time being.,22
105,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Order ! Is the honourable member going to connect his remarks with the question?,22
106,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Of course I am, Mr Speaker. I submit that I am entirely in order in arguing that the policy which I am prepared to adopt in my own private reaffairs I am also prepared to follow in That the affairs of the country. I am not now dealing with the details of the proposal, but with the principle.",22
107,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member must confine his remarks to the Bill.,22
108,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Well , Mr. Speaker, I consider that I have been confining myself to a legitimate argument in connection with the Bill ; and if I cannot give an illustration to show why I think that a proper line of policy is being followed, and why each case should be dealt with on its merits, I cannot proceed any further.",22
109,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member will be in order in following that,22
110,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I was giving what I submit was a reasonable and fair illustration to show why T do not subscribe to the general clamour often raised against .1 loan policy. I was pointing out that it is quite legitimate for one who is buying a house to make an arrangement to tide over the period until the house can be paid for. Similarly in regard to business affairs, a person may see an opportunity for development. Probably he is not able to finance the scheme entirely, and accordingly he makes an arrangement with a bank to tide .him over a certain period. That is a loan policy. It is a legitimate arrangement to make.",22
111,Mr SAMPSON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,It is good business.,23
112,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Certainly . A man would not be a business man at all if , seeing an opportunity of developing his business, he refused to borrow in such a way as would return him interest on his money, and pay off his loan within a reasonable time.",23
113,Mr SAMPSON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,We should have had no development in Australia if we had not followed that policy. ',23
114,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"In my own business I have followed this line of policy for a number of years, and have been able to secure very good results from it. Only a few weeks ago, in connection with a business enterprise in which I am concerned with some others, we found it necessary to develop in a certain direction, and, of course, we considered it advisable to introduce a little outside capital. What we do in our private affairs we are justified in doing in regard to public affairs. If I find that a business in which I am concerned can toe extended, that buildings can be erected, and that a portion can be let so as to return good interest and contribute to a sinking fund on the outlay, it is good business to borrow. This is the policy that is followed invariably in business affairs, at any rate where business is conducted on anything like a large scale. I say, therefore, that such a policy is also justified in the affairs of the country. My only contention is that money must not be borrowed for unreproductive public works.",23
115,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Order ! The honourable member is now going beyond the scope of the Bill.,23
116,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"This Bill provides for the raising of money for reproductive public works. Every case must be decided on its merits, and the use of a mere political "" gag "" by honourable members opposite will not influence my course of action in the slightest degree. I am prepared to deal with this Bill upon its merits, just as I am prepared to deal with every other measure which may claim our attention. Upon a previous occasion, when a proposal was submitted to raise .Â£3,500,000 for naval defence purposes, I opposed it.",23
117,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Order ! The honourable member is now going beyond the scope of the Bill.,23
118,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Because one takes up an attitude of hostility to a certain proposal whilst giving his adhesion to another, he is not necessarily inconsistent.  sorry that, under your ruling, my remarks upon the third reading of fhis Bill must be somewhat circumscribed, especially as I had not an opportunity of addressing myself-o n account of the peculiar circumstances which arose-to the motion for its second reading. The honourable member for Cook has stated that the measure provides for the raising of funds which are to be devoted largely to the construction of reproductive public works. But I gather from its schedule that those funds are intended to be devoted chiefly to the redemption of loans which have been expended upon works in the Northern Territory which are not of a reproductive character, and that they are also to be applied to the liquidation of loans which have been raised by South Australia' for the construction of the Port Augusta railway- a work which is not likely to prove reproductive for some considerable period. So far as I can gather, there is only one work in the schedule which promises to be reproductive^- I refer to the acquisition of a site for a post-office in Perth. That may prove to be a very good speculation. Now the policy of borrowing from our Trust Funds would be a splendid one if it could be continued indefinitely - if the Trust Funds were like the widow's cruse of oil, which never failed. Honourable members opposite appear to regard the policy which the Government have initiated in that light.",23
119,Mr SAMPSON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is a very good method of sneaking in a borrowing policy.  continuing the policy of borrowing from ourselves we are mopping up moneys which would otherwise be employed by the community generally to very great advantage. The continuance of such a policy must necessarily deplete our banking and private financial institutions of their funds, with the inevitable result that labour must be-, come scarce",23
120,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Order ! The honourable member is now going beyond the scope of the Bill.  .(policy of borrowing from ourselves would the an excellent one if we could continue it - indefinitely. But seeing that we cannot -.do so, and that the Government have initiated a loan policy, I venture to say that this Bill is merely the prelude to large borrowing operations which will be forced upon them if they remain in office.",24
121,Mr GORDON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Boothby) [11.36] When I first saw the announcement of this Bill upon the business-paper I could not help soliloquizing with Bret HarteDo I sleep? do I dream? Do I wander and doubt? Are things what they seem? Or is visions about? It certainly marks an extraordinary change jn the policy to which, we have hitherto - been given to understand, the Government were committed. But it was an inevitable innovation if the Government were to acquire property in Perth, or to recognise their obligations in respect of loans floated by South Australia in connection with the Northern Territory. We had to realise that the time would come when the present Administration would reach the parting of the ways, and would, as the managers of a great business concern, be unable to continue to construct all public works of the Commonwealth out of revenue. I was interested in the remarks made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong yesterday, to which, however, I shall not refer in detail, because I understand that by so doing I should be travelting beyond the scope of the motion for - the third reading of this Bill. While I 41m opposed to a borrowing policy for unrepreductivepublic works, irrespective of whether the money be taken out of Trust Funds or raised either on the local or London market, I recognise that for the construction of a post-office in Perth it is necessary either to draw on the Trust Tunds, or on some source other than that of the revenue which is available. view of the many responsibilities which the Government must shoulder in the near - future, it seems to me that they will require to carefully reconsider the whole - financial position of the Commonwealth, if they are to face their obligations in a 'business-like way. Whether they resort to the London or to the local market, or - whether they take the money that is required out of Trust Funds, it will be necessary for them to observe the same business-like methods which are followed The by large corporations and firms in the carrying out of their undertakings.. Such a Bill as this is inevitable. Whether the money is taken from the Trust Funds, or obtained from some other source, the Government must face its growing responsibilities in a business-like manner.  bland and Chinese-like remarks of the honourable member for Boothby",24
122,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member is not in order in using that expression.  ber for Boothby professed to be amazed at the introduction of this Bill, and said that he received a shock by the change of policy on the part of the Labour party, of which it is evidence. I ask him if he thought before he saw the Bill that the whole of the indebtedness on the Northern Territory was to be met out of revenue.",24
123,Mr GORDON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Of course not.  application of the honourable member's opening remarks? Has he not known for some time past that it has always been the policy of the Labour party to construct reproductive works by means of restricted borrowing ?,24
124,Mr GORDON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I fought my election against a non-borrowing policy.,24
125,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member may not discuss general matters of policy.,24
126,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"North Sydney) [11.43] I should not object to the Bill did it provide for bond fide Borrowing, because it is sound finance to borrow when money is needed for reproductive works. Australia would not have progressed as she has done if she had not borrowed.",24
127,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member is going beyond the motion.,24
128,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Bill provides for a method of borrowing which, in my opinion, is unsound. In Mr Laird SMITH - There will be no brokerage fees or underwriters' expenses to pay.",24
129,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,No . The proposal is to deplete the Trust Funds.,24
130,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Would the honourable member borrow in London?,24
131,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I would not use Trust moneys already allocated for certain specific purposes.,24
132,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then , the honourable member would borrow outside.",25
133,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If I borrowed at all, I .would certainly borrow outside. The time must come when the works for which this money has been allocated will have to be Carried out, and the Trust accounts having been depleted, we shall have to borrow to meet the obligations to which we are committed. That is an unsound system of finance. Moreover, the Bill provides for the borrowing of money to be used for .what I do not consider reproductive purposes. It is not advisable to borrow for any but reproductive works.",25
134,Mr HIGGS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Was not the honourable member in favour of borrowing ^3,000,000 under a Loan Act?",25

140,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable meminformation ber must confine himself to the Bill.,25
141,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then I can repeat that 'do not approve of the Bill because, of providing bond fide for borrowing, merely robs Peter to pay Paul, depleting Trust accounts created to provide for Specific undertakings which we shall to fill later with borrowed money, a shod method of finance which does not dound to the credit of the Government.",25
142,Mr FOWLER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Perth) [11.50] - I dewith sire to say a few words on an aspect the Bill to which I think attention should be called, and that is the lack of definite information in the schedule as to the purposes for which the money is asked'.. Speaking last night on the motion for leave to introduce the Bill, I indicated what I wish now to repeat in rather more detail. In regard to the first item of the schedule at any rate, the House might very well have expected to receive more information.",25
143,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What do you want?,25
144,Mr FOWLER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It has been mentioned casually that certain properties are included in the lands which are to be paid for with this money. The Government might have given us the details as to the properties they have taken over, and the price they have paid for each property. are quite in the dark in that respect.. borWe can obtain the information, I supin other ways, but it would have be been better if it had been given in the Then, as regards the loans t which are proposed to be redeemed in respect of the Northern Territory, we might have been given an idea as to when loans were raised, and whether they are now on now falling due.",25

147,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"In some instances the The loans, were raised at different periods.",25
148,Mr SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Order ! - Mr FOWLER - Of course, that mayhas be an amount of particularizing to which the Government may object, but, on the ? whole, I think that the bald statements ir> a busithe schedule are not sufficient to make us fully conversant, with the purpose of the measure. I intend later to ask for that I particularly desire in scope of the regard to the first item.",25
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Parramatta.) I [11.53] - I do not intend to criticise the instead Bill much more, as I had my say on. it Friday. I only want now to call attention to the sources from which the Treasurer proposes in the Bill to get hishave money. He tells us in the Bill that heslipis going to operate under the Commonrewealth Inscribed Stock Act of 1911, and"" he tells us over the table, in accordancethe promise he made last night, that? of some of the money is coming _ from the notes balance which he has available.",25
150,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It need not necessarily - be so, but the principle of investing in Trust moneys is sound.",26
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"We know that the principle is sound. It all depends upon the nature of the investment. Certain gilt-edge securities are chosen all over the world for the investment of Trust Funds, and the laws of almost the whole world restrict the order of these investments very materially. Nowhere in the world is a man allowed to use Trust Funds in the same way as he uses other money. One has to select with special care the investment in which he proposes to put such moneys from time to time. These are very wise provisions, and the same wisdom - characterized our dealings with the Australian Notes Bill. When it was before - the House we decided that we would only use this money for certain well-defined - objects. I ami not quite clear whether the Treasurer is carrying out those objects in connection with the Bill.",26

Is the right honourable .gentleman going to create a special finan-cial security to set against the money which 4ie proposes to take from the Trust Funds ? It is provided distinctly that the Treasurer must invest the note reserve in the securities of the United Kingdom, or of the Commonwealth, or of a State.",26
160,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What more do you want?,26
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Now the right honourable gentleman is taking this money out of the Trust Funds and putting it into land and buildings in Perth. If that is to be all the cover against this reserve, I do not think that it will be very readily available. The right honourable gentleman gets down below the amount prescribed in the Act, or, rather, it is no longer in the Act.",26
162,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I will keep it ; do not be alarmed about that.,26

166,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That is good financing.,26
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I should think so, but who has helped the right honourable gentleman to good financing of that kind? I fancy that somebody has been helping him.",26
168,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Very likely. No man ) in securican stand alone in this world.,26
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Quite so. As the right honourable gentleman appears to affect so much mystery about this thing, would he mind telling the House and the country where that money in the banks is going to, what use is being made of it.",26
170,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I do not pretend to be able to say what they do with the money.,26
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The right honourable gentleman does not know?,26
172,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Not what the banks do with it.,26
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"What is the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank doing with it? Has he lent the right honourable gentleman any money at any time, has he invested money with the Government in any way?",26
174,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No , sir. Next question.",26
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I am glad to be assured on that point.,26
176,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I think that he can get more for his money; our credit is good.,26
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Has he begun to loan out money, then?",26
178,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I have no doubt.,26
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I should have thought that the Governor had not enough money yet to pay for all the skyscrapers which he is going to put up.,27
180,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Has he not?,27
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,He is going to have a bank whether he has any business or not. That is quite evident.,27
182,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,A visit to the Governor would enlighten the honourable member a bit.,27
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No doubt. All that I know is that the Governor is proceeding on somewhat different lines from any other banker. He is, I think, the first banker to talk of putting up skyscrapers before he has any business to do.",27
184,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Why not leave the Governor of the Bank alone?,27
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I suppose we must leave him alone, - and I am sure I have no desire to hurt him. I do not mind telling the Prime Minister, however, that there are one or two questions we shall have to ask on the Estimates, if we are permitted to do so. I hope the Governor of the Bank has not been constituted sacrosanct in any way.",27
186,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,No ; that is the sort of thing for the other side to do!,27
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"There is nothing very spiritual or mysterious about the pay and allowances of the Governor-thes e are material enough-and , since we have to find the money, I hope we may venture to ask a question about our own Bank at any time. I do not quite know now where the Prime Minister is going to get the money. He tells us that he will get it from the Trust Funds and some other funds; but I suppose that, if there were no surplus at the end of the year, and sudden demands were made on the Trust Funds, he would be bound to find the money.",27
188,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Oh , yes.",27
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"There would be no backing to the loan then, until he had issued inscribed stock and sold it.",27
190,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I think we shall get through.,27
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am sure the honourable gentleman will get through, seeing that he is not going to spend more than half the money voted by this House. The Trust Funds have been piling up in recent years in an extraordinary way.",27
192,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is the opposite to .what the honourable member said the other day. One day we are told we are spending everything, and, the next day, that we are piling up reserves.",27
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am afraid the honourable gentleman, if he will allow me to say so, is not capable of following a consecutive statement by anybody, particularly in matters of finance. If there is one man who does not know anything about finance it is the Treasurer-that is the plain English of it.",27
194,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I knew the raising of the voice was coming.,27
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable gentleman "" asked for it , "" and he has got it. I am pointing out that if , at the end of the year, there is a sudden rush on the Trust Funds, which the right honourable gentleman has drawn on pretty well already, he will find himself in difficulties in regard to this loan.",27
196,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Prime Minister says he will not, and he ought to know Better than does the honourable member.",27
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Has there been a reconciliation with the honourable member for Corangamite this morning? Has he been hauled over the coals between last night and now?,27
198,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,We have unbounded freedom on this side-w e are not bound up as are honourable members opposite!,27
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Honourable members opposite have freedom to humiliatethe Prime Minister overnight and to bedumb dogs next morning. However, I congratulate the Labour Government and the Labour party generally on the record they are putting up. One section of the Labour party in New South Wales has the record of having spent more loan moneys in a year than has any other party in Australia.",27
200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That has nothing to do with the question before us..,27
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am merely pointing out that a record has been put up in the Federal arena, where, during the brief term of two years, two loan Bills have been introduced for the construction of public works. The right honourable gentleman is now going back on statements which he has many times repeated, that under no circumstances would he be in favour of entering the market as a competitive borrower with the six States of Australia. He may say that he is not hurting the market in what he is doing, but one has only to trace the course? of the Notes Act to see that he is just as effectually withdrawing the money from circulation in Australia, as if he had floated a loan on the Stock Exchange. One of the causes of the present tightness of money is the excessive borrowing of the Governments in recent years in the local market. When we have a virgin continent, with ''abundant scope for expenditure and the employment of labour, we ought to conserve our local supply for times like this when money is stringent in the .world's market; but we have been pursuing the opposite policy of depleting every available shilling of public capital for governmental purposes, and thus removing capital from private investment and private development and expansion. Now, when money is tight all over the world, we have to go fo the markets of the world, and pay an inordinately high rate of interest. If we had not depleted our local reserves we should not be paying the foreign capitalists 'Â£4. 4s. 6d. per cent.",27
202,Mr WEST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Would the honourable member use our own money before he borrowed ?,28
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I should use our own money in a way that paid us best. What is the difference between paying less interest on money now, and bigger interest hereafter in consequence? If the honourable member looks into the question he will find that the full rate of interest, and a good deal more, is being paid all through as the result of the depletion of our markets. While honourable members opposite are boasting of the policy of the vernment, we are paying through the nose, and workmen are being discharged wholesale, because we cannot get money at anything like a decent rate on the foreign - markets. If we had conserved our resources we should have been able to get plenty of local money, and keep work and employment going. , Mr Fenton - Have not Governments of all parties been borrowing locally.",28
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I have said so.,28
205,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If the honourable member's contention is correct, those Governments must have been big offenders for the ""last ten or twelve years.",28
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"And I say that, in my judgment, the Governments have 'been pursuing a wrong policy.",28
207,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Why always run to Ikev Mo?,28
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is honourable members opposite who wish to run to Ikey Mo now. The Prime Minister has 0 taken the gold from the hanks, and, therefore the bank's customers have had to go to Ikey Mo-it is only a roundabout way of going to Ikey Mo. The Prime Minister avoids going himself, but forces somebody else to go, who cannot face the money lender half so well. The result is to cripple private persons in their development, and to curtail their business, thus leading to the lack of employment and the discharging of men.",28
209,Mr WEST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member wishes to give the interest to the banks instead of allowing the Government to get the benefit!,28
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No ; what honourable members opposite are doing is to raise the rate of interest to every private individual in the community, and this loading of the burden on private enterprise they call splendid financing. The Government are financing at the expense of the people of the community, who have to shoulder the burden of interest.",28
211,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,How is it that the banking returns show that there is more gold than ever in Australia?,28
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The banking returns show nothing of the kind. The banking returns show that this year we sent away Â£4,000,000 or Â£[5,000,000 more gold than we won during the year. local They show that the balance of trade is hard against us the whole time. That is Gowhat is causing the stringency, and why people who want money for their business cannot get it. The banks will not lend at any price to outsiders. They are keeping the little they have for their own customers, and even they have to pay a higher rate of interest for it than was charged to them previously. That is the state of affairs which Governments in Australia at the present time have brought about. I am saying only what is said by expert financiers outside, but, of course, honourable members opposite know more about these matters than do the men who have been immersed in financial transactions all their lives.",28
213,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I ' am using the words of such men. Let the honourable member look at Palmer's share list-the latest list received from Sydney.,28
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Le t the honourable member himself look at some of Palmer's share lists of a month or two ago.,28
215,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I am quoting the latest.,29
216,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"All this is no doubt very interesting, but I should like to know what it has to do with the subject.",29
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Quite so. These interjections have led me off the track. I advise the honourable member for Denison to study Palmer's share lists. He will not get very much encouragement from them for the wild-cat financing of his party. There is no severer critic of Labour Governments in Australia in the matter of  honourable member was most unfortunate in bringing him into a discussion of this kind.  jaundiced view in his criticisms, too. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. '- Of course, everybody takes a jaundiced view who does not agree with my honourable friend and the Caucus. In the meantime the hard fact remains that every one who requires money today has to pay a great deal more for it than was necessary some time ago. Expansion and development are being stopped because there is no capital available for investment, and this stringency and tightness of the money market has been attributed to the financing of Labour Governments in Australia.  manager, on whose word I can rely, told me that the statement as to the tightness of the money market is very much exaggerated. He admitted that it was largely a political move.",29
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I take the statement for what it is worth. I admit that my honourable friend is more closely in touch with the bigfinanciers,who they say are bleeding the people outside, than I am. He is, therefore, more likely to hear these things than I would be.  to whom I refer is one of the fair-minded men.",29
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I see.,29
220,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I must ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the matter before the Chair.,29
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"J was speaking of the general effects of this Loan Bill at the time. I was diverted from the track. I commend the Government for the inauguration of this policy, but I should commend them still more if they would extend the policy and build all permanent reproductive public works out of a capital account raised for the purpose, and leave alone the money that is now coming fo. them frpm the pockets of the working men of Australia, who have to foot these bills in the shape of increased taxation. The result of it all has been that in these rolling years of prosperity",29
222,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Order t The honourable member is again departing from the question before the chair.,29
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I think not. I proposed to say that at this time, when? money. is rolling into the national coffers, and we should have plenty to spare, the Government initiate this policy of borrowing for the construction of public works. Through all the stringent years and times of least prosperity these works have been constructed out of public revenue, and it has been left for the present Government in these years of great prosperity, when there ought to be plenty of money available, and to spare, to inaugurate this loan policy for ' the purpose of constructing minor public works.",29
224,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Wide' Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [12.15] - On e or two questions have been raised during the discussion on the third reading of the Sill to which it is perhaps advisable some reply should be made. We have been asked where the money is to come from. There is now in the general Trust Funds about Â£[900,000 available, and that is too large a sum to allow to remain idle. There is also, I am happy to say, a little money indie gold reserve above the 40 per cent, required in connection with the note issue, which will also be available for'investment. It is not proposed to exhaust the whole of the Trust Funds in connection with this proposal. I stated by interjection, so that honourable members might know what the policy of the Government was in financial' matters, that we consider it our duty, as trustees for the public, to invest our surplus moneys in the best possible securities. What are those securities? Honourable members opposite have said, "" You may invest in State Government securities or in banks, and preferably in banks, and you will be perfectly secure. That is the correct thing to do; but if you invest in Commonwealth stock you will be doing a disastrous or a dangerous thing."" They can never divest themselves of their antinational feeling. It is inherent in them, and they can never rise above it. Honourable members have spoken of this proposal as though it were a borrowing matter solely, and as if it were the first proposal of the kind brought under their notice. is neither the one nor the other. When the Northern Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth, certain indebtedness of the South Australian Government in connection with it, and the loans raised for the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, were taken over vvith it. There were loans to be met at that time, and we met them. When the transferred properties were taken over by the Commonwealth we became, not only liable for the interest upon them, but for the principal borrowed for their construction. We have been paying the interest upon that principal, and it is just vernment. the same as a loan.",29
225,Sir JOHN FORREST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Hav e we considered a Bill dealing with that matter?,30
226,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,It is just as much a ioan against the credit of the Commonwealth as are any of the proposals included in this Bill.,30
227,Sir JOHN FORREST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,It was never submitted to us as a loan.,30
228,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"In addition, I may say that on two occasions we converted a portion of the loan indebtedness upon the Northern Territory.",30
229,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,We have been reducing it.,30
230,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Yes ; we converted a portion of it. The largest amount included in the money proposed to be raised by this Bill, amounting to over Â£[375,000, is required to meet loan indebtedness transferred to the Commonwealth with the transfer of the Northern Territory. The South Australian Government raised this money in very small amounts. I think, speaking from memory, that eighty-eight different loans were raised, and some for as small an amount - as ,Â£TOO were covered by two or. three transactions. The minute details of these matters it is impossible to give.",30
231,Mr WEST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Were they local loans?,30
232,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Some were local, but that is a matter of indifference to us. The money was raised by the South Australian Oovernment, and we agreed to shoulder the responsibility for it under the agreement for the transfer of the Northern Territory. As the amounts fall due we propose to meet them.",30
233,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Did the honourable gentleman say that some loans were for as low as Â£[TOO?,30
234,Mr FTSHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"On e at least was for jÂ£ioo. Honourable members will recogPrime nise the advisableness of putting a loan this stage the debate on the Budget. It of that sort into stock. These various small loans are falling due every now and then, and we propose, therefore, to meet them in this way. I invite honourable members to consider for a moment what is the trouble with the Opposition so far as this financial proposition is concerned. Their real trouble is that we are too secure-that we are impregnable. Their glee vanished the very moment that the honourable member for Mernda launched his indictment against this Government, and it collapsed. That was the end of their attack upon the financial policy of the GoThey used to say, "" Wait until it is launched.""",30
235,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"And the Argus said that it was "" windy.""",30
236,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The action taken on that occasion was characteristic of the Opposition. The honourable member for Mernda, or any other member of his party, by going to the Treasury could have obtained in two minutes an explanation of the little technical error which had been discovered, and which proved to be a technical error on the part of the Auditor General. Instead of doing so, they had their little confabs and",30
237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Order !,30
238,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"They then said, "" We shall launch a great attack on the Government."" Their attack, however, came to nothing. The Opposition have asked for a list of the investments of Trust Funds. During the debate on this Bill I read a list of the whole of the investments made by us. The list, which appears in 'Hansard, shows the amounts invested, the nature of the investments, and when the loans granted' fall due. The note issue investment is earning interest amounting approximately to ,Â£200,000 a year, and the working expenses, apart from the initial expenses, are comparatively low. In addition to the absolute security provided in accordance with the statutory requirement, accumulated interest is being piled up against our obligations to meet the Australian note issue. Nothing could be more paltry, more un-Australian, more injurious to the credit of Australia, and nothing is more likely to excite the fears of the timid than the reckless, careless, and unstatesmanlike assertions from the Opposition side of the House concerning thefinancesof the Commonwealth.",30

241,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I have simply been ferring to statements made during this debate. I do not think it necessary traverse all the statements made position because they did not amount to criticism, but since the note issue Has attacked, I may be allowed to state that the gold reserve is over 40 per cent. promised that it would not go below that point, and as long as I remain in office it will continue to be above it until we have appealed to the electors. It is not an ample, but a super-ample security. The provision, that the gold reserve should be not less than 25 per cent, worked well in connection with the Queensland note issue for fifteen years prior to the establike lishment of the Commonwealth system. No financier in Queensland would ever think of challenging it as being too low, and I believe that a gold reserve of less than 25 per cent, would be ample the case of the Federal note issue. Such cheap. a provision means, of course, the maintenance of a fair working margin, so that the reserve would run from 33 per cent, downwards. A reserve of not less than 25 per cent, is sufficient to meet every contingency while we have in power a Treasurer or Treasury officers that can reasonably see coming events. The Commonwealth was scarce then. Government at the present time has a very large balance at current account with the banks, and we have no desire to unduly disturb that current account. Instead desiring to increase the tightness of the money market in Australia, we have done everything possible to make it as easy possible during a particular period.",31

302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Parramatta) [12.40] - The Prime Minister's Department is an entirely - new one, and I should like to know whether the head of the Government will be good enough to indicate to the Committee what its creation really means. I see no sense in calling into being a new Department if it will not lead to economy being effected elsewhere. This Department, I observe, has taken over the functions of the Public Service Commissioner and the Auditor-General. Altogether I note that it is costing - about ,Â£11,000.",33
303,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If the honourable member takes into consideration the transfers which have been effected, he will see that the difference amounts to only a few hundred pounds. within the Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Las t year there was expended by the Department .Â£6,966, and this year it is proposed to appropriate Â£11,795 - a n increase, roughly, of Â£5,000. Has a corresponding decrease been effected in the expenditure of those Departments from which functions have been taken over? If so, there is justification for the creation of this new Department. But unless some increased efficiency will result from the change, or a corresponding saving will be effected in other Departments, it is difficult to see why this new Department has been created, especially when we recollect that there are a couple of Honorary Ministers in the Cabinet who are able to assist Ministers who may be overburdened with work. In this new Department, I notice such items as "" writing paper and envelopes, including cost of printing and embossing thereon,"" "" incidental and petty PAPERS. cash expenditure,"" and "" temporary assistance"" appear. I observe, too, that the number of clerks has been increased by three. "" Temporary assistance "" is to cost Â£200. There has been an increase in the "" incidental and petty cash expenditure,"" and ""travelling expenses"" are set down at Â£200. To what do those, expenses relate?",33
304,Mr FISH ER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [12.45] - The honourable member's question is quite a pertinent and proper one. The Estimates show an increased expenditure for the current year as compared with that of last year, of Â£ 1 0 , 6 7 5 , whilst the Prime Minister's office discloses an increase of Â£ 4 , 8 2 9 . The explanation is that the Secretary, Mr. Shepherd, receives an increment of Â£ 8 0 as the permanent head of the Department. Practically the whole of the balance is covered by printing and distributing the Commonwealth Statutes to State Governments and others. For this purpose a sum of Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 is provided. mated expenditure upon historic memorials of representative men is Â£[2,000, the Imperial Trade Commission will absorb Â£ > 5 5 Â° , and an addition of four has been I made to the staff, consisting of two f if t h class clerks at .Â£126 and ^ 1 1 0 respectively, an assistant at Â£ 1 2 6 , and a messenger at .Â£39 . The honourable member for Parramatta asked why we have established a Prime Minister's Department. In the early days of Federation, as both he and the honourable membeT for Ballarat will recollect, the Prime Minister generally acted as Minister of External Affairs, and all the records which passed between the Commonwealth and the oversea authorities, and also between the State Governments and the Imperial authorities, had to pass through his hands. It is inevitable that the Prime Minister must sign every document of that description. a change was made, and another Minister took charge of the Department of External Affairs. The Prime Minister thus became divorced from the records that ought to be available to hira. It was desirable, too, that the Auditor-General should be under the control of the Prime Minister, and the same remark is applicable to the Public Service Commissioner. quently these offices were transferred to the Prime Minister's Department, and with the exception of the items which I have mentioned they account for the whole of the increased expenditure. think, a sound principle that we should have a Prime Minister's Department. instituting one we are not singular. haps the time will come, and that soon, when the Prime Minister will be sufficiently employed in looking after his own Department.",33
305,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Then the Department of External Affairs has really become a local office?,34
306,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,It deals with territories and with foreign affairs just as it would do if we were a nation. It deals with any communication external to Australia and of a territorial character.,34
307,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,-Not with the Northern Territory?,34
308,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Yes . It deals with the Northern Territory and with Papua. Literally speaking the Northern Territory is not an external part of the Commonwealth, but it is a territory, andSiere-as The esti- in the United States- a territory is not considered to be in the same category as a State.",34
309,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,In America a territory has never been considered as external.,34
310,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is what we might call ""ex-State."" In other words, it is nota State territory. At any rate the Department shows no serious increase in its expenditure. Perhaps the honourable member for Parramatta would like to look at this official document which has been handed to me.",34
311,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Franklin) [12.49]. - I think the Committee ought to pause before it consents to the creation of any new departments whatever.,34
312,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It might do so in Tasmania, but not here. Subsequently Mr MCWILLIAMS - A very much more important matter for consideration is the redistribution of portfolios. At the present time we have a Department of External Affairs from which the real work of the External Affairs office has been transferred to the Department of the Prime Minister. I think that that is a very proper move. All the important Conse- business of the Commonwealth connected with dealings with the other parts of the Empire should be under the immediate direction of the Prime Minister, who is responsible to Parliament and to Australia. It is, I for what is done, and is the only man who can be held responsible. The real In diplomatic work of the Commonwealth Per- should be directed by the Prime Minister. The arrangement of the business of the Department of External Affairs is a matter which Parliament should consider. The control of the Northern Territory is not an External Affairs' matter, properly speaking, and, in my opinion, should be removed to . the Department of Home Affairs. Then, again, we have at least three Works Branches uncler as many Ministers. Excavation work done on behalf of the Postmaster-General's Department ought to be controlled by the Works Branch of the Home Affairs Department, which has a staff of Works officers, but there is now a Works Branch of the Postmaster-General's Department. Similarly, work in the Northern Territory, for which the officers of the Works Branch of the Home Affairs Department should be responsible, is being carried out under officers of the External Affairs. This sort of thing must result in duplication, loss of time, and an increase in cost. Mr FRANK. FOSTER - How would it be to have a Minister for the Northern Territory ?",34
313,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I do not think that there would be enough work for one Minister. But it seems to me that we might now abolish the Department of External Affairs and have a Minister for Railways and Public Works, seeing that we are committed to a Works expenditure of at least Â£20,000,000 in connection with the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, the railway from the Northern Territory, which is being brought southward, although it would have been better to have commenced at the south and have worked northward, the laying out and building of the Federal Capital, and other public works. If the control of public works were given to a Minister made wholly responsible for it, the Minister of Home Affairs could direct the legitimate work of his office, including the administration of Northern Territory affairs, which are Home Affairs and not External Affairs. In the early days of Federation, the office of Minister of Home Affairs was, perhaps, the easiest to fill, but it has now become the hardest.",35
314,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Wit h the exception of the post-office.,35
315,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"There is not much alteration in the work of the post office, though I admit that it demands the time and attention of the best man to be got to fill the position of Postmaster General. So much has been thrown into the Home Affairs Department that the work there now is too much for any one - man. If the Minister of Home Affairs gave the time and attention necessary for the proper, control of public works expenditure, he would have to absolutely neglect the other work of the .Department. Turning now to another subject, I wish to refer to what I call the automatic increasing of the salaries of the more highly paid officials. It is not pleasant to have to deal with individual cases, but we must take notice of the fact that the salary of the Secretary to the Prime Minister is being automatically increased from Â£[520 to ,Â£600. We should hesitate before automatically increasing by so large a sum the salary of a highly-paid official. I have always thought that we started our Federal Service at least two octaves too high. There are already signs of financial pressure, and when it comes, the pruning knife will have to be applied to the Service seriously and systematically, and naturally the highly-paid officials who are getting these automatic increases will have to suffer reductions. Before we increase the salaries of highly-paid officials, we should see that those in charge of the semi-official and non-official post-offices who give the whole of their time to the work of the Commonwealth, should receive at least something approaching a living wage. At present they do not do that. On this first item, the Committee has an opportunity to express an opinion regarding the automatic increasing of the salaries of the more highly-paid officials.",35

319,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Franklin) [2.33]. - In dealing with the Prime Minister's Department, I am not singling out an individual! case, but merely taking the first that occurs on the Estimates, in order that the Committee may have an opportunity to express an opinion whether the pay of the higher-paid officials should be automatically increased. A decision on the point would save discussion on all the other cases, because, if the increase in the salary of the Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department is agreed to, there can be no ground for opposing other increases proposed subsequently, which may have equal, if not greater, claims to our approval. I shall, at the proper time, move that the Secretary's salary be reduced by .Â£80, thus restoring it to the original sum. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [2.35] - Personally , I hope this amendment will not be pressed to a division. At any time. I am loth to support reductions or oppose increases in the salaries of our officers, no matter of what grade; but, at the same time, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that there is general complaint amongst the lower-paid members of the Service to the effect that the increases are abnormally high in the higher grades of the various. Departments, and less consideration is shown to the officers in lower grades. Of course, I take it that the honourable member for Franklin is using the present occasion to draw attention to that fact, but he has not advanced any particular reason why the salary of the Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department should be reduced. The honourable member, however, is justified in the course he has taken in view of the motives which inspire his action; his desire is to test the question as applied to the whole of the Service. I only wish our finances were so buoyant, and so permanent in their buoyancy, as to warrant our raising the salaries of all the officers Service, but it seems hard to a large number in the lower grades that their claims appear often to be disregarded, while officers who are already paid fair salaries, appear to have no difficulty in securing stantial annual increments",35
320,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Hav e those lower-grade servants not their own system of increases? lower-paid Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Yes ; but there is a way of so working the system through administration that the automatic increases do not result out as the men expected. The complaint is that when they ask for increments they are forced into the Arbitration Court, and they think that the officers in the higher branches should be made to apply to a similar tribunal, and all should be treated alike in that regard. If there was an upward tendency in the finances, we might well be justified in giving increases all round, but, unfortunately, the tendency at present seems to be in the contrary direction. The question arises whether it is not time to look more closely into some of the proposed increases, and see whether the services rendered are not adequately paid for at the present salaries. The honourable member for Franklin is not far wrong when he says that there are indications of financial stringency in the near future, and he fears that Parliament may be called upon to reduce some salaries. I hope that that time will not come, but, if the present trend continues, it seems to me there is a risk of overloading the Public Service with increases in directions where increases, except under special circumstances, mean overpayment for the character of the services rendered. My own feeling is to support increases, but only in those cases where the services do not appear, owing to increased duties and responsibilities, to be adequately remunerated at the present time. I should like to see the salaries of many of the officers of the House increased, because I do not think that some of them are getting as much as they are worth. However, unless the honourable member for Franklin can show some very substantial reasons for opposing the proposed increase, I hope that he will not press his suggested amendment to a division.",36
321,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.40] - The honorin the able member for Lang, I understand, has asked for some information regarding the status of the lower-paid officers in the Service, and, in reply, I should like to read sub- the following communication from the Public Service Commissioner :The Public Service Commissioner has prepared a return which shows that the interests of the divisions of the Service have not been overlooked in the distribution to be made He points out that while 747 officers in the higher divisions are to receive increases, no fewer than 9,105 in the lower"" divisions are to be similarly treated, and that the total amount involved in the payment to the former amounts to / i 8 , o i 6 as against the sum of ^ i o o , r for the latter. 4 S The allocation of the increases is as under :HIGHER CLASSES.

322,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Bendigo) [2.44] The proposed increase in the salary of the Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department affords a suitable opportunity to draw attention to the increases generally in the salaries of the higher ranks of the Commonwealth officials, so that we may ascertain the principles on which these are suggested. There is, no doubt, a great deal of dissatisfaction in the middle ranks of the Commonwealth Service about the increases of salaries of the higher-paid officials in the Clerical Division. I have followed the correspondence, which began with a telegram from Sydney published in a Melbourne paper on the 13th October, to the effect that in the General Division of the Public Service there is great dissatisfaction owing to the decision of the Government that the unions representing the General Division must place their request for higher pay before the Arbitration Court, while the Estimates provide for increases to the higher officers without recourse to the Court.",37

' I say that the men in the General Division do not have their increments decided by law to the same extent as is the case in connection with the officers of the Clerical Division, and that when they make complaints they are told to go to the Arbitration Court. It involves a great deal of trouble, delay, expense, and organization to go to the Court. I think that the comments already made are fully justified when we find such an increment as that now before us in respect of a high class officer in the very forefront of the Estimates. No wonder these men complain when they are told to go to the Coiirt.",37

334,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member is either displaying lamentable ignorance, or is wilfully misrepresenting the position. .",38
335,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am not. I took up the same attitude when the Public Service Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was before the House. I said then that the Public Service Commissioner should be the Arbitration Court for Public Service officials. When they are dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner they should be entitled to go to the Minister or to Parliament. They are told, however, to go to Court. I opposed the passing of that law. I should like more information as to whether there are not reasonable grounds for complaint made by men in the middle class of the General Division. I should like to know whether their claims have been ignored unjustly, and whether they have been shunted into the Court, where they are liable to all kinds of delay, worry, and irritation. I do not feel disposed to oppose any individual increase that the Minister feels justified in recommending. I am not for reductions, but, on the other hand, I think that there ought to be an equalization in the system of granting increments all round, and that one class who may be near the Minister ought not to be placed in a more advantageous position than are the rank and file who have not the ear of the Minister, and who have been told to go to the Court.",38
336,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Minister cannot provide for an increase except in the case of a high administrative officer.,38
337,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If the Minister is not satisfied with the gradations sanctioned by the Commissioner, he should propose an amendment of the law. Instead of doing that,. however, the Minister has told these men to go to the Arbitration Court, and that is a discrimination against them in favour of the highly-paid, classified clerical officers.",38
338,Mr FOWLER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Perth) [2.48] - I agree with the honourable member for Franklin that' this matter of giving almost general increases to those who are already enjoying fairly good salaries demands the serious consideration of the Committee. It is unpleasant to particularize, but I think that the honourable member for Franklin is entitled to ask for further information than has yet been accorded regarding the justification for the increase in this case. The officer in question may have shown remarkable ability, but only a few years have elapsed since he occupied a by no means responsible position. He is now enjoying a very good salary, and is at the hesd of a Department that appears to be developing to a remarkable extent. We are surely entitled to more information as to the wonderful progress that this gentleman has made, and as to the growth of the Department generally. We have had read to us a document which I understand has come from the Public Service Commissioner showing the amount that has been expended by way of increases to the rank and file, but when we recollect the very general increase in the cost of living during the last few years, and remember that at' the most the rank and file get a Â£ 5 note occasionally thrown at them, we must recognise that such an increment will by no means level up their conditions to what they were a few years ago. The fact that heads of Departments and sub-Departments are receiving increases of from Â£ 8 0 to Â£ 1 00 a year to their already good salaries displays on the part of the present Government a very remarkable discrepancy in dealing with the Public Service as a whole, and I , for one, shall certainly support the action which the honourable member for Franklin proposes to take.",38
339,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"North Sydney) [2.56] - I have no objection to the salaries of the more highly-paid officers being increased, but I think that there should be a general increase throughout the Public Service. Having regard to the increase in the cost of living, it is only fair that there should be a general increase in the salaries and wages of the public servants of the Commonwealth. I would point that whereas the Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department is set down for an increase of Â£ 8 0 a year no provision is made for an increase in the salary of the Senior Clerk.",38

Then, again, two fifth-class clerks received last year difficult Â£340, or ,Â£170 each, whereas these Estimates provide for four fifth-class clerks, vice who are to receive Â£516 , or only Â£144 per annum each. There is therefore reduction in the salary of those clerks.",39

They appear to make their own arrangements, and to distribute salaries just as they may deem fit. That circumstance bears out the gestion that the claims of officers in middle ranks of our Public Service* are Parliament. ignored. The higher-paid officers receive increments because they come into close daily contact with Ministers, and the lowerpaid officials-if their claims should be overlooked-ca n obtain redress only through the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. But officers of the middle grades of our Public Service can obtain no redress.",39

At the same time. I do not say that Parliament has not vested the Public Service Commissioner with too much power. If so. the Public Service Act might well be amended.

But I cannot make out why certain officers have been recommended for increases whilst the claims of others have been neglected. From information which I have received it appears to me that officers who received no increment last year - had no right to be treated in that fashion. .Sometimes it happens that a public servant makes himself obnoxious to the head' of his Department, and the latter endeavours to retard his promotion as much as possible.

I observe that highly-paid officers and those in the lower grades of the Service are to receive certain increments, whereas officers in the intermediate grades are to receive no increments. The statement of the Prime Minister has not enlightened us upon this matter, nor have the interjections of the Minister of External Affairs.

361,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Parkes) [3.14].. cussion affords a very useful peg upon which to hang some observations concerning the treatment of the Public Service of this country. This matter has been discussed here on many occasions. I recollect very well the debate which took place when. our Public Service Act was introduced in 1902. The question then arose as to whether our Public Service and itsmanagement should be intrusted to a non-political person or Board, or whether it should remain in the hands of a Minister. When the honourable member for Hume brought in his Bill for placing the Public. Service on a permanent footing, it was; framed so that the Minister would be the pivot upon which all appointments would' turn. To him was reserved the right to* appoint, dismiss, promote, and disrate as he might think fit. But I was very glad to see that the House was not in the humour for allowing political influence to be abused in the Commonwealth as it had been abused in the States, and refused toperpetuate a vicious and corrupt system. At one time in New South Wales a Member of Parliament almost needed a turnstile at the entrance to his office or chambers so that applicants for appointment in-; the Public Service might present themselves only one at a time. Applications-. for positions were so numerous as to positive nuisance. All sorts of tioneering advantages were offered as ducements to members to obtain positions ciple of non-political appointments. for constituents. That system has since been altered, and this House, in 1902, showed clearly that it would not allow to be established in the Commonwealth. The Bill introduced by the honourable ber for Humewas turned inside out, and made an entirely new measure, appointsometimes ments to the Public Service being put under the control of a non-political head. I am glad that the choice of the first lic Service Commissioner fell upon the gentleman who still holds the position, cause, when a Minister in New South Wales, I knew him as Secretary of a lic Department, and was aware that no that more impartial or judicially-minded man could have been chosen. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has complained that there are letter carriers now in the - service of the Commonwealth who are rethe ceiving not more than ,Â£3 a week, although they have been twenty-five years in the vice of the public. It is not for me Slow much letter-carrying is worth. In - opinion, a man who is appointed to a .position in the Public Service should paid so long as he remains there the salary attached to that position. He should not (have the right to annual increases without limit. Every position in the service should 4iave a salary attached to it, and the man appointed to it, no matter how low his previous salary might have been, should be paid the higher salary from the moment that he' was intrusted with the responsiunder bilities of the position. The practice of appointing men at lower salaries than - predecessors received in the offices which they fill, giving occasional rises, is - one. Of course, the difficulty of determinvernment ing the proper remuneration for any office is very great. Two or three years ago, Mr. Justice Hood, on an appeal from a Wages Board, was asked to say what was a living wage. He pointed out that what would be a living wage for a young bachelor, Avithout responsibilities, would not be living wage for a married man with a family, and possibly a sick wife, and that, therefore, it was impossible to determine what is a living wage.

Mr Bruce Smith. be a year, he should be at once paid ,Â£500 a elecyear. There has been a gradual departure inin the Commonwealth from the sound prinA Public Service should possess attractions. When the Bill of 1902 was before the it House, I pointed out that the head of the Service should be a position carrying a memvery high salary. I mentioned that the heads of the British Public Service have been put into the House of Lords, and are paid ,Â£5,000 a year, and that young men are attracted to the Service Pubbecause of the prospect of some day filling these high positions. We began by fixing be the salary of the highest officer in the Service, the Public Service Commissioner, at pub- ,Â£1,200 a year. I have always contended that office, being at the apex of the Service, should be a more attractive one, so that the best young men from the schools would wish to enter the Public Service in hope of some day reaching that pinnacle. There are many men who declined to enter serthe Public Service, because they believed to say that the maximum salary which they my could ever get was Â£1,200 a year, whereas those who are successful in the professions be may count upon making ,Â£2,000 or ,Â£3,006 a year within a comparatively short time. We should not only give a high salary to the Public Service Commissioner, but should also provide substantia!, and even generous, salaries for the permanent heads of the Departments. If patronage is to be used in appointments to the Service, instead of leaving appointments strictly the control of an impartial and judi1 cious Commissioner, all sorts of abuses may their happen. There are many men in the Service who are qualified to fill positions in a bad the Northern Territory to which the Gohave appointed men who were not previously in the Service. Members of the Service have seen the disheartening spectacle of a rejected parliamentary candidate being shoved over their heads into one of the best positions in the Service. The office of Director of Lands in the a Northern Territory is now filled by one large who was a rejected candidate for the Queensland Legislative Assembly. He has been placed over a large body of public is servants, and given a salary of Â£800 a year, although there are many men in the Service at salaries of from .Â£400 to ,Â£600 a a year who were capable and desirous of",40

I refer to that case only as a typical one, because many appointments have been made, apparently correctly, but really by the exercise of political influence, which is stultifying and undermining the principle of the Public Service Act. For years, as Minister, I did not make an appointment except through the Public Service Commissioners, and I should not approve of appointments being made in any other way - There are persons in our Public Service holding important positions who receive very inadequate salaries.

371,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The minimum salary now is ^126 a year.,42
372,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Then salary was 3Q126.,42
373,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member said just now that positions should have certain fixed salaries attached to them, and that we should 'provide salaries for the positions and not for the men who fill them.",42
374,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is so. I am not contending that because a man has occupied a position for twenty-four years he should receive a higher salary, but where a man is intrusted with large sums of money, surely his place is worth more than Â£126 a year? That pay is not as much as a labourer receives; and, although 1 do not desire to underrate manual work, I say that a man who works with his head is entitled to more than the man who works with his hands, because the headworker works with his hands also. Some of those who make the most clamour about manual labour have the softest hands in the House. Some honourable members talk as if they had been at manual work since their childhood, but the greatest talkers amongst them have hands like women- I have felt them. A demagogue may not know that, sometimes, when he is shaking hands, these are being felt in order to test him as to the work he has done. However, I agree with those who say that no undue advantage should be given to certain positions in the Service. The middle, lower, and higher grades are entitled to equal treatment, and my idea is that each position, ought to have a fixed salary. This end, together with consistency, can only be attained by having the Act administered by one man or a Board of men, and there should be no such thing as a Minister undertaking to get his Secretary, because he happens to be a good fellow, an increase of ^20 a year. If a Minister does that sort of thing, which he does not often do, with his own money, it is all right;, but in regard-to the public moneys there is a principle to be observed. I repeat that, as a result of thirty years' experience of public life, each position ought to have a fixed salary; and when living is very expensive all the fixed salaries might' well* be raised. I believe, with Judge Hood, that it is impossible to fix remuneration according to what is called "" a living wage,"" because what is a living wage for a batchelor may be a pittance for a man witha large family. This only shows that theliving wage is a wrong economic test, and that all these matters ought to be arranged this by the head of the Public Service, whoacts irrespective of persons or personal qualifications except so far as these bear on the performance of the duties. I have not looked through the Estimates to see whether it is true that, while the heads of Departments, who come immediately under the notice of Ministers, have had their salaries raised in all cases, the middle and lower men have not been similarly treated; but if such is the fact it is a wrong principle. Every one here, irrespective of party, ought to deprecate the singling out of particular men, unless they are raised to higher positions, or the Minister is satisfied that their remuneration is inadequate; there should be no making fish cf one and flesh of the other. If a man is constantly moving up the rungs of the ladder as he shows himself fit, he will, of course, get frequent rises in salary; and if this were always the case, we should not hear of men being advanced on no principle. I protest against men having their salaries raised by Ministers, or by the Ministry, except through the medium of the Public Service Commissioner, who shpuld always have a free hand to act as he thinks fit in the interests of the Service.",42
375,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Coolgardie) [3.35] - It is very refreshing to hear the honourable member for Parkes advocating reforms which have been on the platform of the Labour party for many years. It is an evidence that we are making some progress, that the world continues to move, as it were. I think - this side of the House will cordially endorse the sentiments of the honourable member, although we may not be able to live up to his very lofty ideals. The party sustaining this Government has been always willing to recognise the claims of the public servants to fair remuneration, and I agree with the honourable member that each position should carry a fixed salary-that when a man attains to a certain post, however high the jump may be, he.should receive the salary attached to it. I cannot, how-ever, accept the honourable member's infer-ences that an attack is being made on the Public Service Commissioner's independence by the Ministry, or by honourable members on this side. So far as my recol'lection goes, there have been no political ^appointments such as the honourable member - suggests. He must be aware that the appointments to the Northern Territory are outside the jurisdiction conferred by the Public Service'Act upon the Commissioner; - they stand much on the same footing as .appointments in Papua, where the Lieutenant-Governor is the responsible person. In the case of the Northern Territory the Minister of External Affairs stands in the position of the Public Service Commissioner. The honourable member for Parkes contends that the gentleman appointed as Director of Lands is not as fit for the position as some one in the Public Service. He did not give the House even a hint as to where this superior officer was to be found. As a general principle, I deny straight out that public servants, regardless of merit and efficiency, should have a prior right to all vacancies. The honourable member knows that some 90 per cent, of our public servants have only clerical experience. It cannot, therefore, be contended that for a position of this kind persons with only clerical experience are as fit as men possessing wide and varied knowledge of agricultural conditions. I say this as one who has at all times supported just and even liberal treatment of public servants. Where exceptional qualifications are required, and men possessing these do not offer or are not available from the Public Service, then the community has a right to look for and obtain the best man amongst outside applicants. As the sphere of the Commonwealth's operations are widening, and works are being initiated such as Government Departments have not handled before, many vacancies must arise which can only be filled to the community's advantage by giving the Government the freest hand in the selection of suitable agents. Indeed, this is recognised in the Public Service Act of 1902, which the honourable member for Parkes eulogized just now. In that Act we arranged for a Professional Division, to which men from outside can be appointed on account of their special qualifications. That is precisely the position in which Mr. Ryland stands.",43
376,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Does the honourable member think that the position of Director of Lands is a professional position?,43
377,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I think it is a professional position in that the Director must know something about the settlement of land, and must have experience which very ifew public servants are likely to possess.",43
378,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What does Mr Ryland know about it?,43
379,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,He knows more than does the honourable member for North Sydney.,43
380,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I know that Mr. Ryland is said to have on one occasion taken the advice of his Chinese cook.,43
381,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I can assure the honourable member that Mr Ryland is a gentleman, whatever else he is.",44
382,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am not prepared with the biography of Mr Ryland, but I believe that he was born and brought up on a farm, and has had a good deal of farming experience in both hemispheres.",44
383,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That experience will not be of much use in the Northern Territory.,44
384,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Surely a man who has been born and brought up on a farm is more fitted to direct farming operations than one who has been all his life over a ledger ?,44
385,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Many men are over ledgers who have been born and brought up on farms.,44
386,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"But they soon forget their farming. A young man, when he enters the Public Service, must be under twenty-one, and the subsequent experience of nine-tenths of the public servants is clerical, made up of keeping books, writing letters, and so forth. Surely it is reasonable and rational for a Minister to look around side in the case of such aopointments as we are discussing, and in view of the new and important responsibilities we have taken over in the Northern Territory. - Had Mr Ryland not been a Labour man, and had the misfortune to be rejected at the Queensland elections, I suppose we should not have heard a word of objection to his appointment.  got the appointment?",44
387,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I should say that if his qualifications justified it, and he had an opportunity of making them known, he would have got the appointment. ",44
388,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"As to the general principle of making all appointments from the Public Service, the necessities of the monwealth will compel a halt, because the time is coming when the Service may not be able to supply efficient men all the positions that will be vacant. I am prepared to support the Public Service Commissioner, and respect him as an independent and impartial man, I am not prepared to say that he should be consulted in all cases, and his decision accepted in regard to appointments, especially in view of the taking over of the Northern Territory and the large contemplated railway and other works.",44
389,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That opens the door to a great many irregularities, as the honourable member will admit.",44
390,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If we go into the matter closely, I am not sure that social influence is not as noxious as political influence.",44
391,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,No one is talking of social influence.,44
392,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"We are not talking about it, but it has played a large part in Public Service promotions, if not in Public Service appointments.",44
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Does that account for the large number appointed by this Government? Social influence would appear to be very much at work lately if that is so.,44
394,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I do not think that even a member of the honourable member's Go-' vernment is entitled to throw stones. I am rather surprised that the honourable member forParkes should have overlooked a matter which to many people is far more serious than any count in the indictment that he framed against the Government. Seeing out- that the Public Service Commissioner is appointed to deal with the pay and conditions of the Public Service as a whole, it is strange that the honourable member should! have passed over the fundamental departure that has been made in invoking the aicl of the Arbitration Court to override the decisions of that officer.",44
395,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"^In my opinion, that should not have been done. e",44
396,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am not expressing any opinion as to the wisdom or propriety of this proceeding; I am merely pointing'out that the honourable member failed had to' touch upon a departure more serious than any that he mentioned. I desire now to refer briefly to certain matters in connection with the Commonwealth Bank. The Prime Minister was recently asked to state - what salary the Deputy Governor Comreceived prior to his appointment to his present office, and I understand that he replied that the information was given to for the Government in confidence, and presumWhile ably could not be disclosed.",44
397,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I think we could be relieved of that obligation.,44
398,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I hope so. because at least fifty of the principal banking men of Sydney must know what salary he was receiving before he entered the service of the Commonwealth Bank. If it be true that he was receiving under .Â£700 a year, I can only say that he has made a very good bargain with the Commonwealth, which has undertaken to pay him .Â£1,500 a year. If he is worth Â£1,500 a year, it is remarkable that the Bank of Australasia did not realise that fact before he left its service.",44
399,Mr FISHEK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I think that the honourable member will appreciate the point that his interest under the bank's superannuation scheme, which he had to forego, represented a very considerable amount.",45
400,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I should imagine that an. officer retiring, as this gentleman has done, from' the service of the bank, would receive some allowance from that fund.",45
401,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"He did not receive a penny, and his interest must have run into thousands.",45
402,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That may alter the position, but the increase certainly appears to be a very substantial one. I come now to the purchase of property by the Governor of the Bank. Judging by the answer - which the Prime Minister made to a question which I addressed to him yesterday, it would seem that this gentleman is allowed to buy property for Commonwealth purposes at his own sweet will, and to pay fpr it whatever sum he pleases. I do not consider it right that we should give to any - one man the power to commit the Commonwealth to an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds without our knowSedge. - Mr FISHER - He does not do so.",45
403,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Prime Minister's Teply to^my question led me to believe that <he did.,45
404,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I said that he always - municated with me.,45
405,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That does not materially improve the position. I question the wisdom of allowing the Governor unlimited discretion in regard to the extensive purchase of property. Doubtless his banking experience has given him a knowledge of values, but he would be a truly remarkable man if he had a knowledge of the value of property throughout all the capital cities of Australia. He may know the value of land in Svdney and Melbourne, but it is hardly reasonable to assume that fee is able to appraise the market value of property in all parts of the Commonwealth.",45
406,Mr WEST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,-He may obtain advice.,45
407,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"And my complaint is that the advice may be tainted; it may be good, bad, or indifferent. Instead of investing the Governor of the Bank with power to buy land, unchecked by any authority, the services of the expert officers, of the Department of Home Affairs should be utilized for the purpose. If there is to be a departure at all from the established practice, this power ought not to be placed in the hands of any one man.",45
408,Mr SAMPSON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,How would it do to hand over the power to any one Minister?,45
409,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,No ; I would prefer to give the power to the Governor of the Bank rather than to an individual Minister.,45
410,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I think that he has invariably invoked the aid of the expert officers of the Department of Home Affairs.,45
411,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If so, it is satisfactory. The fact remains, however, that under the existing conditions he is the final arbiter of the price to be paid for property for the purposes of the Commonwealth Bank, and in view of the fact that we shall be incurring a very heavy expenditure in connection with that institution, I think that the Government should reconsider the matter, and determine whether a small Committee of the higher officers of the Treasury and the Department of Home Affairs should not be appointed to act with the Governor in considering proposals for the purchase of land for banking purposes.",45
412,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Governor's purchases have been excellent, and speedily carried out. They have been commended by the officers.",45
413,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am pleased to have that information, but I would remind the right honourable gentleman that the Parliacom- ment itself knows nothing of these transactions. We read in the press that the Governor of the Bank is purchasing land in the centre of Brisbane, and in the most valuable part of Sydney, for the purposes of the bank, but we do not know on whose advice he is acting.",45
414,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I shall bring down a report on the subject. The property acquired in Brisbane will return 3 per cent, on the purchase money, and give the Governor his own accommodation free.",45
415,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It may return 3 per cent, at the present time, but what will it yield twenty years hence? The fullest details as to all these transactions should be laid before the House.",45
416,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I shall do that.,45
417,Mr MAHON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I thank the Prime Minister; but, at the same time, I consider that it should not be left to the sweet will of any one man to commit the Commonwealth to an enormous expenditure without the Parliament knowing more about such transactions than we do at the presenttime.",45
418,Dr MALONEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Melbourne) [3.55] Such an amendment as that which has been indicated is always a difficult one to deal with. I have the highest regard for one of the officers whose salary it is proposed to increase. His official experience extends over some twenty-five years, and a salary of .Â£600 a year at the end of that long service ought not to be too high for a man of his capability and intellectual potentialities. At the same time, if a division called for, I shall vote for the amendment as a protest against increasing the salaries of officers in the higher divisions of the Service, whilst those in the lower ranks are told to go to the Arbitration Court. I shall do so to mark my disapproval of the lack of consideration that appears to be shown by all Governments for the lowerpaid men of the Service. The Minister of External Affairs evidently misunderstood a statement that I made a few moments ago. What I said was that if public servants are to be given the right of appeal to the Arbitration Court, it should be compulsory for men of all ranks in the Service-fro m the highest to the lowest-to appeal to that Court. I am confident that the citizens of Australia who created this Parliament are opposed to any discrimination in this regard. If any members of the Public Service are to be told by the responsible Minister to go to the Arbitration Court, then it should be compulsory for every member of the Service, with the exception of the Public Service Commissioner himself, to do so. It has become almost a legend throughout Australia that if a man wishes to make progress in an official life, he must bask in the bright sunshine of the Ministerial presence.",46
419,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,All members of the Public Service may go to the Court now.,46
420,Dr MALONEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,But they are not told by the Minister to do so.,46
421,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,There is nothing to prevent their going to the Court if they are not satisfied with the Commissioner.,46
422,Dr MALONEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,They could jump into the Yarra if they wished to do so.,46
423,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The point that I wish to make is that they could not go to the Court, even if they wished to do so, twelve months ago.",46
424,Dr MALONEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am sure we shall find on inquiry that even in the higher ranks of the Service those who do not come mostly into contact-with Ministers have not obtained the increases that have been granted to others. Even the Commissioner himself was granted an extended term of official life during a recess when Parliament could not express an opinion in regard to the matter. As to these increases, I do not wish to suggest that the Crown Solicitor is not worthy of an advance. I believe that had he remained outside the Service, his income would have been larger, but as against that, he would not have had the standing attaching to the office of Crown Solicitor of the Commonis wealth, nor would his income have been as permanent as it is. The Public Service Commissioner is only human, and, after all, must make mistakes like other people. He made a very serious blunder when he insulted every member of the medical profession in this part of the Commonwealth by sending to Western Australia for a lady medical practitioner to be engaged in connection with the service in Melbourne, when there were in this city, as well as in Sydney, lady doctors holding equally high diplomas, and, in some cases, diplomas superior to those held by the lady whom he selected for the office.. In that case both medical men and women strongly resented what they regarded as an act of favouritism by the Public Service Commissioner. The matter was afterwards dealt with in this House. A deputation of the medical faculty waited upon the Minister in regard to it, and I am glad to say that from the Prime Minister's Department down, it has'now been made absolutely impossible for any such favouritism to be exhibited. I heartily support the suggestion of the honourable member for Parkes. It would be well if every position in our Public Service could be marked out as one carrying a certain salary. Then the individual who occupied it, and had not the mental equipment torise higher could not complain. But the lowest wage paid in our Public Service should be a living wage sufficient to enable a man to maintain himself and his family in comfort. We desire to build up a civilization in this country such as the world has never seen, and we can do that: only by levelling up, and not by levelling down. I have never heard of a member of the Labour party advocating a levellingdown process. The historian of the future will pay his meed of praise to the work, done by this Parliament.",46
425,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Mr Knibbs says that if all the wealth of the world were divided equally, it would only give each individual JQI6 a year in excess of .Â£200.",46
426,Dr MALONEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I have the greatest respect for Mr Knibbs, and I am glad to know that my admiration of him is shared by the head of the Statistical Department of the United States, who has recently paid him a. very high compliment. But if this Parliament is going to say that any of our public servants who are not content with the decisions of the Public Service Commissioner shall be at liberty to appeal to the Arbitration Court, every officer in the Commonwealth service ought to be endowed with a similar right. There is one matter connected with these Estimates which puzzles me somewhat-it relates to the question of pensions. However, I shall reserve my remarks under that heading until a ^ater stage. I think it would be well if at the beginning of each session the Government had a list circulated of the increases over Â£ 2 0 a year which it is proposed to grant to our public officers. Honourable members would then be able to study it at their leisure. They would thus be able to speak with better knowledge when the Estimates came under review. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) {4.5] - Honourable members have previously had reason to complain of the unsatisfactory way in which appointments are being made to our Public Service, and of the fact that the control of the Service is gradually, but surely, being taken but of the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. In other words, we are slowly drifting back to the objectionable system of political patronage. Notwithstanding the attempt which has been made by one or two Ministers to gloss over the circumstance, it is a fact that great dissatisfactionexists, especially amongst the officers of the lower grades of our Public Service in connection with the matter of increments. In an interview published in the Argus of the 20th October last, one of the representatives of these lower-paid officials, speaking on their behalf, complained very bitterly of the manner in which increments are dealt with. pointed out thatA few months ago the Clerical Division was advanced from Â£160 a year to Â£200 a year, attainable by annual increments. Now the Professional Division men in receipt of over ^300 a year were to receive enormous increases. A these officers were receiving salaries above necessity, and even a certain amount of luxury. I take it that we all desire to see our officers drawing salaries sufficiently large to enable them to"" enjoy as many luxuries as possible. But due regard must be paid to the nature of the services which they render, and to what constitutes a fair remuneration for those services. This representative of the lower-paid officers saidA l l that the Labour Government had done for the General Division had been to give a wage of 8s. a day at the age of 21 years. That concession was never asked for, and would have been attained under ordinary circumstances a few years later. As it was, officers of the General Division receiving 8s. a day, at 21 years of age, had to wait on that salary for four years before they advanced. The Labour Government had also decreased the period of waiting for long-service increments from ^138 a year to ^150 a year, from ten years to four years. The maximum salary of the General Division officers had not been increased, except in a few isolated cases. The conditions which now existed were certainly much improved for those now entering the service; but for officers who had been in the General Division for 15 or 20 years, and over, comparatively no increase had been granted. The high cost of living within the last few years had brought no increase in the wages of the rank and file of the Commonwealth Public Service. Numerous representations had been made to different Ministers, especially the Postmaster-General, and though no Minister had attempted to combat the arguments advanced for an increase, it had been said that the Cabinet had decided that no in r crease should be given unless obtained by an award of the Arbitration Court. I do not know whether the Cabinet did come to that decision, but evidently applications had been made for increments, and the reply of Ministers had been that the officers in question must appeal to the Arbitration Court. Ministers thus adopted an easy method of shunting their responsibility.",47
427,Mr SINCLAIR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is rather a slow, process. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is. If there were many appeals to the Arbitration Court, a long time would necessarily elapse before tbose appeals could be finally disposed of. Indeed, before they had been dealt with, the appellants would probably be entitled to a still further increase. Speaking of the appeal to the Arbitration Court, the same representative of the lower-, paid officers of our Public Service saidThis decision would be equitable if all secHe tions-Professional , Clerical, and General Division-were compelled to go to the Court, but preference to the Professional and Clerical Divisions was discreditable to any party: _ The Labour Government increased the maximum salaries of the professional and clerical staffs, and the salary of the Commissioner, by ^400; l l but the General Division had received no substantial increase, and was forced to go to the Arbitration Court to secure common justice. I make these quotations for the purpose of showing that a great deal of dissatisfaction exists amongst our lower-paid officers-dis satisfaction which seems to be based upon just grounds. These officers think that their claims have been ignored, and that, in the event of the decision of the Public Service Commissioner being adverse to them-, they have a right to ask Parliament to redress their grievances. Apparently they have been told by Ministers that they must go to the Arbitration Court. But that tribunal, the officers themselves urge, is not one in which they may expect to get their claims dealt with on an equitable basis, because its Judges may perhaps be apt to determine the standards of pay which they ought to receive by the standards which obtain in respect of similar work outside the Service. The conditions being different, the Public Service might, they think, not be sufficiently regarded. To show how much this Government have resorted to political patronage, let me point out that during the past two years no fewer than 144 appointments to positions carrying salaries exceeding .Â£300 a year, and aggregating about .Â£74,000 a year, have been made by them.",47
428,Mr WEST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The officers appointed were needed. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - My point is that the office of Public Service Commissioner was created to prevent the making of appointments by politicians, political patronage having been scandalously abused in the past. It was the Parliaments of the States that first set .the example of purifying our Public Service administration, and the Commonwealth followed their lead. But political patronage is gradually being restored under this Labour Administration. Although in the last two years this Government have appointed 144 persons to positions carrying salaries exceeding .Â£300 per annum, the Public Service Commissioner, in the same period, has made only thirty-six such appointments, at a total cost to the country of only ,Â£15,000, as against the Government's .Â£74,000 per annum. The figures relating to exempt hands, not including military and parliamentary officers, are these-1909 , 13,675 appointed; in 1910, 14,954. The temporary hands appointed in 1909 numbered 2,725, and those appointed in 1910, 3,308, there having been an increase from 16,400 to 18,262. In 1910 there were 12,187 permanent officers, and in 1911, 13,233. The total number of officers in the Commonwealth Service, temporary, exempt, and permanent, was, ih 1910, 28,587 ; and in 1911, 31,485. The appointment, employment, retention, and dismissal of the men, women, and girls who are exempt hands, or temporary employees is entirely under the control of Ministers. That is not a healthy state of affairs. But, apparently, remembering the large commitments ahead of us, and the number of appointments yet to be made, it will not be' long before Ministers personally control an increasingly larger number of public servants than come under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. This will be a very undesirable state of things. Honourable members do not suffer from it now; but when it becomes necessary to retrench, they will have men standing at their doors every morning, asking for their influence to get reinstated. When temporary hands have to be dispensed with, therewill be trouble for those immediately concerned, which we must all deeply deplore, and also for members themselves, if they allow political patronage to be largely exercised by Ministers, instead of leaving all questions of appointment to the Public Service Commissioner.",48
429,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"New England) [4.22] - I think that the rank and file of the Postal Department have a grievance. The fact that something like seventy officers, receiving salaries exceeding ,Â£4Â°Â° a year, have obtained an increment of about Â£ 4 0 >each per annum, and that the rank and ;file have been told to take their case to the Arbitration Court, creates a fair grievance. I ask the Government not to treat this matter too lightly. Had the Service been on a satisfactory footing when Ministers took office, we should not have heard so much of these troubles. It is patent to every one that the Postal Service has never had what it considers fair play, and it naturally expected, when a Labour Administration was returned to power, that its complaints would be looked into, and properly dealt with.",48
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Minister says that the men have received justice.,48
431,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am afraid that a tired feeling is overcoming the administration of the Postal Department. The highly-paid officials number only a few, and it is easy to deal with their cases; but the rank and file number some thousands, and are divided into many grades, so that to satisfactorily remedy all their grievances means a great deal of hard work. I hope that the suspicion that is this tired feeling is not correct; but echoes of discontent are heard in the and in direct correspondence from the rank and file day after day, we have reason approaching Ministers to ask more attention to these grievances. The Postal Department has been seething with discontent for many years. We have thank the honourable member for Lang for warning this Administration to keep from the political methods of the old parties.",48
432,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,We have never followed them.,49
433,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I am pleased to know that. The honourable member for Lang is afraid that Ministers may follow them. He says that they are drifting into the bad old ways which were followed before the Public Service Commissioner was appointed.,49
434,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I am afraid that the wish is father to the thought.,49
435,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I do not know that that is the position. The orary Minister does not like to vice from any quarter. He takes the position that advice should never be accepted from an enemy, and certainly not from a friend.",49
436,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member for New England does not take the interman the jection rightly.,49
437,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,He does not understand it.,49
438,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Perhaps I dissent from the ruling? do not wish to. If so, I am like the Honorary Minister when an interjection comes from the other side; he never cares understand such an interjection. When suggested that the Government should vide for the creation of a Public Works Committee to protect the public in connection with the big expenditure which must place in the future, he said, in his. melodious tones, "" A Works Committee ! """,49
439,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The creation of a men to be dismissed? Works Committee would provide good jobs for a few Members of Parliament.,49
440,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,It would save thousands pounds.,49
441,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is a new argument to say that, because a few bers of Parliament might get billets by tralia. being put into a position where they could save the country thousands of pounds, they are not to be appointed.",49
442,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No one has suggested there that except the honourable member. Had as he been sent to the Northern Territory, we press should not have had so much trouble.",49

444,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member for New England must wait until to he has been defeated at the elections. When he has become a defeated candidate, away he will have his choice of billets.",49
445,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am not open for engagement in the Northern Territory. I think that the honourable member for Parkes was unfair in his remarks concerning the appointment of the Director of Lands there. I do not agree with him that that was an instance of political patback ronage. This Government has kept clear of political patronage in all its big appointments ; and, in my opinion, might have kept closer to it. Had it followed the example of members on the opposite side' of the Chamber, it would have done so. If the honourable member for Parkes had told us how many Protectionists the Honold Free Trade Governments of New accept adSouth Wales had appointed",49
446,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND, The honourable member is not in order.,49
447,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Chairwas controlling the proceedings when honourable member for Parkes was speaking, and allowed him, perhaps, to infringe the strict rules of procedure.",49
448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Why not move to,49
449,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I do not wish to do that, but simply to say that it would to be interesting to know how many Free I Trade or Protectionist appointments were promade when the previous Government were in power'. No one expects a Government to appoint to administrative positions men take who have no sympathy with their policy.",49
450,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If a Government with different views comes in, have those",49
451,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No . That is a point on which this Government have of acted most honourably; they have never attempted to dismiss any one because of his political opinions, and I hope that such Mema system will never be adopted in Aus",49
452,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I do not think that a man's political opinion should be called in question when an appointment is made.,49
453,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"In administrative positions, it is of great importance that those appointed should be in favour of the Government's policy. If the honourable member desired to have a building designed in a certain way, he would not employ an architect with altogether different ideas.",50
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If another Government comes into power, have they, in reversing the policy, to also "" reverse "" the officers ?",50
455,Mr ANSTEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No ; the officers will reverse their opinions. - Mr FRANK FOSTER - If an officer over an important administrative Department cannot reverse his opinions when a new Government comes into power, he should go out himself; with a change of masters, a careful servant, although it may not meet his personal views, will serve his new masters, and change his mind accordingly.",50
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"In other words, a public servant may exercise his opinions now, but he must not exercise them if an-, other Government comes in?",50
457,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member desires to side-track me. We all admit that a man in sympathy with the policy of the Administration can do better work than a man directly opposed to it. As to political patronage, I may say that I got no encouragement from my Government when I offered to go to the Northern Territory, though, doubtless, had the honourable member for Bourke applied, he would have been appointed forthwith. If honourable members opposite think that I have a grievance against the Ministry for not asking me to apply for the position of Administrator, I desire to assure them that they are making a great error.",50
458,Mr ANSTEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member said that he did apply.,50
459,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I did not apply- I made no application whatever.,50
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What did the honourable member do?,50
461,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I merely made the suggestion.,50
462,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,In writing?,50
463,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I made the suggestion that if no other Labour man was prepared to take the position, I would do so myself.",50
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What reply did the honourable member get?,50
465,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member for New England must not discuss the Northern Territory any further.,50

469,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member is not in order in discussing the Northern Territory.,50
470,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Every previous speaker has been permitted to discuss the whole of the Estimates.,50
471,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member is quite out of order. We are discussing the Estimates for the Prime Minister's Department, and the honourable member would be quite in order in discussing the whole of those Estimates and matters under the control of the Prime Minister's Department, but not the Estimates or matters under the administration of other Departments.",50
472,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I have no desire to do more than discuss the Public Service, as other honourable members have been permitted to do. The appointment of Mr. Ryland was the subject of a long speech by the honourable member for Parkes.",50
473,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member is not in order in discussing specifically the Northern Territory at this stage, though he would be in order in discussing the Public Service generally.",50
474,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am a little surprised at the ruling, since you, yourself, Mr Johnson, before you went into the chair, specifically discussed a certain section of the Postal Department.",50
475,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What reply did the honourable member get from the Ministry to his suggestion?,50
476,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I got no reply.,50
477,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Surely the honourable member does not mean to say that they treated him with contempt?,50
478,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I do not think that there was any "" they "" about it - m y conference was with the Minister of External Affairs.",50
479,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,And he treated the honourable member with contempt! It is just like him!,51
480,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Perhaps the Minister "" roughed"" me up the wrong way, as he does other people. However, I have been told by the Temporary Chairman that I must not discuss this matter.",51
481,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I am not surprised that the Minister of External Affairs treated the honourable member with contempt.,51
482,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No ; I suppose the honourable member is not surprised. I protest against any Minister or Ministry showing favour to one section of the servants, all the members of which should be on the same level in regard to treatment. There should be no such thing as a Minister dealing directly with one section and telling another section that it must go to the Arbitration Court.",51
483,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Minister deals only directly with the occcupants of administrative offices-al l others are under the Public Service Commissioner.,51
484,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"There is a complaint that the Minister singles out that section of the Service which receives over Â£^400 a year, and gives it preferential treatment.",51
485,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That complaint is not well founded.,51
486,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I should like the Minister to make a full statement on the subject.,51
487,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"He has made a statement a dozen times. Ministers have no direct power, except over a few administrative officers.",51
488,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I have always held that one of the objects of the Labour Government should be to make the Public Service a model Service, so as to set an example for private employers. I cannot understand the policy which permits grievances and disruption within a Government Department. I do not mean that the Minister ought to give more than justice, or fritter away public money, but if we are to have the best work in the Postal or any other Department, we must have a contented body of men; and I urge the Minister to take all the steps in his power to overcome the present trouble. If the men can be dealt with without resorting to arbitration, why not meet them in a fair way, and extend all possible justice?",51
489,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That power is absolutely taken away by the Public Service Act.,51
490,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Surely the honourable member does not wish me to believe that the Minister, in conjunction with the Public Service Commissioner, has not power to restore harmony without resorting to arbitration?",51
491,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Minister has no power.,51
492,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then I understand that, although there may be seething discontent, the Minister can do nothingthat the men must go to the Arbitration Court ?",51
493,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Public Service Commissioner could tell the Minister to ""go to Hackney "" if he chose.",51
494,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Then I am surprised that there has not been an amendment of the Public Service Act.,51
495,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,It has been the position for years.,51
496,Mr FRANK FOSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is no reason why it should be continued. If the Minister has no real power to restore harmony, it is high time the Act was amended.",51
497,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"South Sydney) [4.43] The Governor of .the Bank has agreed to purchase a large block of property at the corner of Pitt-street; and I , for one, knowing the locality and the building, think that this is not a good investment for the Government, or a good position for the Bank. If the Government propose to resume land for the extension of the Post Office in Sydney, it would be more advantageous, in doing so, to provide room for the Bank there than to go across the street.",51
498,Mr DEAKIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,How far apart are the two blocks?,51
499,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The width of Pitt-street. The land I am suggesting as the better is adjacent to the Post Office, and is covered with a lot of old property that could be bought cheap, while all the business of the Commonwealth would, as it were, be kept under one roof. I understand that the land for the extension of the Post Office will cost something like ,Â£600,000. It is a mistaken policy on the part of this Government to divide up the Departments-to have one Commonwealth building on one side of the street, and another Commonwealth building on the opposite side, when all the Departments could be accommodated under the one roof on the Post Office side. If that block were resumed for postal services, I think the transaction would prove to be a very profitable one. If .Â£100,000 is required for the purchase of a site for a bank in Sydney, why should not that amount be added to a further sum for the purchase of a block on the General Post Office side of the street? I shall reserve to myself the right to refer to this question once more when the Treasurer, who is temporarily absent from the chamber, is present. I certainly protest against the expenditure of Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 in this way without the Parliament having a voice in the matter.",51
500,Mr THOM AS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Barrier-Minister of External Affairs) [4.46] - I propose to deal with the question of the treatment meted out to the lower-paid as against the higher-paid branches of the Public Service, to which a good deal of attention has been given during this debate. In the first place, I would point out that in the whole Service of the Commonwealth there are not more than twenty officers whose salaries the Government themselves have the right to increase. These are the administrative heads of Departments, ancl when we come to look at them we find that in only very few cases have any increases been granted by the present Administration. propose to refer to the increase made in the salary of the Crown Solicitor, since the office relates to the Department of the Attorney-General, who, I am sure, will be able to make out an extremely good case in support of the action that has been taken ; but, coming to my own Department, I would point out that there is only one officer-apar t from those in the Northern Territory-whos e salary could be increased by me. I refer to the Secretary of the Department, Mr Atlee Hunt, and a glance at the Estimates will show that no increase is proposed in his case. Then, again, the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Allen, has not been put down for any increase, whilst of the seven officers in the Department of the Postmaster-General whose salaries could be raised by the Minister, only three are to receive an addition. officers are: Mr Oxenham, Secretary to the Central Administration, whose salary is the same as last year; and the six Deputy Postmasters-General. Three of these, Mr Templeton, Mr Bright, and Mr. Young, are to receive an increase of Â£ 5 0 each, and those who know the work attaching to their office will not say that such an increase is too great. Then, again, Mr. Knibb3 is an officer whose salary could be raised by the Minister, but no increase is proposed. He is receiving today exactly what he received twelve months ago. [189]",52
501,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,He is doing more work today.,52
502,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That would justify an increase, but an increase has not been made. The point I wish to emphasize is that very few salaries have been increased by the Government themselves, and I am confident that every increase granted can be justified. All other increments have been made on the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner. I think I am right in saying that since we have been in office the Treasurer has granted every increment which the Public Service Commissioner has recommended, although it would be open to him at any time to refuse to find the necessary money.",52
503,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,It is open to this Committee to say whether or not it will sanction these Estimates.,52
504,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Committee could reject the Estimates as a whole if it pleased. The Public Service Commissioner has recommended this year increases I do not amounting to ,Â£100,000, of which Â£ 7 3 , 9 9 5 will go to the lower-paid men in the General Division.",52
505,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Sprea d over how many officers ?,52
506,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"This sum of Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 will be spread by way of increments over 9,105 officers, of whom 6,698 are in the General Division, and will receive Â£73,995. In the Clerical Division there are 2,369 persons, who will receive increments this year amounting to Â£ 2 6 , 0 0 0 , while there are forty-one officers in the Professional Division whose increments this year total .Â£371. Then, again, 9,000 officers have received no increment whatever this year. Many of them have reached the maximum of their grade, and cannot receive an increase unless they are The seven put into a higher grade, while some are receiving the minimum, and have not been in receipt of it long enough to entitle them under the law to an increment. I say frankly that I am opposed to automatic increases being granted, irrespective of whether men are doing their work or not. A system under which every man in the Service would receive an automatic increase every year or two would put those who worked well on the same footing as the men who do not. There should be automatic increases to those who have done their work to the satisfaction of their superior officers.",52
507,Mr ANSTEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That is the same old argument that was used against the union,53
508,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Not at all. union scale provides that every member a union shall receive the minimum-which in most cases, is the maximum-immedi - annum. ately he becomes fully qualified. A carpenter who has reached the age one years, and who is fully qualified under the union scale, receives the same pay as a man who is forty or fifty years of age. going Men in outside employment, however, can vice? be dismissed at a moment's notice, whereas paid ranks men in the Public Service cannot be so of treated. That is a point that must not be vince lost sight of. The rights of every public highly honourable servant are very carefully protected. For receivedpaid instance, the Deputy Postmaster-General hands of anything for Victoria, Mr Bright, is, I think, a very a mere handful of public officers able man, who, while anxious to secure effitheir ciency, is not a hard master, yet he could not dismiss a letter-carrier whom he found to be inefficient.",53
509,Mr ANSTEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That is the fault of this Parliament.,53
510,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If this Parliament were to pass a Bill providing that officers of the Service could be dismissed at a moment's notice by heads of Departments, the seething discontent that we hear spoken of now would be nothing compared with the situation that would arise.",53
511,Mr ANSTEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,But it is of no use comService plaining of the position when Parliament passed the law which prevents Departwhich mental heads from dismissing an incompetered tent man.,53
512,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I wish only to point vice under out that there are two sides to the question. entirely,53
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Does the honourable member suggest that these Estimates provice vide for .Â£100,000 by way of increases public servants under the control of Public Service Commissioner?",53
514,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is quite possible that ,Â£1,000 may be in respect of adminisrising trative increases; but I think I am right saying that ,Â£100,000 represents increments recommended by the Commissioner. When I pointed, out to the honourable member for Bendigo that increases amounting to ;Â£73>ooo had been made this year in spect of the salaries of the lower grades of the Service, he replied that most amount was designed merely to raise the looked. pay of men in the lower grades to the minimum wage for the Service. I find, however, that of the Â£T^,OOO paid by way of creases to the lower paid officers has been given to those who were under the minimum, that is, to raise them to Â£126mostly from Â£ 1 1 0 to Â£126. That leaves a The balance of Â£[27,000 to provide for autoof matic increases to those in the General , Division receiving more than ,Â£126 per",53
515,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Then I was fairly pf twentyright in what I said.,53
516,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Is not this money to the lower paid men of the Servoted Then, again, last year Â£53,491 was to raise the pay of men in the lower of the Service to the minimum .Â£126 a year. Thesefiguresshould conmembers that the very men of the Service have not this out of the way at the Government, and that only can have salaries increased by the Government itself. If it be the desire of honourable members that this Parliament should determine what increases shall be paid in the Service, well and good; but my voice and vote will always go against anything of the kind. I am in favour of. removing the public servants as far as possible from political control. I was one of those members in the New South Wales Parliament who supported the Government of which the honourable member for Parramatta was a member, which introduced a sound Public Act. I think that the enactment of that measure wasone of the best things for that Ministry was responsible. I enthis Parliament as a strong believer in the principle of placing our Public Sera Commissioner, who should be independent of political influence. My vote will certainly be cast upon all occasions against bringing our Public Serdirectly under parliamentary control. to A reversion to that principle would, in my the judgment, lead to very great disaster. Under the existing system, an officer in our Public Service has as fair a chance of as can humanly be assured to him. in Of course, the human equation must inevitably enter into all matters of this character. If an officer happens to be in close contact with the Commissioner, who is in a position to judge of his work, he may sonceivably reobtain promotion, whilst another officer equally capable, who is employed some of that hundreds of miles away, may be over",53
517,Mr ANSTEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The closer an officer gets into the Commissioner's ear the more his .Â£46,498 merits are disclosed.",53
518,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I take it that the honourable member would sometimes recommend a man for private employment.,54
519,Mr ANSTEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Upon his merits.,54
520,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Some honourable members have argued that the Government have acted unfairly by saying to the lower-paid officials, "" You must appeal to the Arbitration Court,"" whilst dealing with the claims of other officers directly. All that we have done with the consent of a majority of this Chamber is to afford public servants who are dissatisfied with the treatment meted out to them by the Public Service Commissioner an opportunity to appeal to the Arbitration Court.",54
521,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,To how many does that apply ?,54
522,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"To every officer who is under the Public Service Commissioner, and to the eight or ten officials who are under the control of the Government. If any of these are dissatisfied with the treatment which is meted out to them, they are at liberty to appeal to the Arbitration Court. Access to that tribunal is not limited to the officers of the General Division. If it were, the members of the .Clerical and Professional Divisions would be able to say to the Government, "" You have granted to the officers of the General Division something which you will not concede to us."" But, as a matter of fact, the officers in any division of our Public Service are at liberty to appeal to the Arbitration Court.",54
523,Mr ANSTEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The higher paid officers have no need to do that. They have merely to hold out their hands in order to get what they want.,54
524,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I know that there is a certain amount of complaint amongst officers of the Clerical Division at the present time. The younger officers in that division say that they are not being fairly treated, because their minimum salary is fixed at Â£110, whereas the minimum salary of the General Division is Â£126. But I would point out that the salaries of officers of Clerical Division increase by jumps of Â£ 2 0 until they reach a maximum of Â£180 or Â£200, as against a maximum of ^150 in the case of officers of the General Division. The younger officers of the Clerical Division are dissatisfied because the minimum salary of their division is Â£ 1 1 0 a year, whereas the minimum salary of the General Division is Â£ 1 26 a year. But I would point out that there is nothing to prevent [189]- 2 the officers of the Clerical Division from appealing to the Arbitration Court, and attempting to establish their claim to a minimum salary of ,Â£126 a year. If the Court decided in their favour, its award would override the decision of the Public Service Commissioner. As far as the permanent officers are concerned, it is worthy of note that, prior to the passing of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act last year, they were not at liberty to appeal to the Arbitration Court. It seems to me most unjust for honourable members to urge that the Government are forcing men to have recourse to that tribunal. Prior to the passing of the Act in question, our public servants could appeal only to this Parliament, which could do nothing unless it first annulled our Public Service Act.",54
525,Mr ANSTEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The complaint is that one. class of men have to appeal to the Arbitration Court, while another class can get all that they want without going to that Court.",54
526,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Suppos e that there had been no Arbitration Court at all. These men would still have-been labouring under the same grievance, because the Public Service Commissioner has classified them and graded their work. They could not have successfully appealed to this Parliament, because Parliament would be powerless until the Public Service Act had been amended. Instead of annulling that Act, Parliament has said to them, ""You have a right to appeal to the Arbitration Court."" If our administrative officers are dissatisfied with the way in which the Government treat them they can appeal to the same tribunal. We have made it easy for all grades of our Public Service to have recourse to the Arbitration Court. Under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, before any industrial association can appeal to the Arbitration Court, it must number 100 persons. But in the case of our public servants, three-fifths of those in any grade are sufficient to pave the way to an appeal to that tribunal. So that if there be only five administrative the officers in any grade of the Service, and three of them desire to appeal to the Court, they are at liberty to do so. It seems, therefore, that those who urge that we are forcing our public servants into the Arbitration Court are putting the position unfairly. I have no hesitation in saying that that Court is a much better tribunal to hear and determine appeals by our public servants than is this Parliament.",54
527,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Melbourne Ports) [5.10] - I agree with the Minister of External Affairs that the Arbitration Court is the best tribunal to assess the wages which should be paid to our public servants. I think that the time will come when Commonwealth public servants will thank the Labour party for having given them access to that Court. In this connection we.have to recollect that, if this Parliament chooses to increase the salaries of our public servants, another Parliament can reduce them; but when the Arbitration Court has decided what constitutes a fair wage to these officers no other tribunal can nullify its award. 1 know that a number of our public servants urge that the Labour party ought to consider the question of raising their salaries. But the Labour party has always said that it would place them on an equality with persons engaged in similar work outside the Public Service, and it has done that. I am only sorry that we have not gone further, and given everybody access to the Arbitration Court.",55
528,Mr ARCHIBALD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Government and all?,55
529,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I would not be afraid to submit the salaries paid to members of Parliament to the Arbitration Court, and I do not believe that tribunal would reduce them. I think that this Parliament should have made the Arbitration Court accessible to all our public servants, including the military, and especially to the artificers employed in our Defence Department.",55
530,Mr ARCHIBALD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member would not have a general appeal to the Arbitration Court?,55
531,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Yes . I am not one of those who wish to abuse the Department of the Public Service Commissioner, but I think that its researches should be extended, especially in the matter of increments and promotions. I think that something ought to be done to assure justice being meted out to those men whose claims - as the result of spleen on the part of the heads of their Departments-ar e overlooked.",55
532,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I cannot see how an Act of Parliament could come in there.,55
533,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I have in my mind's eye a case in which one of the sub-heads of a Department has been promoted. The possibility of that promotion was known to the head of the Department, and, with a view to installing one of his favorites in the vacant position, he has put a man who ought to secure the appointment in a subordinate position. In other words, he has placed one of his favorites temporarily in the vacant position, in order that he may be able to recommend his permanent appointment to the Public Service Commissioner. When the head of a Department makes a recommendation, it seems to me that the Public Service Commissioner ought to inquire into the whole question of whether or not the officer recommended has a right to secure the appointment.",55
534,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Is the officer to whom the honourable member refers the senior officer ?,55
535,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No , he is a junior officer.",55
536,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Before a senior officer can be supplanted by a junior, the Public Service Commissioner goes into the case.",55
537,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Public Service Commissioner has not done that as exhaustively as he might have done it. I know that it is not easy to deal with all these difficulties. The Public Service Commissioner would be more than human were he able to see through the peculiar methods adopted by some of the heads or sub-heads to get their favorites promoted over men who are seniors to them.,55
538,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Public Service Commissioner has had a great deal of experience. You could not teach him much in this matter.,55
539,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is possible; but once a position is filled, and the appointment gazetted, those who have been passed over have no chance of getting justice. Twice, to my knowledge, during the last six years the Public Service Commissioner has admitted that wrong has been done to certain men, and that it could not be remedied, because others had been given seniority to them. I know of a case now in which the head of a Department is determined to promote a junior over a senior possessing higher qualifications. That can be done, unless the Public Service Commissioner exhausts all the means at his disposal to prevent it. When a senior is likely to be passed over, the Public Service Commissioner should go into the matter fully. It is because he has not always done so that we have trouble in connection with the Fifth Class officers. They have published a leaflet asking for the further consideration of their position. They wish us to enact that they shall rise to Â£200 a year each by means of increments, automatically, and say that, because of circumstances over which they have no control, in other words, because of the spite of their superior officers, they can now be vented from reaching .Â£200 a year. This is possible, unless the Public Service Commissioner is prepared to go into all proposals for appointing juniors over the heads of seniors.",55
540,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,On e of the chief reasons for appointing Public Service Inspectors was to prevent injustice of the kind referred to.,56
541,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Appointment s are made before those who are passed over know that anything is to be done, and they, - therefore, have no chance to appeal.",56
542,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Does the honourable member say that no appointments should be made permanently until every senior officer who has been passed over has had an opportunity to appeal ?,56
543,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Every senior officer who has been passed over should be allowed to place his case before the Public Service - Commissioner.,56
544,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,How long would it take to make a permanent appointment under that system ?,56
545,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is the question that I am always asked. My reply is that, if it took a year, though there is no reason why it should, men should not be unfairly treated.",56
546,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Does the honourable member think there is much injustice vice promotions ?,56
547,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I think that there is a fair percentage of hard cases, and, if a certain promotion is made, I shall name in this Chamber the head of the Department responsible for it. At the present time. I know of four instances in which men know that they are to be passed over for the sake of favorites of the head of the Department. I do not take one man's word in these matters, because every one thinks that ihe is better than his fellow officer. But men working together know as much, and probably more, about the ability of their fellows than the Departmental head. When - seniors are passed over, soreness is created.",56
548,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Surely the junior should be appointed when more competent than 'his seniors.,56
549,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I admit that.,56
550,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,In many cases juniors are more competent than their seniors.,56
551,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I admit that that is - so sometimes. Many men make no attempt to qualify for better positions. At the same time, seniors are sometimes passed over by juniors who are no better than pre- they are. Where the junior is not greatly the superior, the senior who has given more years to the Public Service should be appointed. The Minister knows of cases in which men have had to relinquish positions to which they had been appointed. I would give men the opportunity to show their fitness for positions before appointing them permanently. No matter how long it might take to make permanent appointments, we should prevent petty spite from operating as it sometimes does in the matter of promotion.",56
552,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,We must do justice to the public as well as to the Service.,56
553,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Exactly , but if we have a contented Service we shall get better work. I admit that there are men in the Public Service who know more of the provisions of the Public Service Act than they know about their work, though, of course, the Act affects their lives and the prospects of their wives and families so directly that they are justified in studying it) The Public Service Commissioner should resort to some methods other than those at present adopted to inquire into all cases in which juniors are promoted over the heads of seniors.",56
554,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is the duty of the Public Service inspectors to inquire into all such cases. If they do not do so, they in the Ser- fail in their duty.",56
555,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I do not say that they fail in their duty. They may not be able to go into every matter as fully as it should be gone into.,56
556,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,In the majority of cases it is the senior who is promoted. It is only in a few instances that juniors are promoted over the heads of seniors.,56
557,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I know of as big a conspiracy as can be imagined, which is in existence at the present time, affecting two or three men. The way to prevent unfairness is to appoint temporarily, so that those who consider that they have been unjustly treated can make representations before it is too late to alter things. During the last Parliament I was asked by one set of officers to introduce a deputation to the Minister advocating that when the heads of Departments suggested promotions, arrangements should be made for considering the claims of others, and I was also asked by a second set of officers to introduce a deputation advocating that the suggestions of the heads ofÂ» Departments be carried into effect. The officers of the latter set considered that they were in the good graces of their official heads, but the others did not. Heads of Departments are human, and have their Hikes' land 'dislikes, and petty spleen is shown in every walk of life. A man sometimes dislikes another because he coughs unpleasantly, or blows his nose noisily, or is not good looking. I should be satisfied with the right of appeal to the Public .Service Commissioner when seniors have been passed over.",56
558,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Royal Commission which investigated the administration of the Post Office recommended that positions should be filled permanently as soon as possible, and the Hobart Conference of the Deputy Postmasters-General, over which I presided, endorsed that recommendation. It is considered a bad thing that in the past officers have "" acted "" too long.",57
559,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"My suggestion is that when a position becomes vacant the man most likely to be able to fill it should be appointed temporarily, and that those passed over should be given an opportunity to appeal.",57
560,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,When I was Postmaster General I appointed a Deputy Postmaster General over the heads of at least fifty of his seniors. Would the honourable member haye given every one of those fifty the right to appeal.,57
561,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Eac h one of them should have had ah opportunity to place his case before some authority.,57
562,Mr WEST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,There were 200 passed over.,57
563,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What the honourable member for Melbourne Ports suggests would have meant delaying the permanent appointment for eighteen months or two years.,57
564,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"What I suggest could have been done in a month. Those passed over could state in writing to the Public Service Commissioner their objections to the appointment. ' It is hardly possible that if 200 men were passed over they all. would appeal; but supposing there were twenty who wished to do so, there ought to be some method by which their case should be considered. The present position gives rise to discontent; and I hope that the Public Service Commissioner, if he has the power, will give further consideration to appointments before they are aiude permanent.  sire to call attention to an item which appears on the Estimates for the first time, namely, that of the travelling expenses of Ministers. I am justified in introducing, this question, seeing that, although no item appeared in the Estimates of last year r Â£258 was expended; and if , under this head, the money is to be expended as it was last year, a large number of honourable members will distinctly object. This expenditure has not only not been with the consent of the House, but in direct opposi-i tion to positive pledges and assurances given by the Prime Minister. When the question was raised on the last day but one of last session, the Prime Minister told us that the allowances would be drawn only, when Ministers were on public business^ The question was asked how the House would know if the money was not drawn when Ministers were on party political business, and the Prime Minister replied, "" I said on purely public business; if we aretravelling on party political business, then,, of course, the expenses will not be drdwn."""" That was the condition on which the Houseallowed the expenditure to pass. In spiteof the assurance given, however, the Prime Minister himself went on distinctly party business to Queensland, where he took part, in the State elections, and drew his travelling allowance of Â£ 2 per day. Another Minister, Senator MCGregor, took part irÂ» the same elections, and also drew his fee,. although he was day after day speaking, on behalf of the Labour party. A third Minister took part in the Tasmanian State election, and for two days drew travelling allowances. Up to the present no Minister has admitted doing wrong, though the wrong is obvious. The other day, when* I asked the Prime Minister a serious question in this connection, he gave an answer which was no credit to himself, because it showed that only in a way did he deny thestatements made. The Prime Ministersaid, "" I drew no expenses in Tasmania at all."" I never charged the Minister with drawing expenses in Tasmania.  member's question referred, to both Tas* mania and Queensland.  whether the Ministers I have mentioned in tended to refund to the Treasury theamounts drawn by them as travelling; allowances during the time they were canvassing in connection with Queensland and .Tasmanian elections; and it will be seen* tthat I referred, not only to the Prime Minister, but to the other Ministers. The Prime Minister, in reply, went on to say iihat he had no intention to refund the exipenses drawn for Queensland. - sanction this item on the present Estimates, the Prime Minister ought to renew his assurance that the expenses will not be drawn while Ministers are fighting party political battles.",57
565,Mr ARCHIBALD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Ha d the Prime Minister no official business in Queensland at the time ?  party political battle. As honourable members seem disposed to question the accuracy of my statements, I may say that on the -19th December last, when this question - was brought up, the honourable member for Bendigo asked what assurance we had that ""Ministers, when drawing these expenses, imight not engage in party business; and the Prime Minister then gave the reply I diave already quoted, namely, that the - expenses would be drawn only when Ministers were on purely official businessthat if they went on party business they would, of course, draw no allowance. A Minister who, in spite of a declaration of that sort, takes part in a State election, or even as a partisan in a Federal election, and at the same time draws exjpenses, does violence to the truth-h e defames his fair name, and takes money out of the Treasury to enrich himself in a way that he is not justified ih doing. I .challenge the Prime Minister challenge a man who is not in the chamber.  ought to be in the chamber when his Estimates are under consideration; but if he will return I am prepared to repeat every word I have said. It is not a pleasant thing to take men to task in this way, and prove them up to the hilt guilty of /having done an unworthy thing- a thing mot to be measured by the amount of anoney concerned, which is only a second-ary consideration, but by the principle at - stake. I say again, as I said before, that .a man who will get into another's pocket 'in a small way, will, if he gets the opportunity, do so in a large way. There is :a fourth Minister concerned in this matter, ; in the person of the Minister of External 'Affairs, and I am glad that he, at any rate, is present. When the Prime Minister announced that these expenses would be paid, he said that they were to cover and reimburse actual expenses out of pocket. A trip was organized to the Northern Territory, during which the exI f we penses of every one who took part were paid from start to finish.",58
566,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is not so. '  paid, and food and lodging were ^provided throughout. But in spite of that fact, the Minister of External Affairs, who headed the party, drew 253. for every day the excursion lasted.",58
567,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If it was an ""excursion,"" why did the honourable member nor come and see the country?  ""excursion"" or not is a matter of indifference-it was a trip in connection with which the Minister of External Affairs drew his expenses in two ways. I charge the Minister to his face, with having taken travelling expenses in two ways while he was on that trip. If similar charges were levelled against any other Ministry in the land they would be hurled from office next day. Up to the present there has not been a single denial on the part of Ministers, nor yet a single admission. The only reply given by the Prime Minister is one that can be most aptly described by one American word, "" slim ""-onl y in a half-hearted way did the Prime Minister give a denial. Before we pass this item we should receive an assurance fromi the Ministry that they will not draw travelling allowances when they go out tq fight as party politicians in the electorates.",58
568,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Corangamite) [5.45] The speech just made ,58
569,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"B y the honourable member for Echuca is characteristic, and one that the House is used 'to hearing from him. He says that there is no denial to his statement. The denial has been made on more 1 than one occasion by the Prime Minister, who has said in this House that he has not drawn travelling expenses when engaged in electioneering or party work. The fact that the right honourable gentleman was travelling on public business in Queensland during the progress of a general election there, should not debar him from receiving travelling expenses at the rate determined upon by the Government. The honourable member for Echuca made another statement which is not true when he asserted that no member of any other Government had drawn any travelling allowance. We have only to turn to the return placed before the House by the Prime Minister himself to find that previous Ministers, including the Leader of the Opposition and other members of that party, for years, under certain circumstances, drew travelling allowances. The'fact that their allowances in any one year did not reach as much as has been drawn by members of this Government merely proves that the present Administration has done more travelling than has any of its predecessors. The amount drawn by the present Ministry in respect of travelling allowances for the whole year is, however, only Â£258. I marvel that the honourable member for Echuca is not ashamed to indulge in the mean kind of criticism which he has uttered this afternoon.  hind it.",58
570,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is neither more nor less than a raking-up of dirt for party political purposes. The honourable member usually sits cheek-by-jowl with a member of the Opposition who draws his ,Â£600 a year as a member of this Parliament, although he has not been seen inside the Chamber this session. Does he think of denouncing the honourable member for Grampians, who fails to attend in his place in the House, but draws his salary while in the Old Country on private business? We do not desire to raise such a question, but it is necessary to do some things in self-defence. The position of this Government is different from that occupied by any of their predecessors, inasmuch as they are doing what previous Administrations merely talked of doing. For instance, this Government took over the Northern Territory, the transfer of which had been talked about by other Ministries since the inception of Federation. The taking over of that Territory carries with it certain responsibilities, and the Minister of External Affairs has traversed a goodly portion of the country. The honourable member for Echuca would have him do that travelling at his own expense. He said that all the expenses of the Minister and the members who recently visited the Territory were paid by the Commonwealth. That is not correct. The honourable member is so successful at burrowing and scavenging work that he should make sure that he has all the facts before he speaks. As a matter of fact, however, he cannot take a broad, national view of anything. 'He is talking, as a matter of fact, to a few. narrow-minded, prejudiced people in the electorate of Echuca. He has a prejudiced outlook, and finds it impossible to look at matters in a broad way. ",59
571,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member is never anything but abusive when he speaks in this House. He does not know the value of logic or argument. He has never been noted for his logic, and he has never fought a political battle on political grounds.  four political battles.",59
572,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member only represents a minority. He does not represent the majority of the people in his own constituency, and he certainly does not represent the opinions of the people of Australia on any question.",59
573,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The oracle has spoken !,59
574,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"On e does not need to be an oracle to know that what I say is correct. One has only to look at and to hear the honourable member for Echuca to know that what I say of him is true. Another undertaking which was talked of for many years by the present Opposition, but not taken in hand until the present Government came into power, was the construction of the transcontinental railway. The builds ing of that line must necessitate a good deal of travelling on the part of the Minister. Then, again, for the first time in the history of Australia, we have laid the fourvdation of a definite defence scheme on something like effective lines. We have practically revolutionized the defence system of this country, with the result that the Minister of that great Department has found it necessary to traverse almost the whole of the Commonwealth. And yet the total expenditure of Ministers in respect of travelling allowances is ,Â£258 for the year. One would imagine, listening to the honourable member for Echuca, that it amounted to ,Â£200 a day. We have heard the honourable member, on four or five different occasions in this House, referring to this matter, asking questions, and prying almost into the private affairs of Ministers.",59
575,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,.Â£25 8 is not alL It is Â£[258 plus three motor cars.,59
576,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Whateve r motor cars have been purchased are used on public business. Every up-to-date. Department and business concern has motor cars at its disposal today. State Governments, business firms, manufacturers, and retailers are employing motor cars in order that their business may be more expeditiously carried out. The honourable member's bit of corner gossip, therefore, does not carry any weight. Then, again, the travellers employed by all large firms receive a travelling allowance. A Select Committee appointed by the State Parliament to inquire into the operations of an insurance company, which is by no means the largest in Australia, was informed by the general manager that his travelling allowance was Â£ 3 3s. per day plus first-class - tickets by boat and rail for his wife and himself throughout the Commonwealth.",59

578,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Company.  allowance in respect of conditions under which he said he would not draw it.,60
579,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I again say that the honourable member has misstated the facts. The Prime Minister gave us his word in this House that he would not draw expenses when travelling on private or partybusiness, and he has not done so. The - mere fact that a Minister, while travelling on public business, uses his leisure time to do certain things, does not mean that he draws his travelling) allowance while engaged in private or party business. The records and the statement made by the Prime Minister show that when he drew his travelling allowance, he was on public business, and I think it is mean and paltry for the honourable member for Echuca to raise such a question as this.",60

The honourable memhonorable member for Fawkner. ber for Corangamite, in the course of his wild harangue said that the honourable ""ber for Echuca was raking up dirt.",60
584,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That is about what it amounted to.,60
585,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"How cou^d he rake up dirt if there was none to rake up? The honourable member for Echuca pointed to the dirt. He pointed to the fact that Ministers had been drawing, in a way they promised not to do, funds from the public Treasury in respect of travelling expenses when they were engaged on party political business.",60
586,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,He did not do anything of the sort.,60
587,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"He proved his case. The return presented to the House shows conclusively what the facts are. In Hansard, of 8th August last, honourable members will find a return showing that the Prime Minister drew travelling allowances while in Queensland from t h to 29th April. That 9 was during the progress of the Queensland elections, when the right honourable member was speaking every night against the Denham Administration.",60
588,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Thes e are scathing remarks.,60
589,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Nothin g will strike the honourable member with shame. The only time that he showed any sign of even perfunctory modesty was when he asked the electors to be kind enough to forget the attitude he had adopted in this Chamber on one occasion.,60

The Chairman courteously pointed out that if I persisted in the amendment the whole of the debate would be restricted to that oneitem. Acting upon his suggestion, I refrained from moving the amendment, whereupon the honourable member for Eawkner moved "" That the item be reduced by Â£1.""",60

598,Mr ANSTEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member outlined his amendment, and then ran away from it.",61
599,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I intend to support the amendment of the honourable member for Fawkner, because it will afford the Committee an opportunity of deciding, free from all personal considerations, whether automatic increments should be granted to the higher-paid officers of our Commonwealth Service. The Minister of External Affairs has pointed out that certain officers have been recommended for increments by the Public Service Commissioner, whilst other officers have beerti recommended by Ministers. To me it is quite immaterial whether an increment is proposed by the Public Service Commissioner or by a Minister. This Parliament is the authority which has to decide whether or not an increment ought to be granted. I do not think that the present is a time when increases should be given to highly-paid officials. There are other officers in our lic Service who are very much more in need of increments than they are. When I sat behind a Government in this House I took up exactly the same position on this question as I am taking up now. I say that, before we grant increments to highly paid officers, those persons who are in charge of semi-official post-offices throughupon noticeout the Commonwealth ought to receive a more adequate remuneration for their services. Let us take a test vote upon this question.",61
600,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Irrespective of the abilities of officers?,61
601,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It will be wise for us to take a test vote on the broad question of whether or not these automatic increases ought to be granted. I draw no distinction between increments which are recommended by Ministers and increments which are recommended by the Public Service Commissioner. It must be acknowledged that those officers whose duties bring: them under the immediate notice of the Commissioner or the Ministerial head of their Department, are more fortunate than those who are not so closely connected with the heads of the Departments. I intend to vote for the amendment on the understanding that it will be regarded as a test vote on this question.",61

I should not have been able to support the latter, because I could not have voted in favour of reducing the salary of any particular officer. Moreover, I do* not disapprove of the granting of increments to the higher-paid officers of our Public Service. But I regard the amendment of the honourable member for Fawkner as a protest against the granting of increments to highly-paid officials, whilst the claims of officers in the lower and middle ranks of the Commonwealth Service are ignored. I feel that I can conscientiously vote for this proposal.",61

604,Mr RYRIE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Yes . I never cast a vote which is not conscientious. But the Minister's conscience is, at times, very elastic The present Government have really excelled themselves in the matter of making highly-paid appointments. I find from a return, which was supplied by the Prime Minister at my request, that last year the Pub- sum of Â£78,000 was paid to officials who were receiving more than ,Â£300 a year.",61

639,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Was it in order for the Minister to make an attack on me under cover of a point of order? Mr THOMAS' - In view of the statement that the honourable gentleman had only spoken once on the general question, I withdraw what I said. I understood that he had spoken twice.",63
640,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Minister of External Affairs says that he upholds the Public Service Commissioner, and that his voice and vote will always be given against any interference with that officer. Mr THOMAS,-Agains t any interference with the Public Service Act.",63
641,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"And , therefore, against any interference with the Public Service Commissioner in giving effect to the Act. But while the honourable gentleman talks in that way, he takes care that every appointment that he can make shall be made without reference to the Public Service Commissioner. The complaint of the Public Service is that the Government is making a new departure in the matter of appointments.",63
642,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member must confine his remarks to the question before the Chair.,63
643,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Canno t the amendment be withdrawn, so that we may discuss the general question? I wish to refer generally to the appointments which have been made by the Government.",63

645,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I desire to withdraw my amendment.,63
646,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I object.,63
647,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Minister, by this objection, is only prolonging the discussion of the Estimates; and it means that we shall have to do piecemeal what we desired to finish now. The honourable gentleman has refused a courtesy that has never been denied to any honourable member before; and it is left to him, after making a series of statements, fo object to any reply. It is the usual fair play one gets from the honourable member, and is what we have learned to expect.",63
648,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member is as truthful as usual 1,63
649,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member, as I say, has made a series of statements, in which he has practically misled the Committee, and now he preventsany reply by the objection he has raisedI hope I am as capable of telling the truth, as is the Minister.",63
650,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND," Will the honourable memberconfine himself, to the question before the Chair?",63
651,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"As mattersstand, I shall have to vote without stating, my reasons in full. The position is that, while a section of the public employees areunder the Public Service Commissioner,, and are told they must appeal to the Arbitration Court, another large section is dealfr with directly by the Government, and givenincreases and conditions denied to theothers. That is an anomaly which wilt have to be recognised in the near future, because it constitutes a grave administrativescandal. Two men, who may be doingr precisely similar work, may, one of them, be directly under the control of the Minister, and the other denied what is considered to be fair and equitable treatment y and this is causing a good deal of discontent. The Minister of External Affairssaid this afternoon that he controlled only one appointment in his Department, but heshould have told us that that was an appointment on the Central AdministrativeStaff, which consists of forty-four persons. The honourable gentleman did not tell us _ that he controls 150 other people, whose conditions are absolutely determined without reference to the Commissioner.",63
652,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I said that the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner had' nothing to do with the Northern Territory.,63
653,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Then the honourable gentleman made a misstatemenf when he said there was only one officer whose conditions he controlled.,63
654,Mr WISE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Minister said, "" excepting in the Northern Territory.""",63
655,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I will accept the statement of the honourable member for"" Gippsland, who is always willing to rush to the aid of the Ministry-it is a way hehas of showing his "" independence.""",63
656,Mr WISE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,To the honourable member's disadvantage very often.,64
657,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member is so "" independent "" that he is always seeking the advantage of one side, the Government, and the disadvantage of the other, the Opposition. I like those "" independents,"" who are all on one side. The honourable member for Gippsland votes, and works, and talks for the Government, and if he cannot vote for the Government, he gets out, and then calls himself a Literal Independent.",64
658,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Will the honourable member confine himself to the item before the Chair?,64
659,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,All this arises from the Temporary Chairman not stopping unruly interjections.' I understand that this vote has to do with the Administrative Branch of the Prime Minister's Department.,64
660,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The question before the Chair is a reduction of the subdivision by Â£1.,64
661,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If I cannot discuss anything but that, I cannot say what I desire to say.",64
662,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Wentworth) [8.10] - A question that needs ventilation is that of the method of dealing with public servants, which does not seem to me altogether fair. The Public Service Commissioner has his case prepared with the assistance of Government officials in Government time, and he, very properly, is able to place his views before the Court without expense or any peculiar personal difficulties.",64
663,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What has that to do with the question before us?,64
664,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is proposed to reduce the subdivision by Â£ 1 , but it seems diffi1 cult to advocate fair play even for public servants in this Chamber now that honourable members opposite are trying to conduct the business with the aid of technicalities under the Standing Orders. If an organization of employee's in the Government Service wishes to bring certain matters before the Arbitration Court, and has to send to Melbourne, say, in order to do so, the employees individually, or the organization, has to pay the expense, and the time occupied is not counted as Government time.",64
665,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member is not in order in addressing himself to that question.,64
666,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I wish to point out that the inequality, such as it is, might be held to justify the Minister keeping one man, at any rate, out of the clutches of this vicious principle-h e might urge that one man should be free rather than that all should be sacrificed.",64
667,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The debate must be confined to the proposal to reduce the subdivision. Mr JS.ELLY - We are opposing this vote because we desire to ventilate a principle; and I claim the right to make my vote clear to those I represent.,64
668,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I rise to order. I understand the ruling to be that we may not discuss the relation of certain civil servants to the Arbitration Court. 1 point out, howevei, that tliere are several employees under this heading, including messengers, typists, assistants and others; and surely the question of whether there should be an increase, together with the decision of the Government to send those clerks and others to the Arbitration Court, as a condition precedent to obtaining an advance, is the subject of proper consideration under this subdivision?",64
669,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"My ruling was not given as the honourable member has stated. I ruled that, the motion that the item be reduced by Â£ 1 having been submitted, the debate must be restricted to that motion; and that the Public Service Commissioner and his actions, or the action of an officer affected, is not now before the Chair, but will come up later.",64
670,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The salary of the Secretary of this Department has been raised from Â£520 to Â£600 a year; and I offer no objection to that, because I think he is a good officer, deserving of the advance. That, however, is not the point, which is that the advance has not been made by the Public Service Commissioner, but by the Prime Minister himself, of his own volition. The Public Service of Australia is supposed to be, and is, so far as the lower-paid officials are concerned-so far as all those whose salaries mean a great deal to them are concerned-unde r thei' Commissioner. But here we have a salary, raised without any reference to him at all,",64
671,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What has that to do with the question before us?,64
672,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is proposed to reduce the subdivision by jQi, and that proposal covers every item, the first of which is that of the Secretary to the Department. We are, I contend, entitled, under this proposal, to consider the reasons for the increase given. It is due to the fact that the Prime Minister properly recognises that this officer is worth more than ,Â£520 a year; but what is the position if any honourable member desires to give some recognition to the services of the clerks who may be considered worth more than they receive? Here we have certain men drawing Â£ 6 0 a year, but an honourable member who thinks that jÂ£6o is too little for them to receive cannot move to increase their salaries. The matter has to be decided by the Public Service Commissioner. Apparently, not one honourable member opposite thinks that these men are worth more than Â£ 6 0 a year.",64
673,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Evidently , the Opposition think that they are getting too much since they are supporting an amendment to reduce the amount in respect of salaries.",65
674,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then we are to understand that if the amendment be carried, the amount of Â£ 1 is to be struck off the salary, not of the highest paid man, but of the poorest paid man in the Department. Is - that the intention of the Government?  hope of reducing any man's salary by Â£1.",65
675,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"And under the Standing Orders we cannot move to increase any salary. That being so, why should the Honorary Minister, who is the peculiar, but not altogether faithful, guardian of the truth in this Chamber, try to make out that we wish to reduce any man's salary.",65
676,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I ask that the honourable member be called upon to withdraw that insult.,65
677,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I withdraw it at once.,65
678,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Fawkner) [8.17] An attempt is being made by honourable members opposite to show that the object of the amendment moved by me is to reduce the salaries of officers in this division.,65
679,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,This is a deliberate attempt to reduce salaries.,65
680,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member knows very well that it is not.,65
681,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The statement made by the Honorary Minister has been denied, and it is offensive, I ask that it be withdrawn.",65
682,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Since the honourable member takes exception to the statement, I ask the Honorary Minall ister to withdraw it .",65
683,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am prepared to obey your ruling, sir, and to withdraw any reis mark which, by any stretch of the imaginaQueensland, tion, might be considered to but there is before the Chair an amendment to reduce by Â£ 1 a subdivision dealing only with salaries, and, in the circumthe same authority. stances, it seemed to me that I was distinctly in order in saying that the effect of this amendment would be to reduce salaries. If , however, my remark is considered to be offensive, I will withdraw it .",65
684,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I wish to make it absolutely clear that my amendment was moved not with the idea of reducing salaries, but to allow a general discussion to take place with regard to the regulation of salaries and the travelling allowances of Ministers.",65
685,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Would the honourable member like to withdraw his amendment?,65
686,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I should, but the Minister on a previous occasion refused to allow me to do so.",65
687,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Prime Minister is now in charge of the Estimate.,65
688,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If the honourable member wishes to withdraw his amendment, I shall not raise any objection.",65
689,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",65
690,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Franklin) [8.21]. - I move That the item, "" Secretary, jÂ£6oo,"" be reduced by Â£1. I submit this amendment in order to test the feeling of the Committee on the subject to which I have already drawn attention.",65
691,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Parramatta) [8.22] - I shall vote for this amendment, not with the object of reducing these salaries, but to emphasize the anomaly which is creeping into the public employments of the Commonwealth, that, whereas some sections of our employees are subject to strict regulations imposed by the Public Service Commissioner, a huge part is being taken under the direct control of the Minister, and differential treatment is being meted out. Something will have to be done to remove these anomalies.",65
692,Mr ARCHIBALD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Was not the same practice in existence whilst the honourable as member's Government were in office?,65
693,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"--To a certain extent it has always existed, but it is now being accentuated and increased beyond reason. Is there any reason why publicemployment in the Northern Territory should not be under the same authority as our public employment alongside in North or in the northern part of be offensive, Western Australia?",65
694,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Custom s and Postal officers in the Northern Territory are under,65
695,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That only makes the anomaly the greater.,66
696,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I would remind the honourable member that the amendment before the Chair is simply to reduce the salary of the Secretary by Â£1.,66
697,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"And I am stating the reasons why I shall vote for that amendment. I shall vote for it, not because I think there should be any reduction in the salaries of these officers-the positions are worth the salaries allotted to them-bu t to protest against the practice of treating men in public employment differentially. It has been suggested that the men under the direct control of the Government are, in some cases, treated better than are those under the Commissioner. The same remark applies to men in the Defence Department and employees in the clothing, saddle, and cloth factories. All these are under the control of the Government, while other employments are under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. The sooner these anomalies are rectified the better for the public servants as a whole. It is this differentiation that is causing discontent throughout the length and breadth of the Service. While some men under the control of the Corrunissioner are subjected to strict regulations, others are not so regulated, but are dealt with directly by the Government",66
698,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The men in these factories are not permanently, employed.",66
699,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Thei r positions are permanent enough.,66
700,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member is going beyond the scope of the amendment.,66
701,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I believe that I am; and I shall, therefore, have to content myself by indicating, as I have done, the reasons why I intend to vote for this amendment.",66
702,Sir JOHN FORREST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Swan) [8.27] Various works are being carried on by the Government of which this House knows nothing, and in connection with which there are being employed many officers whose appointment and salaries have not been submitted to us. If , by voting for this amendment, I could emphasize my disapproval of that action on the part of the Government, I should certainly support it ; but, in my opinion, the subdivision immediately under consideration does not do this. When we come to an item that does have a bearing upon it I shall emphasize my objection as strongly as I can. It is becoming a great scandal-and I am sorry to say this because such a statement may hurt the Prime Minister's feelings",66
703,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The right honourable member is not in order in making use of such an expression.,66
704,Sir JOHN FORREST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"At the proper time, I shall certainly protest against the action to which I have referred, but I think that the Government have done right in creating a Prime Minister's Department, and appointing an officer to take charge of it . They are now submitting to the Committee the establishment of the office and the salary for approval or rejection, and I think that is die proper course to pursue. It is for the Committee to say whether they approve of the establishment of this new Department, and, if so, whether they think that the salary allotted to the office of Secretary is adequate. I am in accord with the establishment of a Prime Minister's Department, having had sufficient experience to know that it is both necessary and useful. The salary of the Secretary is not too high for an efficient officer. Holding these views, I cannot properly vote for the amendment; but, at the same time, I think that something radically wrong is going on. Honourable members will see that we are losing - control of the money which is to be spent. I protest most strongly against what is being done, and if I could emphasize my objection to it in any way I should be glad to do so. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are being expended without any Parliamentary authority.",66
705,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member is not in order in referring to that matter.,66
706,Sir JOHN FORREST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I regret that this is not an item upon which I can express the views which I hold in regard to that matter.,66
707,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Hunter) [8.31] The different views expressed by members of the Opposition upon this matter are really amusing. In the first place the honourable member for Franklin submitted an amendment to reduce the item of "" Secretary, Â£ 6 0 0 , "" by Â£ 1 , in order to mark his disapproval of the high salaries which are being paid in this Department. Subsequently his proposal was withdrawn, and the honourable member for Fawkner moved to reduce the full amount of the proposed vote by Â£ 1 . Then it was found that that would prevent a general discussion, and accordingly that amendment was withdrawn, and the present amendment was substituted for it . Prior to the adjournment for dinner, the mover of the amendment stated definitely",66

709,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am very sorry, because it would have afforded me a good opportunity of pointing out the inconsistency of the arguments of honourable members opposite. They declare that they desire to reduce the salary of the Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department by Â£ 1 , in cider to mark their disapproval of the action of the Government in increasing salaries without consulting the Public Service Commissioner.",67
710,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That is not position.,67
711,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am well aware of that, but the Chairman will not permit me to point out what is the honourable ber's position.

713,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am inclined to think that I do not need to show the orable member how he can attain the object which he desires. But later on I shall very sorry if I miss the opportunity point it out to him. At the am quite sure that he will miss"" no opportunity that presents itself to achieve the purpose which he has in view. The tion which we have to consider is whether this particular officer is worth the salary which it is proposed to vote him on these. Estimates. If he is, we ought not duce it. If he is not, we ought to reduce it so as to give him a salary which will be commensurate with the services which he renders. According to the right honoravailed able member for Swan he is the head of finite principle. an important Department.",67

715,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Ye t we are asked to reduce his salary by Â£ i . I think that the honourable member for Franklin would be acting wisely-seein g that he does not believe in individualizing-by withdrawing the amendment.,67
716,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I find that the next head of a Department receives 50 per cent, more than does this officer.",67
717,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Then there is no justification for attacking him.,67
718,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Wentworth) [8.36] - It is very well known to every honourable member that a proposal to reduce the first item of - any departmental Estimate does not per se constitute an attack on the head of that Department. That course is frequently adopted because it affords us the only opportunity we have under parliamentary practice of ventilating a principle. my But I am inclined to think that the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin might well be withdrawn, because it is idle to endeavour to test any memquestion unless all are agreed as to the subject which is to be tested. It is evident that in its present temper this Comhim mittee will refuse to agree upon what principle is to be tested under this prois. posal. In the circumstances, we are merely wasting time.

727,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"As we may refuse permission to withdraw the amendment, we ought to have a guarantee that if we permit its withdrawal a fourth amendment will not be submitted. I endeavoured to follow, as well as I was able, the tortuous reasoning of the honourable member for Parramatta, who asserted blandly that he agreed with the increase which it is proposed to grant to the official head of the Prime Minister's Department. he believed that that officer was a good officer, that he had no objection to the salary proposed to be granted him, but, nevertheless, he would vote for its reduction. In such circumstances, where are honourable members opposite upon this question ? What do they really intend ?",68

729,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Heave n may be able to penetrate the innermost recesses of the honourable member's mentality, but certainly he does not disclose what is to be found there when, after saying that he approves of the salary which it is proposed to grant to this officer, he declares that he will vote to reduce it.",68
730,Mr RILEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,He will not vote for its reduction.,68
731,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If the honourable member for Franklin presses the amendment to a division, I do not know what will be the outcome. It is scarcely fair of honourable members on this side of the chamber to affirm that the honourable member for Parramatta will not vote for it . I acknowledge that he is able to change his views with lightning rapidity, but to say that within five minutes he will change from "" n o "" to "" y e s , "" or from "" y e s "" to "" no "" is rather hard on him.",68

733,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Honorary Minister must confine his remarks to the question before the Chair.,68
734,Mr ROBERTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I am attempting to do so. Am I not in order?,68
735,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Honorary Minister was not in order a few moments ago. You, sir, Mr ROBERTS - A m I in order now? This alliance between the honourable member for Bourke and the honourable member for Parramatta is truly charming. I am very sorry that the idea should go forth from this Committee that some honourable members desire to reduce salaries. If they wish to ventilate any principle which is involved, they will have a hundred and one opportunities of doing so when other departments of the Estimates are tinder consideration. But to move a reduction of the salary of an officer whose work is admittedly good, and whose emoluments, even when increased by the amount proposed, will represent only two-thirds of the salary which is being pa'id to the heads of other Departments, is an exceptional course He said to adopt, and one which is not justified by the circumstances. I join my efforts to those of the honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Wentworth, with whom for once I am in agreement, to persuade the honourable member for Franklin to withdraw the amendment, not because it will embarrass those on this side, whose minds are made up, and who will take united action, but those with whom he is associated. The honourable member for Parramatta has a fatal facility for getting into awkward positions, and the amendment, if pressed, m i l place him in a peculiarly awkward position. If the honourable member votes for the amendment, he will be seen to be voting for the reduction of the salary of a worthy officer.",68

737,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Parramatta) [8.48] - After the interlude furnished by the corner-man of the Ministry, I wish to say that I made no such statements as those which he persistently attributed to me amid his buffoonery. I am convinced that the matter which I wish to have discussed cannot be raised in any other way than by means of an amendment of this kind. The Prime Minister stands for the whole Government. Public Service Commissioner's office is a branch of his Department, and he represents not only that section of the Public Service which is under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, but also those Government employees who are not under that control. There will be no other opportunity during the discussion of these Estimates to raise the question which I wish to have debated.",69

754,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I withdrew the amendment at the suggestion of the Chairman. I do not wish honourable members to vote upon this amendment under a wrong impression. My intention in moving it is to' test the feeling of the Committee regarding the granting of these automatic increases to highly-salaried officials, when those on the lower rungs of the ladder are being absolutely neglected. An attempt has been made to draw a redherring across the trail, but that is the question I ask the Committee to decide. There is not a member who does not know that I have taken the usual course for obtaining a test vote by moving this formal reduction. It is not competent for any private member to move to increase an amount, or to test the subject by any other ineans.  planations of the members of the Opposition in regard to the amendment for the reduction of the salary of the Secretary to the Prime Minister are edifying and amusing.

759,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Wentworth) [9.10] - I found, when seeking to answer a speech in the general debate on the Estimates, that I was out of order in endeavouring to make some remarks that I wish to make now in reference to Ministers' travelling allowances. I do not wish to discuss it in any heated or personal way. My desire is to place before honourable members some irregularities which I think have occurred in this connection, and some looseness of procedure well worthy the attention of Ministers themselves. In the early days of this Federal Parliament, when the question of members' salaries and the constitutional salaries of Ministers was under consideration, it was stated, I think, by the then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton-and , of course, the precedent then established applied to all the successors of the Ministry-that the Ministers of the day would take the Â£ 4 0 0 , which was then the parliamentary salary, in addition to their official salaries, and use it in lieu of the travelling allowances which obtained in all the States of Australia. This .Â£400 to each of them was to be lumped for the Ministers, as I say, in lieu of the definite daily travelling allowances usually given to Ministers in the States. The practice then established obtained right down to the last session of this Parliament. In the closing hours of that session, the Prime Minister announced to the House that it was proposed by Ministers to take, when travelling on official business, allowances on a scale which it is not necessary to detail now. The actual statement of the right honourable gentleman will be found reported in Hansard of the 19th December last, page 4871, and I take the clearest extract I can find to show his intention. It is as follows:I wish to intimate to both Houses that the Government think it .would be fair for the Prime Minister, while on official visits only, to be allowed 40s. per day, and other Ministers holding portfolios to be allowed 25s. per day when on similar visits. I remind honourable members that these allowances were to be additional to the Â£ 4 0 0 a year which Ministers were getting as members, and which' had been accepted by all previous Ministers in lieu of travelling allowances, and that the money was to be drawn only while on official business. Now, the honourable member for Echuca has brought, up this matter on several occasions, and, as a result of his ventilating the question, a return was laid before honourable members. In dealing with personal questions like this, it is always unadvisable to harp on them in an invidious way, but honourable members, I am sure, will forgive me if I point out one or two details which, I think, show how irregularities of a somewhat objectionable nature have crept in . .The return is reported in Hansard of 8th August last, page 1917 ; and we learn fromi t that the Prime Minister drew the travelling allowances whilst he was in Queensland at the time of the Queensland elections, with the exception of a period during which he was in his own electorate.  Minister not doing public business?",71
760,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Prime Minister states that he was then doing public business, and I shall quote his own words as the fairest way of putting the position. He said I also interviewed Ministers in Queensland.",71
761,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Le t the honourable member have enough rope, and he will soon hang himself.",71
762,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"What an un-Christian spirit to display ! I am approaching' this matter in the kindliest spirit possible, sparing in every way the feelings of honourable members opposite, and the honourable member hopes I shall hang myself. This is what the Prime Minister had to' say with regard to his visit to Queensland, which we are told was on official business onlyI also interviewed Ministers in Queensland"" going and coming on the question of wirelesstelegraphyHe interviewed State Ministers concerning wireless telegraphy! and I saw general managers of banks in BrisbaneHow pleased the Caucus outside would' bein relation to the appointment of a Governor of the Commonwealth Bank.",71
763,Mr BAMFORD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Does not the honourable member think this very paltry?,71
764,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No ; I believe the Prime Minister intended it to be serious. I should have thought, however, that in establishing a bank to enter into competition with other banks the Government would have taken care to choose a Governor for that institution without consideringthe convenience of its competitors. ThePrime Minister went on to sayAs to Queensland, the manifesto of the Government of that State was launched against the Commonwealth Government. The State Ministers were travelling around denouncing Commonwealth in every possible way; and is it to be saidThis is the gist of the Prime Minister's defence-that he was on official business in Queenslandthat no' Federal Minister was to go there and say a word on behalf of the National GovernI ment, because of a fear that it might be said he was going in his personal capacity. Was it to be said that a Minister was not to go there and say a word on behalf of the National Parliament? That was the Prime Minister's reason for drawing travelling allowances while he was in Queensland upholding, not the National Parliament or the Government of Australia in the abstract, but the popularity of his own Ministry in that State ! That was purely cal business ! Honourable members opposite could not describe as purely official business the discussion of their own propaganda, or the putting forth of their own defence on any public question; yet, while in Queensland, the Prime Minister was everywhere discussing the Denham Administration, and giving reasons why it should be displaced by his own friends.",71
765,Mr BRENNAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That was the most important work of all.,72
766,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Exactly . That was what he was there to do, and yet we are now told that he was entitled to draw from the Commonwealth Treasury 40s. a day for travelling expenses whilst he was doing this "" official"" work in Queensland. This, I think, is an irregularity, and honourable members when they consider it will realise that it ought not to be repeated. The question of travelling allowances, now that it has been voiced both in regard to this and future Ministries, should be placed on a definite basis. We ought to know exactly what we are doing. Tf travelling expenses are to be granted merely to encourage Ministers to travel, it will mean that the Ministers will be paying themselves so much a day to travel away from their jobs. It will be jolly well worthwhile, so far as Ministers are concerned; but I do not think it would be a good thing for the country if the one man that stands as a link between the Parliament and any Public Departments is away from the only place-the Seat of Governmentwhere he can control the policy of his Department. I do not wish to go through the whole list, although there are other irregularities - For instance, there is the the case of a Minister who travelled in Tasmania on electoral business advocating the claims of his own party.",72
767,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That is absolutely untrue.,72
768,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Order !,72
769,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member, am sure, does not mean to be offensive; he means to say that the statement is inaccurate. I have seen reports of speeches made by the Postmaster-General while in Tasmania, and there is no man in Hobart - whic h is in the honourable member's constituency-wh o does not know that the Postmaster-General was engaged in making; party speeches there.",72
770,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Did the honourable member's leader draw anything for expoliti- penses while Prime Minister""?",72
771,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I think he drew expenses while in England, but refunded alarge proportion.",72
772,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Did he not make a refund quite recently?,72
773,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"A refund, I think, of Â£ 1 16s.",72
774,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Of which, however, he was not aware.",72
775,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Quite so. Evidently, my honourable friends want the gloves to beoff. If they desire me to go into detailsa course which I personally deprecateby all means let us go into them. When, we look at this list we find that everything went merrily-that travelling allowances were being drawn merrily-until the middle of May last, when in the electorate of Werriwa this question of Ministers' travelling expenses when on unofficial business was first put forcibly before the electors. Ministers have since ceased drawingthem.",72
776,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I sent in an account the other day.,72
777,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"This return was published in Hansard on 8th August last, and it does not credit the Minister of ExternalAffairs with having drawn anything since 24th May. I find that the honourable gentleman drew Â£ 5 0 for expenses while in the Northern Territory, from the 8th Apriltill 18th May. I suggest, without any ill-feeling, that the Minister, in going to the Northern Territory, had not to make any financial sacrifice. His railway and steam-boat fares were paid; his salary went on all the time, both as a Minister and as a private member, and yet, on this trip, during which everything was found for the party, it was thought to be worthf the while of the Commonwealth to pay - this Minister Â£ 5 0 to get him out of bourne for a few weeks.",72
778,Mr BRENNAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That was the case in regard to the trip to Port Augusta, in which the honourable member for Echuca took part, but it was not so in regard to the to the Northern Territory.",73

An honourable memto ber says that this is a very paltry matter; but, while the amounts drawn are not large, the principle involved is an imling portant one.

781,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"He thinks that the amount was in connection with some taxicabs, - and that he ought to have been charged with it at the time, and was not, so that the fault was not his.  for Wentworth has said that, although the amount is small in these cases, the prinment ciple is important.",73
782,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What does the honourable member say of lawyers who draw fat fees while practising in the Courts instead of atwe stand. tending to their duties in Parliament?,73
783,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The fattest fees are drawn by men like Comrade Sutch.,73
784,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,If the honourable member is going to start his dirty work he will some in return.,73
785,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I am not afraid of anyto thing in return for what I say.,73
786,Mr WEST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member is Melonly trying to rake up dirt. He is not speaking in the interests of the country.,73
787,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"And this is the return for being moderate in placing one's views before the Committee ! I put simply the trip bare facts, and I am not going to be deterred by bluff or anything of the sort. It is the bare fact that these allowances were be taken only when travelling on official business. I should not care what Government was in power- I say that no travelallowance should be paid to a Minister who is going round the country on his own party business. I regret having to bring this matter forward. I did not know that the honourable member for Echuca intended the to bring it up this afternoon, but when he the did he was made the subject of a savage attack, and I thought it necessary, in reply, to put the matter clearly before the Comduring mittee and the country.  thought it necessary to make a leniently savage attack in return.",73
788,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I appeal to any honourable member of the Opposition to say whether I have made a savage attack on any one. I put the bare facts, and it is my fault that they areinconvenient to honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Corangamite said that the honourable member for Echuca was raking up dirt. Was it his fault that the material was of that character? It is our duty to Was draw the light of criticism on all the actions of Ministers in their official",73

Now that I ' have ventilated this matter, I sincerely trust that the Governwill see that some definite arrangement is made with regard to the travelling allowances of Ministers, so that this House and the country may know exactly where",73
791,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Denison) [9.30]., - I intend to support this item, because I believe that in travelling round the country Ministers have done excellent work. The get honourable member for Wentworth has just referred to the Postmaster-General's visit the Denison electorate, which I have the honour to represent. What did he do there? He came over at my personal request. I saw how invaluable it would be to Denison in particular, and to Tasmania in general, if we could secure a visit from him. He came there, and for what purpose? To open the wireless telegraph station- a station which has proved itself invaluable, not only, to the city of Hobart and the people of Tasmania, but to the whole of Australia. Since its opening we have been able to. pick up vessels four days prior to their arrival in Hobart-ves sels from Africa, which hitherto have been unable to communicate with Australia during the three weeks of their voyage from that country. The result has been that the fruit-growers of Tasmania, and the people generally, know almost to within a few minutes the time at which these vessels will reach port. The Minister came to Tasmania and opened the wireless telegraph station, which has proved of immense benefit to the community. I had also the honour of introducing to him a deputation from the .Chamber of Commerce, and that deputation obtained more from him than it obtained from any of his predecessors.",73
792,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"What did it get? Mr 'LAIRD SMITH - It obtained provements in the mail service and in the Hobart Post-office, and the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr W.

An estimate of in the amount needed could easily be made, based on the present scale, or, if necessary, acon a higher scale. For an honourable member, as was done earlier in the day, to sugand gest that Ministers of the Crown are not enmen of honour is to lower the dignity of the House.",75
818,Mr BRENNAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That is practically what,75
819,Mr ARCHIBALD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No other inference could be drawn from the words used. It was suggested that Ministers had engaged in electioneering in Queensland and in Taswas mania, and had drawn travelling expenses he for visiting those States for that purpose; of but we have been told by Ministers themselves that it is not so, and I accept the - statement. If honourable members opposite decline to do the same, it is their affair. I imagine that a Minister has always some business awaiting attention in one of the capitals, and it would be quite possible for him to be engaged all the morning and part of the afternoon in a conference with a State Minister, or in an inquiry into departmental business, and still have time at night for electioneering. In such a case the Minister would be allowed his travelling expenses, not because he was electioneering, but because he was travelling on official business, which he would have to do whether he were electioneering or not. I do not know that what I have spoken of has actually occurred, but it is what would occur in my own case, and I attribute to others conduct similar to my own. I decline to brand Ministers as not being men of honour. They have told us that the expenses that they have charged have been fairly and squarely earned by travelling on public business, and I believe them. The late John Bright said that there was a residuum everywhere, even in the House of Lords, where there were men bankrupt in pocket and in honour. There will always be a residuum even in the Commonwealth Parliament-me n ready to make party capital of anything, using a matter like this under discussion for mean and contemptible purposes. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Is the honourable member in order in reflecting upon members of the Committee, and attributing to them the lowest possible motives?",75
820,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,He is not in order in attributing improper motives.,76
821,Mr ARCHIBALD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I have not attributed motives; I have merely applied to the Commonwealth Parliament what John Bright said of the House of Lords. There is the possibility that there will always be at least one member ready to scrape up matters of this kind, to use them for party purposes. Discussions of this kind lower the ""dignity of Parliament, and it is our business to prevent them. A FrenchmanI think, Rabelais-said , "" Defend me from the man who peeps out of a hole."" Ministers, and all of us, need protection from such a man. Undoubtedly, the impression of the public was that put by the honourable member for Wentworth, that the Â£400 given to Ministers as a parliamentary allowance was to cover travelling expenses. As a new member, I do not know what \the arrangement made by the earlier Parliaments was. If Ministers are to have travelling allowances, an amount should be provided for each of them-Â£40 , ,Â£50, Â£ 6 0 , or whatever is required. I refuse to believe that Ministers would take from the Treasury money they had not earned by travelling on official business. If this item is brought forward in the next Parliament, I shall oppose it. I do not object to Ministers getting travelling allowances, but I object to opportunity being given for the sort of thing we have seen today. The man who drags these matters forward, does not do so for patriotic motives, or, if he does, it shows what his standard of patriotism is. I do not want a repetition of this debate, and Ministers should see that the opportunity for it does not recur.",76

824,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Eve r since the Government took office we have heard about nothing else than the dignity and proper behaviour of Ministers and their supporters ; but methinks they protest too much. I agree with the honourable member that it is time that the question of travelling expenses was settled on a proper basis, though I repudiate the suggestion of the honourable member for Denison that Ministers will not travel unless paid to do so.",76
825,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I did not say that.,76
826,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member said that they would not have been travelling in Tasmania as they did had not their expenses been paid.,76
827,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I said that other Ministers did not travel, and that Ministers whose expenses are paid have no excuse for not doing so.",76
828,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Othe r Ministers did travel, although their expenses were not paid for them. I travelled all over Australia with Lord Kitchener for a period of about six weeks, although I received no allowance.",76
829,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member for Ballarat was in Tasmania more than once, and so was the right honourable member for Swan.",77
830,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am beginning to think lately that we were a set of fools - in the last Government. We had the old fashioned notion that we ought to protect the people's pockets in every way, and when we had to cross the city on Governanent business we paid for the cabs that we used. We were fools to do so, and the people did not thank us for doing it.",77
831,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,There are three Government motors now.,77
832,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"This Governanent have bought motors, and I hope that we shall have the privilege of using them - some day. The Minister of External Affairs nearly ran over me with his one - day.",77
833,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I have not a motor car. I wish I had.,77
834,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Minister - was riding in a motor car. I do not say that it was his own, but it was a Ministerial car.",77
835,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,There is not a car be'longing to my Department.,77
836,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"We were - foolish enough to pay forour own travelling, and the people did not thank us for : it. I make no complaint about the change that has been introduced by the present Ministers. One thing that they have done - well is to uphold the dignity of Labour. Whatever else they may have left undone, they have upheld their dignity in a way - that other Ministers have not. It has been the same all through the piece. They have - believed in treating themselves liberally, .and in doing things properly.",77
837,Mr BRENNAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Sparta n simplicity is the motto over here.,77
838,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then our motto must have been absolute, ineffable meanness. _ No matter how we gloss it over, there is a great difference in these respects between this Government and any preceding - Government. The matter of 36s. credited to the Leader of the Opposition has been - commented on several times to-night; but - my belief is that no one was more surprised than that honourable gentleman himself to - find this sum opposite his name, and he no - sooner discovered it than he discharged the obligation at once. This money was evidently for a taxi-cab, or something of that sort; and had the Leader of the Opposition been aware of the debt, it would have been paid before.",77
839,Mr TUDOR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Accordin g to the honourable member, taxi-cabs .may have been used by members of the late Government and paid for out of public funds. How does that argument apply?",77
840,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The idea is that the Secretary of the Leader of the Opposition had charged this cab, or whatever it was, to public funds when he ought not to have done so. My opinion is that the Leader of the Opposition should not have paid the money back; but he did so, and we all know how very punctilious he is in all such matters. Whenever he has gone to London on behalf of the Commonwealth, I believe it has cost just about half as much as, for instance, any trip of the present Prime Minister. However, other men, other ways, other tastes, and other ideas as to what the dignity of the position requires. It would be better, from all points of view, if a certain definite sum were allocated to Ministers to disburse amongst themselves as they pleased.",77
841,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Is not the present system the same as that adopted in the States when the honourable member was a Minister ?,77
842,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,It was not the same as this.,77
843,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"At that time, State Ministers, when on official business in New South Wales, drew two guineas, and the Premier three guineas.",77
844,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I do not know what the Premier drew, but Ministers received two guineas a day.",77
845,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,We get only 25s.,77
846,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"My opinion is that the amount is too small; but, on the other hand, we have to recollect that it was well understood, in the early days of Federation, and definitely decided on the floor of the House, that such expenses would not be paid; and, on the faith of that, Ministers, in addition to their statutory salaries, were given the ,Â£400 a year paid to private members.",77
847,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Surely there is some difference in the work of Ministers now.,77
848,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I do not think that the difference in the work affects the principle one iota. There having been an undertaking of the sort made on the floor of the House, there should have been a vote of the House before any change was made.",77
849,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,There has since been another. undertaking on the floor of the 'House to pay travelling allowances.,78
850,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,We cannot call that a decision.,78
851,Mr CHARLTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,It was a decision of the House. ',78
852,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Muc h has been said about the good Ministers have done by travelling about Australia, but that is not the point of the honourable member for Echuca; the point is that these allowances have been paid to Ministers for doing work connected with their own party advantage. Ministers have paid themselves these moneys in circumstances under which they told the House definitely they would not take them.",78
853,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Does the honourable member believe that Ministers have done so ?,78
854,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I do believe it - I am unable to' escape the belief.,78
855,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member doubts their word?,78
856,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Will the honourable member tell me what Departmental engagements the Vice-President of the Executive Council was fulfilling when he was addressing meetings every day on behalf of the Labour party throughout Queensland ?,78
857,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Will the honourable member say that the Vice-President of the Executive Council did not then perform any Executive or Cabinet duties ?,78
858,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I should say not. I should think not. Will the honourable member show me what the Vice-President of the Executive Council could have done up there? It is no use quibbling in this way. I do not wish to probe this matter ; it is the honourable member who insists on doing so. Every day the Vice-President of the Executive Council was away, from the time he left until he came back, he drew the allowance. The Prime Minister did exempt five or seven days that he was in his electorate; but no reductions made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I cannot bring myself to believe that, for twenty-three days, that honourable gentleman was discharging purely departmental functions.",78
859,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I dare say the honourable member would do the same if he were a Minister.,78
860,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"As I say, whai ought to be done is to vote a sum, and allow Ministers to spend it how they please.",78
861,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Does the honourable member mean a lump sum to each Minister, whether he travels or not?",78
862,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I think the Government are doing the right thing to place this sum on the Estimates now. I hope the amount is enough; but there ought to be no more of this investigation of what Ministers are doing when they are engaged it* 1 the various States. All this discussion arises out of the definite'undertaking given by the Prim'e Minister on the floor of the House. It is no use trying to impugn the honour of the honourable member for Echuca; he is impugning the honour of the Prime Minister, who gave the House an undertaking that neither he nor Ministerswould draw expenses when engaged on political party duty.",78
863,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member thinks that the Prime Minister has been dishonourable in the matter ? There is no other deduction.,78
864,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I desire to say that I think that Ministers did step over the line a little. If the honourable member will insist on putting the matter in this offensive way, I cannot help it .",78
865,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It is not a matter of "" cannot helping ""-the honourable member will get something back directly I",78
866,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I do not care what I get back. The honourable member can make himself easy on that score.,78
867,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I know the honourable member is an old enough politician to have a hide like a rliinoceros.,78
868,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am here to say what I think. The course that Ministers are now taking is a proper one, which will obviate criticism of this sortIt is of no use for honourable members todeny what has been said about the matter. The facts are clear that this money was taken while Ministers were addressing political gatherings, in various parts of Australia, quite contrary to the undertaking of the Prime Minister that Ministers were should not draw expenses while so engaged.",78
869,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,They were doing public duty as well; I have no doubt of that.,78
870,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The honourable member would have no doubt about anything that these Ministers did.,78
871,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I would as soon trust them as I would trust any one.,78
872,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable member would sooner trust them than me, I have no doubt.",79
873,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If a man gave me his word, I generally would take it.",79
874,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"It does not matter what the honourable member does in the way of making comparisons, odious, inof employees. sulting, or otherwise. I hope that we shall hear no more of this sort of thing, and that we shall vote a sum to Ministers, leaving it deputations of employees. to their honour and conscience as to and under what circumstances it is spent. The only important point that has been made in this debate is that the Prime MinAustralia, ister gave an undertaking that was not acted upon in connection with certain political proceedings in the northern Australia. I am not concerned with the suggestion that other Ministers have travelled. They have. The honourable member for Denison knows nothing about what other Ministers have done, or he has employed. would not have libelled them in that way. Could there be a more offensive or unnecessary statement than to say that other isters would not receive deputations of of Parliament? Commonwealth employees?",79
875,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Nobody said such a not - have been. thing.,79
876,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The honourable were. member did ; and he also said that if Commonwealth employees had approached a prefinitely vious Minister introduced by a politician, they would have "" got the boot."" That, I think, was the expression which he ployed. The honourable member maligns other Ministers when he makes a statement of that sort. Previous Ministers were just as honourable, just as conscientious, and just ceive as sympathetic to Commonwealth employees as these Ministers are, and they did their best for the public servants under greater difficulties and more stringent conditions than those in which present Ministers have had to do their duty.",79
877,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That is a matter of opinion.,79
878,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Of course it is; and I am giving the Committee my ported opinion. There have been previous Postister masters-General who have been quite as conscientious, able, and sympathetic to ployes as Ministers in the present Governto ment could possibly be. I venture to say that other honourable members who have been here longer than the honourable memotherwise ber for Denison will bear out what I say.",79
879,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I happen to have been one of the workers.,79
880,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"What has the honourable member to say about the matter, then ?",79
881,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I could not call my soul my own.  Ministers have refused to see deputations,79
882,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No other Minister that I ever knew refused to receive I received how plenty of them. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro received deputations continually, was constantly travelling about and was always open to see those who wanted to have interviews with him. The Postmaster-General who succeeded part of him, Mr Mauger, did the same. They inaugurated the system which obtains now, not of employees going to the Minister. The honourable member for Denison libels these men when he uses such expressions .as he",79
883,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Was one of those Mindeputations ever introduced by a member,79
884,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I should think so. There was no reason why they should,79
885,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I do not think they,79
886,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I cannot deanswer the question but I have no doubt that some of the deputations were introduced by members of Parliament. emWhether they were or were not, however, does not make any difference. The point is that Ministers were always open to reto deputations whenever employees liked avail themselves in a reasonable way of their opportunities. No more is done now, and no more could be done, in my opinion. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 12 {Executive Council), Â£166, agreed to. Division 13 (Audit Office), ,Â£22,551. Mr. JOSEPH COOK ""(Parramatta) [10.17] - The Auditor-General has retwice in two years to the Prime Minanimadverting upon the way in which the Treasurer's accounts have been preemsented to him, and complaining that, owing the lateness of the time when these accounts were presented, his audit has been incomplete and less interesting than it would have been. Moreover, the Auditor-General has pointed out that he has been unable to report to this Parliament at all, but has had to report direct to the Prime Minister, with a view of having his - report published in the Commonwealth - Gazette.",79
887,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is to say, Parliament had risen before the Auditor-General's report was issued.",80
888,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Parliamen t had risen months before the accounts were presented to him. In one case, the accounts were not presented to the Auditor-General until March, and in the next year not until April, that is nine months in the one case and ten months in the succeeding year after the close of the financial year. Consequently, his audit was less valuable than it should have been.",80
889,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Auditor-General did not suggest that there was anything the matter with the accounts.,80
890,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"No , but his audit is of very little value unless his port can come before this Parliament for discussion, if need be, while we are in sion. I do not know what the relations between the Treasurer and the Auditor-General are. The right honourable member stoutly denied the other night that the Auditor-General had made any comment at all until we produced the report and showed him that adverse comments had been made. Surely his attention ought to have been called to an important circumstance of that kind? It makes me wonder whether the Auditor-General's office ought to be under the Prime Minister, if this kind of thing can go on. It is a very serious matter.",80
891,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,What would there be for an Opposition to do if I anticipated everything ?,80
892,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"There would not be anything for an Opposition to do if everything was right; but this is too serious a matter to be laughed off. If the Treasurer of the Commonwealth does not see the Auditor-General's reports, of what value are they? He is the very man who ought to see them. They are reports which concern his Department. If he is not to see them, we may very well question their value, and ask why we should keep this huge office going. If it is so useless and formal a thing, why pay all these huge salaries, and place the Auditor-General in an independent position to report. He has pointed out that, owing to the conduct of the Treasury- I do not say the Treasurer - h e cannot get the accounts in time to make them useful for the purposes of effective audit.",80
893,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That is not the way to put his statement. What he says is that his report is of less value than it would otherwise be.,80
894,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The annual balance-sheet of a banking institution or company is always accompanied by the certificate of the auditors that the accounts have been audited and found to be in proper order. No such audit takes place in connection with the Federal accounts until a time when it is of very little use. The point is that the new year's accounts are on us before we get the accounts for the old year audited. If there is some inherent intricacy in the Federal accounts we should be made aware of it. The Treasurer should make some reply to the Auditor-General's adverse criticism, because it is about as severe as an officer in re- his position could possibly make it.",80
895,Mr MATHEWS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,In 1909 we were asked sesto pass accounts that had been paid twelve months previously.,80
896,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I have only to say that the Auditor-General points out that his eight previous reports were always presented in good time. It is only since this Government came into office-sinc e the new order of things, when everything is proper, well ordered, and dignified-that the Auditor-General finds that his audit is being rendered of very little value because he cannot get the accounts in time to audit them. He properly mentions the matter, because it is certainly a very serious situation when we cannot, from time to time, get a quick and effective audit of the national accounts.",80
897,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.24] - The honourable member was good enough to raise this question some time ago. It is a fact that the Auditor-General stated that, owing to the lateness of the arrival of the accounts for 1909-10, his report was delayed until Parliament had been prorogued. The Treasury can only point out, in reply, that the Auditor-General did not mean anything more than that the accounts were found to be accurately kept in every respect, but that his report was of less value than it would otherwise have been, since it could not be brought before honourable members whilst Parliament was in session. The Treasury is not by any means over-staffed, but I have given orders that every effort shall be made to bring the accounts before the Auditor-General at the earliest time possible. It is not, and never was, suggested that anything more than delay, and a consequent lessened utility as far as the Auditor-General's report is concerned, has arisen.",80
898,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The audit, as an audit, is quite effective?",81
899,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Yes . The accounts, as balanced before the Estimates were brought down, were attested by the Auditor-General as true and correct, but his report was delayed. It is only reasonable that we should try to expedite the presentation of the accounts to the Auditor-General to enable him to present his report as early as possible, and that is .being done. Honourable members will realise that up to 1909 very little was being done by the Commonwealth. We really launched into our national existence in 1910-11. It is, therefore, more difficult than it was to get the mass of complicated accounts promptly before the Auditor-General, but the work is being done as expeditiously as possible by the Department at the present time. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 14 (Public Service Commissioner), Â£15,688.",81
900,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Wentworth) [10.27] - I take it that on this division we shall be able to discuss the Public Service Commissioner's Department generally, and I regret that we should have reached it so late in the evening. That, of course, is not the 'fault of the Treasurer; but perhaps he will be prepared to report progress.",81
901,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I desire to finish the Estimates of this Department to-night.,81
902,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Whether we view it from the point of view of the Department or of the officers, the whole structure of the present system is the reverse of efficient. From the departmental point of view, we find, first of all, that in every Department there are a vast number of officers, and that the head of the Department is not in a position of complete authority over the men under his authority. not wish to discuss the matter at length, but I should like it to receive more serious consideration than we can hope to give it after a twelve hours' sitting. It is a matter of enormous importance to every public Department that, so far as you can with justice to the employees arrive at it, each departmental head should be responsible for the officers under him, and for their cipline and regulation. I am not sure, now that we have the arbitration system, not altogether in full working order, but, at all events; in its initial stages, in operation in connection with the Public Service, that the Public Service Commissioner's Department is altogether necessary. The Public Service Commissioner's Department was primarily intended to give fair wages and conditions to the employees in all Departments; but we have now, in addition, partially made available to the Public Service the Arbitration Court system. For the Public Service Commissioner in the first place lays down certain definite scales and conditions, and if pubT lie servants regard these as unsatisfactory they can appeal to the Court. I am beginning to wonder why they should not go to the Court in the first place, and why the head of each Department snould not be responsible for all the men under his own control. You wipe out just one of the interlocutory processes that we have In the structure of Federal administration inter-departmentally. This is a matter well worthy the consideration of the Minister. There is not a Minister who has ever served in a great Department that does not realise to a certain extent the futility of the present system. He cannot do what he pleases with the men who are under him. If a man is running a big business, does not he wish to have his hand on the control of that business? Under the existing system, we have a Public Service Commissioner.' Under the old system, he was intended to take the place of the Arbitration Court. With what success he did so may be gathered from the dissatisfaction which exists in our Public Service. Now an appeal from his decision has been provided. Why not take our courage in our hands, and allow the Arbitration Court to determine the wages and conditions of employment which shall obtain in our Public Service, whilst permitting each departmental Head to be responsible for the control of the officers under him? It seems to me that that I do would be a much simpler method of procedure. This is a principle sufficiently important to warrant it being tested in a full Committee. I do not like to suggest that we have been sitting a long time _",81
903,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I do not think there is anything in this Department which is challengeable.,81
904,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am suggesting that we dis- might simplify the whole structure of Federal administration, and at the same time give our public servants a better deal than they get under the existing system. At the present time, the Public Service Commissioner is a sort of Czar, and if our public servants wish to appeal from his decision they must do so with their own money, and in their own time. They must appeal from the decision of a Czar, who has all the resources of the .Government behind him. This seems to me about as big an administrative problem as any with which we have yet been asked to deal. There are one or two matters connected withit which are worthy of attention. We constantly find that things are happening which, in our immature reasonableness, we cannot appreciate. For instance, why on earth should marriage in the Public Service of the Commonwealth be penalized ? If a female employ^, after serving the statutory term which entitles her to furlough, retires to get married, she is deprived of her furlough, and can obtain only married leave. I brought an instance of this kind under the' attention of the Public Service Commissioner, and afterwards of the Postmaster-General. In that case a lady had given the Postal Department exemplary service for twenty years. In our Public Service Act this Parliament has laid down the principle that every public servant, at the end of twenty years of good service, shall be entitled to six months' leave df absence on full pay.",81
905,Mr WEST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,For the purpose of recuperating his or her health-no t of opening a business.,82
906,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If a man in the Commonwealth Public Service goes on furlough after twenty years, and then retires, he is paid for the six months during which he is on furlough. But when a woman, at the end of twenty years' service, wants to marry, she is docked of the right to furlough, given three months' marriage leave, and then sent out of the Service. heard a lot of talk on the public platform About the action of certain nnancial institutions in discouraging marriage, and I hope that we shall hear more of it, if there is justification for the statements that have been made, because such action is antisocial, and against the public interest; but this Parliament should be the last to throw Stones at private institutions, in view of way in which it treats its women employees. There ought to be absolute equality of treatment as regards the sexes. When a woman has served twenty years, she should be allowed six months' furlough, just as a man Js. It is absurd to suggest that the furlough is given to enable the officer to return to the treadmill when his faded or damaged energies have been restored.",82
907,Mr FINLAYSON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,A man is not allowed to do private work while on furlough.,82
908,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If a man marries when on furlough, he is not docked of his leave. Why, then, should a woman be decked of her leave when she marries? As every humane employer does, we give leave on full pay for sickness, and a yearly holiday on a scale more generous than obtains in most services, to enable our officers to keep in the pink of physical condition, recognising that we must treat them well to getgood service from them . But the Czar 1 has decided, apparently, that, although Parliament gave a moral right to furlough, no legal right has been given, and that men and women are not to be treated alike in this matter.",82
909,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,No distinction is made between them.,82
910,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I have given a concrete instance. The fact that the honourable member fails to follow me shows the reasonableness of my suggestion that we should adjourn.,82
911,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,When did the case occur ?,82
912,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Fro m memory, it came under my notice about a year ago. Obviously it would not be proper to mention any names, but I can furnish the Minister with copies of the papers tomorrow.",82
913,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Unde r an Act of Parliament, an officer who . has served twenty years, whether man or woman, can obtain six months' leave of absence on full pay.",82
914,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,And then retire?,82
915,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Yes .,82
916,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is not the position taken up by the Czar and his Department. I do not attack the Public Service Commissioner, but the system, for he is doing We have what he can to meet the difficulties of administering the Service. I shall be glad if some one will get the papers for me from my box.",82
917,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Does not the honourable member know that we have passed an Act ?,82
918,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The Acts are bound up in the volumes on the table. I am as certain of my facts as the Minister was that he the would pass his Northern Territory Lands Ordinance.,82
919,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I have just seen the Public Service Inspector.,82
920,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am glad to know that that officer is here, because the Minister can inform himself on a further point. I was told during last recess that when a female public servant gets married it is customary to dispense with her services. Will the Minister deny that?",82
921,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,No .,83
922,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I have now a copy of the papers to which I referred. The application for furlough was made on the 5th February, 1911.",83
923,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,An Act of Parliament dealing with the matter has been passed since then.,83
924,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The ex-Postmaster General has just admitted that the present practice in the Postal Department is that, the moment a woman marries, her services are dispensed with.",83
925,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,That is another thing altogether ; we are not talking about that.,83
926,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am giving one instance able to keep her. of the inequality between the sexes in the Department, dealing primarily with the discouragement to marry; and I am told by the ex-Postmaster-General that this is another thing altogether, in fact, quite foreign. Here is a regulation so sweeping in character that it completely establishes my case, without it being necessary to refer to these papers. I think that there ought to be absolute equality between the sexes in any public Department.",83
927,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I think that there is now.,83
928,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The ex-Postmaster General has said that there is not. In this particular case, I should like the Postmaster-General to make the principle of his Bill retrospective, so as to enable this public servant to be given what she was morally entitled to, and that was the equivalent of the six months' leave, three months of which she was, deprived of because she got married. That is, I think, a fair request.",83
929,Mr OZANNE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Sh e gets it now.,83
930,Mr TUDOR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,How far would you back-to the establishment of Federation ?,83
931,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I would make the Bill retrospective in any case where this invidious distinction has been drawn between the sexes.

940,Mr HIGGS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Is not your time up ?,83
941,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I do not think that I have been speaking very long. I really would like some respect to be shown to the Public Service of Australia by honourable members opposite who are always attending their association banquets. This is the one chance in the year that we have of considering the legitimate grievances of the public servants; but these Estimates are to be driven through at the end of an all-day sitting. I do not think that that is a decent way of treating the public servants, and I hope that they will ""tumble"" to it.",83
942,Mr FENTON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"They will ""tumble"" to you people to-night.",83
943,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I think that the Public Service will realise that an ounce of fact is worth a great deal of froth after an go association dinner, and that when they see a party prepared to force through these Estimates, and prevent their legitimate grievances being ventilated in the National Parliament, simply to suit the convenience of the Minister, and to prove the insincerity of a party, they will be inclined to modify their views of the powers that be, if they have not already modified them very considerably. There are one or two matters in connection with the Department of the Public Service Commissioner to which I wish to refer. This afternoon the honourable member for Parramatta referred to the big principle of having everybody in the Public Sendee put on the same basis so far as tenure, emoluments, and increments are concerned. This principle of having a few persons about the throne rewarded by the Minister, and all the other members of the Public Service, including the most poorly remunerated, placed at the disposal of the Commissioner, with an appeal at their own expense to the Arbitration Court, strikes me as inequitable and unreasonable, and not likely to command the respect of thinking persons. It seems to me that if we are to have a Public Service Commissioner, w,e ought to put everybody under him on the same basis as anybody' else. Do not let a few persons who are closely connected with the Minister be freed of the general supervision and control. Why should a man earning Â£ 6 0 a year or a bit more in, perhaps, some underpaid office, be compelled to have his case heard under all the laborious processes of the present tangled system, while an officer who is on close and friendly terms with the Minister can get his increments whenever they are asked for?",83

951,Mr TUDOR,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I regret very much, sir, having to withdraw the remark.",84
952,Mr WEBSTER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I acceded to the request of the Prime Minister on that occasion, and did not proceed to discuss this matter, which to me is of more importance than any other item in the whole of the Estimates. I take it that I am likely to [190] offend some honourable members if 1 attempt to deal to-night with the administration ot che Public Service, the conditions of public servants today, the differentiation between one section and another, the fixing of payment and conditions by Statute on the one hand, and by a Judicial Court or a Court of equity and good conscience on the other hand. The question as to whether this Department is necessary under present conditions is worthy of discussion. It grows by leaps and bounds, and now we find that an additional Â£2,000 is required. I understand there is a proposal, if it has not already been carried into effect, that an additional inspector be appointed to take charge of arbitration matters. While introducing machinery to redress the grievances of public servants, we are building up a complicated machinery that is not in harmony with the machinery outside. Those who are not Government servants, having no parliamentary court of appeal, have to go to the Arbitration Court, where they meet their employers, without any intermediary in the shape of a Commissioner; and pethaps the greatest anomaly in the world in this connection is found in the position presented in the case of our Public Service. We have a Commissioner charged with the selection of public servants, and yet he is not responsible for the efficiency of the Service he controls-powe r and responsibility are alienated in a manner that cannot insure success. I do not know what would have been the position in the Postal Service, for instance, had some other means of investigation not been found;' and I venture to say that, had there not been a Royal Commission, the Estimates now under discussion would have been discussed by every honourable member. However, as it is, the Commissioner's course has been made easy by the report of the Royal Commission, which he has very largely adopted. There are four points in regard to which he cannot see his way clear, and it is in regard to these that trouble has arisen. One of these points or recommendations is connected with postmasters; the second deals with the senior sorters, who were, for some reason, left out by the Commissioner; the third has to do with the grievances of the men in Adelaide who are entitled, at least, to a hearing; and the fourth deals with minor matters connected with a section of the Generaf. Division. The Commissioner has dealt already with over 150 of the recommendations of the Royal Commission; and all the trouble arises over a mere bagatelle made as compared vvith the expenditure incurred. For instance, I deeply regret that the question of the payment of the forage allowance to postmen in New South Wales has not been settled. The Royal Commission had evidence put before it that these men have to find their own horses, shoe them, house them, and replace them on an allowance of 12s. a week; and it was clearly shown that this is a most inadequate amount. It was thought that the Public Service Commissioner would have acted on the recommendation of the Commission at once, or, at any rate, that the Government would have urged him to do so. An experienced man, and a Government official, has stated emphatically that, during the last few years, no horse could be fed alone at such a rate; and yet such a matter of simple justice is not settled because the Commissioner, in his might, has deemed it wise to advise the Government to the contrary. The claim of the postmasters in regard to the payment of rent for their quarters is quite clear to All banking and other institutions, which employ men to live on the premises in order to safeguard valuable property, do not ask for. rent. These caretakers are the custodians of valuables, and in return for their services they are allowed the free use of the premises; and yet a matter of this kind, which might be settled at once, and should have been settled long ago, has been permitted to breed discontent in the Public Service. The senior sorters haye evidently been overlooked by the Commissioner. That gentleman has thought it wise to get out of the storm by agreeing to give, at least, a. modicum of justice to the large number of employees, but in the case of the smaller number he has held his hand. He seems to have a keen desire to appease irritation in the larger branches of the Servioe, with representative associations behind them, but not so in regard to the smaller section of the employees. In my judgment it would have been only fair on the part of the Government to take the matter into their own hands, as they have done in other directions. I thought that the creation of an Arbitration Court would have reduced the expenditure in the Public Service Commissioner's Department, but such has not been the result. We cannot have two assessing bodies; and if the Court undertakes the work in regard to great General Division of the Service, there is no need, when an award has been Mr Webster for, say, five years, for any interference by the Commissioner. After that has been done, matters may be left to officers of the Department, who are best able to judge the capacity and qualifications of different men to proceed from stage to stage in the various Departments in which they are employed. The worse feature of the whole business is that we have created a differential system, and have made provision for class treatment. One section of the Service is protected by law. The minimum salaries and annual increments are fixed.by Statute, and the Public Service Commissioner has no work to do in connection with them. All that is necessary is that records shall be kept, and this work may be done by a few clerks. Parliament has laid down what shall be done in connection with the Clerical and Professional Branches of the Public Service. Then we have decided that officers of the General Division must go to the Arbitration Court for the settlement of their troubles. me. What, then, will the Public Service Commissioner have to do after the Arbitration Court has made its first award dealing with officers of the General Division? Still he seems to dominate everything, and our public servants seem to be unable to approach him as they should be able to do. If we are to have a contented Public Service, the members of it must be given facilities to have their grievances heardThe Government have been prepared to act upon the recommendations of a Commission that inquired into the facts, and, if they have been able to do that in the case of certain sections of the Public Service, why should they not do it in thecase of all ? I am not here as a special pleader for the public servants, but I know that if we are to have a contented Service we must treat the members of it in a manner which will bring about contentment. I appeal to the Government to again consider the recommendations of the Postal Commission with respect to senior sorters and the rent allowance to postmasters. Tf they compare the salaries of the postmasters referred to with the salaries of railway servants and schoolmasters, they will find that there is an anomaly which might very well be rectified. They will see that some satisfaction should be given to men who have very heavy and responsible duties to perform in many of the post-offices of the Commonwealth. I shall have an opportunity to deal with the matter in a comprehensive way, I hope, before very long. I intend, if possible, at a later date, to submit in a concrete form the main recommendations of the Postal Commission, covering the matters upon which all the rest depend. We may make concessions, raise minimum salaries, and improve conditions, but unless we alter the management of the Postmaster General's Department, no Minister in charge of that Department will be able to administer it with satisfaction to himself or to this House. No Minister who has had control of the Department, even with the assistance to be obtained from the voluminous report and evidence submitted by the honourable members with whom I vvas associated on the Postal Commission, can say that he made a reputation in that Department. While a Minister allows the Public Service Commissioner, on the one hand, to tell him what to do, and afterwards receives different advice from the men at the head of the Department, he cannot expect that his management will give satisfaction to the public, the servants of the Department, or this House. The day will come when we shall be forced to reform the management of this great Service. We shall have to see whether we cannot get a greater degree of competency at the head of it, whether we cannot secure at the head of the Service men vvho are not merely automata who have grown up in a groove, but men with initiative and a desire tp introduce reforms, and lift the Department out of the rut in which it has been driven for years by upholders of red-tape and circumlocution. This is too big a problem for me to deal with to-night, but I shall deal with it at a later period, when there will be a full opportunity to discuss the matter.",84

956,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,No ; 1 want to get vote through. We have still a to do. The matters referred to can be discussed in connection with a Bill later on. This is not a very big Department to deal with at one sitting.,86
957,Mr GORDON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I have only a few observations to make under the heading of the Public Service Commissioner. The object of Parliament in passing the Public Service Act and giving the Public Service Commissioner such very wide powers as are given him under that Statute, was to remove a large portion of the Service, as far as practicable, from political control. It was necessary to give the Public Service Commissioner these large powers, in order to enable him to carry out the responsible duties assigned to him by Parliament. 1 should be the last to offer any criticism in the form of an objection to the Public Service Commissioner, because of any acts he may have committed in the past, or on the ground of want of sympathy with any branch of the Public Service; but we have to recognise that, rightly or wrongly, there are public servants who feel that the departmental attitude towards them is not as sympathetic as it should be, in order to bring about that contentment .which we want in the Service. A large section of the officers of the Postal Department who have attempted to approach the Public Service Commissioner with their troubles claim that they have not been treated with the sympathetic attention that their case deserves. As to whether that is a fact or not, I am not prepared, at this stage, to express an opinion. But' I do say that, as a Parliament desirous to mete out even-handed justice to all sections of the Service, we are entitled to express our opinion fo the effect that the Public Service Commissioner might at least give these officers an opportunity ? of appearing before him and having their heard. I know that the senior sorters in various States have been claiming to re have their grievances attended to by the Commissioner, and I hope that he will see his way clear to give them some consider a- I Mr ARCHIBALD - They will not get will realise much out of him.",86

960,Mr GORDON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I did not say that he will not receive deputations, but there is a feeling abroad-if the Minister can allay it, I shall be glad-that there is some difficulty in getting to see the Commissioner and having a case adjudicated upon by him.",87

963,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Not the slightest.,87
964,Mr GORDON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then there must be some misapprehension on the part of some, public servants, who appear to think that they have not been able to approach the Public Service Commissioner.",87
965,Mr ARCHIBALD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I think the difficulty is that they cannot get anything out of him when they do see him.,87
966,Mr GORDON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Perhaps they have not put their case as strongly as they might have done.,87
967,Mr THOMAS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Has the honourable member compared the figures as to the way in which postal officials were treated in South Australia before Federation and now?,87
968,Mr ARCHIBALD,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is not the question. Other officers have had their salaries raised, ancl these men have not.",87
969,Mr GOP DON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Minister, no doubt, looks at the matter from a different point of view from those who have been knocking at the door of the Public Service Commissioner, and have been unable to get their working conditions and pay improved. Mr THOMAS.,- I am talking now of the sorters.",87
970,Mr GORDON,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Whether their case is a good one or not, I am not in a position to say to-night. All that I do say is that there is no section of the Public Service which ought not to be able to have its case heard and finally settled. If the Commissioner is in a position to say that the claims made have been adjudicated upon, he must take the responsibility The members of the Service have two alternatives-eithe r to accept his verdict, or to appeal to the Arbitration Court for public servants created last year. May T be permitted to say, as regards that alternative, that, whilst the members of the Service have been afforded this option of getting to the Court. I do not think that we shall soon have to devise means for simplifying the methods of that tribunal. It may he easy enough to get into the Court, but there is some amount of difficulty in getavailable. ting out of it ; and the various branches of the Public Service feel that, in order to have their cases adjudicated upon by that tribunal, it is necessary for them to be in a position to put up a substantial amount of money. I do not know whether that is correct or not; but I do know thai there is a great amount of hesitation on the part of various sections of the Public Service to seek the alternative of appealing to the Public Service Arbitration Court as against the judgment of the Public Service Commissioner. It seems to me that we shall have to devise means by which the various branches of the Service will have an opportunity of going to the Arbitration Court in an inexpensive manner, having their cases heard, and being able to get out of the Court without much delay and expense. There is a case now before the Court in connection with the mechanical, side of the Post and Telegraph Department. The case has been under consideration for a considerable time, and I understand that there is no possibility of judgment being delivered during the present year. By this time the officers concerned are in a considerable amount of doubt as to what their actual position is likely to be. Naturally, other branches of the Service are deterred from seeking the protection and guidance of the Arbitration Court when they see cases occupying such a long time, the result, of course, being in doubt in the meanwhile. I put it to the Government that if they are to make the appeal from the Public Service Commissioner popular, in the sense that the members of the Public Service will feel that they have a fair opportunity of having their claims heard by this Court, every effort will have to be made to simplify the procedure of getting into the Court in the first place, and of obtaining a decision with the least possible delay.",87

973,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The idea of having a Public Service Commissioner was to place our Departments entirely outside political patronage, and under the control of a qualified responsible officer.

The Commissioner's reports are not presented to Parliament merely for the purpose of being laid upon the table. They are reports from an officer who understands his work, and who presents to Parliament what he considers to be an account of the position and necessities of the Departments under his control. If the Public Service Commissioner's reports are simply to be presented to the House and brushed aside, it is idle to ask for them.",88

No man is infallible, and I am sure that the Public Service Commissioner - would not say that his work is not capable of improvement; but the Commonwealth was fortunate in securing a man like him to take charge of the Public Service, especinot ally in its initial stages.

When the minute as to preference to unionists was first issued, we were told that it was to apply only to temporary employment, and we understood by that that it would apply to men who could be employed for not more than nine months at a time. We now find that a large number of employees outside the Act, but who are, to all intents and purposes, permanent hands, are to have this principle of preference to unionists extended to them. It is a proper principle to adopt.. The Public Service should be thrown open to those who have the capacity to fill the various positions, apart from what, their industrial or political views may be.

1026,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"The Minister's reply was "" Certainly.""",90
1027,Mr KING OMALLEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The r e has never been a rule made.,90
1028,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Then why did the Minthe ister reply "" Certainly "" when I asked him if a rule had been made? M i . KINGO ' MALLEY - The honourable member asked me if I had made a rule. I You lawyers put questions in such a way vision that really you do not understand them yourselves. Mr GROOM! - The position I put was visions clearly stated, but if I misunderstood the reply of the Minister, I apologize to him.",90
1029,Mr KING OMALLEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,We have no rule. The officers employ whom they like.,90
1030,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Then the rule does not apply to temporary employees in the Statistician's Office? Will the Minister say I be per- whether that is so or not? Mr KING O'MALLEY - There has never been an order issued.,90
1031,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Does the rule apply to them ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I hope that it does, but no such order has been issued.",90
1032,Mr SCULLIN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Is this question time? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member for Darling Downs should cross examine me when the Estimates of the Department of Home Affairs are under consideration.,90
1033,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I thought that the Statistician's Office was included in the Department of Home Affairs?,90
1034,Mr KING OMALLEY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"So it is, but the Department of Home Affairs is not now under consideration.",90
1035,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"When the Public Service that Commissioner's Department is under consideration, we are at liberty to discuss any The honor- otiier Department. It is unfortunate that at this late hour we cannot discuss matters as exhaustively as we might otherwise do.",90
1036,Mr WISE,PATENT MEDICINES AND,Because we wasted last night.,90
1037,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,The important subject of temporary and exempted employment is dealt with in the seventh report of the Public Service Commissioner. The prohibition against employing men temporarily for longer than nine months was enacted to require the permanent appointment of men needed for permanent work.,90
1038,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"And to prevent patronage. is my Mr GROOM - Yes . The Public Service Commissioner saysI t is certain that Parliament never intended that temporary hands should be employed in a wholesale manner for the performance of duties which, by no effort of imagination, could be considered as being temporary in cliaracter. This is manifested by the specific provision in law that the period of temporary employment of any person should be limited to nine months, and that, on completion of this term, no person sliould be eligible for further employment pending the expiration of six months. t was considered that by embodying this proin the Act, it would become impossible for any person to secure quasi permanent employment on the plea of special knowledge of or training in departmental work. While the proof the law are as indicated, a regrettable omission occurred in the failure to provide for a system of selection for employment which would remove any possibility of undue influence, and enable temporary or casual work to be distributed on fair grounds without favour to any peison. . . . The danger does not end at this stage, as once having secured temporary engagement by means of undue influence, the same influence is brought into play to prevent the services of temporary hands being dispensed with. It will be seen from the above r&sumi of the conditions governing temporary and exempted employment, that under the present unsatisfactory methods of regulating the selection and appointment of persons for this class of work the inducements for the exercise of pressure in securing Government employment are very considerable. In a letter addressed by the Secretary to the Public Service Commissioner to the Secretary to the Postmaster-General's Department, this passage occursThe Commissioner wishes me to add that unless definite action be taken within a reasonable period to place some check upon temporary and exempted temporary employment, which is growing so alarmingly, he will be reluctantly forced to review the whole question of class and individual exemptions, which have been extended from time to time on the representations of the Department, and to insist upon a rigid compliance with the provisions of section 40 of the Act as regards the limitation of periods of temporary employment. Tf there is permanent work to be done, men properly admitted to the Service, ancl possessing the necessary qualifications, should be permanently appointed for its performance.",90
1039,Mr FISHEK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"We had to spend about three times the ordinary amount to bring the Post Office Department up to date, and employed temporary hands far in excess of the number that could be absorbed in an ordinary year.",91
1040,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"But when the work to be done is permanent, permanent men should be appointed.",91
1041,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Certainly ; but it was reported that Â£2,000,000 should be spent to bring the Post Office Department up to date, and more men were needed to do that than were required permanently. think highly of the Commissioner; and, although he became apprehensive about the number of temporary employees, what was done was inevitable.",91
1042,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I am glad to have that explanation. It is a reply to the passages that I have quoted.,91
1043,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"If 4,000 or 5,000 men are appointed to deal with a rush of work, you cannot keep things at that level.",91
1044,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I do not wish to see in connection with the Commonwealth what has occurred in connection with State employment- a big Public Service in times of prosperity and wholesale retrenchments .uuring intervals of depression.,91
1045,Mr FISHER,PATENT MEDICINES AND,I shall never be a party to that; but we were bound to bring the Post Office up-to-date.,91
1046,Mr GROOM,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is so. No one can find fault with that; but the Commissioner having drawn attention to this matter, there was need for an explanation. I have here a long account of a public meeting held in Brisbane, and reported in the Courier of 4th November, dealing with postal discontent, but in view of its importance I shall refer to it at a later stage. Important questions affecting the Public Service are above party considerations, and a whole day could be profitably spent in their discussion. It is not fair to the country, the Service, or ourselves, to deal with them at this hour.",91
1047,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Parramatta) [11.56] - I have no intention to discuss this matter. I rise to protest against it being brought on at this hour without a report from the Public Service Commissioner, or any information regarding the present? condition of the Service, which now, more than at any other time, merits close attention. Nothing can be more prejudicial to the well-being of the Public Service than to have one set of officials under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, who is removed from parliamentary influence, and another set directly under Ministers, who can give themany privileges that they may think fit. You will not get the best service from your public officials if you show favouritism, and it is favouritism to. say to one man: "" You must go to the Arbitration Court if you will not accept the award of the Public Service Commissioner,"" and deal directly with another man. This can only lead to the demoralization ""of the Service. But the I position cannot be adequately discussed at this time of night, when we have been sitting for over thirteen hours, and are jaded and weary. I protest against the bludgeoning through of these Estimates without information being given, and without an opportunity to fully and properly consider the grievances of the public servants. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [11.59] - I , too, desire to protest emphatically against pushing on with these Estimates at the present time. A most important and startling declaration has been made by the Prime Minister. He has shown that the large army of temporary and exempt employees which has been appointed by Ministers is temporary only. in name. As a matter of fact, they are permanent employees, or, to use the Prime Minister's own words, they are likely to remain there during good behaviour.",91
1048,Mr WEST,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"You have been advocating that all the session. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - For the honourable member to say that I have advocated political patronage at any time is to make a statement which is absolutely contrary to the fact. I have never advocated political patronage. On the contrary, I have always condemned it.",92
1049,Mr JH CATTS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Nobod y else has advocated it. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - No body else may have advocated political patronage, but here we have a Government which is exercising political patronage with the approval of honourable members on the other side, who profess not to believe in it. We have had a large army of public servants appointed uncler a Labour Government within the last two years, directly under political patronage, and in direct contravention of the spirit of the Public Service Act. Presently, we shall have a larger number of public servants employed directly under Ministerial control and patronage than are employed under the authority and administration of the Public Service Commissioner.",92
1050,Mr WCWILLIAMS,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"That is the case now. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member is, I believe, right; but in the near future it threatens to be very largely in excess, and to be altogether a menace to the principle underlying the Public Service Act - the principle of separating public employment under the Commonwealth from the influence of politicians. The system of political patronage is being insidiously introduced with the approval of a party which is ostensibly opposed to the system. I undertake to say that if anything like the same amount of political patronage had been exercised by a Liberal Government, nobody would have been louder in denunciation of the practice than would those honourable members who are now quietly aiding and abetting the Ministry in the establishment of this pernicious principle, while openly professing to disbelieve in it. When we hear that casual employees are being appointed to the Public Service under this principle of ference to unionists, we realise where movement is trending and what [i9r] pose of it all. It is about time that we entered a protest against the continuance of the system; and I hope that this Parliament, before it rises, will insist that the whole of these employees shall be transferred to the authority of the Public Service Commissioner, especially when we have learned, as we have learned to-night from the Prime Minister for the first time, that the intention is to make them practically permanent employees during their good behaviour. In other words-, they will be in possession of their billets so long as Ministers have no reason to find fault with them. When it is found inconvenient to have them there, or they develop tendencies, perhaps in a political direction opposed to the opinions and the principles held by Ministers and their, supporters, no doubt they will not be regarded as being any longer of good behaviour, and convenient excuses will be found for replacing them with others whose political opinions are more of the Labour colour. I regret very much the absence of the Public Service Commissioner's report this year, as it places honourable members at a decided disadvantage in discussing the Estimates relating to this portion of the Prime Minister's Department. It only emphasizes the necessity of deferring their consideration until the Committee is in possession of fuller information. The Ministers do not feel in the least disposed to give any information. Perhaps they are not able to do so. Although honourable members' liberties in the matter of criticism have been reduced to a minimum by an amendment of the Standing Orders, yet we are asked to deal with an important matter of this kind at this time of night, after a protracted sitting of over fourteen hours, when honourable members are tired, jaded, and weary. I was not surprised to find that at least one honourable member on the other side had the courage to get up and record a protest, feeble though it was, because it was not followed up. It shows that there are some honourable members on the other side who, however much they may support the Government and help them to "" bludgeon "" the business through, do not approve of this attempt to force Estimates through without proper consideration.",92
1051,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"I am quite sure prethat there are not half-a-dozen honourable that members of the whole party who believe is the purlhat it is a fair thing. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Hear , hear I Many honourable members on this side went home without the slightest idea that it was the intention of the Prime Minister to push his Estimates through tonight. No information to that effect was given when they were presented. It places the House and the country at a disadvantage to force these Estimates through without giving reasonable time for examination and criticism. The rents of the postmasters is a source of very serious discontent in that branch of the Public Service. .They have not received fair treatment.",92
1052,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Will the honourable member deal with that matter on the Estimates of the Postmaster-General? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I would remind you, sir, that it is almost impossible to properly deal with the Estimates of the Public Service Commissioner's Department without traversing the administration of the various Departments of the Public Service. I am making only an incidental reference to postmasters, without going into the merits of their case, which I would be able to do if we were discussing the Estimates of the Postmaster-General. In this instance, we have to discuss the matter generally, so far as a large section of the employees are concerned, because employees in all Departments are under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. I only instance the case of the postmasters as one of the phases of the question that ought to be thoroughly gone into with a view to seeing that something like a fair measure of justice is given. Then there is the question of holidays for the temporary employees in the various branches of the Service, who have been transferred to the permanent staffs. Some weeks ago, I asked in this House whether the temporary employee's who had been for twelve months and upwards in the Service, and were subsequently transferred to the permanent staff, would have the twelve months reckoned in connection with their annual leave, and I was told that that would be done. I have since ascertained, however, that through the action of officers in the Departments that promise has not been kept, and that these men have been refused leave until they have 'served twelve months as permanent employees. A number of such men, for instance, are employed in the mechanical branch of the Electrician's Department in Sydney, and they have general cause for complaint in this regard. However, I shall not discuss the matter at length, but merely mention these instances to show that reasonable time should be given, in the consideration of the Estimates, to bring grievances of the kind under the notice of the Minister. Owing to the late hour at which the Government are attempting to force the Estimates through, we are denied the opportunity we desire. We were promised that if we curtailed our speeches, sacrificed our morning hours, and the time set apart for private members' business, we should not have late sittings, but we now find that the inducement held out to us to assist the Government in expediting the work has been forgotten. We are now face to face with the old trouble of exhaustive sittings, just as if no concessions had been made; and, under the circumstances, I do not feel inclined to discuss the Estimates, and I refuse to proceed any further. Proposed vote agreed to. THE TREASURY. Division 15 (The Treasury), .Â£20,305.",93
1053,Mr KELLY,PATENT MEDICINES AND,"Wentworth) [12.16 a.m.]. - The Estimates of the Treasurer's Department cover the financing of every Department. Under the old system of government, a Minister, under the advice of his executive officers, made certain estimates, based on his anticipations of what would be required during the year, and these Estimates were ultimately sent on to the Treasurer. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I beg to call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.]",93
