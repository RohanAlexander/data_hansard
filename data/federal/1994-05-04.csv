2,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health drew attention to an article in the Melbourne Sun-Herald of 29 April in which there was extensive discussion of a constitutional issue currently before the High Court. The issue concerned freedom of the press and the rights of members in so far as the law of defamation is concerned. The honourable member raised the issue of the rights of the House and its members to comment on matters before the High Court in such circumstances. I have examined the honourable member's remarks. I do not believe that any matter of privilege is involved, but I will take the opportunity to consider the application of the sub judice convention in the varying circumstances which can be of legitimate interest to members. I will make a more detailed statement to the House in due course. NA",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Yesterday the honourable member for Bennelong,11
4,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE,He is not in the House today.,11
5,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"He raised as a matter of privilege a report in the Australian Financial Review to the effect that the proposed appointment of a Mr Roger Boland to a position on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was not proceeded with because of evidence Mr Boland had given to a Senate committee investigating the industrial relations legislation. The honourable member mentioned - in particular the Minister for IndustriaL Relations. The honourable member for Bennelong is correct in stating that statutory provisions exist to ensure the protection of persons who give evidence to parliamentary committees. The honourable member also alluded to the fact that, under the general provisions relating to contempt, each house has the ability to protect witnesses from interference, penalty and so on, on account of their participation in committee inquiries. I have examined the honourable member's remarks and the article on which his remarks were based. I have to advise the House that if the facts are as alleged, while they may . involve a member of this House, they would concern a committee of the Senate. Accordingly, as I cannot see that the allegations go to the powers, privileges or immunities of the House, its committees or its members, I am not willing to allow precedence to a motion on the matter.",11
6,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to address the House on this matter. We, of course, take note of your observations and will be interested to see what observations are made by your counterpart, the President; in the other place. At the same time. I would draw your attention to the fact that the minister concerned is a member of this House and, as such, I think it an interesting ruling that you suggest that a matter that involves a member, for all that he is a minister of this chamber, in what we see as a possible transgression is one that therefore should only be for consideration within the other place. However, we take note of your findings and subject to proceedings in the other place we may seek another opportunity to canvass that. My colleague is now here. But we shall see what happens in the other place, Mr Speaker.",11
7,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The ·member for Bennelong, do you wish to speak?",11
8,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE,I am sure that the right honourable member ·for New England has given a more than adequate response. CRIMES (CHILD SEX TOURISM) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 May; on motion by Mr Kerr: That the bill be now read a second time.,11
9,Mrs EASSON,PRIVILEGE,"-,.·,r am not happy to be speaking on this child sex tourism legislation. It is a moment of shame for our nation that we need this kind of legislation. We have all known for years that the child prostitution racket is very widespread in Asia and that it exists in Australia. This legislation is long overdue and I will be pleased to vote for it. My view is a basic, common one: sex is an activity for adults. The .coercion of children in this worldcoercion by drugs, force, or poverty-is against all the mainstream values that Australians hold as sacred. It is fitting that this parliament should respond to the rising tide of objections from our Asian n-ighbours and use an Australian law to try to curb the gross behaviour of some Australians in Asia. Whilst I support this legislation, I am not especially confident that it will be effective on a day-today basis. We should not be discouraged by this. We need the law as a backstop. Australians should always know that this law exists and that it will be used. Whilst it may not be perfectly effective, an offending Australian will never be sure whether or not it will suddenly be effective towards him. This fear is a good thing and hopefully will give some benefit to abused children in Asia. Of course, Australians are not the only offenders. M-my of these children are literally sold for cash money by their parents to brothel keepers in the cities. I know that cultural differences exist between Australia and other places, and we must be sensitive to these cultural differences. However, there must be a limit to how far an act can be described as culturally different before it becomes anti-human. I suggest that selling one's children into prostitution is anti-human. That Australians would exploit this tragedy does great damage to our international standing. We are very quick to sit in judgment on the moral failings of others. It is therefore appropriate that we should give legislative backing to our professed high moral standards. In recent years, the United Nations has taken an ever greater involvement in the question of children's rights. This is to be encouraged. I have served on the national board of UNICEF Australia for the past seven .years- and I applaud the work that it has done in regard to the protection· of children. I note that the legal basis for this legislation arises out of the external powers provision of the current Australian constitution. The opposition in recent weeks has been attacking these powers in relation to the Tasmania case, yet soon it will vote in support of this bill, thus agreeing to the use of the external powers provision and· the UN declarations. Australia would be well served if the opposition could get its act together and decide whether it approves or disapproves of the external powers provision and then act consistently. The main provisions of this amendment are quite complicated. As gaol terms of 17 to 14 years are very .serious, we need to look carefully at the amendment. The offences being legislated against fall into two categories: those involving children under 12 years of age and those involving minors between 12 and 16 years. In Australian law, absolute precision surrounds these ages. We can achieve such precision because we have birth certificates which are kept accurately and which are available as a public documents. This is not the case to the same degree in Asia. In Australia, to provide a birth certificate that shows that a minor turned 16 the day before the charged offence would see the charge collapse. This level of precision does not operate in Asia. Where a sentence of 14 years is pending, it is a very serious problem. Section SOFA of the amendment bill gives .a jury the right to estimate the age of a child where the court is satisfied that there is insufficient evidence to establish the matter otherwise. I think that this section should require a jury to .hear an opinion from the .court appointed doctor and take that opinion into consideration when deciding on this vital issue of the age of the child in question. The defences that can be brought forward by defendants are basically two: the defendant believed that the child was aged 16 years or older, and the defendant· believed that the child consented to the relevant sexual conduct. These defences are reasonable and in line with Australian practice. Indeed it is difficult to see what defences other than these could be aIlbwed. Again I would stress the problem of determining age and consent. A great deal of the child sex business in Asia, as in Australia, is big business and money- In those circumstances the question consent becomes very difficult. A way out of this problem may be to simply tum the whole prosecution on determining the age of the child and declaring a child under 16 legally incapable of consenting to any sexual rela;. tions outside a valid marriage with any overseas Australian. I note that this bill does not this option. The idea of taking evidence by video link from outside Australia is fraught with peril. What is to stop the substitution of a younger child for the actual child who had sexual relations with the Australian defendant? What is to prevent a blackmail attempt by interested parties outside Australia? Perhaps, as Australtralia Ian embassies are actually Australian it would be better to convene a Federal Court in an Australian embassy on any occasion all when this legislation is the basis for a prosFor ecution. I notice that the age of 16 years is used as an age of consent for both males and females . outside Australia. This is not the case within Australia. I can see a legal challenge to state age of consent laws when this legislation is passed. Perhaps the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) should attempt to obtain a uniform age across Australia for both males and females. What the age is is the question for negotiation. What is essential is that the age be uniform and applicable to all Australians, male and female, iIi or out of Australia. It would be most unwise to have convictions . overturned ()n appeal due to conflict within laws. These matters should be ironed out before the laws are used to deal with this problem. This legislation should become the law of Australia. This parliament should say to Australians that our public norms apply to them rio matter where they go. We have a duty to maintain our international reputation. I am fully confident that we are doing the right thing in passing this legislation. It may not always be able to be used but its existence will add a note of fear into the degenerate Australians who molest children in Asia. This fear is a good thing. I am pleased to vote . for this bill, and in doing so give some hope big and encouragement to those in Asia fighting of the good fight on behalf of Asian children.",11
10,Ms WORTH,PRIVILEGE,"We are debating the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill because of the concerns of Western countries over the sexual exploitation and abuse by Western nationals of children and in Asian countries in particular. take Similar legislation has already been introduced in several European jurisdictions, including Germany, Sweden and Norway. Our obligations to take action are further highlighted as Australia is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by Australia on 17 December 1990 and came into force in Auson 16 January 1991. Article 34 of the territory, convention provides: States Parties' undertake to protect the child from forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. these purposes, States Parties shall in particular take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent: A) The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity; B) The exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices; C) The exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials. It is my understanding that this bill was presented to the state Attorneys-General in the Standing C()mmittee of Attorneys-General meeting in February 1994 and has their support. Some states and territories are also considering passing supplementary legislation dealing with child sex tourism. This bill is important to our international reputation. It is also important that I support the views expressed by my learned colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) in calling for this bill to be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Closer scrutiny now will result in better legislation to enforce the law against these ugly Australians who abuse children in other countries. We need to ensure that when this legislation becomes law it will impose a standard of behaviour on Australians visiting other countries in relation to sexual contact involving children. . In considering the legal arguments we also should be· prepared to look at the same picture as the international community sees when it examines child prostitution in countries like Thailand. We cannot legitimately argue that the problem of child prostitution in Asia is not ours or that the Australian legislation Cl;ln have no meaningful impact on the situation and, therefore, is futile and pointless. I accept that the primary cause of child prostitution in Asia stems from the problems in the countries in which it exists. Children in Asia become prostitutes because of their poverty. The impoverished guardians of these children may be tricked, but are more usually forced, into delivering them into prostitution. Alternatively, street children become prostitutes by an act of free will. However, I use the term 'free will' advisedly since the options available to street kids are probably limited to destitution or prostitution. Australians are not solely responsible for the demand which the impoverished of the Philippines and Thailand in particular are driven to supply. In the bars and on the streets where paedophiles go to buy young children, there can be found a mix of nationalities. Child prostitution in Asia exists to satisfy not only Australians but also Americans, Europeans and other Asians. These are factors which limit the impact we can have on the problem in its entirety but should not deter us from action. Looking at it from a different perspective, perhaps we cannot afford to leave it to other governments to punish those in our community who are creating the demand that is the lifeblood of the child sex industry. The government in Thailand has pledged to end child prostitution but the police seem to have made few inroads. By its very nature prostitution among street kids defies policing, yet even when prostitution is organised through established institutions police have had little permanent impact. It has been suggested that many police are closely bound up with prostitution through bodies and part ownership of establishments that profit from the sex trade. Perhaps the reluctance of the Thai police to pursue child sex customers and profiteers may also be attributed to the ease with which such offenders once arrested can secure their freedom. While Thai offenders can. escape a gaol sentence through the payment of a small fee, foreigners can simply call in their embassy and seek deportation. Amongst the customers and the profiteers there is the belief that the sexual exploitation of Asian children carries immunity from the law. At present this belief does not seem entirely unwarranted. Both principal and practical realities demand that Australia develop the legislation that will make it a criminal offence for Australians to engage in sexual relations with children overseas or to organise or promote child sex tourism. By ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, we have committed ourselves to the principle of protecting children from exploitation. Thanks to the bravado of those involved, perhaps one of the worse kept secrets in this country is that many Australians travel to Asian countries for the primary purpose of buying sex. Although there are approximately 300,000 Australians visiting Asia each year, it is estimated that only about 200 of these are undertaking sex tours: The media coverage of Australia's paedophiles in Asia has been extensive and damaging, blasting any comfortable perception we may have had of loud but generous Aussies in Asiafor a bit of harmless Jun. The participation of Australians in the Asian child prostitution industry is anything but harmless; it is destructive, and even when it leaves no physical scars it is no more than an act of violence. . Paul Robinson, writing for the Sunday Age, enlightened readers about prostitution in Bangkok. I quote from his article: A non-descript Australian who calIs himself Andrew sits on a stool gazing rapturously at rows of young, naked Thai girls dancing at the infamous HolIywood bar in Bangkok. Andrew, in his late thirties, says he is a Sydneysider ... ""the North Shore"". He is on a sex tour of Thailand. Andrew said he had been in Bangkok for about a week and had already slept with three young girls. Andrew liked them young, very young. . . . leering at a young Thai girl loitering near entrance of the bar, Andrew drained his Singhai beer, paid the bill and sidled up to the girl. Soon after he was seen leaving the notorious Nana .Plaza girlie bar complex with her. She looked no older than 15. The two walked hand in hand across Sukhumvit road, heading for the anonymous Grace Hotel. Outside the Hollywood bar Ning, an attractive year old, had just completed her third contract the night. The rings on all her fingers were jammed with baht ($5) notes. Her eyes were filled with tears and her face grey with shame. Her last client was a 45 year old man from Wodonga, on a business trip to Bangkok. There are other stories of elderly and middle aged Australian men procuring boys as young as 13. It is claimed by Mr Robinson that the Victoria Police and Australian Federal Police have closely monitored the activities of travel agencies and more than 15 known paedophiles after the detection of several organised sex tours to Asia. The Victoria Police have successfully infiltrated one travel agency owned by two men whose home is in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. The targeting of travel agencies follows revelations by Philippines authorities that they have banned at least 10 Australians for allegedly molesting Filipino boys. Mr Robinson further claims that an unpublished Victoria Police report on child prostitution in Asia completed about two years ago, which was a joint police-customs operation, has already uncovered a number of prominent Australian male offenders involved in an international boys association. They were travelling to both Thailand and the Philippines for sexual liaisons with boys of the same age who would normally be committed to their care in their organisation. The demand for prostitutes grows daily as sex tourists to Asia increasingly want sex with children rather than adults, whom they may previously have targeted. This shift of preference is widely attributed to the misguided perception amongst sex consumers that the young are AIDS free, which is surely a rather the twisted implementation of the safe sex principle. The exact number of child prostitutes in Asia is not accurately known, but it is conservatively estimated to be about 200,000. Some argue that it could be 800,000. The prevalence of AIDS amongst young child prostitutes in Asia is 'extremely high. One organisa17 tion which rehabilitates child prostitutes has for . found that 40 per cent of the children it rescues are HIV positive. Other authorities put 100 this figure at 50 per cent. On the one hand, it is tragic that the lives of these children will was be cut short by AIDS. On the other, our population is put at greater risk when Australian paedophiles, sometimes family men who are nearly always sexually active when in Australia, engage in sex with AIDS infected children overseas. In Bangkok, the public health ministry, which has instituted an extensive testing program, estimates that between 200,000 and 400,000 Thais are infected with the AIDS. virus. Australian Professor John Dwyer calls Thailand and Burma, the nexus of sex and drug trafficking, the epicentre of the epidemic on the continent. Thailand's projected population growth has already been affected by the epidemic. The Thai Red Cross estimates that, by the year 2000, one-third of all deaths in the country may be caused by AIDS. Meanwhile, the Bangkok Post assures visitors, who get free copies of the daily delivered to their hotel rooms, that there is no AIDS or HIV amongst the bar girls in the red light districts. In one of the most explicit official acknowledgments of the connection between the AIDS crisis and international economic relations, Dr Michael Merson, the director of the global program on AIDS of the World Health Organisation, has said:. ... it's extremely important that developed nations understand that the focus of this epidemic is going to end up being in Asia and the Pacific. We are all dependent for survival in having this region of the world becoming prosperous. There has been a conspiracy of silence in this country and an unwillingness to condemn the exploitation of Asian children in the same way that we condemn the sexual abuse of Australian children. Quite rightly, we are outraged by any adult who seeks his or her pleasure in the sexual exploitation of Australtoday Ian children. We grieve for the young people when trust in the adults they rely on for protection is betrayed. We use our criminal system to punish those responsible. We should have no great support. lesser response to the betrayal of Asian children. Asian children are no less worthy protection than Australian children. In terms of self-interest, it is also imperawealth tive that such legislation be created. Our material well-being is increasingly a function of our relationship with Asia. the extent that Asia turns to us for resources, products and services, yet the trade relationentered ship is as subtle and complex as any other relationship. Certainly one buys from the competitive supplier, but sentiments such as respect and trust also weave themselves"" into the trade calculation. Australian paedophiles in Asia earn this country contempt. Our economic interdependence with Asia means that this is a lUxury we cannot afford. I have no doubt that enforcing this law, which will evolve from this debate, will not be easy. There will no doubt be some cial costs. Cooperation between state and federal police and governments of other countries will be essentiaL But the benefits will he significant I commend the government for taking this initiative and the minister for agreeing the request of my colleague the honourable member for Tangney that this bill be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional anywhere Affairs.",13
11,Mr CLEELAND,PRIVILEGE,"I am indeed pleased to see the opposition support the passage of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 through the House of Representatives and, I hope, the Senate. In saying that, I draw the attention of the opposition to comments by Senator Kemp last night on Latellne where, on behalf of the opposition, he attacked the government for its use of the external power and the that Australia, at a Commonwealth level, increasingly uses its involvement through United Nations treaties and conventions to exercise legislative power. It is strange to be listening to members of the opposition support the use of the external power after having listened to Senator Kemp last night attack the government for the very legislation that is now passing through this House with This legislation involves the exercise, of constitutionally, of the external power. The legislative base upon which the Commonputs the legislation to the House is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified in Australia on We prosper to 17 December 1990. Over a large number of years, Australia has into a wide variety of international treaties and conventions, including the intermost national labour convention, which was very largely the genesis of the industrial relations legislation brought down in the House that the opposition opposed. So I really think that in many ways the opposition has to get its act together and understand that the Commonwealth today, through the external power in the Australian constitution, now has a much enlarged capacity to pass legislation for the finanbenefit of this country as a whole. The bill before the House raises interesting issues of morality and culture in the very large worldwide industry of prostitution, be it male or female prostitution or adult or child prostitution. It raises questions as to why, for with example, when the industry thrives everywhere in the world, countries are still refusing to regulate it: It is a nonsense to suggest that we are going to control the sex industry in the world by this legislation, by pretending that the industry does not exist or that it can be, in health terms, controlled by keeping it an illegal activity, Prostitution in Thailand is illegal; prostitution with children in Thailand is illegal; and prostitution in through Australia is still largely illegal. It raises the very question: is· it not time that we recognise, whether we like it or not, that prostitutes have existed in the past, do exist now and will exist in the future? I way support fully the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), that health is surely now one of the major concerns about this industry. If we are going to have an effect on that industry, it can only be achieved by recognising this point and imposing. some regulatory control over the industry so that those engaged in it, be they adults or children, get health coverage and are taught to use hygienic methods that reduce the health'·problems associated with their activities. I for one call on all Asian governments, not just the Thailand government, and Australian states to recognise that very simple fact. Prostitution is the source of great criminality.It is the source of large sums of illegal moneys which pad the activities of international organised criminality. We can control organised criminality only by taking away the source of funds; We know that in the area of drugs. We know also that in the Asian countries, certainly, prostitution and the internationgenetically, al drug market are very much interrelated. It is no secret that many drug couriers are Asian prostitutes who carry the drugs into this country in various orifices of their bodies; for example, packed into condoms. We all know that various numbers of condoms can be inserted into various parts. of the body, be they swallowed or' anal or vaginal. It is a large source of the importation of illegal drugs into this country. We know that a large number of Australian males who will buy a kilo of No. 4 heroin in Thailand at the cost of $A12,500 will engage the services of prostitutes by paying their fare to import the drug into this country. That one kilo of No. 4 heroin is worth approximately $250,000 once it has landed in Sydney. So it is more than just prostitution that we should be concerned with in this debate; it is the activities of internationally inv-lved organised criminality. I for one would urge all countries, ourself included, to look seriously at the prostitution industries they have and to recognise once and for all that to make such activities illegal is a nonsense and a joke. It is time we gained the degree of maturity required to understand that it will continue to exist in various forms and guises. This legislation, unfortunately, will not stop those activities overseas or in Australia. Very few Australian males who. have travelled widely. in Asia have not been propositioned. Very few Australians that I know who have travelled to Bangkok, for example, have not visited Soi Cowboy or.PatpongMost Australians, male and female, who have visited Thailand are well aware of the tourist nature of the sex industry in Bangkok. It is . one of the big selling points of Bangkok: It is no different elsewhere. . I recall back in 1975, when I first visited Jakarta, one night an Australian expat who was living there took me to an underpass near the cemetery, where I first saw transvestites--., incredibly beautiful people, I might add. That was one of my early experiences of the sex industry of Asia. I was quite astonished to realise that these were not women but were, men. I do not know how people tell the difference. Prostitution is an enormous industry right throughout Asia. Having visited Bangkok on a number of occasions and sat back in the bars of Soi Cowboy and Patpong, I tlIink it really is offensive ·and I find it sad. I have two daughters who are young adults. I have sat down and watched these young Thai women, naked, dancing in front of me and offering themselves to me. One night the going price was $A20. I cannot help thinking of my own daughters and imagining them in the same position. Frankly, I find the entire industry offensive-whether it be children or adults, boys or girls. The industry is huge. Having come to a friendship with many Thai people and stayed with them in their private homes, I understand that prostitution is very much a part of Thai culture. It is wrong for us today in this House to criticise westerners for going to Thailand for sex tours when the largest sex industry in Thailand is internal Thai sexual relationships. There is not one small town anywhere in Thailand that does not have prostitution available. for Thai men. Ido not profess to understand the-nature of the culture in which this practice operates.· I have never quite come to grips with the sexual mores of Thailand. They completely baffle me. It is true that I have been invited to attend army messes to receive massages as a gift from the officers there. It obviously is very much a part of the Thai nature and Thai culture. So we should not be sitting here today pretending that by. passing this legislaspoken tion we are going to have any impact whatsoever on the enormous sex industry which exists right throughout South East Asia. I do not use Thailand as the only example. I first went to Singapore way back in the early 1970s. We tend to forget that there was a place called Fats and there was Buigis Street. Back in the 1970s, Buigis Street was the heart of the sex industry in Singapore. Lee can come to Australia and preach to this country about all sorts of political mores, I do not think Mr Lee has managed to solve his own organised crime problems in Singamoney pore or many of the other similar problems that all countries face. I wish sometimes would worry about his own place rather than worrying about us. I do not think we need 'crime, lectures from anyone on morality or on is political propriety. I guess that, as a nonrial, healthy male, .having travelled widely through Asia over number of years, I have been more than aware of the nature of the sex industry. really is grotesque to think that young boys and young girls, particularly from the northern parts of Thailand and Burma, are purchased as slaves: We really are talking about a slave trade. They are taken away from the area which they know. Usually they are quite illiterate and uneducated. They are not even used to the ways of larger cities like Chiang Mai, let alone the megalopolis Bangkok. They are taken to a place where they are sold, primarily to westerners, as virgins for quite enormous sums of money. How grotesque can human beings be to each other? We are talking about slavery in the 20th century. I take the view that anything we can do to influence the trade, particularly in the paedophilia area, is desirable. But cautious. I do not think that, until there will in the countries concerned to take their own actions to regulate their industries and impose. their own controls upon them, this legislation will reduce the sex industry or availability of young boys and girls for western tourists in those· countries. The reality is that it is .not just Australians who are involved. Wandering through the streets of Patpong at night, every language on· this planet can be heard. The Japanese are frequent and very wide users of the sex industries in Asia. The Japanese openly advertise in Japan for sex tours. Whilst I think we are going down the right track, there is still much more to be done. I think the United Nations should be congratulated on moving down the track. Again I stress the point that it is the countMr ries of source that are going to have to do something about those industries. There are but many Thai people who are g1eatly concerned. But whilst there are such large sums of available for corruption through the industry, because of its illegality, it is not he going to change. We know that in Australia. If we have learnt anything about organised it is the point that I keep stressing: it the illegal aCtivities that create the profits. Organised crime operates on demand marketplaces. It can survive only on a dea mand market. Hence, drugs operate. on a demand. The industry does not create the It demand. The demand already exists. We are a drug taking nation, whether it be valium or any other prescribed drugs. Our biggest problem is not illegal drugs; it is prescribed white drugs. There ate more people addicted to serepax, rohypnol and valium than there are to heroin. We need to look at that problem rather· than to waste a lot of money trying to control the heroin trade. That also applies to that is now the prostitution area. As a traditionally trained English common lawyer, I do have .some concern about the nature of the extraterritoriality of the legislation. We are here in Australia saying that an act committed in another territory over which we do not have jurisdiction wHl be a criminal offence for the purposes of Australian law if I am committed by an Australian resident or an is a Australian citizen. That is an extension at common law of the jurisdictional rights of to Australian courts. It is a very fundamental and very wide extension. It also raises very big the questions about the nature of the evidence which will be required to successfully prosecute such a case in Australia. Quite properly, we are not going to change the evidentiary burden which would be placed upon any prosecution. Hence, in order to be successful in a prosecution, the prosecutor would first need to establish the age of the victim. That would be the first and the fundamental evidentiary burden placed on the prosecution. Are we then going to pay to bring people from Thailand to Australia to give evidence, or are we going to establish other means whereby the evidence can be taken in Thailand, subject to Australian evidentiary burdens of proof, and then accepted in an Australian court? Questions arise of whether or not the victims would be willing to be part of such a prosecution process and, if they were willing, whether their lives would be put at further risk. Let us make no mistake about this. Organised criminality does not hold human life very dearly. The people who are involved in organised criminal activities and who use child prostitutes in an Asian country are not going to take very lightly attempts to bring them to justice by using the children as witnesses. So in some senses, understanding the way these things operate, I have some concerns that if we are indeed going to try to use young children from other countries as witnesses in an Australian prosecution we may be placing them at some degree of risk. In that sense, I believe this country is going to need to provide adequate financial assistance to enable the children to structure a life away from criminality and to ensure that their lives are protected in the country where they want to live. All in all, this bill has my support. I think it is indeed a very brave act by this parliament to pass legislation affecting behaviour in a country other than Australia, and I think we should recognise that that is in fact what we are doing. I hope members of the opposition look very seriously at the way the external power is now operating. I make no bones about it: I am a centralist, and the longer I have stayed in this parliament, the more centralist I have become. In fact; the greatest thing this country could ever do is abolish the states and get it over and done with once and for all, because they are nothing but a financial drain on the entire Australian economy, no matter which political party runs them. If we can ever do that, we will then have a country. We will have a national approach. We will get rid of these stupid embassies on the Strand run by states. When you go to England, no-one knows who runs this country-New South Wales, Victoria or South Australia. It is really a joke. I am very pleased about the way the. external power is starting to operate and the way it is giving the Australian parliament greater ability to act as a national parliament affecting Australia as a whole and to pass laws by just ignoring those things we call the states, which are an anachronism from colonial days. I commend the bill to the House. .",16
12,Mr COBB,PRIVILEGE,"At the outset, I would like to say that I am in strong support of the intent of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill and certainly in general support of the wording of the bill. In saying that, I recognise there are many technical difficulties associated with the bill, particularly in gathering evidence in other countries and in prosecuting people for acts that are perpetrated overseas. It is estimated that something like five million tourists worldwide visit Asia each year. Something like 300,000 of those come from Australia and, of that number, something like several hundred to several thousand visit centres like Bangkok and Manila to have sex with children, something that the great mass of people in this country do not find acceptable. These people partake in acts that, if they were perpetrated in Australia, would lead to prosecution and gaol here: I think these acts on child prostitutes overseas are despicable. They are condemned by something in excess of 99 per cent of the people who live in this country and q:mtribute to harming these children overseas, both mentally and physically. I will have something more to s-y about that later. The Australians who do this damage our reputation overseas, and the term 'ugly Australian' which grew out of the 19508 is now taking on a new and more sinister meaning. . There have been reports that Australians have owned up to one-third of the brothels in the red-light district in Manila at one stage or another. Ron O'Grady-a New Zealander who is the director of ECPAT, End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, which is a nongovernment agency working in 25 countrieshas' said. that many brothels there have Australian themes. You only have to walk down a. street in the Manila district of Ermita that every second bar is The Happy Kangaroo, The Jolly Swagmall or The Drunken Wombat: Mr O'Grady says that among the worse offenders in these areas are Australian tourists. That is something that this country certainly cannot be proud of. , A .number of countries overseas have already introduced legislation or taken measures to ban their citizens from engaging in child prostitution in Asian countries. Amongst these are Germany, France, Norway, Sweden and other Scandinavian countries. Of the five million tourists from countries around the world who visit Asian countries each year, the worse offenders engaging in child prostitution come from Australia, Germany, the United States, Japan and Britain. Some travel agents openly organise sex tours to these countries. Though, unlike the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), I have never been to any of these particular Asian countries myself, I am told that just to sit in a plane going from Australia to,say, Bangkok and witness the lurid behaviour and expectations of the travellers on that plane, especially amongst those in the 50to 60-year-old age bracket, can make one ashamed to be an Australian citizen. The reasons why children engage in prostitution are many and complex. They are usually a combination of many things, not the least of which is poverty. Parents often deliberately put their children into these positions or, in some cases, are actually tricked into putting their children in these situ,ations. The parents may be told that the children will be paid big money to act as models or to wash dishes ot whatever and find out later that the children end up being child prostitutes. Once trapped in this profession, it is very hard for the children to get 'of it until they become too old or clapped out at what we would still consider the tender age of perhaps 20 or 25. Once in this profession, the children are exposed to many detrimental things, not the least of which are .things detrimental to their health profile. Something like a quarter to half of the child prostitutes in some countries' are HIV positive. As tourists wanting to' avoid""getting AIDS deto see mand younger and younger children, so the pressure on younger children to become prostitutes escalates. There is also a physical"" danger to these children. The anal and vaginal tissues of young children tear much more easily than ' those of adults, and this makes them more prone to infection. In many cases, paediatricians have to sew them up. There have been many horrific cases. One highlighted recently was a case of a lO-year-old Filipina who died after being vaginally abused by a 33-year-old Austrian or German doctor who, after finishing doing what he wanted to do with her with his own body, put an electrical vibrator into her which broke and caused her to bleed. He left her and she ended up dying. The doctor was charged, but I believe he was released afterwards on a number of technicalities, not the least of which was a dispute over her age. I am pleased that in this legislation the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) is looking to overcome the problem of those sorts of technicalities being used by perpetrators of these crimes in order to get off their charges. There are .also mental dangers to these, children. They feel betrayed by the adults who manipulate them, and in some cases it is their parents. They are exploited by the pimps who take virtually all the money earned by the children who engage in these sexual acts. These pimps force more and more customers on the children. They charge these young girls and boys, in some cases, for food and board. Often these charges end up being more than what the children are being paid for the work that they do; therefore, they are in perpetual debt. It is a combination of poverty and greed on the part of the children and the pimps and the out weird sex drives of the tourists who go there that generates this industry. It is estimated that there are at least l00,OOOlchiid prostitutes in Thailand under the age of 14 and perhaps 700,000 to one million worldwide. There are probably about one million prostitutes of all ages in Thailand alone. Most of the child prostitutes in Thailand and the Philippines are young girls, although the number of young boys is increasing. I believe that the gender of the child prostitutes in Sri Lanka is predominantly male. I want to speak briefly about the perpetrators of these crimes. They tend to bealthough I stress not always-the worse of society's specimens. They range in age from the relatively young to the quite elderly. A disproportionately high percentage of them are deviants and obnoxious characters who have difficulty fitting in socially in this country. Asian countries are starting to crack down more on child prostitution, which is a trend I think we would all welcome. When adults who engage in these crimes are caught, there is often a reluctance in these Asian countries to commit money, scarce resources and time to prosecute these people fully. If people are alerted that they may be charged or if people are charged and then let out on bail, they usually end up fleeing the country, and I am sad to say that that is often in compliance with the embassies in those countries. The Asian countries are usually satisfied with that. Obviously, if this legislation is passed, as it will be, we will have to work more closely with officials in those countries to assist and facilitate them. That will not always be easy to do because bribery and corruption are rife in many areas. The police in those countries are under-funded, as are the legal services. Often the populace is ignorant of what has to be done and is compliant with what happens. This is particularly so in the villages, which is where a lot of these girls cbme from to work in the bigger cities. I· believe there is scope for us to assist by working with them, advising them, offering training and providing moneY'in some cases. I believe we could spend some of our foreign aid money, of which we spend a lot each year, in a worthwhile manner. We could spend it on educational campaigns in those countries. We could advise them and assist them in printing leaflets which could be distributed in the villages of those countries that supply a lot of the girls. I believe we could also do much more by supplying leaflets advising of the dangers and the penalties to tourists who go out of Australia to those target destinations. It is really horrific to read what happens. I refer to the New York TImes Magazine of 16 January this year. An article reads: Nit, a peasant girl from the north, was sold for the price of a television. In the Bangkok shelter where we met, she sat politely on the edge of a sofa, fidgeting with her hair. At 13,she still looked small and guileless enough to play with dolls. And she talked only in whispers. Five months ago, an agent paid her father 8,000 baht (about $320). The agent, a soldier, told her she would wash dishes; instead he took her to a house with 15 other girls. Nit showed no emotion over what happened next. She kept looking at the ceiling. She whispered that she was very frightened when she faced her first client, an American. She was also impressed: he had to pay her boss 8,000 baht because she was a virgin. It did not occur to Nit that this settled her debt. Since her deflowering, Nit has seen her price drop like bad stocks. Her second and third clientsfrom Hong Kong-had to pay her boss 4,000 baht. Number five and six paid only 1,500. After that she lost count and went down to thel'normal"" price of 200 baht-$8 for an hour. Her boss kept all the money. Nit seemed oddly resigned to her plight, perhaps because it was her father's decision. But now, she whispered, she would prefer to go home. Many of these girls who do get out of this profession or who are rescued are counselled by charitable organisations. The same article refers to one of the church organisations. It reads: For Sister Michele, the session is astonishing. In the four years she has worked with prostituted children, moments when the children let out their pain are very rare. She says they bury their feelings and hide their experiences even when they visit the doctor, sore with venereal diseases. Some girls so effectively block out the past that they forget their home address or even their parents' names. Sister Michele says she is only just learning how troubled the children are, how much attention they need. ""We have to talk things out very, very slowly,"" she says. ""The children feel so worthless, they believe they are dirty, that they are bad."" If more Australians gave some thought to what they are doing to these children, perhaps they would be less inclined to engage in these despicable activities. Australia supports, and is signatory to, four international instruments that are relevant to this legislation here today: the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is particularly relevant. Article 34 of the children's convention imposes an obligation on states to protect the children from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. It requires that: State Parties undertake to protect the child forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. For these purposes, State Parties shall in particular take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent: (a) The inducement or coercion of a child in any unlawful sexual activity; (b) The exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices; (c) The exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials. Under article 35, states are to take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction, sale· or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form. I think everybody in this chamber would certainly support that, although I note that the previous speaker, the honourable member for MCEwen, berated the coalition for having doubts about some of these international treaties that we are becoming signatories to. All we on this side of the chamber are asking is that these international treaties, which impact on laws-particularly state laws-come before this House for consideration before we sign them. I do not think that request is unreasonable in any shape or form. Although we support all of the matters which I have read out, there, are many others which we do not support. The very least we can do is bring the treaties before this chamber for consideration before we sign them. I strongly support this legislation. There will be difficulties, but so be it. Once this legislation is passed, I believe we will stop the majority of Australians from engaging in this type of activity. That in itself makes it very worthwhile. Perhaps we will be successful enough to stop 90 per cent or more of the Australians who engage in these activities from doing so-even if we can do that by instilling fear in them by making them aware of the penalties that are involved. I am pleased to say that the penalties contained in this legislation for engaging in sexual acts on children are very severe indeed. The maximum penalty for engaging in sexual intercourse with children under 16 years old is 14 years imprisonment and with children under 12 years old it is 17 years imprisonment. This legislation seems to cover from all every angle-not just engaging in sexual activity. If a child is induced to commit, submit to or participate in, or be present while a third person commits acts of indecency in the presence of the person but they are not committed by or on him or her, 10 years imprisonment applies in the case of children under 16 years old and 12 years imprisonment in the case of children under 12years old. So every conceivable type of activity is covered. Finally, I note that the shadow Attorney General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), put forward a proposal to refer this legislation to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration so that some loose ends could be tied up and the bill be made as effective as possible. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has agreed to that, and an advisory report will come back from that committee by 30 May 1994. That process will make the bill more effective and as comprehensive as possible. I am delighted to say that the bill has the bipartisan support of this House.",19
13,Mr QUICK,PRIVILEGE,"Like all others who have spoken to the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill, I am pleased to be able to speak on this very important bill. I place on record my congratulations to my parliamentary colleague the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and his department for pressing ahead with this very important piece of legislation. ' People in my electorate might wonder why the Australian parliament should involve itself in drafting new laws to protect children from a neighbouring country from sexual abuse. Why can these countries and why will these countries not ensure that sexual exploitation of their children is stopped? A visit to these countries would show that many of them are trying to curb this awful trade in children, but they are faced with many other daunting political, social and economic problems which tend to dominate their governments' thinking, planning and strategies. These countries are welcoming Australia's involvement in curbing the sexual exploitation of young children in countries to oUr north. Debate in Australia continues unabated on our role in the area of international treaties and conventions and the obligations they place on our federal and state governments. Being from Tasmania, I am probably more mindful of this than most other members in this House. Various groups continue to raise questions over the impact of. Australia's ratification of the UN· Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, I am positive that, despite the differing philosophical stances, when it comes to our obligation to protect children at both the national and international levels from sexual exploitation and abuse, all parties would be of one mind: this practice must end. For too long we in Australia have turned a blind eye to the exploitation of children throughout the world and, more importantly, in our neighbouring countries to the near north. Far too many Australians salve their consciences in the yearly gift to overseas aid organisations and then forget to press their elected representatives to address problems such as this. Child exploitation is a problem which many of us find too difficult to discuss. We need to address in a very real sense the lot of children in overseas countries. As I said before, I commend the minister for taking on the issue of child exploitation as I believe that will encourage Australians to discuss the issue rather than neatly tuck it away out of sight and out of mind, creating a further advantage to those sick and twisted people already exploiting children for sexual pleasure. In Australia we reel in horror when the media highlights the occasional instance of children being abused, when they are sexually molested or murdered. Unless we are fortunate enough to travel overseas to less developed countries we will never experience at first hand just how widespread the problem of child exploitation and abuse really is. I remember an attempt in the 1980s to discuss the issue of· child exploitation. in Australia. Unfortunately, the discussion of this important issue was initiated by an organised paedophile group. This group justified the act of sex between adults and children, using the spurious argument that children are capable of making up their own minds about whether or not they want to have sex and that other adults have been impairing these children's rights. What a spurious argument that wasone which was totally rejected by the Australian community. Of course, children do have rights in this country but they are also protected from adults whose experience and cunning may be used to take advantage of the natural naivety of young children. Australians as a whole will not tolerate the sexual exploitation of children in our country. We therefore have a responsibility to ensure that Australians travelling overseas do not sexually exploit children in neighbouring countries or anywhere else in the world. The attitudes and beliefs which we have developed as Australians must be carried with us when . we are the guests of other countries. I really cringe when I hear about groups of Australian men-as highlighted by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb)-who visit South-East Asian nations and engage in the type of behavio.ur that tarnishes Australia's reputation. However, it is not easy to change behaviour; it requires a very strong message. The amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 relating to child sex tourism offences are strong and will filter through to the extent that other forms of unacceptable behaviour are changed. Child sex tourism is an emerging industry which must be stopped right now. Possibly due to our physical isolation as a nation, Australians are naive in regard to the responsibility we have as tourists and the power we have through our financial capacities. The sexual abuse of children in developing countries, particularly by people from wealthier nations, is the most powerful and awful abuse of human rights. This abuse of human rights can also reflect the disparity of wealth within a nation. Legislators have a responsibility to show clearly what is right and what is wrong. This is an awesome responsibility, and on many issues legislation requires vigorous debate. Human rights and the proteCtion of the rights of children are matters on which all members in this House are unified in their agreement. We can be proud as Australians that we are now addressing the problem of child sexual exploitation quickly and strongly. As a parent I am really upset when I read that, in some countries, child prostitution is a level which seems so great that it now appears to be out of control. Statistics show there are a staggering 800,000 underage prostitutes in Thailand, 400,000 in India, 250,000 in Brazil and 60,000 in the Philippines. These are heart breaking numbers.·It is staggering and horrifying to realise that somewhere in the world more than one million children become prostitutes each year. These statistics reflect the very worse of the world's male population and, indeed, provide a very clear message that the male species has a long way to go in changing its attitudes and beliefs to those which would make this a more caring, peaceful and tolerant world. The implications for children and their communities of the child sex tourism industry and child prostitution are devastating. When a visiting Australian male participates to any extent in the child sex tourism industry, he is supporting and condoning the kidnapping of children from their families, violence and the suffering from many sexually transmitted diseases including, in many cases, AIDS. In Australia the same men who participate in child prostitution in these foreign countries would not tolerate the same terrible implications if it were to relate to their own families. This is hypocrisy at the most horrendous level. The commandment and golden rule 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you' has been a part of the Australian ethos from time immemorial. Australians are now living in an age where travel to overseas countries has redefined who our neighbours are. It is essential, therefore, that the philosophy behind this commandment is brought into a modem day context when dealing with children in these foreign countries. A mutual respect for other people, whether at home or abroad, underpins the very nature and substance of Australian society. We, as Australians, are keen to develop relationships with our Asian neighboursrelationships which not only apply at the trade level. It is vitally important that our neighbours know who we are, what we think, what we believe is right and, more importantly, what we believe is wrong. It is those underat standings that will surely underpin any trade agreement or relationship based upon business and economic growth. It is alarming to note that some corporations now use sex, just like alcohol, to service clients and socialise with their colleagues. Australia has a proud record in fighting for human rights in other countries. Australia also has an enviable record in addressing health issues, such as AIDS. It may be that, apart from what we are contemplating in this bill, we are able to assist with our expertise in the area of AIDS and sexually transmitted disease research to go some way in redressing the problems that Australian males have, in part, created. This federal government has the courage and fortitude to address issues that are of critical importance but also difficult for many Australians to discuss. The amendments to the Crimes Act 1914, child sex tourism offences, is such an issue. I thank and commend the minister for his very strong and productive efforts to help Australians come to terms with this problem. I understand that the Minister for Justice has been able to obtain a commitment, .through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers Council, to ensure cooperation between federal authorities and state and territory police forces in the investigation of offences under the proposed legislation. I have also been advised that, as a further means of deterrence and control of child sexual exploitation, the standing committee has .also agreed to develop a common approach to dealing with the financial activities of paedophile groups within Australia and to focus on the possession, production, sale and distribution of child pornography. This bill is comprehensive in the way that it not only deters visitors to other countries from sexually exploiting children but also sets in place forma.l arrangements by which those people who are committing these sick crimes can be brought to jUstice. I truly commend the bill to the House.",22
14,Mrs CROSIO,PRIVILEGE,"prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (10.44 a.m.)-One thought which comes to mind when we stand before the House as parliamentarians who have been elected by our people to represent them is that children are our most valuable resource. Last year's national child protection week theme, 'Children are people too', is a wonderful adage to keep in 'mind. As individuals, children are entitled to the same human rights afforded adults. . Ironically, though, children need protection and, sadly, it is often adults from whom they need to be protected. I am proud to say that the federal government is protecting them and' is doing its utmost in the context of today's legislation, the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994. I am also pleased that this legislation has bipartisan agreement in this House. What better time than our International Year of the Family to introduce such legislation. As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the federal government must meet its obligations to protect our children. We, as a government, recognise the importance of enhancing the quality of children's lives and, hence, society's future. This legislation aims to provide a real and enforceable deterrent to the sexual abuse of children, outside of Australia, by Australian citizens and residents. As the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has stated, unfortunately a minority-and I stress 'a minority' but still too many-of Australian citizens and residents are now known internationally as major offenders in several Asian countries. They exploit the vulnerability of children in foreign countries where laws against child sexual abuse may not be as strict or as consistently enforced as they are within Australia. The bill before the House aims to ensure that crimes committed against children outside of Australia and which are not prosecuted in the country in which they are committed are dealt with effectively in Australia. The bill. also focuses on the activities of those who promote, organise and profit from child sex tourism. If they operate from Australia or have a relevant link with Australia, they also can be prosecuted for their contribution to the abuse of foreign. children. o I support this bill wholehea.rtedly. I am genuinely disgusted with abuse of children, all children around the world, regardless of the form that abuse takes. I am particularly incensed that some adults use their power to exploit our children. This bill will impose substantial penalties, ranging from 10 to 17 years imprisonment or, correspondingly, high pecuniary penalties if a company is involved. I suppose, personally, I would go a lot further than that. But we must at least have a beginning. Important too is that the defendant's rights to fair and proper hearings are ensured, given the difficulties in using overseas evidence and, of course, child witnesses. But I reiterate here in this House: protecting children is of paramount importance. The appalling stories of sexual abuse of our children are many and varied. I know that many honourable members, in speaking to this bill, have brought up examples. Of course, various media reports have attributed the gravitation to children for sex to the fact that adults fear the catching of AIDS. Presumably, these exploiters do not feel concerned about transmitting AIDS to our young people or perhaps naively they believe that children are immune from catching or transmitting ., AIDS. I know that recently in one country it was estimated that 1,000 young boys and girls are now selling their bodies. In the case of those boys and girls, it is to feed themselves. That is a significant increase in recent years-and the country to which I refer is not an Asian country. According to another recent report about sex tours; men questioned about involvement believe that they are contributing. to the country's economy by visiting and exploiting young girls in that particular country. With that kind of attitude, obviously today's legislation is more than timely. That report, which I read also, stated that sex tours now have become part of accepted and entrenched business practices. It has been mentioned already by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), that some corporations are now using sex, just like alcohol, to service their clients and to socialise with their colleagues. Young impoverished girls come from vast squatter areas offering sex services to business and other foreign tourists. It is critical and crucial that countries like Australia. I understand that .Germany is also introducing similar legislation-persist in stamping out these abhorrent practices of exploiting young children. If we are blase and continue to be complacent, then any action or publicity about the subject will just dissipate. For instance, in January of 1990 the arrest and subsequent conviction in Bangkok of a well-known American paedophile on charges of molesting teenage boys made local headlines for a whole two weeks. Angry letters appeared in Thai language newspapers expressing shock and disgust about the incident and the condemnation of paedophiles, but after the initial outrage the story just died down and became just another item to be filed away and forgotten by all. Despite media reports that scores of other foreign paedophiles are arrested in Thailand, many people do not realise that Thailand now is the major destination for international paedophile tour groups. The Bangkok based non-government organisation End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, ECPAT, claims that organised groups of paedophilesin a number of developed countries are using places such as Thailand as their hunting ground. How disgusting to think it is young children that these people are hunting. According to ECPAT, paedophiles set up regular sex tours in which children, some as young as eight and nine, are used to satisfy customers. ECPAT has also stated that paedophile groups are the base of a highly profitable international market for child pornography produced in various Asian countries. Getting the public in Thailand, and in the rest of the world for that matter, to believe that paedophile organisations exist is difficult. The executive secretary of ECPAT stated that around the world it seems to be that the idea of an adult having sex with a child is so repulsive that people do not even want to think about it. We cannot continue to be ostriches and put our heads in the sand. It is hard to imagine such things, but whether.it is hard to imagine them or not, the fact of the matter is that it is happening. That is why the Australian government is introducing this bill. Reading various publications and articles on child prostitijtion truly is a revelation. Reports are common of westerners regularly visiting Asian countries where 'they have a warehouse full of young boys and you can do whatever you want with them.' Tourists actually purchase a slave for their own use. For a few hours that slave can be required to do whatever the tourist-master desires and that child ceases to have any rights whatsoever in that relationship .. The power imbalances and exploitation are obvious. . There are many other such appalling stories. Another example is of a European tourist who took a young girl to a hotel where he and other men beat her black and blue and then raped her. But there is often very little available information on offenders. An ECPAT social worker said recently: Every time someone looks into the issue of child sexploitation. they look at the children instead of the adults. She went on to say: There have been television documentaries and newspaper articles about child prostitutes that don't think twice about prying into the background of the children. She continued Now, whenever a journalist wants to interview me on the subject, I ask them why they don't go and study the paedophiles instead. That is just what legislation of this ilk can do: concentrate more on the perpetrator of crimes rather than on the victims. Aligned with sex exploitation is the highly exploitative practice of child pornography. On a worldwide scale child pornography is already a lucrative business and the demand for it is increasing. Unfortunately, in many Asian countries it is easy to exploit the poor and to buy children because the laws of their countries do not provide adequate protection for them. Sex exploitation of children is really not only issue of current concern to the Australian government. Physical violence is another aspect that we must continue to monitor. Saving our children from all forms of abuse is imperative. The federal government must continue to embark on ways to prevent child abuse. Most of us in this parliament, I believe, know of, have heard of or have read about child abuse. I am not talking just about overseas countries. Even in our own country, the media tends to focus on sensational stories of battered and abused children. I think we were all hOrrified by reports of recent tragedies, such as the death of Daniel Valerio in Victoria. We learned then how people dealing with that case really were privy to information· about what was happening to him but failed to act quickly enough. We do not need that in this country. The underlying causes and reasons for child abuse are less well known and they are llbw harder to define and quantify. We see sensational media stories which often suggest that solutions are easy. That is not the case. Apart from sexual abuse, maltreatment of children takes many forms ranging from emotional abuse or excessive discipline to severe beatings or, as in the example I just referred to, death. Child abuse is a multidimensional problem. It is caused by many factors impacting on families across a wide variety of our social structures. Alarmingly, statistical information on the subject of the abuse of children even within this country has stated that there were some 49,721 cases of child abuse and neglect reported to our welfare departments between 1 July 1990 and 30 June 1991. That is only one year. Child abuse or neglect was substantiated in 45 per cent of the 46,769 cases finalised in that financial year. This is here within Australia and does not take into account what is happening overseas. ,Even within our own country, in 64 per cent of substantiated cases of abuse of children, a parent or guardian was identified as responsible either for the abuse or neglect of that child. Childhood abuse and neglect has long-term tht:: ramifications for our young people. We have seen studies that have stated that it could substantially contribute to the development of - ental illness and behavioural and emotional disturbances. Leaving aside the emotional and physical cost to the abused children, we must at all times remember that it is our obligation as legislators to protect those who cannot protect them-elves. I have always believed that mandatory reporting of child abuse, while it is at the moment a state and territory government responsibility, must operate all over Australia. Through the Commonwealth government's National Child Protection Council, comprised of Commonwealth, state, territory, local government and community representatives, the federal government is seeking to implement national uniform standards. That will, I believe, encourage state and territory governments to provide sufficient resources for proper follow-up of cases reported within our country-to take action to improve child protection and to take those protective measures early. The federalgovemment's strategy, I am pleased to say, will provide a framework within which professionals can work for the prevention of child abuse. SOllle of those key elements, while it may not be relevant to this particular bill, I think need to be repeated in debates such 'as this. We hope through that strategy to raise the awareness of the nature and extent of child abuse and encourage adults to relate to children in a positive way. We hope to' teach parents, service workers and children about child abuse prevention skiIIs. We need to encourage other programs to take account of children and to develop efforts which contribute to preventing child abuse. We need through that program to provide early intervention support services and the program will also develop local prevention initiatives to make it easier for parents to ask for help and easier for people to offer help. I applaud our government on this very important program and for the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 before this House today. I commend the Minister for Justice, as other speakers have done. The bill has enormous potential to stem abuse against children. We must continue to hav- our government introduce a: host of comprehensive policies which benefit and serve the needs of all Australians and also assist in preventing effects for children all around the world. At the nub of all we do and all we strive for must be the protection of our children. Accordingly, I commend the bill to the House.·",25
15,Ms HENZELL,PRIVILEGE,"It is always very encouraging to speak on a bill that has the bipartisan support of House. Very often we are in a confrontationist position with our colleagues on the other side and very often that is the community'S view of the parliament. In many instances, including the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill that we are debating today, a very positive position is taken by all parties in the debate. I hope that the wider community hears about these debates. It was pleasing to see that the debate on genital mutilation got some good press coverage. 1I have listened with interest to my colleagues' contributions. I am very pleased to support this bill. I applaud the Minister Justice (Mr Kerr) and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) for this legislation. We can be immensely proud of this government's law reform agenda, particularly in relation to human rights, to the rights of families, women and children, and to the protection of the innocent. The principal aim of the bill is to provide a real and enforceable deterrent to the sexual abuse of children outside Australia by Australian citizens and residents. This is groundbreaking work and we. are taking an international leadership role in this area. Essentially, this bill is looking to provide deterrent to two categories of people who feed off the 'sick' industry of sexually abusing children from overseas countries: firstly, the perpetrators of these insidious acts and, secondly, those people or organisations who promote, organise and profit from this. vile form of tourism-the child sex trade. What we are essentially talking about is one of the most vile forms of colonial exploitation. Colonialism, I believe, should be dead and buried, but in this we can see a new form of colonial exploitation. .. Principally, the Philippines and Thailand are the foremost countries in which these sexual acts are carried out on vulnerable children by foreign tourists. As has been said by previous speakers, poverty and ignorance in the victim countries· contribute to this shocking trade. Other Asian nations such as China, Sri Lanka and Korea also have developing sex-based tourism industries which effectively exploit children. It is important to state that our foreign aid objectives are very important here. the We can assist in solving this problem in the countries of origin by making sure that the standard of living, which will include. effective population control strategies, is maintained. We are doing all we can to help our neighbours in this regard. It has been estimated that over one million children become· prostitutes each year, with many of those being in Asia. Many of these children are· forced into prostitution after being sold or abandoned by their parents who cannot afford to look after them. Others have been stolen from their villages. Some parents have been deliberately misled by traffickers for in the child sex trade and are unaware of the fate that awaits their children in the towns and cities where this trade is carried out. It would be fair to say that parents care for their children. We should have a more effective understanding of our Asian neighbours, their culture, their religions and their social organisation. Despite the unreliability of figures, most members in this House would be aware that a number of Australians have, for many years, knowingly· exploited children of overseas countries by their involvement in child sex a tours. This has been referred to by previous speakers. In several Asian nations Australians are major offenders in these practices. These people epitomise the ugly Australian stereotype and are truly the white trash of Asia. This should be seen as a national scandal. It does nothing to. improve our standing in the nations that we seek to effectively integrate our trading partners and friends in our area the world; It is no good for people to tum a blind eye and dismiss the activities of a minority of Australians because they are not happening our backyard. As we move towards greater economic and social ties with our Asian offence friends,· I would argue that these crimes against Asian children are taking place in our backyard. To continue our push towards Australia integration with Asia would be we are going to let some of our nationals get away with these practices. It would show an ignorance and lack of respect to our friends in the countries to our near north. As a selfpenalties respecting nation concerned about its internathis tional reputation, we cannot let this situation occur. I commend the Minister for Justice for his leadership in this area. The Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendiour, ment Bill is an internationally responsible piece of legislation similar to existing laws already introduced in Germany, Sweden and Norway. In fact, Australia is already earning an international reputation for doing somesupplementary thing about the problem. This legislation complements the strategy adopted by the Australian Federal Police of targeting travel agencies catering to paedophiles. It is importour ant to remember that illicit sex tourism international responsibility. Francois Lefort, a French priest and doctor who has dedicated his life to fighting child prostitution throughout the world, has said: This problem is not just Bangkok's, Colombo's, Manila's. It is Paris', Brussels', Rome's. I suggest that this problem is also Canberra'S and Australia's, and this bill concurs with those sentiments. The sexual exploitation children is in direct conflict with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the or Child which Australia ratified in 1990. It states: ... parties undertake to protect the child from forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. This UN convention alone compels Australia to act on the magriitude of the problem. Australia proudly played a key role in the development of the United Nations Convenimprisonment tion on the Rights of the Child. The Australoffence. as Ian government is committed to pursuing the of aims of that convention. This legislation is part of delivering on that commitment. The bill aims to achieve these ends by creating sexual offences relating to conduct in outside Australia by Australians, which will be punishable in Australia. It will be an to encourage, facilitate or profit from child sex tourism which may be committed in or out of Australia and will be punishable in provided there is a relevant associahypocrisy if tion with this country. All these offerices will have substantial penalties ranging from 10 to 17 years imprisonment or correspondingly high pecuniary if a company is involved. I think is very important because until we legis. late and provide penalties we are not sending a clear message that such behaviour is not to be tolerated. We condemn this sort of behavas is shown in our legislation. The bill has the support of all Australian jurisdictions through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. State and territory governments are also committed to providing legislation should any perceived gaps eventuate. It is a good example of the positive use of the external affairs powers of the constitution, which can forward national goals and is being used very is an effectively by this government. The bill creates prescribed sexual offences committed overseas against chi1dr-n under the . age of 16 and aggravated sexual offences where children are under the age of 12. years. The prescribed sexual offences are: engaging in sexual intercourse, maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment or 17 years for the aggravated offence; committing an act of indecency of on, or in the presence of, a child in the prohibited age ranges, 10 years imprisonment 12 years for the aggravated offence; inducing children to have sexual intercourse with others in the person's presence, 14 years all imprisonment or 17 years for the aggravated offence; and inducing children to commit, submit to or participate in, or be present while a third person commits acts of indecency on, or in the presence of, the person, 10 years or 12 years for the aggravated There are further offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The bill presents a number of challenges Australian legal conventions. These include: difficulties with obtaining overseas evidence; problems of the age of co-sent, which for the countries. purposes of this bill is set at 16; the age at which the aggravated offence of child sex abuse occurs, which this bill sets at under ensuring that the rights of the defendant not compromised-the bill is not a witch-hunt or an attempt to impose our will on other countries in the region-and difficult-to-detect offences in some countries due to the nature of law enforcement practices in those ries. I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) has chance suggested that this bill be sent to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on occupation, Legal and Constitutional Affairs and I underhave stand that the justice minister is prepared to rulers. support that. Overall, the bill highlights the need for cooperation between law enforceThis ment bodies in Australia and overseas continue the massive challenge of tackling this problem. Any finetuning that the standing committee can do will be welcome because obviously we want to have this bill optimally he says: drafted. I can appreciate that many people would still be unaware of the need to legislate in Australia fo confront problems created by child sex tours. It is still true that Australians would like not to have to face and confront the unpalatable facts of child sex exploitation in our own country. An historical conseof quence of Australia's past paternalistic society has encouraged some men to indulge their worse sexuality and their need to abuse their power in relationships not only with children in country but also with children in other countthese ries who are seen to have less of personhood due to our own igporance and O'Grady's material: racism. We cannot allow these practices to go unchallenged. Responsible Australians need to do everybodies of thing possible to reduce the number of Asian children entertaining two to four foreigners per night Resulting health statistics 50 per cent of Thai child prostitutes are assessed as being HIV-positive. Not only is. this gping to lead to alarming consequences to for the health, and welfare of those children, but it will spread the HIV. virus throughout Asia and into those colonial exploitative Whilst it would be fanciful to suggest that this legislation will wipe out child prostitu12; tion, it is a very important step to take reare sponsibility. As the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) said in her' speech before I began my contribution to the debate, we are talking about the abuse of power. As Ron O'Grady mentions in his material on the countsubject of child sex tourism: Tourism is the selling of dreams. It gives ordinary middle class people from Western nations .the to live like royalty. In their own country the tourist income and savings may appear modest and they may have a somewhat boring and servile but once they enter a poor country they the instant capacity to live as if they were . is nowhere. seen more clearly than into child prostitution. Thomas,an American paedophile, is a carpenter. He travels as a tourist to Thailand. and the Philippines as often as. he can afford to do so. In Bangkok, They have a warehouse full of young boys and you can do whatever you want with them. The meaning is clear. The tourist is plJrchasing a slave for his own use. For a few hours the slave can be required to do whatever the tourist master desires and the child ceases to have any rights in the relationship. This form modem slavery naturally opens the door to all forms of sadism .. I think this is one of the forms of exploitation of foreign children in that because of ignorance and racism it this allows an absolute abuse of power, which people know is not tolerated in their a own country. I quote further from Ron On January 31 1984 fire broke out in a brothel in Phuket province in the south of Thailand. Firemen sifting through the ashes were shocked to find the five young girls, burned to death because they were chained to their beds and could not escape. One of the girls had been bought from her are that parents for $200. This sort of shocking abuse is happening all over South-East Asia. It will do nothing to forward the economic future of those countries or our reputation if Australian nationals are, as they are-and it is well knowntaking part. I quote further from the material: There are villages in north east Thailand where it is hard to find any children at all. Parents in some cases are sel1ing their children from the earliest years. There was a public outcry in 1990 when a Thai newspaper reported that a pregnant young woman in the north had sold her child into prostitution even before the little girl or boy was born. This is not. an indictment on this particular woman; it is an indictment on the alamling poverty in these countries which leads to such situations. I refer back to the speech of my colleague the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) on the involvement of Thai culture in this tourism. O'Grady suggests that widespread prostitution really developed as a consequence of the Vietnam War. O'Grady says that by the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 the sex industry had become firmly established. But the end of the war also raised questions about the future of several million people whose livelihood had been built around the inflow of American war dollars. Two things started to emerge at this time. The first was the growth of a large indigenous sex trade. Thai men who had not been particularly avid customers of brothels in earlier history suddenly began to cultivate a new lifestyle. Tens of thousands of out of work prostitutes became available to Thai men, even in the poorer suburbs. Older and handicapped prostitutes began to sell their bodies for as little as a few cents. Now it has been claimed that 450,000 Thai men visit a prostitute every day. So it would appear that this is a relatively new historical phenomenon in Thailand and the result of a very unfortunate episode in Western history in Asia; one of the side effects of one of the last colonial exploitations in South East Asia, the Vietnam War. With the recent visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Asia and the opening of the new friendship bridge we have a very important opportunity to gain a significant reputation as a friend to our Asian neighbours. This legislation sends another clear signal into Asia that we respect Asian people, that we regard them as our friends and that we will not tolerate our nationals exploiting Asian people, who are going to be our friends and colleagues in the future.",28
16,Mr ADAMS,PRIVILEGE,"I rise to support the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994. The amendments to the Crimes Act clarify the government's position, which is to ensure that Australhm citizens and residents who sexually exploit children overseas will face prosecution under Commonwealth law if apprehended in Australia. It will also be illegal for members of the tourist industry to help those exploiters .achieve their sick objectives. It appears that although Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 to fulfil Australia's domestic obligations, now there is a need to respond to the appalling behaviour of some Australians overseas. Studies have shown that Australian tourists have been identified as significant sexual abusers of children overseas, particularly in Asia. In the Third World there are an estimated 800,000 underage prostitutes in Thailand; 400,000 in India; 250,000 in Brazil; and 60,000 in the Philippines. The newest areas to become involved are Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and China. While in the philippines last year the Australian ambassador spoke of the 'ugly Australians', as he called them. He told me how they arrived in Manila with the sole purpose of exploiting young women and children of the area. Sometimes it was in the disguise of taking a wife, but when the same person has been back three. or four times it is hard to feel anything but disgust and shame for our fellow Australians. Prostitution is an age-old profession and provided there are strict rules to ensure the safety, health and dignity of the women involved there is little that can be done to prohibit the activity in some countries; It may be the only way uneducated women can find some form of employment to feed their families. However, when it comes to selling children from poor families into slavery and these kids then become objects for sale to tourists, it becomes sick and alarming. It is har? to imagine that we have ordinary Austrabans from all sorts of backgrounds setting off to buy child sex from agencies in such countries as Thailand, the Philippines and other parts of Asia. So much for our image as a c1ean, green country, as reliable business partners or as a socially just society. This shows our other side as Western dominators _our suspected superiority over other cultures: our - acism that lurks beneath our benign extenors. We are really kidding ourselves. I am sad to think that this legislation is needed in Australia, but I know that it is from hearing from our ambassadors and trade people oversees, from reading the exposes in various magazines and newspapers. We are no better than the Japanese, western Europeans or the Americans when it comes to child prostitution. People both in this country and overseas are making a fortune out of it leaving the youngsters involved with little no money, sick and dying, and slaves to their own poverty. Once the young are in the - usiness there is little or no way out, except m a coffin. Similar laws to this one, I understand, are being c-ns.idered in Germany and may have only a hmlted effect, but they are important from a moral point of view and say something about us as a country. This law will mean we are taking responsibility for our own citizens' behaviour overseas. It will act as some sort of dete-ent and will be the first step towards so-vmg !he problem of people targeting children m less developed countries. But we need to do more. We need to assist these countries to provide better working co-d.itions for their people, better pay and trammg, better health and education can break away from having to sell their children .to survive. Ron O'Grady, international coordmator for a Bangkok based campaign' to end child prostitution-my colleague the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) quoted him on several occasions in her speech-seems to have a lot of information and seems to be one of the leaders in this area of understanding the situation. He stated in an artic1e: In-idents are - ecomi!lg increasingly prevalent in ASia but only In certain selected countries. Tourists are obviously careful about the places they visit for sexual purposes and their choice has been governed to a large ex!ent by the reputation of the country for tolerance In sexual matters. Poor countries have an obvious attraction for paedophiles fromaftluent countries. Children and their parents are more desperate for money and are therefore easy targets for procurers. The government has greater priorities than the fate of a few thousand street children and police will often tum a blind eye to events in exchange for a supplement to their meagre wages. Hence one of the major problems that I saw in Asia: lowly paid and poorly trained police forces. While there is a market and the police are part of the pay-off, there will be no great change; Everything becomes a commodity, even the human beings. This situation has to change and these amendments to the crimes law are only one way that Australia can take responsibility for its own Citizens. I hope 0; Germany goes down the same path and that all other countries who are known to have tourists seeking this sort of gratification also seek to change their laws to give the same recognition as we have. But this is only the tip of the iceberg and we need to deal with the poverty these countries face. We need to get rid of the need for families to sell their children into slavery. The underlying reason why they sell their children is poverty. If we do that, then the rest of the chain can be easily broken and they can move towards a more just society. I commend the bill and commend my colleague the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) for bringing this biII into the parliament. I understand it will be referred to a committee to be looked at even further. I hope it is not too long before the bill comes back into the so they House and is passed. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders . Motion (by Mr Kerr)-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Minister for Justice from moving a motion to refer the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration and an advisory report. Reference to Committee",31
17,Mr KERR,PRIVILEGE,"I move: That: (1) the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 be referred to the Standing tee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration and an advisory report; and (2) the committee present its report to the by 30 May 1994. In so moving, let me acknowledge that the suggestion of this course of action was initiater ed by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Wilpoverty liams), who proposed to me that we might use this quite unusual mechanism to allow the House to undertake a close examination this bill and to trial the process through House committees, which processes are at cerned present more customarily conducted in the Senate. Previously such a suggestion has been tome and I indicated that, subject to receivinternational ing suitable understandings in relation courses of the Senate, I would be content with that course. I have spoken to Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats, who has bill indicated that he is content not to refer this bill again to a Senate committee should it be subject to examination in the· House. He, any case, proposed that his specific concerns be addressed in debate and discussion in the Senate sitting as the Senate. Being so sured and with the shadow Attorney ing that the opposition is content that its concerns be addressed through this process; I am pleased to be able to facilitate this procedure. I regard this process as somewhat of It has some novelty, but I thInk we will test the goodwill and approach of members on both sides of this House. I hope that the very obvious public concern· that has been maniwill fested by speakers on all sides of the House in relation to this matter also in the committee and that we are able to deal with the bill expeditiously upon its return. .I certainly look forward to members of House being able to progress the bill before the end of this session and for the Senate to be able to deal with it in the same session so that it can become law without delay. I commend the speakers who have addressed this subject in the course of the debate. Both in the. House and watching the debate on closed circuit television, I have been impressed by the sincerity and obvious concern Commitof members on both sides of the House. I note the comments that have been made House by a number of speakers, including the last speaker, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), that this issue also raises broadsocial questions about how Australia can most effectively deal with international and the way in which people in many countries are induced into the sale of their children or their own exploitation in this of pernicious trade. These are matters with the which this government has very much con:itself. In that context, I also note the work that Brian Burdekin, the human rights commissioner, is undertaking on behalf of the put international community to ensure that the community has this whole issue to the quite high on its agenda. With those few remarks, I commend this process to the House. I look forward to the returning on 30 May with suggestions for such improvements as the committee sees fit. I flag now that the government will not resile in from its determination to proceed on these matters and to ensure that the interests of innocent children overseas are not abused by reaspaedophiles in the manner that this bill indicatproposes to prevent.",33
18,Mr COSTELLO,PRIVILEGE,"Higgins) (11.32 a.m.)We will support the motion. As the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) said, this request came initially from the shadow Attorney-General, a trial. the honourable member for Tangey (Mr Williams). The minister has taken it up and moved the motion. We commend him for it. It is an example of cooperation which I hope lead to the thorough vetting of legislation and eventually, if necessary, the improvement carries through of legislation. . As has been made clear throughout the debate, those on this side·of the House conthis sider this trade an appalling business. We support the principle of the legislation, which is to halt it and halt the involvement of Australian citizens in it. We also think important, however, that since it has wide repercussions in relation to applying law external territories-an action done in foreign countries-it be thoroughly· investigated that all questions of proof and evidence and the protection of the legal process be looked at by the committee. When it is looked at the committee, the legislation should be such that it can achieve its aims, which, after are to bring to an end the involvement of Australian citizens in appalling practices overseas.. We commend the Minister for Justice for taking the course that he has. We will be supporting the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994' Consideration resumed' from 3 May. Second Reading",33
19,Mr OKEEFE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends seven acts, five of which are administered within the transport portfolio and two of which are administered within communications and the arts portfolio. Most of the amendments are of a technical nature and represent a finetuningand clarification provisions of various acts administered within the portfolio. The amendments do not introof duce substantial new policy schemes, although some of the amendments introduce minor policy initiatives. I will not deal with . minor technical amendments in this speech, but will instead concentrate on each of more significant amendments in turn. Amendments of the Air Navigation Act 1920 All of Australia's bilateral air services agreements and arrangements embody an obligation that 'substantial ownership and effective control' will reside in the nationals of the contracting party. The agreements generally provide authority for a contracting state to withhold, revoke or suspend operating it is permission if the party which has made the designation cannot demonstrate that its desigto nated airline or airlines meet n.ational ownership and control tests. Australia is b()Und and under the Chicago Convention to supply to other contracting states and/or the International Civil Aviation Organisation information by concerning the ownership and control of any particular aircraft registered in Australia and all, conducting international air services. It is common practice in other countries to either exclude, or limit the extent of, foreign ownership in airlines. The government's decision to limit equity holdings by foreign airlines in Australia's international airlines to 35 per cent in aggregate and to 25 per cent by a single foreign airline was announced on 22 December 1992. The object of the amendments in this bill is to enable the government to ensure that any Australian carrier seeking designation or already designated on an international route can demonstrate its compliance with bilateral requirements that it is substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals. Amendments of the Australian and Overseas Tel-communications Corporation Act 1991 . The bill. will change the name of the Austhe tralian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991 to the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to reflect a change in the name of of the company under section 382 of Corporations Law of the ACT. While the application the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act to the company was unaffected by the change of the company's the name, alignment of the name of the act with the name of the company. will avoid any the confusion on the part of the public. The company continues to trade in Australia as 'Telecom Australia' and internationally as 'Telstra OTC Australia'. There are a number of consequential changes to the act consequential upon the name change of the company. Schedule 3 of the bill amends a number of other acts not within the transport and communications portfolio consequential upon the change of name. Amendments of the Navigation Act 1912 The Navigation Act is amended to consolidate into one section a number of provisions that allow exemptions to be granted from the requirement to comply with the act. Those provisions were inserted into the Navigation Act at various times, and there is some overlap between the provisions. .Six existing sections in the Navigation Act are being combined by this bill into one section to provide that the minister or the Australian Maritime Safety Authority may exempt a person or a vessel from the operation of specified provisions of the act. The amendment of section 377L will ensure that there is a right of review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision not to grant an exemption or to grant· an exemption subject to conditions. Clause 4 of the bill will ensure the continued validity of any existing exemptions. Amendment of marine pollution legislation This bill amends two acts which deal with marine pollution issues. In brief, the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 will provide that any loss, damage, costs or expenses incurred by the Australian· Maritime Safety Authority in performing its obligations to combat pollution in the marine environment will be able to be recovered at law. Secondly, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 will be amended to explicitly state that the act extends to the exclusive economic zone and to provide for t,he detention of foreign ships which are suspected of or have actually committed a pollution breach in the territorial sea or in Australia's exclusive economic zone. Detailed safeguards are provided to ensure that any detention is consistent with the requirements of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and that any detained ship will be released with the minimum of delay after investigations and any necessary subsequent action have been completed or appropriate financial security provided. Amendment of. Telecommunications Act 1991 The bill makes a minor amendment to the Telecommunications Act 1991 to implement the government's decision that the Indian Ocean territories-Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands-are to be treated as part of Australia for the purposes of Commonwealth law. The amendment is consequential upon a 1992 amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act which provided that Australia include Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This minor amendment to the Telecommunications Act is the only amendment to the act necessary to implement the decision. It requires external territories to which the universal service obligation does not extend to be prescribed. The universal service obligation provides that access to and supply of the standard telephone service and payphones must be provided throughout Australia. Currently the obligation specifically does not apply in the external territories to which the act extends. The amendment will ensure that the universal obligation applies to the Indian Ocean territories. The measures contained in this bill are expected to have no significant effect on Commonwealth revenue or expenditure. However, the amendments to tJ:!e Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 will provide more surety that costs of combating pollution can be recovered. Details of the minor technical amendments in the bill, which I have not referred to in this speech, are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House.",34
20,Mr SHARP,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I rise on behalf of the opposition as shadow minister for transport with special responsibilities for surface transport in Australia-that is, shipping, roads, the waterfront and rail. My colleague the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) will be speaking after me to represent the opposition in the aviation matters that have been outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe). This is an issue that I have had a lorig and genuine interest in over the five years that I have been looking after this portfolio on behalf of the federal coalition. It brings me a great deal of pleasure to see the parliament of Australia, the government of this country, moving in the direction that we are moving in, and have been for some time now-that is, to try to tidy up a number of important issues relating to our maritime industries. These are issues that relate to the safety of ships at sea and to the protection of our marine environment. All of them are terribly important to Australia, our being a major maritime trading nation. I think we have the fifth largest maritime task in the world. Of course, we have one of the largest coastlines in the world, and that needs to be protected. In particular, we have some of the most famous parts of the world's coastline around the Great Barrier Reef. All of them are very important tourist income earners for Australia, and they need proper protection. This bill adds to those bills that have preceded it in this House over the last year or two. It further protects the Australian maritime environment, our coastline, and tightens up some areas of ship safet-. For my part, the opposition will not be opposing the bill, as we have not opposed, and indeed have supported; so many of these bills over recent times. As I have said on other occasions, whilst I am responsible for this area. of the federal opposition's interests, we will always support sensible, reasonable, rational legislation that improves safety at sea and improves our ability to protect our maritime environment and our coastline. This is an area of genuine bipartisan support. I think the people of Australia can rest assured that what can be done is being done. We are prepared to accept government initiatives. Likewise, we would like to think that the government would accept sensible, rational and reasonable propositions that are put forward from this side of the House in this area. Over time we have put forward a number of reasonable propositions. I would like to see those picked up by the government in legislation. I now turn to the aspects of the bill that relate to my portfolio. The first is the Navigation Act 1912. There are some minor amendments tidying up the act. The industry regardS these as sensible, and so do we. The second aspect of the bill that is pertinent to me involves the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993. There is a minor amendment enabling the Governor General to make some regulations. As has often been the case in recent times, it raises the question of why it was omitted from the original act,. which was passed through this parliament just last year. We so often see legislation introduced into the Hou!!e and within a matter of months or a year or so it is brought back for some tidying up. Whilst we cannot get everything right all the time, it does raise the fact that we need to be more careful in the drawing up of these bills to ensure that we do not have to take up the time of the parliament, which is at a considerable cost to the taxpayer of Australia, in overcoming minor amendments like this which reflect shortfalls in the drafting of legislation. The third aspect involves the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981. This provides for recovery of loss, damages, costs or expenses incurred by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in the combat of pollution. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is the body that looks after all of Australia's maritime regulations. It looks after navigation equipment, navigation aids and all those things that are important to the maritime industry in Australia. It operates through a cost recovery process. Whatever costs it incurs on behalf of the government, the government has to pay for. It runs like a normal business, but it has a very important task. In light of that, this amendment will now enable it .to recover any costs or damages incurred by it through its role of combating pollution at sea. This is very important because any pollution caused at sea can run into very large dollars. . As people will remember, probably the most spectacular pollution at sea incident in Australia in recent years was the break-up of the ship Kirk; off the Western Australian coastline, when the bow of the ship fell off and oil poured out into the water. The cost of cleaning that up and rescuing the crew and all those other things can be and should be recovered. This legislation ensures that is so. It can run into tens of millions of dollars and in some instances even hundreds of millions of dollars. Probably the most spectacular internationally known oil pollution incident occuued with the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound a few years ago. I think· the cost involved in tidying that up ran to about a billion dollars overall. So we are not talking about a. little bit of pocket money here. It is very substantial. This bill enables AMSA to pick up any costs it has incurred in that area. The Australian Chamber of Shipping, whi-h primarily represents foreign flag vessels, was concerned that AMSA's right of recovery would be limited to recovery from parties proven responsible for a pollution breach under legislation and that this would obviate the need to draw on funding through the oil pollution levy. It was concerned to know whether this was the case. In fact, it is the case. Not so long ago, this parliament, supported again by the opposition, passed legislation enabling Australia to contribute to the i'nternavessel tional compensation fund. Funds are paid into this international fund by all ship operators around the world. If there is a major oil spill or some form of pollution at sea, the cost of cleaning it up can be recovered from that fund. What we are doing here enables us to bypass calling on the international compensation fund and go directly to the person who it is proven is responsible for the cause of pollution and charge him or her for the cost of it. This means that the cost of cleaning up pollution at sea can be focused right back onto the people responsible rather than being a burden on the iriternational shipping community at large. The fourth aspect relevant to my responsibilities is the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. This provides for the detention of foreign flag vessels suspected of violations within Austral. Ian territorial waters. Some representations from the. Australian Chamber of Shipping expressed concerned about some aspects of this. We referred the matter to a Senate committee. Our colleagues in the other place established a committee to look into this particular concern, and the Australian Chamber of Shipping representatives had a chance to outline their case there. It. was properly heard and the committee made its judgment. But the chamber felt that the legislation unfairly discriminates against foreign flag vessels by preventing them from sailing whilst Australian flag vessels are .free to trade on. The Chamber of Shipping made it clear that it did not seek to protect disreputable shipping operators but, rather, to ensure that the powers in the legislation were not used to detain foreign flag vessels while investigations were carried out to determine the cause of a pollution incident. It is worth noting that, whilst foreign flag vessels-if they are suspected of causing pollution in Australian waters-could be detained at port whilst tests are carried out to see who is actually responsible for the cause of pollution, Australian flag vessels are not detained. There is a good reason for this: Australian flag vessels technically never leave Australian jurisdiction; whereas a foreign flag within a couple of hours steaming time of a port can leave Australian jurisdiction and never return. Hence, if it is responsible for that pollution, we have no opportunity to recover the costs incurred in cleaning it up or to penalise those people for causing that pollution in the first place. Whilst it does seem on the surface to be unfair to foreign flag vessels, on balance, when one considers that that Australian flag vessels never leave Australian jurisdiction whereas foreign flag vessels can, then we would consider this aspect of the legislation to be reasonable. The Australian National Maritime Association, which is the body that represents Australian flag vessel owners and operators, pointed out that Australian flag vessels are already subject to stringent legislation domestically, and this legislation makes foreign flag vessels similarly liable. In the view of the Australian flag operators, this legislation puts Australian flag ships and foreign flag vessels on an even footing. ANMA argues that no responsible shipper would object to measures to protect waters from· ships poorly maintained and staffed, and that is a view that I have confirmed from my own experience. Most Australian shippers are aware of the down sides of bad publicity if some pollution occurs at sea, and they generally act very responsibly. It is not the case with every single shipper, but I think it is fair to say it is the case in general. The Chamber of Shipping agreed with that sentiment. Its concern was that undue delay not be imposed, and it wanted to ensure that any delays to the movement of member ships were avoided and to remove any inequity. It is worth noting that the legislation being brought into the House today is in line with provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. About 80 countries around the world adhere to this particular law making Australian vessels subject to the same provisions and the same supposed inequities in non-Australian ports. So, on balance, my colleagues in the opposition and I think that this is a fair amendment to the legislation and that it is the only way to maintain jurisdiction, since none applies to a non-port state flag vessel once it has left the jurisdiction of a port state. The Senate committee shared ACOS's concerns that unnecessary delay should not result. It did not extend that concern to poorly maintained vessels but it felt, as I think most people would feel, that poorly maintained vessels should have the wrath of God brought down upon them whereas others should not. I think the Senate committee probably reflected the general view in the community. The committee said that AMSA will have to put in place a very efficient system for the collection and analysis of samples. In the case of vessels that have departed port, this could mean intercepting ships to obtain samples. The committee also said that AMSA must streamline the system of securing financial responsibility through P&I clubs and that it should be possible to arrange for samples to be obtained without having vessels return to port. Interestingly enough, the AMSA witnesses at the committee confirmed that return to port would be required only in an extreme case. The committee observed that this should be the case even where a number of ships are being investigated for a breach, even if they are still in port. So delay need not occur and, indeed, in most cases should not occur. The committee found that there was no basic inequality in the provisions of the legislation. The committee did, however, say it would watch the progress of investigations under the legislation and would respond to any industry representations that· are made about unusual or lengthy delays resulting in ships being detained. So it is a matter of saying, 'Let's try it and see how it is works and, if unreasonable delays are being incurred by foreign flag vessels, perhaps that will be a chance to look at it again.' But, given the assurance that AMSA has offered us, we are satisfied at this stage to let AMSA prove that it will detain vessels only in extreme circumstances. If that is the case, then we will be very happy with that. This bill is a piece of legislation which we think, on balance, is worthwhile and, therefore, we will be supporting it. Ultimately, it will only add further to Australia's excellent reputation as a maritime nation. The Australian flag industry is renowned throughout the world as being a reputable one. We are fast gathering a reputation for being tough on ships of shame, as they are now commonly called; and AMSA is gaining a reputation for being able to pick up a number of these ships that are not up to standard, although from time to time ships do sneak through the net. Indeed, . even the Kirki slipped through the net. If memory serves me right-I am sure if I am wrong my colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) will point it out-AMSA even inspected the Kirki before it sank and found it to be up to scratch, even though it obviously was not. So, from time to time, things do go wrong but AMSA is doing a reasonable job. I think all of us would like to see more inspections undertaken by AMSA to ensure that as many vessels as possible are inspected to enable us to be satisfied that few ships slip through the net. As I have said, we have a very high standard here in Australia but it is worth making· the point, as I have made on other occasions, that safety and proper operating procedures are only the product of a viable shipping industry. It is absolutely important that, whether we' are talking about shipping, aircraft, road transport or whatever, safety depends upon the viability of the industry. One of the craziest things that I have seen go through this parliament in recent times was the decision made by this government in the last bQdget to increase the excise on fuel. particularly hit hard for the Australian shipping industry. Bunker oil had the excise on it almost, but not quite, doubled. Some late negotiations reduced the proposed new excise, but there was a huge increase in cost to the Australian shipping industry. If memory serves me right again, there was an increase of about $287,000 per vessel per year as a result of the fuel excise increase, when on the same day as the budget the shipping industry had just completed its latest round of reforms reducing crew sizes, saving it $217,000 per vessel per year. So here we have Australian shipowners making a genuine attempt to reduce their costs, to make them genuinely internationally competitive, to enable them to have an industry with a future, to enable them to offer people who work within that industry a job in the long term. all being done by the industry in a most satisfactory fashion-and the government in its budget statement taking away all of that advantage the industry had just created for itself, and some, by loading an extra excise on bunker oil, whacking up the cost of running the average ship around Australia to the tune of about $287,000 a year. That is stupid and I think my colleagues on the other sideparticularly those who take an interest in this area, like the honourable member for Throsby and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris)-though they may not agree with me publicly, would agree with me in their own hearts that that is a silly thing and the government should be condemned for doing it. It is worth making the point in these sorts of debates that, if we are to be talking about ship safety, occupational health and safety and proper operating procedures on Australian vessels, then we must take into account the ability of Australian shipowners to operate their businesses viably. Decisions like. the one we saw in the last budget hinder that process and only harm Australia's capacity to have a world renowned high standard of safety within its shipping industry. They therefore also reduce our a:bility to protect the Australian coastline because, if we cannot afford the best safety procedures and the best operating This procedures, one of these days one of our ships will run up onto the reef and do a great deal of damage to the reef, our tourism industry and our international reputation. It is silly to treat the Australian shipping industry as some sort of cargo cult mentality. We have to look at the viability of it; we have to stop increasing taxation on the industry; and, if we do that, we have to ensure that the industry will respond, as it has done in the past, by maintaining very high standards so that we can protect Australia's coastline, protect Australian seamen who operate in our coastal vessels and protect Australia's reputation as a country which is clean and healthy and a great tourist destination with a very reputable shipping industry.",35
21,Mr HOLLIS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to join in this debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) invited me to make a correction, which I will do in the spirit in which I was invited to. It was not so much AMSA that made the inspection of the Kirki; rather it was the German Classification Society that gave the Kirki its clean bill of health. As I have done before in this chamber, I publicly state that I agree with what the honourable member for Hume, who has just resumed his seat, said about the levy on fuel. The government made a most unfortunate to do decision in the last budget. We are one week away from the next budget, and let us hope that levy will be dropped. But I have no argument with what the honourable member for Hume said about the impact of that levy and the other comments he made. I am not ashamed to publicly state that I am ·in total disagreement with my own party with respect to that measure it took in last year's budget. As has been pointed out, this is an omnibus bill which will make a number of largely non-contentious amendments to legislation administered by the transport and communications portfolio. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) has pointed out, the principal amendments will be to provide the minister with the power to require divestiture of foreign airline shareholdings in an Australian international airline where those shareholdings exceed 35 per cent of the total value of the issued share capital or in an individual foreign airline which has shareholdings exceeding 25 per cent; to provide for the recovery of any loss, damage, cost or expenses incurred by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in combating certain pollution discharges or disposals; and to provide for the detention of foreign vessels suspected of causing maritime pollution in an Australian port or Australian territorial sea exclusive economic zone. I thought the honourable member for Hume made an important point when he explained how important it was to detain foreign vessels, as opposed to Australian vessels, which are always detained here as they are always in Australian waters. I have no argument with that. During the debate, I will mainly confine my comments to the amendments dealing with navigation and the amendment dealing with marine pollution legislation. Given that we are an island continent with thousands of miles of coastline and a nation more dependent than most on sea traffic for our imports and exports; we have been remarkably free of marine pollution. I have said before in this chamber that this is more through luck than anything else,especially considering that much of the trade to and from Australia is currently traversing through our prime tourist attraction, the Great Barrier Reef. It is appropriate that we are debating this issue at the very time that there is a push in some quarters to sell off the Australian National Line. If we as a nation are short-sighted enough to sell off the ANL, we will need this legislation much more than ever before; By selling off the ANL, we will be opening our sea lanes up to the rust buckets of the world. Much has been written in recent years about the threat to our coastline by oil spills. We have seen dramatic film footage of the Kirki incident to reinforce this. It had the potential to not only pollute much of the coast of Western Australia but also wipe out the crayfish industry in that area. Perhaps an even greater danger to our coastline and our marine environment is posed by the operation of ships carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk. We do not hear very much about this. I suppose we hear a lot about oil spills, as they are very visible. If something happens, there is often dramatic footage, as there was in the case of the Kirki incident. But there are ships in somewhat disgraceful condition which are plying up and down the Australian coast carrying all sorts of liquids which are posing perhaps an even or greater danger than that posed by oil pollution. Despite reports such as Ships of shame, in many cases the condition of shipping is getting worse. This is because we are not building replacement ships and, consequently, the world's shipping fleet is ageing. So what is Australia's response to the economic,social and environmental challenge of the world's ageing fleet? Some are proposing that we opt out; that we sell off our national line. Honourable members can be assured that, as soon as we sell off the ANL to overseas interests, other Australian flags will also opt out. For example, the BHP fleet could be owned by Hong Kong interests, registered in Cyprus and flying the Cyprus flag, with Greek officers and a crew which is a mixture of Burmese and Filipinos. These well-maintained and well-crewed ships would decline. Not to put too fine a point 011 it, it would be an act of economic stupidity to sell off the ANL. It would diminish our standing in the international shipping forum. The honourable member for Hume made much of Australia's standing in the international forum, and I agree with him. Australia has a good reputation amongst maritime nations. We are regarded as being rigorous-some say that we are overly rigorous-in inspecting foreign ships coming here. Our Australian flagships are of a high standard. I believe that our reputation has been enhanced by the recommendations of the Ships of shame report, the majority-not allof which have been accepted by the government. But what will happen to that reputation if we sell our fleet? lt is essential, in my view, that we maintain the ANL as an Australian owned, Australian flagged and Australian crewed shipping line where people are employed under Australian standards and conditions. I make no apology for saying that. I will fight with all my ability to see that that is maintained. Are we prepared to put the future of our trade in the hands of foreign shipping interests? Make no mistake: if we sell off the ANL, this is what we will be doing. Instead of talking about selling off ANL, we should be talking about investing in more Australian ships. If we were really serious about protecting the Australian maritime environment, there would be no talk of selling off ANL. We are more likely to be able to protect our environment if we are dealing with our own registered flagged and crewed ships. I note that there are recommendations in the proposed legislation about payment for the maritime damage. I .have some worry about who would actually pay for the damage. I know the legislation makes specific recommendations. These recommendations are fine as long as the money is there. When we talk about a major environmental disaster, many millions of dollars are involved. Today, with the international markets' as they are, it is often difficult to find out who owns a ship or a cargo. Ships and cargoes are traded on the international exchange like anything else. W.e often find that someone might own part of a cargo or a ship or have an interest in part of a ship for a journey or part of a journey. I remember people telling me about a ship which. almost went down in Norway. The only words the captain had' as the ship was going down were, 'Big problem, big problem.' The authorities in Norway were trying to find out who owned the ship, but they could not find out. The only thing they could find was a fax number in Tokyo: This is the sort of thing that we are increasingly facing in international shipping today. The days when families owned the ships, treated the crew as part of the family and had a certain pride in maintaining standard- and crewing have gone. Today ships and cargoes are traded. If someone owns part of a ship for part of a journey and that ship happens to go down and pollutes the Australian coastline during that person's part of the journey, who will pick up the tab? I know who it will be. lt will be the Australian taxpayers. Those ships that are registered with a fax number in Tokyo make things very difficult. I know that we live in a technological age, but it is very difficult to get compensation out of a fax number. During recent years I have personally inspected much of the substandard shipping detained around Australia. Members of the committee that produced the Ships of shame report were made familiar not only with the conditions of ships but with the appaIHng conditions the crews have to work under: starvation wages,-and sometimes no wages at all-lack of food, physical and often sexual abuse. It is a: sorry . state of affairs. These ships are traversing the sea lanes around Australia. If we talk to the people in ports such as Newcastle or Port Kembla they would be able to repeat these stories. If we talk to the chaplains from the Missions to the Seamen, as I have many times-in fact, I am on the board of the Missions to the Seamenthey would confirm the conditions that many of the crew members, who are often from Third World countries, have to survive under. . If people doubt that the Australian coastline is. under threat they have only to recall that late last year the Indian registered ship APJ Anand travelled from Albany in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland where on inspection it was found to have 147 defects-and they were only the serious ones. I was asked to go to Gladstone, which I did, and I attempted to inspect the ship but I was refused permission to go on board. I have . spoken to the people who have been on board and I most certainly had a look at the ship from the. outside. It was in an appalling condition. This legislation is being brought into make sure that if those ships do go down, or do pollute the Australian coastline, they can be traced to the owner-not that it would be too hard to trace the APJ Anand. This is the sort of shipping that many are trying to open the Australian coastline to. There is also another issue in regard to shipping that, although not specifically covered in this legislation, is an issue that I not think we have given nearly enough attention to: the disposal of the ballast water costs. that many of these ships bring to Australia. There has already been danger. There has been great damage done to the oysters in Twofold Bay in New South Wales where the ships come in from Japan to pick up our woodchip and take it back. In Twofold Bay they dispose their ballast water, which was picked up from Tokyo harbour or from wherever they picked it up, carrying all sorts of organisms which get into the oysters. People have told me about the conditions of the oysters now in Twofold Bay - It .is yet another example of why we should not be exporting our woodchip. I do not think that as a nation, as a parliament, or even as a government, we have given enough attention as to how ballast water is disposed of and the dangers that it is posing to the Australian coastline and to the marine environment. We have been very fortunate in _Australia that we have not had a major maritime disaster. We have had no Exxon Valdez here nor have we had a Briar type experience, but we have had a few near misses-the most notable being the Kirki. Every time we debate this subject we bring it up. The danger with the Kirki was that it would have polluted a lot of the Western Australian coastline, and indeed wiped out the crayfishing industry in that area north of Perth. We have been lucky, but I wonder how much longer we can continue to rely on our good luck. We must keep our shipping lanes safe and indeed we must keep our shipping line. If we are foolish enough to sell off the ANL we will be opening the Australian coastline to the rust buckets of the world, and the number of these rust buckets will increase despite the Ships of shame report and all other similar reports. The number will increase for the sheer economic reason that replacement ships are not being built anywhere in the world. Anyone who knows anything about shipping will say that within eight to 10 years there is going to be a major shortage of shipping throughout the world and there is going to be a major shortage of seafarers-and we are talking about selling off our own national line do and the little bit of cargo that we carry. It is economic stupidity and must be resisted at all As other speakers have said,there is nothing terribly contentious in this legislation. It has given me a chance to present some of my other hobbyhorses, though. I have plea-ure in commending the legislation to the House.",39
22,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"There are seven acts within this Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill that are subject to our scrutiny-today and it is !lly intention to concentrate on one, the Air Navigation Act 1920, as it falls within the responsibility of my shadow portfolio. While we have,already addressed the particular topic that is covered in this amendment in the Qantas Sale Act 1992, the opposition welcomes the additional amendment to make sure that Australia can enter into the world of international aviation competition with confidence that we will be able to maintain our services. It was on 12 February 1992 that we decided that we should introduce a scheme of multidesignation on Australia's scheduled airline services. There are bilateral arrangements which govern Australia's rights to designate Australian carriers for scheduled services. Each bilateral arrangement, to which Australia is a party, in fact includes a clause under which substantial ownership and effective control must be vested in the nationals of the country designating the airline or airlines. Under that particular clause the country to which a designated Australian carrier operates has the right to withhold, revoke or even suspend operating permission if Australia cannot demonstrate to the other country's satisfaction that its designated airlines meet national ownership and control tests. The object of these amendments is to enable the government to ensure that any Australian carrier seeking designation, or already desigthe nated on an international· route, can demonnegotiations strate its compliance with bilateral requireacquisition ments that it is substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals. This amendment in fact gives the minister the power to require information as to the shareholding of Australia's international airlines and the power to require a vesture foreign airline shareholding in an Australian international airline where equity held by foreign airlines and aggregate exceeds 35 per cent, or where equity by a single foreign airline exceeds 25 per cent. It is probably timely that this particular piece of legislation be passed by the House. I say that for a couple of reasons. Firstly, have already seen the sale of 25 per cent Qantas Airw-ys to British Airways. We are looking forward to the ultimate, although highly delayed, float of Qantas. The privatwe isationof the remainder of Qantas Airways does give foreign investors the opportunity come in. That is where the 35 per cent shut off point comes in. We were also interested to read in the few days of a possible arrangement between amendments. Ansett Airlines and the German carrier Lufthansa. It has been suggested in some press reports that Lufthansa might be taking some equity in Ansett Australia. If that happens, we will also have that double probI lem: we will have some foreign ownership of both major carriers, Ansett and Qantas. is also the possibility of a third international airline in Australia soon-if and when the funds can be arranged for that carrier to get off the ground and meet its obligations under the arrangements that have been International Air Services Commission-to service China. We have also seen evidence that some countries hold up the provisions of these arrangements very strictly indeed. The case comes to mind of the situation that developed with the privatisation of British Airways. Some major negotiation went on between British government and the United States government on the rights of British Airways to operate into the United States; at one stage the foreign shareholding had slightly exceeded 35 per cent mark. Also, there were major regarding the British Airways of a percentage of the US domestic and international carrier US Air. While I suppose one could suggest that they might have a little more to do with the bartering of air rights between the United States and Great Britain, .British Airways could have been of denied access to the United States if these procedures had not been under control. If we look around the world at the arrangements that are being made at the moment with the grouping together of airlines, at the commercial arrangements that are being made between numbers of foreign carriers, obviously there is room for some countries to object we to the access of particular carriers into their of country if these provisions are not met. Therefore, the opposition welcomes these amendments to the Air Navigation Act so that can make sure any Australian airline operating overseas has the capacity to meet to those obligations and thus avoid any situation where an Australian carrier is denied access to a particular country, otherwise we might be subjected to protracted negotiations. The last opposition welcomes and supports these",42
23,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"In speaking today to the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill, will concentrate on the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Preventio'1 of Pollution There from Ships) Act 1983. This, I am quite certain, has been one of the main topics that speakers have spoken on this morning, and rightly so. I want to concentrate on what is happening in Western Port Bay, which is very made by the relevant to this bill. Firstly, though, I agree with what the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said of the ANL shipping line. To sell off Australia's only shipping carrier would be ludicrous. I think it was the Bruce government which tried to do that back in 1929-30. It got nowhere then, and I do not believe it the will get anywhere now. We need our own shipping line. We are an island nation and it is important that we have our own ships, at least to know exactly what is going on in the shipping world with the transportation of our goods. We would be held to ransom if we did not have our own shipping line. The Shell-Mobil Crib Point terminal handling facility at Western Port Bay is used by many Australian or ANL boats. Back in 1992, lstarted to oppose the use by Shell and Mobil of the old BP site there. I wrote to the then Minister for the Arts, Sport and Environment, the honourable member· for Canberra (Mrs Kelly). A letter back from the then minister stated: Approval of the project rests almost entirely the Victorian Government, the only Commonwealth role being in the initial approval of the foreign investment for acquisition of the site. In ing that approval, the Treasurer has sought from the Commonwealth Environment Protection Authority, and has been made aware of the sensikilled tivities of Western Port Bay with regard to the RAMSAR sites. Ramsar, of course, is the agreement we have with overseas nations in relation to migratory birds. Briefly, what is happening at Crib Point is that Shell and Mobil are proposing to significantly increase the importation of heavy crude oil. for the refineries at Geelong and Altona. They intend to do this in tankers-not their own-of around about 150,000 tonnes. Those tankers will be brought into Crib Point, which is a deepwater port. There they will offload half of the oil and transport the rest it up Port Phillip Bay to their Altona Geelong refineries. The tanker traffic in the area will increase quite significantly. I think it is suggested an extra 60 to 70 tankers per year will Bass Strait and the confined waters of Westpoint ern Port Bay. If this proposal goes ahead, will mean there will be an extra 180 passages between Western Port and Port Phillip Bay. Given the increase in the number of tankers that will be used, the risk of accident happening must .also increase. The Bureau of Transport and Communicalegal tions Economics Report No. 70, Major marine oil spills: risk and response, 1991, concluded, amongst other things, that 'the probability one or more major oil spills occurring in Australian waters, from tankers, could much as 48 per cent in the next five years and 93 per cent in the next 20 years'. We are heading towards a 93 per cent risk of thing happening. Just imagine what would happen if one ·of these tankers went aground at The Nobbies at Phillip Island at the entrance to Western Port Bay. It is not unusual for ships to be wrecked there;· over the years many ships have been wrecked on theapproaches to Western Port Bay. Just around the corner from The Nobbies is a major Australian tourist attraction-the penguin parade. That is estimated to' bring hundreds of millions of dollars into the with Victorian economy-and, with Jeff Kennett there, we need hundreds of millions of dollars; we need every cent we can get. If it were considerwiped out-it could happen; we have had advice examples of hundreds of penguins being by oil spills just off the Otways-it would ruin this magnificent tourist attraction. It would destroy the economy of many people on Phillip Island and around Western Port Bay. I believe that it would even destroy the economy of Melbourne, because the Japanese tourists who flock to those particular penguin parades of a night would no longer go there. Therefore, the tourist trade would cease in Melbourne and on Phillip Island. That is why I am so adamant that· this expansion by Shell and Mobil should not go ahead. At the present time they have put it on of hold because of the pressure that has been put and on them by various groups throughout the community in. the Western Port area. Those groups have ,d-me a tremendous job, pointing that out the dangers to this huge conglomerate of use two oil companies. They are continuing to it out and I think they are winning. I it hope that Shell and Mobil withdraw from the tanker .proposal they are putting forward. I have asked continually that the minister request that an EIS be carried out in this area. an That has not happened because there have been all sorts of problems. But I believe that advice has been given which says that the minister can direct the oil companies to carry out an EIS. Their reason for not carryof ing it out is that they went into an existing facility which started off down there in the be as early 1950s and was used byBP. The MARPOL Convention, which deals with marine pollution, I do not believe allows somefor land based clean-up. MARPOL and the moneys which are connected to it will clean up the sea based pollution-that is. what is in the water-but what happens when it washes onto the land? Would that also be covered by this piece of legislation? Looking around the chamber, I can see some nods. lam glad to know that. I believe there should be a transportation levy placed on Shell and Mobil for shifting this fuel around. If they do go ahead with this proposed development and they shift fuel from Western Port to Port Phillip Bay there has to be a problem. There is a higher risk and therefore an oil levy should be placed on them, based on the amount of oil they transport. That would go into some trust fund, perhaps capped at a certain amount, say, $14 million or $15 million. When the contributions reach that level, then maybe the interest on that amount can be used for the Environment Protection Agency or for some research or something on the two bays. It is important that some fund is set up that can be used for rectifying any problem that occurs. I know that a fund is being set up at the present time, but if this goes ahead I would like to see a fund particularly for that eventudone ality.· The oil companies can afford it. I am .quite certain that another couple of cents on a tonne of oil would not break them, even though they would oppose it. Oil companies are actually. importing oil from overseas and we are exporting oil. We are exporting it because of export dollars and we are importing it and paying more. Why they should do this is beyond comprehension. I realise that different sorts of oil are needed for making tar, bitumen or some sort of heavy road material, for example, which I believe we do not have in Australia, but I cannot work out exactly why we are importing oil that we can produce in Australia. We have plenty of oil here in Australia; we are finding it all the time. It is to do with export dollars and our balance of payments, and so on. I think a lot of it is to do with profits for of our bigger oil companies. The other area I would like to talk about, mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby, is the marine ballast. There has been quite a lot of talk about that. Recent]y in Victoria there have been outbreaks of various red algae in Port Phillip Bay. We are particularly concerned about the starfish that have appeared in Tasmania. The larvae of these starfish were taken there by ballast water. It is believed that if they were to be transferred to Victoria, Victoria's commercial shellfish industry, which is worth approximately $35 million a year, could be destroyed. It is very easy for water to be transferred in the ballast of a ship. About 6,000 internationa] ships come to Australia every year and 120 million tonnes of ballast water comes into Australian ports each year. That is a huge amount of ballast water-120 million tonnes of water being pumped into our ports all around Australia. Anything can be in that water. There is this starfish. There is algae from places throughout the world. There is seaweed from places throughout the world. All of that is going into our water. Australia has this barrier of water all around it, but, stupidly, we are introducing water from other countries containing particular types of animals and flora which will destroy our own. A lot more work must be in this area to stop importation of these pests to our own waters . I have seen the television items about the starfish in Tasmania. Who knows where they are going to end up? They have started off down the Derwent River and are heading out to sea, so it is not too far to come across Bass Strait. Mr Lee....,.. They will be in Frankston!",43
24,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I do not want them in Frankston; we have to do something to stop them. How much money are we putting into have surveys done by the CSIRO and to stop that starfish menace? Are we taking concerted action? The most important time in a battle is the first couple of days. These things have been around for a couple of years. If we do not stop them soon, they will be out some of control and there will be no way to stop them. I think it is important that a lot of money be put into that. I think the people who should put the money in are the people who actually brought the pests here: the shipping companies, the oil companies and the woodchip companies. They all should be hit with a levy straight away and that money should be put into research to try to rectify the problem. The people .of Australia did not bring it in. I did not export any woodchips. I did not export any oil. It was the oil companies. They are getting the profits out of it and therefore they should rectify the problem. I would like that to be looked at fairly closely. I noticed an advertising supplement to the Australian Magazine of 26 March 1994 relating to oil spills. I read it and thought, 'Who is actually paying for this?' It was written in such a way that one would think those who produced it were having a go at the oil companies. But when I looked a bit closer I found that the people who actually paid for this are the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association; AMSA, the body set up by the oil companies to correct any spills; the Australian Marine Oil Spills Centre; Caltex; and the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. All of that goes to putting up this fairly neutral story on how oil spills are not really that bad, how they can be fixed and how we all should feel warm and fuzzy about them. The supplement contained a list of spills that have occurred over the years. In 1968 the Korean Star spilt 600 tonnes off Western Australia. The Al Qurain spilt 184 tonnes. The Arthur Phillip released a slick off Victoria killing 200 fairy penguins. A slick is what I was talking about before. Can one imagine, say, 20,000 tonnes, which would not be unreasonable from a 150,000 tonne tanker, being spilt into Western Port Bay? I wonder how many fairy penguins would be killed then. In 1991, the Sanko Harvest, wrecked off Esperance, lost 700 tonnes of oil and 30,000 tonnes of fertiliser. That should be a good mix for the ocean floor. The Kirki lost its bow in rough seas of Western Australia and spilt 17,280 torines. The Daishowa Maru, grounded in TWofold Bay lost 780 tonnes in 1992 and the Zera, ruptured by a tug in Spencer Gulf, lost 300 tonnes of oil. They give that as the total of the amount of oil that has been spilt on our coastline. One that they also point out, which is most important and which the petrol and oil companies do not pay for,. is that an estimated 16,000 tonnes of oil and petroleum products, equal to the biggest disaster in our history, are sluiced off our roads, driveways, parking lots and service stations and quietly released by industry or backyarq mechanics. So 16,000 tonnes every year is being poured off into our. creeks, our bays and then our oceans. Why should the petrol and oil companies not pay for this? Why should there not be a levy on them to fix this up? Why should we as consumers and users of the ocean and bays have to pay for the problems' they create? Esso in Western Port Bay did a nice little exercise recently. An article I have on. the subject entitled '''Disaster'' clean-up' stated: 'Esso workers fight mock spill to test emergency equipment.' The article reads: Esso workers snapped into action last ThursdayI bet they were not warned about this or anything like thatwhen the company staged a mock oil spill disaster to practice using its $10 million clean-up equipment. About 50 workers moved'swiftly to drag giant floating booms around arI oil tanker ... at ... Western Port Bay. . It was probably in the middle of the day, on a calm sea and they would have all been ready for it. I do not think oil spills happen in the middle of the day. I do not think they happen in calm seas. Western Port Bay has quite a strong tide. I bet this was done at a time when the tide was not running too hard. We are told these sorts of things to try to soften our thinking in relation to what will happen if one of these tankers goes aground in Western Port Bay. AMSA has a fairly large set-up, which is paid for by the oil companies, to try to solve the problems of oil spills. It claims that it can get anywhere in Australia within 24 hours, but it has not yet been tried. I would like to see the government stage a mock disaster somewhere and not tell AMSA about it to see how quickly it can get there. I do not think it will get there too quickly. The audit office is currently doing an audit report on AMSA. From what I have heard behind the scenes, there is a real concern about the effectiveness of AMSA to do an oil clean up. I am waiting breathlessly 'to hear what the audit report has to say about AMSA. The Auditor-General seems to be able to comment on anything these days and it will be interesting to hear what he has to say on that. I would like to touch on the imposition of fines on oil companies in relation to oil spills. In 1993 Shell was prosecuted. At the time the court case was under way, Shell was up for a fine of $125,000. Shell probably has a turnover of $125,000 a second throughout the world-I do not know; it is huge-so that fine would have been nothing. We have to have some decent teeth. If oil spills occur, we have to·have harsh penalties in place to make certain that companies remember what they have done and take steps to rectify it. Companies claim that they are doing these things and that they are spending some money, but I do not believe it is enough. A separate fund should be set up which puts a levy on all these oil companies. This will ensure that when they do breach regulations and there is a spill they pay for it. How much is one penguin worth? No-one can put a price on it. According to this article, it is worth a few hundred thousand dollars. (TIme expired)",45
25,Mr NEVILLE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I rise today to support the general thrust of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) and to join fellow members of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, even if I have to be a little critical of the government on some aspects of its policy. This is an omnibus bill. However, I wish to restrict my comments to the two protection of the sea amendments which were included in the hill. As already mentioned by previous speakers, while these amendments will ensure that foreign flag polluters or so-called ships of shame are held accountable while in Australian waters, I also wish to highlight today the ship safety anomaly which, if rectified, could stop polluters from being allowed to operate along our coastline in the first place. I appreciate what the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) said about the need to have some sort of trust fund. I understood that there was one in place. If we get to the root of the problem, rather than trying to fix up the mess at the end, we might be more effective. The amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 provide for the' recovery of losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in the exercise of its duties to combat pollution of the marine environment caused by a discharge or disposal from a ship. AMSA's right of recovery would be limited to those parties which have been proven responsible for a pollution breach. Quite rightly, ship owners should be responsible for all fonns of ·discharges from their vessels, from ballast waters, which, as the honourable member for Dunkley said, could contain hannful micro-organisms, to garbage and waste disposal and to fuel oil spills-all of which have a damaging impact on sensitive marine environments. The second set of amendments deals with the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and provides for the detention of foreign vessels suspected of causing marine pollution within Australian waters. The need for such detention powers over foreign ships can be seen in that the act allows legal action to be taken against Australian ships wherever they are. However, Australian jurisdiction over foreign vessels is limited to Australian waters only. AMSA should be given the power to detain foreign vessels that pollute, as Australian ships already face similar measures in foreign ports, including most EEC countries. Often the detention will only see the offending ship post a bond or security before sailing on-a sort of guarantee, if you like, until investigations are complete. I support the thrust of these matters. It is, I believe, all about responsibility and making sure that the culprits pay. There is too much at risk,. particularly in my electorate where there are busy ports operating on the doorstep of the Great Barrier Reef. As an example, let us take the port of Gladstone in Central Queensland, one of the most efficient and modem ports in Australia. Last financial year, 1992-93, it handled a record cargo throughput of 33.1 million tonnes valued at $2.8 billion, including 23.9 million tonnes of exports to 32 countries valued at $2.1 billion and imports from 12 destinations totalling 9.2 million tonnes worth $700 million. Almost 700 cargo vessels visited Gladstone last year, carting such diverse cargoes as coal, alumina, grain, cement clinker, petroleum products and caustic soda. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would recognise many of them as potentially deleterious to the Great Barrier Reef or coastal environments. These vessels must navigate at least part of the way through the Great Barrier Reef, which is not only a totally unique and pristine environmental marine park but also the backbone of Queensland's tourist industry which generates billions of dollars for both state and national economies. While the measures debated in the bill today allow us to detain and seek compensation from ships that pollute our watersaction at this stage is important but often simply too late-the damage has been done and the clean-up might not really compensate us for what has been done. Ideally we must stop these polluters or ships of shame before they damage our marine environment. We need to have a culture of vigilance and a mechanism of intelligence. I would like to highlight a recent 'ship of shame' story with which I am familiar and which was referred to by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). It is something which we should be able to avoid easily in the future if the government decides to take some positive action. I have raised this matter in the House before but it bears reiteration, especially in the context of the acts which we are discussing today. This story involves an Indian registered bulk carrier, the APJ Anand, which set sail from Albany in Western Australia with a load of feed barley for drought stricken farmers in Central Queensland. According to vendors, WA Grain Pool and Grainco, the APJ Anand's credentials as a carrier were satisfactory ,and the vessel was issued with a single voyage permit to cart grain around the coastline with no safety inspection required. Ironically, the vessel's generators were so underpowered that they required on-wharf supplementation in order to load the grain. Further, it was responsible for a minor oily bilge spill just before leaving Albany, which had to be contained and cleaned up by the local port authority. Given the fact that no AMSA inspector was based at Albany at the time, the derelict APJ Anand was allowed to sail on. The APJ Anand arrived in· Gladstone in late September, but this time it was unable to unload as its lifting gear proved to be defective. AMSA authorities were alerted and a full inspection on 10 October revealed over 120 defects-I understand the honourable member for Throsby now has it at 147-including extensive wastage, corrosion and other structural problems; poor crew conditions, which I saw photos of, and they were filthy; and substandard lifesaving equipment. The APJ Anand was impounded. Repairs had to be carried out to the lifting gear amountirig to some $80,000. The Anand was later released and later allowed to sail off to Singapore for major repairs. The vessel was to have travelled on to Mackay, deeper into the Great Barrier Reef. That should again alert us to the danger of this situation. Before we dismiss the Anand as just a oneoff instance or one of a small number of substandard foreign vessels, there is another example of such a 'ship of shame', one from the same shipping company, Pacific Rim Shipping Co. Pty Ltd. It had in its fleet another vessel of doubtful credentials known as Marine Blue. I concede that the Marine Blue is not a totally similar case to a vessel plying the coastal trade. This vessel carried a load of magnetite from Chile to Mackay. Mackay is on the doorstep of one of the great areas of the central Barrier Reef. When it arrived in Mackay it was found to have a rupture in the ship's chain locker which had been flooded through a crack in the hull. The ship's pumps were faulty and it had to undertake lifesaving and firefighting equipment restoration and improvements to crew facilities. We do not allow maniacs on our roads. We do not allow semitrailers to run around with bald tyres. We do not allow tankers to spew out fuel onto our urban environment. Very tough conditions apply to tankers carrying petroleum and chemicals. That is fair enough. We all endorse that. The principles should be no less for vessels which ply the highways of the sea. A degree of responsibility rests with the flag states, the owners, the classification societies, the agents, the charterers, the insurance providers and the port and maritime authorities but the principal responsibility rests ultimately with this government. There is a lesson in the Anand situation. It highlights the major anomaly in our ship safety regime. While foreign tankers must be fully inspected before being issued with single voyage permits to operate on Australia's coastal trade, such inspections are not a prerequisite for foreign bulk carriers. Yet these vessels, identified as the most at risk in the Ships of shame report, are left unscathed. I quote from the report: The catalyst for the inquiry was the loss in close succession of six bulk carriers off the West Australian coast between January 1990 and August 1991. During the inquiry it became clear that the loss of bulk carriers is a significant problem, posing considerable threat to the lives of seafarers, international trade and the marine environment. Although the APJ Anand incident did spark a departmental review of procedures under the former minister Senator Bob Collins, from the advice I have received from the new minister, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), it appears that nothing further will be done. I quote from my letter to Senator Collins at that time. I said: In speaking to the parties involved in the APJ ANAND saga, it is known that the classification society'S previous rating of the vessel was grossly inaccurate and misleading. I'm sure you'll agree, therefore, we need to strengthen our inspection procedures. Could you advise how the government proposes to address this anomaly in regard to the issuing of Single Voyage Permits for bulk carriers? What additional resources has the Australian Maritime Safety Authority received since the handing down of the ""Ships of Shame"" report? Sadly, when the new minister, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, replied to that letter he did not· address those matters. He took a fairly superficial view of the matter. He said: Unfortunately the APJ ANAND is a symptom of an international problem which potentially results in small numbers of sub-standard ships participating in the Australian trade. I would have thought that for an environmentally sensitive government the damage from just one of these derelict ships would be just too high a price to pay. The new minister goes on to say: . The long term solution to the problem of substandard shipping can only be achieved through international action by those having responsibility for ship safety. I do not accept that. Mr Braithwaite-There is not much comfort in that.",47
26,Mr NEVILLE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"No, there is not. Nor indeed have members of the government who are on this same committee as I accepted that point of view. Certainly that is an important dimension of it. We cannot duck the local issue. It is well and good to make those sorts of statements, but the APJ {lnand in our case was hardly an international problem when it threatened our coastline. I am not opposed to foreign vessels operating in Australian waters and I do not support any forin of cabotage which might restrict competition in our seaways. Legitimate foreign vessels should not be made scapegoats for the government's failure to enforce its own maritime safety standards. As we have heard from the shadow minister, on the latest figures, ships of the Australian Maritime Association have been achieving· savings on average of $217,000 per vessel per year in operating efficiencies. Then they have to tum around and lose $288,000. on average in petroleum and bunker oil excise. Those who would tum a blind eye to this form of government action on the one hand and then call for cabotage on the other are living in cloudcuckoo-land. We cannot have it both ways. It is a little like the situation in my own electorate, where we have a number of train lines under threat. These lines are struggling to maintain viability. Excise increases as of August this year will add $275,000 to the Gladstone-Moura line, raising its total excise contribution to $1.7 million a year or, in the case of the small and equally much threatened Maryborough-Monto-Gladstone line, $80,000 in additional excise for a total excise bill of nearly half a million dollars. One can see that there is a parallel case there. The government is demanding efficiencies on the one hand and then taking them away with the other in excise. I share the concerns of the honourable member for Throsby regarding the future of Australian flag vessels, the ANL and others, but his government might well look to the cost it imposes on Australian shipping companies. To protect their future and to ensure that they stay in Australian hands we might well look at lowering their operating costs and allowing them to pass on at least some of their efficiencies so that vessel placement and legitimate shareholder expectations can be met and fulfilled. Mr Braithwaite-They could also lower the freight rates, too.",49
27,Mr NEVILLE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"That would help. We have to get fair dinkum about it. We have to start at the cost end and not try to patch up all the problems once the environment has been polluted. However, returning to the matter before the House, we must take greater responsibility for the protection of our coastline. Tightening the permit system to include foreign bulk carriers is a positive step. I am disappointed that the government has decided not to act more positively but rather to rely on the existing inspection regime, the same system which allowed. the Anand to sail through the Great Barrier Reef unhindered. It is my personal· view that there should be a greater resourcing of AMSA. I am conscious of what the honourable member for Dunkley said about an efficiency audit. At the very least, if we are going to maintain the current practice of only inspecting 25 per cent of these vessels on average we should add extra resources to AMSA by way of intelligence gathering facilities and staff so that we can be ready for such vessels when they come to Australian waters. While I support the bill which is being debated today, which will see polluters brought to task, I cannot close my eyes to the outstanding ship safety anomalies which have not been addressed by the government like the single voyage permits for foreign flag bulk carriers. If this matter were addressed it would ensure that fewer ships of shame like the Anand and the Marine Blue plied the coastal highways of this great nation with the potential to pollute its waters.  p.m.)-I am pleased to participate in this debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. As has been mentioned by previous speakers, the bill encompasses amendments to a number of acts. A number of changes relate to the way the Protection of the Sea··(Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1'983 applies in the exclusive economic zone. It clarifies provisions which require foreign vessels to provide information to determine whether a pollution breach has occurred. It also clarifies the powers to inspect vessels in the economic zone and the express power to bring people into port, and generally tidies up some of the legislation that has already passed this House. The issue raised by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in respect of the APJ Anand is one of major importance to this country. It goes to the core of the operation of ships of shame-of substandard shippingnot only in Australia but around the world. The critical issue is the fact that ships operat:ing on the Australian coast, until the incigent with the APJ Anand, were not subject to port state inspection. The APJ Anand had been in Australia some years earlier at the port of Geraldton, where the condition of the vessel caused major problems and the port authority had it great concern about it. The vessel arrived later at Albany. Because there was not a surveyor from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority there, the vessel was not subject to AMSA inspection, but its defects were noted· and the next port of call was advised of them. That has led to the question of the inspection of vessels operating under single-voyage permits. We are looking at that in the current resumption of the inquiry into substandard shipping. We have had some information about that. I think it is fairly clear to most members of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure that vessels operating under single-voyage permits must be subject to inspection, preferably a mandatory inspection. The Australian Mining Industry Council has called for the mandatory inspection of all vessels operating on the Australian coast under single-voyage permits, so what I have just said is not something that is radical. !tis not something that is tougher for Australia than what is being put forward by the organisation that represents the major users, the Australian Mining Industry Council. That is something we are going to come back to later as we proceed through the consideration of the evidence being brought before the committee. Let us look at the Ships oj shame report, very favourable response and acclaim that it has received across the world, and the momentum it has generated in trying to get rid of substandard shipping. There have been comments made at times that we, as an exporting nation, are being too tough on foreign shipping coming to Australian ports. They are put to rest completely by the consideration of the approach to substandard shipping going on in Europe and the United States at the moment. There was recently a meeting of the transport ministers from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, looking at stamping out pollution. They were particularly concemed about vessels carrying hazardous cargoes travelling their waters. They were looking at bringing in. a new convention of liability for ships carrying hazardous and noxious substances, to be enforced by the Intemational Maritime Organisation, by 1996. They also resolved that they would support research into the feasibility of identifying containers lost overboard. We had an incident with a lost container just afew days ago. The container was submerged, and a yacht struck it and was destroyed. Fortunately, everybody was rescued from the yacht. But containers that are lost overboard and remain afloat but are not always visible are a constant problem at sea. They also took a decision that ship surveyors in each of those nations that I have mentioned would be exchanging information. They decided that substandard ships would be detained, as they are here, until they are upgraded to meet the intemational maritime standards. They discussed a further amendment to the Intemational Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea to provide that ships carrying oil, harmful substances and dangerous goods follow predetermined routes. That is, the route to be followed by the master of a vessel in completing its joumey would not be one of his selection but would be a prescribed route, similar to what we have on the Australian coast in some areas. The European Commission only a few weeks ago brought forward very tough plans the in respect of port state control. Anybody who thought Australia's approach to port state control and its level of inspection were tough, on reading through and reflecting upon what the European Commission is now proposing and hoping to have in place by 1996, and on what the United States Coast Guard is doing in respect of substandard shipping, would see that Australia looks soft. If anything, we are too easygoing; we are too soft in our. approach to substandard shipping in this country. The developments from the European Commission and from the US Coast Guard are verywe1come because they give a legitimacy to the sincere and deeply felt concems of members of this parliament of both houses, of people out there in the community generally who are concemed for the welfare of seafarers from wherever they come. All of those people now will get some comfort from the fact that it is not a matter of Australia trying to do it by itself here; the major markets of the world, the United States and the European Community, are bringing forward tougher measures than even Australia is carrying out at the moment, so there will be some prospect of sweepfng the seas of substandard shipping. The EC plans, for instance, to look at how to ensure that vessels visiting European ports meet the requirements and that oil tankers that are ijve years or less away from being phased out under the MARPOL rules, the marine pollution rules, and that bulk carriers over 12 years old will all come under increased port state scrutiny. The proposals they are putting forward will all go to the· European Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and, hopefully, will be adopted by the European Union by July 1996. It touches also on the question of crewing of ships. It was said before that a good crew will save a bad ship in a time of crisis but a bad crew will destroy a good ship in a time of crisis. No matter the condition of the vessel, priority one has to be the competency of the crews. If one were to look back-and I will not take up the time of the House with it nowover the recent ship accident investigation reports that have been released on the competency of crews of a trawler that was sunk by a foreign flag vessel, one would see that competency of the crew and crew not carrying out their responsibilities were the key feature. It was not the· structure of the vessel or condition of the vessel; it was the performance of the crews on both vessels. So surveyors will seek to ensure, when they carry out these port state control inspections under these new proposals for Europe, that crews comply with minimum training standards and are aware of their duties on the master list. That goes to the core of the problem: the training agencies themselves are a motley collection. We know that the Philippines is a major source ofrecruitment of seafarers. But many of those seafarers carry phoney qualifications. A few of the training agencies do have world standing and do meet competency standards but many of them do not. There has not yet been sufficient response around the world to this question of ensuring that crews meet competency standards. We made recommendations in our report that there should be a standard set and approved by the International Maritime Organisation. That has not had the response from government that we had hoped it would have. But this issue is not going to go away. One of the previous speakers, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), referred to the shortage of crews and the shortage of officers-in total, about half a million by the end of this century. It. is an enormous shortage. But what is happening is that farmers are going to sea. Effectively, on many vessels, we have seagoing labourers. Until the major trading nations of the world face up to this question of ensuring that crews are adequately trained, we are still going to have an extremely serious problem. I am very pleased to see that the Europe-nCommission in its recommendations to its ministers and to the European parliament is proposing that the competency of crews be taken into account. Another issue that enables much of this substand-rd operation to survive and the dangers to continue to be created is the conspiracy of silence, as I like to describe it. I think it is most regrettable that in recent weeks the Salvage Association of the United Kingdom has determined that it will no longer release publicly the results of its inspections. It gives some reasons for that, saying that the number of vessels that it now inspects has declined considerably over the last decade. It expresses some reservation about the use to which that information is put. But to me, and I hope to this parliament, those excuses can be seen only.as excuses. The effect of it will be to help cover up the abuse of seafarers, the exploitation of seafarers and the dangers of what is going on. Contrast that with the recommendation from the European Commission, again to its ministers and the European Parliament, that each national admiriistration be required to publish quarterly the number of detentions, including the names of ships, the International Maritime Organisation number, the flag state, the owner and the classification society which issued statutory certificates on behalf of the flag state. That will help do what we have recommended here and what the Australian Maritime Safety Authority here in Australia has started to do, and that is to get it all out in the open. Much of this abuse can happen only because peculiarly in the shipping industry everything is to be secret; it is commercially confidential. It is that conspiracy of silence, that cloak, that enables these abuses to go on. So it is great to see that the European Community, hopefully, will pick up this recommendation from the European Commission and move now to publish that information. The US Coast Guard already makes that information· available on a regular basis. It does not have any problem with it. What the European Commission has recommended to its ministers is supported by the United States Coast Guard and the tougher still approach that it is taking to substandard shipping. Let me repeat that there is no case for anybody in this country to be offering some kind of puny excuse that in some way, by not turning a blind eye to substandard shipping or by enforcing our requirements under the Port State Control Convention, we are going to impinge upon Australia's terms of trade and our capacity to trade. Let the cargo owner who wants to uSe a substandard ship, a ship of shame, stand up, identify his or her business and product, and say, 'I am prepared to create these risks and to endanger the lives of the seafarers on board that vessel to get the cheap rate that it offers.' It is wonderful that the US Coast Guard is going even further than it has in the past and that the European Commission is looking to pick up the kind of measures that we recommended here in the parliament in December of 1992. The US Coast Guard is also moving to categorise those flag states which do not carry out their responsibilities as flag states. We know there are flag states that stand out as the home of substandard shipping: Malta, Cyprus, Panama. We could go on through the range of them. But what the US is going to do is to look at three-year averages on the number of vessels detained under those flags and publish that information. That will help put focus upon what is going on with a flag state and put pressure upon the flag state to carry out its responsibilities. The US Coast Guard is also going to enforce checks on flag states. What the head of the US Coast Guard,· Admiral William Kime, has said recently is that a mechanism should be set up that would enable the International Maritime Organisation to certify the capability of flag states to enforce the various safety and anti-pollution conventions. Our capacity to enforce measures relating to the prevention of pollution is one of the issues covered in this legislation. The recommendation from the US Coast Guard in respect of the IMO hopefully will do something about those flag states which see the registration of ships as an easy source of revenue. It is an easy source of revenue without having to carry any responsibilities. That is one good measure that has occurred. Another measure which I am greatly heartened by is the support being given to the view that I have expressed repeatedly: cargo owners are ultimately the people who trigger the use of substandard shipping. You can tie a substandard ship to the buoy, park it by the wharf, and it cannot do very much harm. Admittedly, the vessel can leak oil or whatever but, in relative terms, it can do little harm. It becomes a danger to those who work on it and it is a danger to the waters in which it travels when a cargo owner says that he wants to use that vessel. There are plenty of instances where the same cargo owners use the same type of vessel, obviously because it is the cheapest vessel that they can get. The measures that I have proposed relate to cargo owners being held responsible for the operation of substandard ships. They unleash those dangers when they say, for example, 'Yes, I will use the MV Bendigo owned by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). It suits me fine. Yes, it has got a problem.' They take a deliberate decision to unleash the dangers and the risks involved in the use of that vessel. The article in the Daily Commercial News dated 29 April 1994 states: If a cargo owner charters a ship that is detained for being unseaworthy, it is the shipowner who has to pay for it-but the law should be changed to penalise the cargo owner. That statement has come from Roberto Salvarani, the head of the maritime safety at the EC transport directorate. I was greatly heartened when he said: ... a survey had shown that it was legally possible and technically feasible for cargo owners to be held responsible for the consequences of trading substandard ships by an EC directive or IMO convention. In other words, if we can get an IMO convention that will hold cargo owners responsible, it is a major solution to the problem. The ship will not have a cargo. It will not be able go to sea; it will go straight to the scrap y.ard. Similarly, it will solve the problem If the European Commission, in respect of its own shipping, makes a direction. We. are not Robinson Crusoe. We have been try10g to do something ourselves in respect of shipping. Australia stands tall in the world in respect of the credentials of its seafarers, its standards in respect of shipping, the role that it plays in the International Maritime Organisation and the lead it and .this parliament have given to the issue of the safety of shipping and the protection of the lives of seafarers. As a nation, we can only benefit from a better standard of shipping. There may be a temporary problem in that some firms might be able to continue to utilise substandard shipping, but that is going to stop. Whe? I started this speech, I mentioned the Austrahan Mining Industry Council statement. It believes that every ship operating under a singlevoyage permit around the coastline of t?is nation should be subject to a port state 10spection to ensure that it meets the requ.ired international standards. I support the legIslation that is before the parliament and commend the bill to the House.",50
28,Mr LATHAM,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I support the legislation, in· particular the amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920 and the fashion in which they attempt to fulfil government commitme-ts abo-t prod-c-ng competitive markets for mternatlonal aVIatIOn in and out of Australia. This whole issue of competition is very important in aviation. It comes from a broad government agenda about competition; it comes out of the Hilmer report. In telecommunications and the whole range of infrastructure provision around the country there are important gains to be made in productivity from having competition between infrastructure providers, particularly in the aviation industry. It is important to understand not only do we need good legislation to provide competition between airlines but also we need a commitment to competition between airports. The competitive structure needs to be right for aviation as an industry-for the planes as well as their destinations. Last week the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in a landmark speech in Melbo-rne outlined his important framework for achlev- . ing those goals. This is an issue that is - ery important to me as the member for Wemwa. When I contested the by-election, my leading promise was to establish an international airport at Badgerys Creek. It will be a. v-ry important competitor for the . large aVlatl-n market currently serviced at Kmgsford Smith in east Sydney. I mentioned this in my maiden speech. I cannot explain how flattered I was to have faxed through to my office later that day a press release from the shadow minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr lull). The headline of the press release said 'Latham shows Labor the way on Badgerys Creek'. For a new member to be the subject of a press release from a shadow minister was indeed a flattering moment in my parliamentary career. The release went on: The Government has two choices if it wants to see Badgerys Creek built. Firstly, it could fund the airport from consolidated revenue. I hope Mr Latham will continue to press his colleagues on this issue. While he may have woken up to the solution to this problem, the Labor Party remains crippled by inaction. I have a sneaking suspicion that in a few hours time the shadow minister will have to draft another press release, this time praising this government for its very strong action on Badgerys Creek, the new Sydney .west in!ernational airport. The shadow mmlster mIght also have to reconsider the matter of public importance he has listed about government administration of civil aviation, because there is no better way to administer the aviation industry than that being pursued by the Minister for Transport. His model for competition between airlines is reflected in this legislation, and his model for competition between airports is reflected in the landmark speech in Melbourne last week. I note also that there has been some media speculation about how feasible the international airport in Sydney's west will be. The argument fed by the FAC is that it has done a survey of· all the existing operators at Kingsford Smith. Many have said, according to the hypothetical survey, that they want to stay at Mascot, defend their existing investments and downplay the role of a second international airport in Sydney. Of course, that is what they are going to say in hypothetical circumstances. The existing operators, posed that question, will always say, 'We will def-nd our interests and our large investment at our existing location. We will downplay the role of the second airport.' We need to understand-this is a view shared by both sides of the House, I believe that in a competitive market where there is a customer base infrastructure providers must follow their customers and cover the way in which competitors will break out of existing markets to establish themselves in large and growing markets. A study in November 1993 by Economic and Energy Analysis and the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research in Melbourne showed that, by the year 2000, 26 pet cent of air passengers in Sydney will live closer to Badgerys Creek than Mascot. That means there will be a catchment area for Sydney West international airport of more than five million passengers per annum. As well, one-third of companies exporting air freight out of Sydney will be located closer to Badgerys Creek than Mascot. That is, 48,000 tonnes of air freight per annum will be exported out of the catchment area for Sydney west international airport. These are quite significant figures because this will be the third largest aviation market in Australia after Kingsford Smith and Tullamarine. Quite frankly; no airline and no freight forwarder can ignore such a market. If they do turn their backs on that sort of market, they run a very high risk from new entrants in a competitive airline industry locating at Sydney west international airport, tapping into the third largest.. - and fastest growing-aviation market in Australia, and making substantial profits. Once the hypothetical surveys are put to one side, the truth is that according to basic market forces those operators must follow their customers to the very large catchment in Sydney's west and south-west. It is an outstanding initiative for the government and the Minister for Transport to introduce competition across the board for aviation and airports, and for the government to recognise the importance of these reforms, as part of the white paper process. For my region, in the south-west of Sydney-which has had high unemployment for a number of decades now, under governments of all persuasions, and a high proportion of long-term unemployed-this is a very significant day. It is the fi-t time a national government in Australia has not only attempted to make the long-term unemployed jobs ready but also attempted in regions with high unemployment to make jobs available, to match up both sides of the labour market. On the supply side, the government is reconnecting people into the work force. On the demand side, it is making sure that important infrastructure projects-such as Sydney west international airport-in a competitive environment are available to generate tens of thousands pf jobs. So the shadow minister will be drafting his press release, and I am sure the Minister for Transport will be very happy with the outcome that has been achieved in such a short space of time. With regard to the benefits to employment, a report by the national institute in 1991 detailed the substantial employment benefits of the new airport through competition, with the creation of at least 36,000 new jobs in the . region over the next 20 years. That· means much more than jobs coming out of airport construction or out of airport operation. It is a major regional economic development opportunity, because of the cluster of industries that will locate around the airport site. That is, the government is using infrastructure policy and competition policies at a national and regional level to achieve jobs in a region that badly needs them. From the catalyst of Sydney west internationalairport manufacturing will regard Sydney's west as an attractive place for the location of its activities and joining the export push from Australia, and also for tourism industries. There is a large and growing tourism market in Sydney's west,·spearheaded by the Blue Mountains. The new airport, of course, with the international length strip, will facilitate the benefits of tourism growth in our region. So these are very important things. The study in 1991 also examined the discounted benefit of Badgerys Creek relative to the expansion of Kingsford Smith. It identified a net expansion of national GDP by $8.8 billion to the year 2010, which represents 2.5 per cent of our current annual output in Australia. The government is not only doing something that is good by the standards of regional policy, through competition between airports and in aviation, but also something that is, in its own right, a very important micro-economic reform for Australia. We are going to be moving away from an airport at Kingsford Smith which, by any standard-particularly international standards-is inefficient. It is congested, and is. running out of room for its expansion. What next-the fourth runway? We already see forecasts, even before its opening, about the third runway reaching capacity by the year 2000. The road. network around Kingsford Smith is much too congested, and the curfew at night is a hindrance to the airline operators. All these things will be avoided at the competitor airport in Sydney's west. There will be state-of-the-art technology, ideal for freight forwarders wanting to join the export drive. There will be no curfew at night hindering the operation of freight aircraft. There will be no congestion around the road network at Badgerys Creek. It will be, by international standards, Australian's first advanced, and best-practice. designed, international airport. That is a tremendous initiative for this government to realise as a micro-reform, making the economy and our export drive all the more efficient. I know that manufacturing enterprises in western Sydney, which have been growing substantially, are looking forward to an efficient airport to give them their best possible chance of joining the export push. No longer will they have to battle all that horrendous Sydney congestion on the roads to place their produce at Alexandria with the freight forwarding companies. At present, they have to wait a couple of days until the order comes through, and then wait until there is a plane available and, when they do put it on the plane, there are delays at the airport. All the while their customers in Asia are waiting desperately for these goods. We will have in western Sydney a very efficient airport that overcomes all the problems at Kingsford Smith. It will also be very important for Sydney's urban and economic development, because there has been a substantial movement of manufacturing enterprises to Sydney's west and south-west. The government, following market forces, is facilitating further development of manufacturing by making sure that the international airport is there to efficiently carry goods to export markets. One can look at the figures for employment change from June 1992 to June 1993 in Fairfield-Liverpool and the outer south-west, which is part of my electorate. Employment grew there in 12 months by 29,000 jobs, according to the DEET figures. That was an employment increase of 16 per cent. The inner Sydney and inner western Sydney figures are the exact opposite. There was a. loss of 19,000 jobs in those 12 months, a decrease of 9.7 per cent. The benefits. for urban planning in Sydney are substantial. As long as I have been alive, the battle in western Sydney· has been to get the jobs in place before the development of the housing estates. That, of course, is the great objective-not just to lower the rate of unemployment but to produce a much more efficient urban area, so that people do not have to travel long distances, in cars which are polluting the air, to find their place of employment. We need a region that is self-contained in terms of employment opportunities. These are very good goals that the government would be supporting through an international strip at Badgerys Creek. They not only produce a micro-reform of substantial benefit, not only producing more than 30,000 jobs in Sydney's west and south-west, through industry clustering over the next 20 years;. not only producing greater efficiency and environmental benefits in Sydney's west by reducing com"""" muter times; but also, in the inner city, ending the way in which the FAC for decades has misled communities about the potential grpwth - nd noise consequences of Kingsford Smith. My colleague in the chamber, the honourSmith able member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), has led a campaign for many years to make sure. that the FAC is kept honest, made responsible, and pushed into an environment of competition. FOf the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, the Minister for Transwhich port, to be able, after only five months in the job, to produce these results is enormously his credit. It is a tremendous thing for him to have achieved for the inner city and the western part of Sydney, as well as for the region tha- I represent in the south-we-t. I look forward to support from across Sydney metropolitan' area for this sort of initiative. I hope the avia:tion writers can break free from the FAC drip and have a look at the' very positive way in which market competition can make a real difference. It must be understood that the catchment in Sydney's west is the third largest in Australia for aviation purposes, and no company, no airline, and no freight forwarder-away the hypothetical surveys-will ignore that of market opportunity. If they do, they will not be in the market for very long, because the new airlines that are establishing, and some of the existing players-particularly freight forwarding-will most certainly take up those opportunities. One can imagine how the next Compass in the domestic aviation market in Australia will not be messing around with restrictive trade practices on the counter space for Kingsford Smith, crowded out by the existing players. They will be straight out to Sydney west international airport, with equal opportunity on the airport design to market their services to the third largest aviation market in Australbecause is. These opportunities reflect well on the legislation the House is now considering to make sure that not only domestic aviation competition works in this country, but also international competition.  about aviation movements in Sydney. It is called the residual development model, and it is something like a glass of water overflowing. The unrealistic assumption is that there will be no demand at Sydney west international airport until such time as Kingsford has saturated its capacity. That is to say, when they cannot fit one more plane on the runways at Kingsford Smith or deal with one more freight forwarding opportunity, then-and only then-will these operators look to Sydney's west and its aviation market is bigger than Adelaide or Brisbane, and bigger than any airport in Australia other to than Kingsford Smith and'Tullamarine. That, of course, is a model which any firstyear university student will tell us is fundamentally flawed. Its assumptions are wrong, because it rules out any notion of market the competition, and any notion of companies  no interest in any of the things we talk about in this parliament, how companies in Australia in the 1990s need to achieve to be competitive and strong. I suppose one can understand that. It is a monopoly itself: a monopoly that has never been exposed to market competition, except for Cairns airport, which is a from tearaway success, as identified by the sort MCKinsey report. That report shows that Cairns has done a lot better than the FAC airport at Townsville, and that it has provided the sort of economic boost that we will now in see in Sydney's west.  needs to read the Hilmer report, understand some of the' basic rules of economics about competitive markets and how market forces produce benefits. It needs to break free of its monopoly shackles and understand that this is an airport well worth supporting. The state government in New South Wales also needs to upgrade its point of view, it has taken a very poor role. in the planning process. The site at Badgerys Creek has been identified as the airport site since 1986, and in the eight years since then no state government has lifted a finger to do any of the basic planning-not for roads and not for rail. Nothing happened until the Minister for Transport,took the initiative by putting in federal money for the road links and commenced federal planning about the rail links. This airport can be operational by 1999. It will have an international length runway, fully serviced road and rail access, a growing manufacturing and freight forwarding market in Sydney's west, and 25 per cent of the passenger share of international traffic by the year 2000. All these figures are rising as Sydney's west. and south-west continue to grow and mature as regional economies. The share of freight imports into Badgerys Creek will increase from 31 per cent in 1995 to 42 per cent of the Sydney market by the year 2020. The share of exports from Badgerys Creek will rise from a third in 1995 through to 51 per cent by the year 2020. The passenger share will go up substantially after the year 2000, kicked on by the enormous tourism boost from the 2000 Olympics. That is in recognition of the fact that a number of the sporting events are located much closer to Badgerys Creek than they are to Kingsford Smith. This sort· of initiative brings together a whole range of reforms, including competition policy reflected in this legislation, better urban planning, better noise control, less congestion in the inner city and more jobs for Sydney's south-west. I will conclude where I began on the historical significance of this day, by stressing the broad sweep of how this parliament and how governments in Australia have formulated economic policy. This government has spent a lot of time working. on making the Australian economy more competitive. Now it turns its focus towards making the regions more competitive. It is backing sensible and well targeted, cost-effective infrastructure development like Sydney West international airport. It is the first government to do that. It is the first government in Australia's history to have an effective agenda for regional economic development. It is also the first government to take an active interest in the benefits and the welfare of the long-term unemployed. It is making the training market and the training agenda more effective. It is reconnecting the long-term unemployed to the work force. On both sides of the labour market it is making the long-term unemployed jobs ready and making the regions jobs available. This is, by Australian standards, a major breakthrough for regions and electorates such as mine and for all those regions around the country that have been saying for many years that they wish to compete, and compete effectively. Come the end of today, we will be even more confident in Sydney's south-west of our chance to compete. It is reflected here in the legislation for international airlines. We know that Sydney west international airport will not only compete against Kingsford Smith but it will win the competitive battle. It will win the competitive battle on the back of our substantially enhanced and growing region, growing population and growing economic strength. This is avery good initiative for all the people that I represent and for those in the broader metropolis of Sydney's west and south-west.",54
29,Mr LEO MCLEAY,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Watson) (1.29 p.m.)I join my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in making a few remarks on this omnibus bill, the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill, in particular on how it relates to air traffic. I commend the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) for the amendments to the Air Navigation Act and point out that my constituents are in favour of any move to rationalise aircraft operations. These amendments allow the Australian carriers to comply with international requirements in accordance with our bilateral agreements. They also allow the act to address capacity arrangements in line with a deregulated industry and our bilateral landing rights agreements. I agree with my colleague that it is a pity that the Federal Airports Corporation was not all that interested in a deregulated industry. This bill clearly outlines a definition of what an Australian carrier is and prescribes permissible levels of foreign ownership, safeguarding the growth of our air industry. The airline industry is a growth industry, as the member for Werriwa and other speakers in this debate have pointed out. I take the chance to remind the House that, even with the third runway at Sydney airport, future demands on capacity at that airport are very pressing. The Federal Airports Corporation's own projections of future usage of the airport at Sydney envisage a five per cent annual growth of traffic. Authoritative figures that are to hand suggest that in 1993 there were 21,087 landings and there were 4,472 takeoffs on the north runway. After the parallel runway is developed the runway will be able to take 15,302 landings and 15,302 take-offs. The important thing to note with that five per cent annual growth is that the landings and take-offs will increase to 21,530 by't'he year 2000. Indeed, the worse case scenario-which often, the way the FAC does things, becomes the norm-is that, with particular weather conditions and a heavy load on the day, the north runway, the long runway at Sydney airport, could be in use for over 150 take-offs a day to the· north of the airport, which equates to about one take-off every seven minutes. This is take-offs to the north of the airport, when the FAC and all the environmental impact statements and speeches that were made in the discussion over the last 10 years on the use of Sydney airport said that there would be very few take-offs to the north. When I and some of my colleagues, such as the member for Phillip, as she was at the time, now the member for Grayndler eMs MCHugh), the member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) and Mr Michael Maher, who was the member for Lowe at the time, said that building the third runway and concentrating activities at Sydney airport were going to be a disaster, we were all said to be scaremongering and just saying. this for political opportunism. But the FAC's own figures are now showing that, on a day when the weather is bad, we will get one flight every seven minutes taking off over people's homes. That is disgraceful and it puts the lie to all the things that the FAC has said in this debate. own worse case scenario is 150 take-offs a day to th- north of the airport. No doubt the residents of my electorate and the other electorates surrounding the airport will be comforted by the government's statement later today, and the work that the Minister for Transport has done on seeing that we do something for western Sydney. What the minister has done is to ensure that we have a regime that will allow us to expand the operations of Badgerys Creek and to put into place the transport infrastructure which will allow Badgerys Creek to operate. All through the run-up to the choosing of development at Sydney airport, we had the FAC saying, 'Oh yes, we are all in favour of doing something at Badgerys Creek.' But what we find now is that it was doing just what those of us who were interested in this project said it would be doing-nothing. There was no planning for the road and rail infrastructure that would link Badgerys Creek airport to the city, there was no planning for the expansion of that airport - there was no planning for Badgerys Creek at all. What the FAC wanted to do was concentrate all its activity at Sydney airport. One would expect that ultimately we would have the only economic case put forward to us that it was interested in, which would be, 'Well, Minister, the problem with Sydney airport is that we have got all this infrastructure and investment there and it is only being used 17 hours a day-'-we really need to get rid of the curfew.' What Minister Brereton has done now in his proposals to have Badgerys Creek con-· nected to the rail and road infrastructure of Sydney and in his proposals to sell off some of the FAC's operations will ensure that Badgerys Creek is able to compete with Sydney airport. As a non-curfewed airport, Badgerys Creek will be successful, in my view.  should go against the trends of everywhere else in the world. Any member or citizen who has travelled to the other large capitals of the world sees something entirely different from what happens in Sydney. In all the other large Its capitals there is a smaller 1950s or 1940s airport close to the centre of the city and the large international operator out on the city rim. In London there are two big airports, one at Gatwick and one at Heathrow; Washington has Washington National and Dulles and New York has La Guardia and Kennedy. Any of these large cities has two airports.  Sydney had only one airport searched the world to come up with an example of city where there was a big airport planned by the government on the rim of the city that had failed. Such an airport was found in Canada, so the FAC said, 'See, this is not a one-off; this is what happens everywhere.' However, the current official of the FAC. is the chairman of the World Airports Association, and lam sure he would'not be silly enough to say to the government, 'Of course, these large airports on city rims have failed all around world,' because they know it is absolutely not true. This is aridiculous attempt to invent something that does not happen anywhere else in the world and concentrate all the activity on one of the smallest airports in the world. That is just not going to work, and the government and particuliuly Minister Brereton are going to make sure that that little plot is undone. The infrastructure that will be built to link Badgerys Creek with the city by the rail and road networks will ensure that that airport, if it is freed up from the FAC's grasp, will be able to compete with Sydney airport-and compete very well. . The minister has also flagged the idea of selling Tullamarine. The minister really should package Badgerys Creek and Tullamarine together and sell them as a job lot. I think that there would be very great interest from large international operators as well as Australian operators in two airports that can serve the two largest markets in Australia, both of them being non-curfewed airports. What is going to kill Sydney airport in the end-or kill the residents-is the struggle between the FAC to have the curfew lifted and the residents who want to have some peace and quiet. When you see that its own figures suggest that on bad days there can be a take-off-not a landing-every seven minutes over the suburbs of Sydney, that shows just how stupid the planning proposals wer--not just stupid but scandalous. If Badgerys Creek is opened up as Sydney's western airport, we will see the development of a very significant freight industry. At present some freight operators bring night freight into Sydney with the government a licensing, in most instances, quiet aircraft. One operator bought some quiet aircraftAflsett bought BAel46s-but then Australian Airlines, which is now Qantas, whinged and said, 'Of course, we have not got any of those qui-t aircraft but we have got some that are not quite so quiet and, in the terms of proper competition, Minister, you should let us fly these aircraft.' I am sad to say that recently a very stupid the decision was made. by the government to allow Qantas to fly 737s for night freight operation for a 12-month period. I can say here today that I am going to make sure that, when the 12 months is up, this period will not be extended. It is a disgrace that these people should be allowed to operate such noisy aircraft over the suburbs of Sydney throughout the night. Badgerys Creek is the perfect place for this. A significant freight operation will be able to operate from Badgerys Creek. International freight operators can come to Badgerys Creek in very large aircraft. It needs to be remembered that Badgerys Creek is at the centre of the growth area of Sydney. To be trying to develop all these aviation operations in a very cramped peninsula, 20 minutes from the CBD, is an absolute nonsense. In fact, figures show that Badgerys Creek catchment area will increase the total Sydney passenger market from 21 per cent to 32 per cent by the year 2020. That catchment area will be larger than any area outside the Sydney and Melbourne CBDs. .  international gateway in Cairns and international airports in Adelaide, Darwin and Perth. But where there is a market that is bigger than all those markets, it wants to put down some little strip that wiil not even take small jet aircraft. That is a nonsense; it is stupid. It is not going to be sustained. The changes that Minister Brereton has put forward, and which will come into effect,will ensure that we get a bit of competition in the airport industry in Australia. Surely this other monopoly, the Federal Airports Corporation, should be opened up to competition, if the airlines tell us they are in favour of competinorth. tion and if the government has told other GBBs that they should be open to competition. It has told Telecom that it should be forced into competition. As part of that forced change, there are some amendments to Telecom's legislation in this bill that are directly related to Telecom having competition. The opposition is not much better. Its answer is to sell the Federal Airports Corporation; this replaces a public monopoly with a private monopoly. That is just as silly. What we need in this area is proper competition. One of the most competitive regimes that could be put together in Australia would be created if there were one owner for Badgerys Creek and Tullamarine. It could get into competition with this large government business enterprise which has been busy spreading half-truths around the country for so long. We would then see the proper development of Badgerys Creek and the movement· of an asset to the people in the industry who can use it. If it is good enough to have airports in markets that are smaller than that market, is certainly good enough to have a proper airport that can take international traffic Badgerys Creek. It will ensure industry in Australia reacts as it has in rest of the world, with a smaller, inner city airport, dealing with some international traffic but mostly with domestic traffic, and a international operator out on the city rim. The people of my electorate and the electorates around the airport have no problem with Sydney airport being involved to a greater extent with domestic traffic- Domestic passentralian gers tend not to want to fly at midnight or 5.00 a.m., and the curfew can. work safely there and not be of detriment to the operators. It can be a positive boon, in fact, to the people who live around the airport. Domestic jets are in the main not as heavy as and are less noisy than those of the international carrier. operators that are coming into Sydney airport now. TheFAC needs to comply with what it said it would do originally, which is have take-offs to the south and few or no take-offs to the The way to ensure that happens is to move the big operators out to the city rim. Let us have a decent, proper competitive regime and let us see that we get a bit of balanced development in the west of Sydney-and some sanity for the people who live around Sydney airport. I commend this legislation to the House and congratulate Minister Brereton on his foresight which will ensure our transport and communications industries are given the scope they require to grow and, in particular, to compete in Australia's more and more internationalised marketplace.",58
30,Mr OKEEFE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"in reply-At the conclusion of this debate I thank the honourable members who have contributed during the morning and into the afternoon. Although this Tran.sport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill contains mainly machinery measures, honourable members have taken the opportunity to express some fairly strongly held views in a range of areas in which they are, in many ways, quite expert. The preceding speaker, the it honourable member for Watson· (Mr Leo MCLeay), for example, has a distinct and at well-developed interest in the operations at that the airport Mascot airport. the . As I stated in the second reading speech, the bill does not introduce any substantial new policy measures and can be summed up bigger as follows: some amendments to the Air Navigation Act will ensure that Australian airlines that are designated as international carriers under international agreements are substantially controlled and owned by Ausnationals. In fact, they have to conat tinue to be that in order to be the designated national carrier. That comes about through the government's decision to float the ownership of Qantas. It means that Qantas, in fact, must have at least 65 per cent Australian ownership to continue to be described as the national The bill also contains some amendments to the Telecommunications Act, which simply change the name to renect the new trading position of Telecom and Telstra-as it is called in its international operations. There are some amendments to ,the Navigation Act which tidy up the validity of some exemptions to the act and particularly-and I think this is a very important one-give the maritime authority the power to collect the costs of cleaning up the pollution that is ,caused particularly by foreign' vessels operating in Australian waters. We do not have any difficulty through our various schemes in dealing with Australianshipping in Australian waters, but the ability to collect the costs and force contributions to the fund from foreign vessels is tidied up in this legislation. There is also a very interesting amendment which enables what we call community service obligations, the requirement ·of T-lecom to make sure that people have access to the phone system and for the payphone system to be extended into the Indian Ocean territories for which Australia has responsibility, in particular, the Cocos and Christmas Islands. In conclusion, it is worth making one correction to the contribution made by the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) when he was talking about the incident with the Daishowa Maru and referred to the article in the Australian supplement. It is of significance to note that with that incident there was not actually any oil spilt into the sea and so, while the incident itself was significant and highlights the need for our work in this field, in that particular case it was not one that led to actual marine pollution .. I thank the members who have contributed to the debate. I think the legislation takes us all a step further in all of these areas. I appreciate the fact that the opposition has allowed this legislation to pass without dissent on its part, so it is in fact a collaborative arrangement, and that is a good sign for the people who are involved and most particularly the people from the Department of Transport who have .put their effort into bringing this legislation together. They too will be pleased to know that the parliament has supported it on both sides of the House. I commend the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

31,Dr THEQPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (2.02 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill makes amendments to a number of acts within the Hum'an Services and Health portfolio. The amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and' are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen. Part 2 of this bill amends the Disability Services Act 1986 to provide for the recovery of costs incurred by the Commonwealth. in the provision of rehabilitation programs. It has been a long standing practice in the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to serve notices in relation to the recovery of rehabilitation costs on insurers prior to the settlement or conclusion of litigation between the insurer and the insured person. The amendment will provide legislative backing for notices to he served in time for the debt to the Commonwealth to be considered as part of the negotiations prior to the settlement of the compensation claim. Under current legislation there is no requirement for the party deemed liable to pay compensation to discharge the debt to the Commonwealth before paying the person receiving the compensation. This has led to situations where the Commonwealth has had to recover moneys from its rehabilitation client. The amendment will ensure that the insurer pays the debt to the Commonwealth before award moneys are disbursed. Both amendments to section 23 will serve to strengthen legislative support for the recovery of costs by the Commonwealth for rehabilitation programs provided to clients with c()mpensation claims. Finally, the bill amends section 26 to require decision makers under part III of the Disability Services Act to notify persons affected by their decisions of the making of the decisions and of their rights of appeal. The Administrative Review Council has recently explored ways of improving a client's appeal rights. The council's advice is implemented through this amendment. The amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, made by part 3 of this bill, are consequential to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. The Childcare Rebate Act 1993 was another important step to ensure that child care is affordable for all working families. From 1 July 1994, parents using child care while in employment, training, studying or looking for work will be able to claim a cash rebate for part of their child-care expenses. An estimated 230,000 families with 358,000 children will benefit from the scheme. The Commonwealth child-care cash rebate will be administered by the Health Insurance Commission on behalf of the Department of Human Services and Health. The cash rebate will be payable by mail or in person through Medicare offices of the Health Insurance Commission. To enable the Health Insurance Commission to begin preparations for the child-care rebate, the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Act 1993 was passed during the autumn sittings last year. Part 3 of this bill makes further amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, to ensure that it makes adequate provision in relation to the child-care cash rebate functions of the commission. Accordingly, the Health Insurance Commission will be required to prepare estimates of receipts and expected expenditure related to the performance of its child-care cash rebate functions, to expend its moneys in relation to those functions only in accordance with approved estimates of expenditure, apportion its assets appropriately, apportion its expenditure appropriately and open bank accounts required to enable it properly to handle its moneys. The opportunity has also been taken to make technical and drafting amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 to facilitate the operation of the financial provisions of the act in relation to functions conferred on the commission. In part 4, the bill proposes a schedule of amendments to two acts. The schedule makes technical and drafting amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953, substantially to cast certain references in inclusive rather than . sexist language. I commend this bill to the House.",62
32,Mrs SULLIVAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Moncrieft) (2.07 p.m.)< This bill is largely mechanical and the coalition will not be opposing it. However, there are a few points relating to the family and in particular to the many women whose unpaid 'work' is largely ignored, especially the raising, nurturing and education of their children at home, which I shall discuss further in my speech. This comes under part 3 of the bill, or those aspects of the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 which are consequential on the passage of the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. I really am very disappointed that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is not here. This is, of course, her first bill since she has become a minister and I had hoped that we might have seen her in here to discuss this bill, which has some very important implications for women. . The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 proposes amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. Part 2 of this bill amends the Disability Services Act 1986 by inserting a new subsection 23(5A) to bring the legislation into line with what has develtion oped as common practice over the years relation to the issue of early notices of intent to recover moneys to the person potentially liable to pay compensation. Subsection 23(7) is also to be amended require the insurer who has been sent a notice under subsection 23(5) advising of the debt lost the plot. due to the Commonwealth relating to the rehabilitation program provided, to pay that debt before any payment is made to the client. Section 26 of the act is also amended by inclusion of a provision relating to section 27 A of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the effect of which is to require decision makers to notify their decisions to the people affected and to inform them of their review rights. The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service is responsible for the delivery of rehabilitation services to workers compensation authorities. These services account for 32 per cent of CRS service delivery and are revenue raising for the Commonwealth. The Disability Services Act 1986 does not allQw for the CRS claim payment for rehabilitation services to service delivery. In the past CRS has encountered problems attempting to recover moneys from workers compensation authori840,000 ties after services have been rendered. As result, this has often led to cost recovery from CRS rehabilitation clients rather than from relevant authority. The amendments before House today will overcome the difficulties and administrative delays by allowing CRS to claim funds from workers comp-nsation authorities prior to service delivery for clients. The coalition supports this concept as outcome will be a step towards better acadequately countability of government revenue. The question of government accountability course, a familiar ring to it. Already in this first week of a new parliamentary sitting we have heard much about the need for greater accountability in relation to the· spending public moneys. Yesterday's matter of public importance debate about the fraudulent use of funds expended under the Department of Employment, Education and Training prosmall grams highlighted the government's accmintability problems. It is yet another demonstraof the government's inability to monitor in programs and account for disbursement of funds. In the last parliamentary sitting it was its famous sports rorts affair. In the spring sittings it is a question of watch this space for to the next example of extravagant waste. of taxpayers money by a government which has As I mentioned earlier in my speech, I would like to make particular reference to part 3 of the bill which proposes amendments to the the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, consequential to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. From 1 July this year, a $30 allowance will be paid in lieu of the present dependent spouse rebate for those parents who ((lect to stay home to care for their children. For the 840,000 Australian families where one parent, usually the mother, is caring for children full time in the home, the government's initiative is a case of not all that glitters is gold. The Keating government's lack of regard for the contribution made by parents caring ,for their children at home is demonstrated by to the yawning gap between the child-care cash prior rebate-which is worth $61.20 per week for two children-and the home child-care allowance, set at a maximum $60 per fortnight. The families across Australia in the latter a category have a right to feel cheated. Their caring for their children at home is deemed to the have about half the value of child care rethe ceivedby the 230,000 families who will past recovery receive the rebate. Women who elect to stay at home to look after their young children no doubt feel demeaned as a result of this Labor govern the ment's action. These women are not being recognised for their significant contribution to' the family unit and to our has, of society as a whole. The coalition has always recognised the need for choice for families when raising their children. Unfortunately, with the cashing out of of the dependent spouse rebate; the government has done nothing to extend support to those parents whose family priorities result in one parent staying horne to care for their children. This cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate and turning it into the home child-care allowance will not make a jot of· difference to the ability of the average :single income family's ability t? provide basic necessities and to meet the cost of raising children. Work by the Social Policy Research Centre has demonstrated that families' earning between $20,000 and $40,000 a year have been the big losers under Labor. Research by the Department of Social Security has shown that since 1983 when this Labor government was first elected a single income couple with two children on average weekly earnings is now nearly five per cent worse off in real terms. Other research studies have shown that there is no net assistance from government to families with dependent children. These families enjoy a real standard of living about three-fifths that of the rest of the adult work- year. ing population. The non-means-tested child-care cash rebate makes having two parents in the paid work force, getting their two tax, free thresholds their means test free child-care rebate, the 'logical-perhaps essential-financial option. It may not, however, be the better option. for their family's non-financial welfare. This issue of the right of choice keeps recurring. When parents would prefer to have the opportunity of continuous close personal contact and interaction with their young children, watching o'ver their developmental stages as they grow but are deprived from doing so because government financial policies impact on them, Australia's families are not being well. served. The Keating government discriminates against families with one income compared with those families who have both parents in the work force and who are eligible to receive a child-care rebate, of up to $61 per week for their children in external child care. It is a monstrous inequity which demom;trates no regard for those parents who sacrifice their income. and financial independence to stay home to nurture their children at a critical time of their children's' development. Further, the home child-care allowance is also income tested. An at - home parent cannot have income of more than $282 a year before losing this new benefit at a rate of $1 for every $4 of income. So a second-income parent who earns $282 a day or $282 an hour is eligible for $61 per week child-care rebate but a full-time parent will start to lose the home child-care allowance with an income of a miserable 78c per day.

36,Mrs SULLIVAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am trying harder and it is costing me more. For some time before coming into this parliament I had been very and active in politics and particularly in issues relevant to women. This was from the 1960s on, at probably the beginning of the women's movement. I wonder for how many more years its simple message will be misunderstood. The message back in the late 1960s and early 1970s was one of the right of choice for women of not being put into a particular mould, of rejecting the assumption that once they married they must have children and they must stay at home and look after those children full time or else they were unnatural women. The situation now seems to be a 180degree tum which indicates that the arguments that were being put' forward in those days have never been underStood in all the intervening years. We have it encapsulated by those child-care financial provisions. Let me make it absolutely crystal clear that the coalition stands for free choice. It is not opposed to the child-care cash rebate. In fact, it advocated it in the 1984 federal election and has done so in every election since. It would make fascinating reading indeed to go back over the statements of various Labor Party ministers and private members in the intervening years to find out why there could be no rebate where there were two parents in employment. The previous minister for sport rorts and all .those other things she was minister forMr Reith-And whiteboards. Mrs SULLIVAN,-Yes, that is right. She is on the record time and again, particularly as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the. Status of Women, as saying why one could not have a rebate for child-care costs when those child-care costs were related to earning an income. The statements are legion. Those statements are, of course, now flicked aside and not referred to at all by the ment. There is no attempt at justification of why it has taken over 10 years for this government to recognise that child-care costs can be a necessary expense of earning an income. I repeat, the coalition has long since recognised that need in its policies and went to the election 10 years ago on policies to that effect. So we are not opposed to the rebate. What we are opposed to is the situation the . woman who chooses the other option-which was the so-called traditional option-is' now put into, and how she is treated in contrast to the career woman. One of the things this bill does is fix up some sexist language and makes the language in the acts gender neutral. I thoroughly approve of that, let me make that very clear. I was very careful in the earlier stages of this speech to be gender neutral in my language. I am now not being gender neutral because in most cases the parent staying at home is the mother and I am presently focusing on that fact. It is highly relevant that we have this debate at the moment, because there is a lot of debate also going on about the subject of women in politics. I have really been itching for the opportunity to say this. The trouble we have with the subject of affirmative action or encouraging women into parliament is that, to this very day, the contribution of the full-time wife and mother is still regarded as zero by this community. That is the problem that women have at preselection councils. One of the government members opposite is nodding her head in agreement; it is the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith). If we were to look at the profile of the women in this parliament, we would find the following facts. A number of those women are not married and have no children. A number are married and have no children. A number of the rest married, had children, and-when their children were of a certain age, an age of independence-came into parliament. That tells you something. I came . in comparatively young, and childless. All the women who have come in here at an age on a par with men have come in childless. The honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Ros Kelly) is the exception: she had children after govern- she became a member. A profile of the women in parliament will also show that very few of them came in here' without having subsequently pursued a professional career of some ,kind. The thing that· irks me, despite my being a non-traditional woman, and irks those women who are, is that the political parties pay absolutely no regard to the abilities that are demonstrated by the woman who is the full time homemaker, rearing children and keeping house. This is indeed the real struggle. Such' women are not regarded as professional people by their political parties. Their backgrounds are considered to be irrelevant in terms of a recommendation for service in the nation's parliament. That is the issue that the parties must address, whether through quotas-in the Labor Party's case-or through the leader's support, in the Liberal Party's case. It is an issue, furthermore, that society must also address. The really sad thing about this child-care funding change is that it has only taken the step of recognising that caring for children is important in our community. If a decision to work means that children must be put into paid child care, then it certainly should be recognised that that expense is a necessary part of that parent's going to work and it is recognised through the child-care cash rebate. However, what it still has not recogJo1ised is that child care by a parent, usually the mother, is as valuable to society. Until that is done,. then none of us women, whatever our background-whether professional women, childless, or whatever-has made real pro gress., That must be recognised. That is the bottom line. As I said earlier, what women were reacting against, starting in the 1960s and through the 1970s, was being shoved into a mould contribution where a woman was not considered normal if she did not marry and have children, and then stay home and look after them full time. pushed for the right of choice and we said that, in the case of certain families, the option of the second parent-the mother-going to work could be better for a family, and that each family had the right of choice. What I have objected to here today is the financial penalty when the family decides that the better decision is for the second parentthe usually the mother-to stay at home and look after the children, bur does not then have equivalent financial support. This principle was established some time ago. Back in 1977 or 1978, the Fraser governnecessarily ment abolished the child endowment payment which went to the mother, and replaced it 'th th - '1 II WI e laml y a owance, a very muc upgrad ed and h Ig er mcome lor e mo er.

This bill, of course, cashes out the dependWe ent spouse rebate with the same rationale. have no difficulty with that rationale. rationale is. the same. But in process-of cashing out the dependent child rebate-a couple of important things happened, and they were stated at the time. Firstly; the big winners were those on low incomes because the actual amount paid them was not linked to income. It was the receive same for all families. People were not rebated according to their rate of taxation; they rebated a set amount. So there was some ment. financial equity there. The benefit paid did not depend on the amount of income earned. The second point of equity was that the into family allowance recognised the economic to this nation of child rearing. In those days, children were looked after much more in the home than through the child care We arrangements that we have these days. These are very important principles. They are principles that were broken by the Hawke government when it means tested the family allowance. I objected to that means testing at the time, as did the opposition. Family allowance thus became the only benefit-other than Austudy-that was means tested according to income of somebody other than the person receiving the benefit. It was an offensive the principle. The wife's payment-the mother's payment-was means tested according to the husband's income. As I said, the only other case where that happens is Austudy, which incorporates principles of dependency. The Fraser government's family allowh ance never incorporated principles of dependI . . If 'b' I · h·' th th ency. t was a prmclp e 0 contn utlOn. t £ kid d h ..

It is not a principle anyone of us accepts as individuals. all expect to receive remuneration accordI ing to the job we are doing and by an objecThe tive measure, and that is what the family the previous allowance used to be. However, Labor means tested it and decided that, because some women had husbands of an income of a certain level, those women's contribution in the full-time mothering role to was to no longer be recognised, or was to less recognition. That is utterly obnoxious on principle. Family allowance was never were a welfare payment under a Liberal governI repeat that it was a cashing out of the dependent child rebate, a transfer of child endowment into what was at the time stated, in words of one syllable, as a recognition of the value of the child-rearing role. Of course, if a parent wanted to then put the children into child care-the family allowance was not paid only to people who were full-time parents-and use that money to pay for child care, that was their choice. And that was the correct principle. All speeches by Liberal, Labor and National party parliamentarians at the time recognised and supported that principle. It was the Hawke government that moved away from it and got us into this real muddle of principles that we have at the moment. The family allowance has gone. It is now the family assistance' supplement, which is means tested, and goes only to families in need. I hav:e no problem with special payments to families in need. The Fraser government brought in the family income support payment, which was additional to family allowances, to assist low income families. That payment was also put into the family assistance supplement. We no longer have.the. family allowance. We no longer have a recognition that child rearing benefits everyone, and should be supported by this. community. That recognition has gone under Labor. Instead we have a child-care rebate, which we support, and the cashing out of yet another rebate-the dependent spouse rebate-for the home child-care allowance, which is not good enough. Whilst I take no objection to government members, men or women, saying nice things about the .childcare cash rebate-we support it and it should be supported-it is incumbent on members of the government, particularly women members, to go back to the government and ask, 'Are we fair dinkum about the importance of child care? Why is it so much more important when someone· other than a parent does it? Why is it that we will give this sort of recognition someone who is paid to do it as a job, yet we give such puny recognition to a parent who does it? Is child care of value or is it not? it is of value, why is it financially downgraded when it is done-usually-by the mother?' Let us face it, 90 per cent of the time the value of what we do in our community is measured in money. The contribution we are making for the work we do is measured by the financial return we get. I repeat: a parent who stays at home to look after the children and who gets an incomenot necessarily earns it-from, say, shares or a savings account starts .to be financially penalised when that income exceeds 78c per day. Either the job they are doing is of value and is therefore financially recognised, without a means test, or it is of no value. The child-care rebate to parents who work outside the home is not mea:ns tested. I would certainly support neither of the payments being means tested. . As I said at the be.ginning, the coalition supports the bill because it approves of what is happening in the a:rea of rehabilitation in terms of proper financial administration and recoupment of government expenses, and approves of the child-care rebate. However, we differ on some very significant points which go to the principle and the detail of the government's child-care provisions-not least how they reflect on the real status of women in Australian society. M;r GIBSON (Moreton) (2.33 p.m.)-'-I am pleased to participate in this debate and to support the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. I am also pleased to have the opportunity to follow the comments made by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), some of which I agreed with, some ofwhich I will disagree with. I will reiterate the main points in this legislation and then turn to some specific parts of it and respond to some of the comments that were made by the honourable member for Moncrieff. The legislation will amend two or three acts. Firstly, it will amend the Disability Services Act 1986 where it talks about recovto ery of costs of rehabilitation programs provided by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. The amendment to section 23 of the If act will cover the capacity of the Commonwealth to recover compensation. The amendment. to section 26 of the act relates to a client's right to have a decision reviewed by the secretary and to the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. An amendment to section 23(5) brings this legislation into line with what has been common practice in the government for many years. It has been the practice to serve notices in relation to the recovery of rehabilitation costs on insurers prior to the settlement litigation between the insurer and the insured person on the basis that the insurer is the person liable to pay compensation referred to in the aCt. It is accepted that no payment would be received until the court case has been settled. Legal advice indicates that, under section 23(5) of the act, notices should not be served until it has been determined by a court or by agreement between the parties that the insurer is liable to pay compensation. The Attorney General's Department has been consulted in the formulation of this amendment. Its advice supports the need for this legislative amendment. A number of other amendments are outlined in this amendment bill to the Disability Services Act that achieve tidying up changes and bring the legislation into line with the accepted practice. The other major section of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill relates to administrative changes to the financial provisions of the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, which enables the Health Insurance Commission to be involved in the payment of the child-care cash rebate system. These amendments are complementary to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, which introduced this new payment. It is within this context that I would like to make most of my comments this afternoon. Firstly, I will respond to some of the points made by the honourable member for Moncrieff. Once more, she has been guilty in her comments of only selectively outlining some of the provisions of the Commonwealth in support of families. She has indicated that she feels there is a yawning discrepancy between what we are paying in the home child-care allowance, which is a $30 per week payment, to the spouse remaining at home for the care of children and what we will be paying in the child-care cash rebate system, which is up to a maximum of $61. She claims that this shows a huge discrepancy and discrimination against those families where one spouse remains at home and cares for the family. However, the honourable member failed to talk about all the other components of the of the government's comprehensive· program of support for families. There is a great discrepancy in her argument because she failed to talk about what we provide to families in recognition of the important role played by the spouses who remain at home and care for children. The government recognises the important contribution to society and to the economy of the unpaid work undertaken by those people who remain at home caring for children. It is recognised that in the vast majority of cases those people are· mothers; The government also acknowledges that the skills of women with work force experience are also extremely valuable in an economy dependent upon the training and flexibility of the work force. So it is a question of getting the correct balance between the two competing needs within our economy. In properly assessing the impact of Commonwealth assistance for families, it is important to consider all of the allowances that we provide to families. The honourable member for Moncrieff talked about the home child-care allowance. What she has outlined is correct: it replaces and increases the dependent spouse rebate for families where one parent is caring for the children. Instead of the previous tax rebate being a tax concession that goes to the working partner, the taxpayer, we have now changed it to being a weekly payment to the carer of the child or children in the home. It will assist those families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the dependent spouse rebate. The home child-care allowance and the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate, which we are ensuring is implemented through this amendment today, will assist families with children, whatever their employment. status. They respond to work force participation patterns, which suggest that today most women will spend some time in the paid work force and some time at home caring for their children. The child-care cash rebate will be of great assistance to many women seeking to re-enter the work force through retraining or education. The home child-care allowance will be claimed by women leaving the paid work force to have children. Since 1983 the government has substantially improved assistance to low income families with children, including single income families. For example, between 1983 and 1993 additional family payments for children in low income families increased in real terms by 75 per cent for a child under 13 years and 147 per cent for a child aged between 13 and 15. Rent assistance has also been extended to low income working families. In particular, these payments go to those families where there is a single income. They are very much a direct cash contribution and cash support to those. families where one member of the partnership has remained at home to care for children. This support is paid to families with incomes under $60,000, with greater assistance targeted to lower income families with incomes less than $25,000. All family. payments are now, indexed automatically to account for changes in the cost of living. A large number of. families receiving the additional family payment are single income couples. Many of these· have previously been on higher incomes. They now receive additional assistance when one partner leaves the paid work force to care for a child and, therefore; has a reduction in income. Let us examine a family earning $35,000, with both partners working-one earning $20,000 and one earning $15,000-renting privately and caring for one child under 13. If that family had another child and the partner earning $15,000 withdrew from the work force, that family would receive nearly $123 per week in tax-free family payments. It is quite incorrect for the honourable member for Moncrieff to make out that the only payment that this government makes to those families where one partner withdraws from the work force to remain at home caring for children is the $30 a week home childcare allowance. A much larger amount of money is paid through the family payment system. In addition to that $30 a week home child-care allowance, these families would qualify for $123 in family payment, making a total of $153 per week, tax free, in child related assistance. The home child-care allowance is expected to assist 840,000. families, at a total cost of $1.13 billion, which is $230 million more than we currently pay through the dependent spouse rebate. That is an additional $230 million a year that the Commonwealth will be providing to support those families where one partner remains at home to care for children. About 55,000 families who were not eligible to receive the dependent spouse rebate will now be eligible to .receive the $60 per fortnight payment of the home child-care allowance. The home child-care allowance is also much more responsive to families whose circumstances change during the year, since it is based on current income rather than on income in the previous financial year, which was the way in· which the dependent spouse rebate worked. This flexibility is expected to assist up to 120,000 families whose circumstances change within any given year. When combined with the home child-care allowance, family payments make up a comprehensive package of support for families with children. The government will continue to provide access to child care for parents out of the paid work force for respite and occasional care. In addition, the government has increased child-care assistance, formerly known as fee relief, for occasional care. These (orms of care are an essential service for women .caring for children, as they allow them time to go shopping, to involve themselves in community organisations, or to attend to important family commitments. The .government will also provide an additional $1.5 million over the next three years to support the establishment of some 3;000 new playgroups, which will benefit an additional 50,000 families-all of those being families where one partner remains at home to care for children. Some single income families will also be eligible to receive this new child-care cash rebate from 1 July in circumstances where dependent spouses are paying for child care to enable them to study, train or look for work. In her comments this afternoon, the honourable member for Moncrieff claimed that the government is. restricting choice for women and that w,e are discriminating-she used that term anda lot of other emotive language to describe our actions in introducing the home child-care allowance and the child-care cash rebate-in favour of those families where both partl1 ers work, and that we are discrimi.:. riating against those families where one person remains at home to care for children. She says that, during her formative years in politics when she was actively involved in the women's movement, she sought to assert the right of women to have a choice. That is certainly the position of this government. But we are trying to achieve effective choice where, if people wish to re-enter the work force, we assist them in. doing that. We are doing that in a whole range of measures, not just in the support that we provjde in our child-care programs. The honourable member for Moncrieff failed to outline that, all through the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s and the early part of the 1980s, it was largely coalition governments that were in power. They had the opportunity to introduce some of these measures and failed to do so. From 1949 to 1983, apart from three years of Labor government, coalition governments were in power. They did not move to introduce any of these alleged new major improvements, as. coalition members are now urging the government to do, to support families in the home. That is the direction that we are taking. The honourable member has some hide coming into this place and attacking the Labor government for the introduction of the programs that we have put in place that support both killds of families-families where one partner stays at home and those where both partners are at work-when her party, which was in government for 31 out of 34 years, failed to take any such action to support them and has failed to demonstrate any capacity to deliver the types of support for families in the home that she is now urging this government to undertake. The honourable member for Moncrieff also expressed her strong disagreement with the government's policy of introducing a means test on family payments. She made much of the fact that she believes family payments should go to all families regardless of their income because, by introducing a means test, we are making the carer-the partner who has no formal source of income-answerable to the partner who has a source of income when the carer seeks to get family support payments from the government. She is suggesting that we should not put a means test on family payments. Family payments aredesigiled to assist families inrrieeting the additional costs of bearing children and raising them to adulthood. They are designed to bring about some equality between those families· which have no children and those that have children, and to assist them with the additional costs of raising children. But, as a government, we have not got an ul1limited pool of money and we cannot provide those family payments to every family regardless of their source of income. If we did that, we would have to. raise taxation levels, which would impact negatively on low and middle income families and take away a lot of the benefit that we gain from family allowance payments. It is a nonsense to suggest that families that earn $100,000, $200,000 or $300,000 a year in income should be eligible for family allowance payments. Family allowance payments are designed to assist families that do not have sufficient income to meet the needs of raising children. It is an absolute nonsense for the honourable member .for Moncrieff to suggest that we should have no means test whatsoever on family payments. It is a particular nonsense when she has been the one to lead the coalition charge in attacking us because we did not put a means test on the child-care cash rebate. I wish the honourable member would work out exactly what her position is on this matter. When we introduced the child-care cash rebate, she attacked us for not putting a means test on it. because it is a much more limited program targeted at a much more restrictive audience. We did not impose a means test on that, but she is' now saying that it is wrong for us to impose a means test on family payments. So I do not know· what she expects us to do. She attacks a means test in one area and then says that we should have imposed a means test in another area, both concerning family payments and designed to support families in the costs of raising children. The initiatives outlined by the government in the area of child care have been major. This government has been responsible for significant improvements in offering women a real choice as to whether they wish· to remain in the home or enter the work force. I agree with the honourable member for Moncrieff that this community does not give sufficient recognition to the contribution women make in unpaid work in both the home and the community. I believe it is long overdue for us as a community to give much greater recognition to that. The home childcare rebate will go some way towards achieving that. I certainly support the belief of the honourable member for Moncrieff that, within the preselection processes which parties go through in determining the eligibility of people to stand for election to local, state and federal governments, political. parties should give much greater recognition to the unpaid contribution that women make in the home and the community and that unpaid work should be given equal, if not greater, value to that of paid employment when determining the contribution women make in our community and, therefore, determining their eligibility for selection as candidates for the various political parties. These amendments to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 that we are discussing today are impq.rtant. I am pleased that the coalition is supporting the whole of the. bill. I commend the bill to the House.",65

However, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) attributed an action to me, namely, that I 'led the charge' on the means testing of the home child-care allowance. In other words, he said that I was critical of non-means testing of the home child-care allowance. Those words, or words to that effect, have never passed my lips.",72
41,Mr HORNE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It . gives me a great deal of pleasure to support my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) today. Any study of Australian families today shows that there has been a significant dramatic difference compared with the families oftwenty years ago. Many more women are in the work force. They are either part-time or full-time employees or running their own businesses. Women today are much more orientated towards a career that will take them through their full working lives. Over the past five years, the growth in women's labour force participation has been about 4.5 per cent. Now more than 50 per cent of women with young children are in the work force. More importantly, the future growth of the Australian economy and the living standards of Australians will benefit from women's participation in the labour force. However, most women have different work force patterns from men. They can expect to have periods of. their lives where they are out of the paid work force or working part time. Many women also need time to retrain or upgrade their skills because the nature of our work force changes as industrial needs change. The stress of combining changing patterns of work and family and community responsibility is falling heavily on women. Women are reshaping their lives and the government must respond to their needs. Child care is essential 'to give women choices as to how they combine work and family responsibi1ities. One of the facts to be taken into considerfamilies. ation is that child care is now a common experience for large numbers of Australian children. Some can expect to spend up to 12,000 hours of their early years 'in paid, many more. formal child care-as much as all the time they spend in primary education. That is why it is absolutely vital that children receive quality care in these important formative years and that parents do not have to worry about how their child is being cared for. Quality child care is essential for helping parents to remain in or re-enter the work force or to increase their skills through further education. This government believes responsibility to parents to ensure that this quality, affordable child care is available. is a point of pride that the child-care policy of this government is the most comprehensive and integrated ever adopted in the history of Australia. Its focus is on helping relieve and family pressures. In the national child-care strategy we have made a solid commitment to meeting the who demand for child-care places by the year 2000. An extra 29,000 new child-care places were funded in 1993-94 and the child-care places has quadrupled, from 46,000 in 1983 to almost 200,000 today. A target 300,000 places has been set, to be reached 1996-97. This government's record in building new child-care places is outstanding. It is import- children ant that the pace of growth is continued so that women have the confidence that they find a child-care place when they need it. government has also introduced a generous fee relief system which now assists two-thirds of families who use Commonwealth child-care centres. It is appropriately targeted income families. We have a needs based planning system to make surenew child-care places go where they are needed most. Over three years $5.3 million dollars is being allocated to support an industry based national accreditation scheme for child-care centres. When this is fully operational, extra funding will be available for training and resource centres participating in the scheme. There are also initiatives which encourage employers to assist with the child-care needs of working The government already provides child-care assistance to almost 10,000 employer sponsored child places and existing tax benefits have encouraged the provision· of Research shows that children are likely to be sick as often as nine or 10 times a year, with the period of illness usually ranging from three days to a week or more. This load falls particularly on working mothers. The provision of child care for employers supports demonstrable productivity benefits, including the reduction of absenteeism and the retention of skilled staff. Employers are thus the major it has a beneficiaries of child care. This government has also expanded services It 'for children with special needs, whether they are from non-English speaking backgrounds or with disabilities or simply live in remote or isolated areas. The family day care system has work been expanded with new centres set up and existing establishments expanded. Family day care is a wonderful choice for those parents want flexibility to arrange hours of care which best suit their individual needs. The secure, home-like environment is ideal for number of babies and young children. The ,children's services program has also of identified the need for out of school hours by care to meet the growing need for child care among school aged children. Quality outside school care enables parents with school aged to remain in or re-enter the; work force to increase their skills through further can education. An innovative new neighbourhood The occasional care concept. has also beenintroduced. This will provide parents who look after their children at home with more opportunities to take a break to attend appointto lower ments, such as visiting a doctor. In my own electorate hundreds of working families have benefited from this range of excellent programs. Our government also recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for women earning an income. That is why the child-care cash rebate is a great initiative. It will help families with the cost of child care associated with employment, training, education or job search. A feature of this support is that it is not income tested and will provide up to $61.20 per week for two or more children. Unlike a tax concession, the cash rebate is claimed as the cost is incurred, rather than up to 18 months later. That is why it is a fundamentally fairer system.",72
42,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! It being 3-OO p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The honourable member for Paterson will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA Aviation: Safety",74
43,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Transport. How does the minister reconcile the maintenance of Australia's high air safety record with the fact there were no regulations covering the charter flight of the DC3 routed to Norfolk Island and which ditched ill Botany Bay on 24 April 1994? Will he acknowledge that the lack of air safety regulations covering this flight contributed to the crash and that it was only the fortunate proximity of private fishing vessels that rescued the 26 passengers and the skill of the pilot which avoided what could have been the worse air disaster in Australia's history? What action has the minister taken to review the regulations relating to air charter flights ensure that no such event can happen again?,74
44,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member has asked this question of someone who has hadlo live all his life under the flight paths of the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and in the shadow of air disaster. My most vivid memories are of attending the scene of a DC3 which crashed into the lakes system at the Lakes Golf Club when I was a small boy. I was one of the first people present at the scene of that accident. As a state member of parliament, immediately after the crash of the King Air aircraft in 1980 I stood and witnessed the most horrific carnage that I have ever experienced. I had never seen disaster on such a scale. I have had this job as Minister for Transport now for four months, and I will tell honourable members this: no-one will put more energy into guaranteeing the high standards of aviation safety in this country than I. In terms of major air transport, Australia has an enviable safety record-indeed, it is the envy of the whole of the rest of the world; no-one does better-and the opposition should acknowledge that. But, whilst our performance with major aircraft safety is better than world best, our performance in charter operations and general aviation is no better than the rest of the world. That is something that should concern all of us, and I know it certainly concerns the honourable member for Hume who spoke in this parliament only yesterday on the issue of the Monarch Air disaster. I was appalled to learn that it is allegedwe have to await the outcome of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report before this is through-that because a plane was 50 years old it could undertake a sevel1-hour journey across the Tasman Sea which would not have been allowed had that aircraft been built after 1963. If that is the case, then clearly the regulations are defective. Unlike the opposition, I will not be prejudging that issue. The fact is that we have had a series of accidents. There was one on the weekend which I think anyone watching television would have been horrified by. The to scene reminiscent of the great Waldo Pepper involving a,couple of people being incinerated in a light aircraft I know shocked and appalled everyone who saw it. I have spoken to the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority. I put to the House that we in Australia are very fortunate to have had as the leader of the Civil Aviation Authority' since last year General Peter Gration. No-one has served Australia better and no-one is more capable of giving leadership in respect of the Civil Aviation Authority and the very important work that it must pursue. I have spoken to General Gration in respect of these incidents and, indeed, in respect of the action that must be taken, and must be taken immediately, after the interim report of. BASI into the Monarch Air disaster is available. I expect that report to come to me within the next 24 hours. It was in anticipation of that and following upon the 25 passengers landing in the water in Botany Bay that I personally contacted General Gration. I have his assurance that he will do everything in these areas necessary to guarantee the highest standards. I trust him and I trust the task that he undoubtedly will complete. Any recommendations in respect of the Monarch disaster, each. and every one of them, will receive every bit of my energy and every bit of my attention. I know that it was a disaster that tore apart a community and destroyed seven lives. Three of those people were school children. Mr Sinc1airWhat have you done about the regulations?",74
45,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have done a lot about the regulations. I got hold of the chairman only this morning. Only this morning the chairman assured me that this would receive his urgent attention. I repeat: we will pay the closest attention to each and every one of the recommendations from BASI. I will personally not rest until such time as I am assured that each one of them has been properly and comprehensively addressed. We must improve our standards in respect of general aviation and charter aviation and I will certainly be doing everything I can to achieve that outcome. Corporate Law: Western Australia Mr STEPHEN SMITHMy question is directed to. the Attorney-General. Has the Attorney-General seen reports of comments by the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, criticising both the federal government and the Australian Securities Commission for failing to effectively police corporate law. in Western Australia? Could the· Attorney General advise the House what th- government has done to improve the system of corporate regulation in Western Australia and Australia generally? Mr ThckeyThey are probably coming around to you with a brown paper bag.",75
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for O'Connor has not been asked to comment. Mr LAVARCHI had the good fortune last week to spend a number of days in Western Australia. Indeed, the honourable member for Perth was able to accompany me at a number of functions I was able to attend. I can say that the views expressed to me by . the business community of Perth certainly do not coincide with that being expressed by the .Western Australian Premier in terms of the acceptance and support of the Australian Securities Commission. It is fair to say that Western Australia joined the national corporations scheme of all the Australian jurisdictions I suppose with most reluctance and with most concern as to how the ASC would operate. I am pleased to be able to say that in the almost three years since the ASC has been an active operation in Western Australia it has built up a great deal of confidence in the local business community. The regional commissioner there, Murray Allen, I think has a good reputation amongst the local business community. That initial point should be made: the ASC is held in high regard among the users of the organisation. In terms of the allegation that not enough. has been done to prosecute outstanding offences flowing from the excesses of the 1980s, again the facts do not coincide with what the Premier's allegations are. Since 1 July 1991, in Western Australia alone there have.been 13 successful prosecutions in major cnmmal matters. Some 19 major civil actions are currently before the court. There have been some 41 prosecutions of major criminal matters and three prosecutions of major civil actions. Obviously, this does not include far more numerous m6re minor matters. Clearly, some investigations ate still under way involving activities in Western Australia. We await with interest the outcome of those investigations. The reality of the situation in the west indicates that the ASC is operating effectively. It is well respected by the business community there. Premier Court's utterances can be dismissed for what they are-the simple rantings of someone who goes on with state rights rhetoric on any issue. He just pulls out the next page. It does not matter what the heading is; he just goes on with exactly the same 'line. It is not supported by the users of the organisation in Western Australia. Aviation: Safety",75
47,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed .to the Minister for Transport and follows on from the answer he has just given to the honourable member for Fadden. Why has no action been taken, 11 months after the crash of a Monarch Air aircraft in Young last year, to bring to account those Civil Aviation Authority senior managers who defied the obvious and allowed Monarch to continue to fly .so that seven people were killed on 11 June last year on a Monar:ch aircraft that had had the autopilot removed and several instruments rendered inoperative that were vital to the safe operation of the aircraft, particularly when, on two separate occasions, airworthiness inspectors within the Civil Aviation Authority had recommended that Monarch be grounded and, in particular, after the managing director of the airline had admitted to fraudulently altering the registration of an aircraft to make it suitable for regular public transport? Mr Tim Fischer-Why indeed? Ten months later, and no action. .",76
48,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is absolutely untrue to say that there has been no action by the CAA. A great deal of work has been done by the Civil Aviation Authority and the BASI investigators during the months that· have elapsed since that accident last year. I know the emotion of the honourable member and I know the relationship that he has with his constituents in that close-knit community. He is not the only person in this House who had personal friendships with people who died on that occasion. My wife lost two friends in the process. The Civil Aviation Authority is well advanced in a range of reforms that resulted from the report of the Terrell inquiry into air safety and the CANs management of air safety which was brought down last year. Of the 58 recommendations of the Terrell inquiry, 38 have now been adopted and put in place. As late as the last 24 hours, I have received an assurance from the Civil Aviation Authority that it is proceeding with absolute haste to guarantee that the remaining 20. recommendations-bringing it to 58, that is the total number of recommendations-are implemented by the end of June this year. For the honourable member to say that there has been a tardiness on the part of the Civil Aviation Authority, I think is incorrect. To suggest, as he has, or to go further than to suggest, to declare the guilt of officers of the Civil Aviation Authority, as he did in the House last night and as he has repeated today, I think is also premature. For my part, I will await the BASI report that I will receive within the next 24 to 48 hours. Immediately I have it, I will make it available to the honourable member for him to study. I think that is entirely appropriate. I will also await . the outcome of the coronial inquiry, which will be conducted later on this year. I have assured him and the House, and I repeat that assurance, that not a stone will be left unturned in pursuing every one of the recommendations necessary to guarantee high standards of aviation safety in this country.

49,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Mr Jack H. Watson Jr, the personalrepresentativeof the President of the United States of America for Australian-American Friendship Week. On· behalf of the House, I extend to him a very warm welcome. NA Enterprise Bargaining",76
50,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. It is four weeks since the federal government's new industrial relations laws carrie into force. Can the ministerinfotm the House of the progress made in workplace bargaining under the federal industrial relations system? MrBRERETON - I thank the honourable member for Reid for his question and for giving me the opportunity of informing the House that more than one million Australians working under federal awards are now covered by workplace agreements under the Federal Industrial Relations Act-one million Australian workers. That represents 2,000 workplace agreements finalised before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and all of them finalised since October 1991. Indeed, this year the rate has picked up and half of those 2,000 agreements have been registered in the last 12 months. All told, federal agreement making now covers 45 per cenf of all workers under the federal award syste-. The spread of enterprise agreement making in the federal system leaves the performance of the state systems absolutely for dead. Let me indicate to the House just how well we have performed in comparison with the states. In New South Wales all they have managed is 579 agreements covering 43,000 workers, that is, 11 per cent of all of the New South Wales workers covered under state awards. This is the much vaunted New South Wales system. We have achieved 45 per cent penetration; they are back at 11 per cent. Indeed, all of the independent studies of the quality of agreement making indicate that, by and large, federal agreements are the higher quality, high productivity outcomes as well. In Western Australia-:Mr Tuckey interjecting",76
51,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that the honourable member will be interested-there are only a miserable 113 agreements covering 20,000 employees. It is even worse in poor old Tasmania, with 47 state agreements covering 744 employees. Yet we continue to hear from the states how well they are going and how poorly they regard the federal system. The fact is that the federal system under the existing legislation saw us run rings around them all. Of course that was before the amendments that have come into effect in the last month. At the moment, 90 per cent of all businesses with 500 or more employees in the federal system now have workplace agreements. But we are interested in picking up the rest. We are particularly interested in looking at the non-union or lightly unionised sector. That was one of the principal purposes of the Industrial Relations Reform Act. Already in its first four weeks of operation we have seen the first agreements put forward. Indeed, we have seen agreements registered without union involvement in terms of the arrangements that prevailed up until this year. Until now, workplaces in Australia did not have the opportunities that they should have had to negotiate these flexible agreements. The new act allows that to happen while at the same time reinforcing the award safety net for those people fortunate enough to move into the enterprise bargaining stream. This revolution in the federal workplace-a revolution that will continue as a result of this year's act-has been achieved at a time when the opposition has contributed nothing except a long debate about whether 10bsback should . be dumped along with Fightback and the GST. Budget 1994-95",77
52,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of a budget speech draft outline being circulated in Parliament House along with a minute. paper headed '1994-95 budget speech-draft speech modules', issued under the name of Mick Shadwick, Assistant Secretary budget policy branch? Is the minister aware that the 'Budget speech-draft outline (major themes)' deals with the ·items under the headings 'economic context', 'budget strategy', 'policy settings' and 'economic prospects'? In view of the requirement for absolute confidentiality of budget documents, will the minister urgently request the Treasurer to come before the House to explain whether the document is genuine; and, if it is, why it was released?",77
53,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not actually aware of the document to which the honourable member refers. Mrs Bishop-Here is the document, minister.",77
54,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If such a document were circulating so far in advance, no doubt she would be very pleased. The last time she commented on bureaucratic matters was to suggest that when the then Treasurer, and now Prime Minister, took decisions on floating the Australian dollar he should have actually gone through a very lengthy process of consultation before he did so, while in the course of that the money markets no doubt went spare. One thing that I will certain about in this place is that we will not be taking advice from the honourable member for Mackellar on processing propriety as far as financial matters are concerned.",77

65,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the minister aware of claims that the government has achieved little in tackling poverty in Australia? What does the government see as the role of the social security system in poverty alleviation?,78
66,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. This is an area where misconceptions abound and I have to say that some of the comments that have been made publicly by a number of people have .been highly misleading and inaccurate. A recent article by Ross Gittins this week's Sydney Morning Herald is an be absolutely honourable exception. The fact is that the safety net· that we provide through the social security system is the key instrument for poverty avoidance and . alleviation in this country. Our system has been reformed and improved over the course of the 1980s and the 1990s. We now have a system which has been carefully studied and found to be highly effective and efficient at its poverty alleviation and avoidance objective, to the point that' around 90 percent in net terms of payments made through the social security system goes to people who would otherwise be in poverty. This sharpening up of the targeting is a very major achievement of this government and is a crucial element in our efforts to keep fiscal policy in reasonable shape. The United States government, for example, is having to have a very close look at entitlement programs, including a substantial level of payments going to people on middle to high incomes, from the point of view of curtailing its own deficit in the next few years. I think we have achieved something major here. In the course of doing that, we have been to significantly improve the sitllation of those on low incomes, particularly the poorest in our society. Improvements have been made against",78
67,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,78
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister might just wait for a moment. Those on my right might respect the minister who is on his feet and giving an answer to a question asked by one of their side.,78
69,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The evidence is that major improvements have been made over the course of the last decade. For example, very substantial improvements in family payments and rental assistance have meant that payments to an unemployed couple with two dependent children under the age of 13 have doubled in real terms over that period. A sole parent with two dependent children renting privately at the beginning of this government's term of office was nine per cent below the poverty line. That person would now be in four per cent above the poverty line. A single pensioner renting privately is now 15 percent above the poverty line. Pensioners who own their own home are 49 per cent above the poverty line. A pensioner couple who own their own home are 62 per cent above the poverty line. In all these areas, there have been marked and major improvements against the Henderson poverty line, which itself has increased by 16 per cent over that period. So the increase in absolute terms is even more substantial against the increase in the Henderson poverty line. This is an enormous achievement. In addition to those payment improvements, the measures we have taken to extend occupational superannuation and to have a more effective child support scheme have meant that many of our clients are receiving substantial sources of income over and above the social security payments that they receive. The· area we tried to address in the last budget, which is the remaining area of concern, is single people on unemployment payments. At the time we came into office, they were 36 per cent below the poverty line. I regret to say that they are still somewhat below the poverty line, but we have made a huge Improvement in that time. In last year's budget, we prioritised them by making a real increase over and above the inflation rate. So, across the board, I think our achievements in this area are real and substantial. The claims by some that they are not are clearly false. Once again, I refer honourable members to th- excellent article by Ross Gittins in this week's Sydney Morning Herald which documents and tabulates them very clearly. DEET: Police Inquiries",78
70,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Justice inform the House whether or not the Australian Federal Police is inquiring into allegations of the misappropriation of substantial. funds by Palencia Pty Ltd from the Department of Employment, Education and. Training and ATSIC under the training for Aboriginals program? If so, can the minister inform the House of the progress of that inquiry? Has the minister informed the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs of that inquiry?",79
71,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can advise that I have been told an investigation is proceeding. But, of course, all operational matters are not ever disclosed in this House, and that practice has been universally applied. In relation to those further matters, I can make no further comment. Foreign Aid",79
72,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the Minister for Finance seen reports of statements calling for a huge increase in the amount of Australia's foreign aid? If so, is this consistent with other public statements calling for spending cuts in the present economic situation? What is the government's intention in the matter?",79
73,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a feature of Australian political debate at the moment, particularly since opposition members junked their Fightback document with a cheerful air-a plethora of them threatened to resign if it was not implemented in detail and to the It:;tter, and another plethora of them said that it represented their profoundest convictions about the future needs of Australia....;.that all discipline seems to have been lost on the part of the opposition. On the one hand, the opposition. spokesman on the Treasury is absolutely demanding massive cuts in public outlays. On the other hand, in just about any conceivable area of government policy one would care to think of, as a problem arises, a suggestion is made that more resources ought to be devoted to it. The most recent example of that is the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong, who called on the Prime Minister to intervene in the budget process to have Australia's overseas aid budget increased. In the last election he ran on a policy of reducing by $200 million over the next two years the amount devoted to Australia's foreign aid. He is one of those who appear to have been liberated so that one side of the opposition can perambulate about the place talking about the need for budget discipline and another section of the opposition can stand up and perorate on the need for more expenditure in particular areas. 'As it happens, of course, the public generally, and members of this House, will know what the government intends to devote to the area of foreign aid when the budget is announced, but I think it is worth pointing out these facts. Australia has a better record, in tenns of the percentage of our GOP assigned to foreign aid, than the United Kingdom, Portugal, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain, New Zealand, the United States and Ireland. It is in pretty good company, looking through the bulk of those nations. There is a very substantial immber of respectable countries among them, including some who are noted for a degree of generosity in the area of foreign aid, such as the United States and Japan; and the United Kingdom has not been regarded over time as niggardly. I might point out one or two other things about these nations. We have about 38 per cent of our GOP in the public sector. All of those nations which have a better perfonnance in percentage GOP tenns in foreign aid than Australia: have much higher percentages of their GOP in the public sector. They include the Scandinavian countries. They do come up with very good figures on foreign aid-such as 0.7, 0:8 and one per cent of GOP-but, for example, something like 72 per cent of Sweden's GOP is in the public sector. It is obviously in a position where, devoted to government attention each time its budget is considered, there is a very considerable amount more resources available for disbursement for any particular purpose, including foreign aid. I do not think there is any country with a public sector the size of ours-and there are only about two with a public sector smaller than ours, including the United States and Japan-that does better on foreign aid. So what consideration there is of foreign aid in the budget needs to be contemplated against that background. Building Better Cities Program",79
74,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Minister for Finance. Is it correct that $816 million was allocated under the One Nation statement of February 1992 over a five-year period for the building better cities program and that $798 million of that has been committed under this program? Is it also correct that the majority of this money-in fact, 80 per cent-has already been committed to capital city areas and that regional Cities of the size and population of Bendigo and Ballarat throughout Australia have virtually been ignored by the Keating government? Can the minister advise whether the $150 million for the national regional development strategy to be announced by the Prime Minister today at 4 o'clock is a new allocation of funds or is simply the 20 per cent of the original One Nation money being recycled?",80
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You really will need to wait to see the Prime Minister's statement before you can make a judgment about that. I am obviously not going to get up in this question time and deal with matters that are contained in the white paper. I will go to the basis of your question on the better cities package that has been put in place to this point. The sorts of figures that you are talking about sound, off the top of my head, roughly of the appropriate dimensions. It has to be said that those propositions in the better cities program are basically aimed at ensuring that we optimise the use of public utilities to ensure that our cities, which have a very substantial tendency to spread expansively, have that process somewhat corrected. It is natural, in those circumstances, that where there are the greatest centres of popula.;, tion there is likely to be a strong tendency in the program to recognise them. I would have thought that the sorts of figures that the honourable member referred to, which were figures related to where the bulk of the Australian population lies, would be the sorts of areas that would be likely to pick up programs. I might say that all those programs are put in place on the basis of consultation with state governments and most of them reflect the priorities that state governments put forward themselves. If the honourable member has a complaint about that in relation to his area, perhaps he should have a chat with Jeff. Construction Industry: Reform Mr OCONNORI address my question to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask the minister whether he can inform the House as to the progress of reform in the Australian construction industry and the extent to which a report released yesterday in Victoria contributes to the reform process.",80
76,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Good, and thanks to the honourable member for Corio becauseMr Bruce Scott-Good, and thanks!",81
77,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I beg your pardon? I started by saying that I wanted to thank the honourable member for Corio for bringing that report to my attention. It is a report of the Victorian parliament. I understand that he has an interest. in the construction industry and has been following that report. We now have a report which contributes nothing to reform in the construction industry. I think that is a sad thing, because the Victorian parliament's own report into the construction industry flies in the face of the Victorian government's cooperation with the Commonwealth government over reform of the construction industry. That is the most disappointing aspect. So under the Commonwealth process-where we have the Construction Industry Development Agency-the Victorian government, along with other conservative governments, has seen the light and the need for cooperation in order to improve the construction industry. But not so the conservative elements of the Victorian parliament. That is the most objectionable part of the report that was handed down yesterday and, as I say, brought to my attention by the honourable member for Corio. One of the so-called important conclusions of the. Victorian report is 'the Victorian building and construction industry is critically divided on what the basic productivity objectives are .and how to achieve such objectives.' That ignores the fact that there are dozens of enterprise agreements in the construction industry ·which themselves define productivity and which themselves have produced greater productivity in the construction industry. So the report is outdated and does notunderstand the sorts of processes that are taking place now between construction agents and the building unions. It also flies in the face of real live facts like the fact that, as a result of reforms in the construction industry, the Great Southern Stand at the MCG-as I have mentioned here before and which was a $130 million project-was built four months ahead of schedule. So the Victorian parliament, or at least the conservatives in it, are unaware that their . own Great Southern Stand was built four months ahead of schedule. ' They appear to be unaware that, in the years between 1989and 1992-for which we have figures-on the aspect of industrial disputes, for instance, an average of 38 days were lost on projects started in 1989 compared with 17.1 days lost forprojects commenced in 1992. In a recent survey of 50 projects in the construction industry, 85 per cent of those projects met or bettered their cost targets. So here it is: the conservative elements of the Victorian parliament are at loggerheads with their own Vict()rian government, which has cooperated in our process in the reform of the construction industry, and have ignored the very practical processes of reform in that industry. Criminal Justice Commission: Queensland Mr KATTERMy question is directed to the Attorney-General. I refer to an' article appearing on page 3 of today's Australian newspaper outlining a QueenSland CJC investigation' into allegations that a 'senior ALP identity'is alleged to have been provided thousands of dollars worth of sex from prostitutes, paid for by a man with New South Wales underworld connections, over a twoyear period. Having, along with many of my past colleagues, suffered under trial by innuendo and, since the corridors of this place's inside players have been all morning naming a certain person, that person is owed, in my opinion, a speedy and public denial by yourself. If, on the other hand, these allegations constitute, as they appear to do, a prima facie case of corruption at the highest levels, can the Attorney-General advise what were the quid pro quos for such generous, non-taxed fringe benefits? Further, if such is the case, call the Attorney-General assure the House that Mr X will be brought to judgment and given a fair trial-I might add, a courtesy he never extended to thousands of ordinary, working-class north Queenslanders? Will the Attorney-General confirm or deny that the senior ALP person referred to in the Australian article was the ALP's most powerful figure for over a decade, ex-Senator Graham Frederick Richardson?",81
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Attorney-General might take some care in responding to the particular question that has been outlined so that it conforms to our standing orders. Mr LAVARCHThank you for that guidance, Mr Speaker. I have seen the article in the Australian today. It refers to an investisands gation by the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission. The activities and investigations of the Queensland CJC are not referred to me, the Minister for Justice or the Commonwealth government. They are obviously matters for that particular body. I can give no advice whatsoever as to whether there is an investigation of this type or whether the allegations contained in the article are true or otherwise. I am simply not in such a position. I would, however, express my extreme disappointment in the honourable member arid the action that he has now taken. Mr BevisNot much is honourable about him. Mr LAVARCHYes, I think 'honourable' .is probably an undeserved term in this situation. In your preamble you announce that people are entitled to certain protections. Such protections, as I understand it, would be provided by the legislation which governs investigations by the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland. If the honourable member were to make a similar statement outside this chamber, I imagine there may be some action there. For the honourable member to come into this chamber and perform in the way he has does no credit to this House and particularly no credit to him.",82
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Lilley, I remind honourable members that when the honourable member for Kennedy asked his question, I made some commel1t to the Attorney General before he responded. I draw the attention of honourable members to the standing order to which I referred, which is 153, and ask them all to look at that. Veterans: Pensions Mr SWANMy question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Is the minister aware of recent media reports suggesting that veterans entitlements are likely to be adversely affected as a result of recommendations contained in a report on veterans compensation soon to be released? In particular, is the minister aware of assertions by the honourable member for Wide Bay On ABC radio in Queensland to the effect that thouof service pensioners are about to lose their pensions as a result of this report? Can the minister assure veterans in my electorate, the electorate of Richmond and many other electorates that such statements are irresponsible and untrue? Can the minister advise the House as to when the report of the compensation review committee, chaired by Professor Peter Baume, will be released and when the government's response will be provided?",82
80,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lilley for his question. I am sure that everybody, including honourable members on the other side, will want to listen to this answer because we all have veterans in our electorates. It is true that there have been a number of media reports, It is also true that, as a result of a 1992 Auditor-General's report which was critical of the veterans compensation system, my predecessor, John Faulkner, commissioned an independent review by a committee chaired by Professor Peter Baume < and assisted by Air Vice Marshal Richard Bomball AO and Ms Robyn Layton, an Adelaide QC. The committee was asked to consider the Auditor-General's report and the High Court case of Bushell. The committee reported to my predecessor on 18 March 1994. The government has examined the report and will respond in the budget context. < Mr Tim Fischer interjecting",82
81,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I intend to release the report, to answer the question of the Leader of the National Party, on Monday, 9 May, just prior to the presentation of the budget. Naturally, I cannot disclose the government's response until budget night. But in general terms, I can say that under this government the principle will always remain that the service community is a unique and highly respected section of our society and deserves to be treated in a special way. All Australians owe veterans from all campaigns a huge debt of gratitude-a debt which will be very difficult to repay in the future. Accordingly, this principle has been at the forefront of government's thinking during budget ations and it will be well maintained next Tuesday. I tum to the assertions made on ABC radio in Queensland by the honourable member for Wide Bay, as mentioned by the honourable member for Lilley, and also to an article his local newspaper headed, 'Veterans' pensions may face government threat-Truss'. The honourable member for Wide Bay is not a bad fellow; he is quite a good felIow. But on this occasion he has been a very naughty boy. He is out there scaring an older section of our community by making people think they are going to lose entitlements which they will not lose. I would ask him to be the fellow that he is and stop doing that. I reject absolutely his prophecies. Further, irrespective of any recommendaproposing tions of the Baume committee, I can assure the House that all legitimate claims will continue to be recognised and that no signifiruptcy cant changes will be made without consultasions tion with our ex-service community. That has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. In conclusion, I inform the House that tions. any new initiatives arising from the government's response to the Baume report will not result in the reduction of any existing pensions. Wilkinson, Miss K: Abduction",82
82,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the regrettable though now regular absence of the Prime Minister, my question is directed to the Minister f@r Finance, who I understand is standing the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, who usualIy repreof sents the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to the plight of a young woman, Miss Kellie Wilkinson, from Caloundra electorate, and her companions, who were kidnapped at gunpoint about three weeks ago by the Khmer Rouge guerillas in Cambodia, exand also to my representations to the Prime Minister on behalf of the Wilkinson family seeking his intervention to secure the immediate release of Miss Wilkinson. Can the . minister outline to the House what steps, if any, the Prime Minister and the government have taken or are prepared to take to secure the Miss Wilkinson's freedom from this terrorist delibergroup at the earliest opportunity?",83
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not have a brief on the material which the honourable member has asked his question on. I will check with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and provide the honourable member with a note on the in matter to answer his question. Bankruptcy Law,83
84,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice. Does the minister agree that there is a need to reform existing bankruptcy laws and, if so, what are the. government's intentions in this area?",83
85,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable memgood ber for the question. The government is committed to modernising many aspects of the law. Recently three discussion papers reforms to the Bankruptcy Act were published. They were circulated to all interests in the community concerned with bankmatters. A large number of submiswere received from registered trustees, conSUJ;ner organisations, banks, credit unions and other interested individuals and organisaThe government has analysed. all the submissions and proposes to bring forward legislation which will do three things. It will overhaul part X of the act, which provides for negotiation of voluntary insolvency administrations and, in keeping with the government's commitment to improve access to the law, there will be a new form of administration to in for be known as consumer compositions. Mr Cadman':""- Mr Speaker, I raise a point order. The minister is clearly announcing policy. He says that they have ,had an inquiry. He now wishes to announce the government's in my intention as regards the legislation.",83
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no point of order. The minister has been asked to respond to aspecific question, and he is doing so.",84
87,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If honourable members had any knowledge whatsoever of this field, they would realise that cabinet made this decision some little while ago and public releases were issued. I am simply responding to a question from a member who is interested-as, clearly, the opposition is not-in making sure we do provide the most efficient and effective means of providing fair processes for those unfortunate enough in our community to find themselves in the position of facing financial difficulty. The new form of consumer composition that we will be introducing in legislation to this House will, for the first time, mean that we have a convenient and more appropriate process for smaller debtors to negotiate alternatives to bankrqptcy. The package will also allow trustees to quickly and cheaply recover property' disposed of by bankrupts in an attempt to defeat creditors. We have also asked the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia to continue its process of making sure it develops a convenient one-stop service for those who seek its assistance so that they can be facilitated in getting appropriate advice without difficulty or delay. 'The elements of that reform package will go a very substantial way to improving the administration of the bankruptcy system. Whilst we occasionally hear crocodile tears from the other side relating to numbers of bankruptcies, we hear very little noise now, given that the numbers are going down. I wish that those opposite would have some concern for getting systems in place which will be of benefit to those who are unfortunate enough to face those difficulties. Adelaide Airport  Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport. Is it a fact that the former manager of the Adelaide airport, Mr Lou MACKrall, was dismissed from that position by the, Federal Airports Corporation because of his support for the extension of the runway at the Adelaide airport? In light of this, will the minister conduct an inquiry and report to the House on aviation industry claims that the current manager, Mr Mike Lennon, was appointed specifically because of his opposition to the extension of that runway?",84
88,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I must admit that I know of no such claims or allegations. If anyone has any evidence of substance to support those allegations, I will most certainly ensure that they are properly and fully investigated. The Adelaide airport issue is one that I have discussed with the Premier of South Australia as late as the last two weeks. I have indicated to him the federal government's support for his plans to see that airport developed at a much earlier than might have been anticipated date. So let the, House be under no doubts that the government is not in any way opposed to the aspirations of. the Adelaide community, the government of South Australia and any individuals who would seek to see a beuer, bigger and more effective airport servicing the needs of, that state. I can only say to the honourable member for Sturt that, if he has any evidence-but it had better be evidence of substance-he ought to put it forward. But I certainly have not heard any suggestion at all along the lines that he has raised this afternoon until this very moment.",84
89,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Wilkinson, Miss K: Abduction Mr BEAZLEYI was asked a question earlier on, and a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been handed to me. He says that the Australian Embassy in phnom Penh, .together with the British Embassy, has been working closely on this issue with the Cambodian government, which has primary responsibility for achieving the release of Miss Wilkinson and her British companions. The trio has been held by the Khmer Rouge since 11 April 1994. He is satisfied that the Cambodiangovemment is fully committed to gaining the group's safe release. The minister is similarly satisfied that every possible effort has been made by Australian officials in Cambodia to assist both local authorities and members of Miss Wilkinson's family. Both my colleague Senator Bolkus and the secretary to the department of the Minister for Foreign Affairs were recently in Cambodia and discussed with Cambodian ministers and officials our concerns for the safety of the group. It was as a result of representations by the Australian and British ambassadors that King Sihanouk wrote an open letter to the abductors requesting the release of the captives. Cambodian authorities have received a number of unconfirmed reports of sightings of the captives, who have been moved around the Kampot region. These reports indicate that Miss Wilkinson and her companions are unharmed. Consular officials have been in Sihanoukville, in southern Cambodia, since the abduction and are in close contact with local police and military officials. Two Australian Federal Police officers with previous Cambodian experience are on hand to provide advice to embassy officials.

91,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My question is in relation to standing order 144, which in part states: Questions should not ask Ministers(b) to announce the Government's policy, but may seek an explanation regarding the policy Government in its application . . . It has come to my attention over a period that members from the other side have asked very broad, generalised questions which have led to ministers announcing policy in their responses. As members of the opposition try to be vigilant in seeing that the standing orders are in fact enforced, how can we ensure that that particular standing order is enforced when, clearly, you are ruling that once the minister has started answering a question by announcing policy then obviously the question cannot be ruled out of order? Will you also consider being more vigilant in ensuring that questions are in order under that particular standing order?",85
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The honourable member raises a point that from time to time his colleagues take points of order in respect of within this place. When they feel that a particular question does go to a matter of announcing policy they raise that. In most cases-in fact, in all cases that I can recallthe minister is reiterating what was announced previously as a government decision. Where a member asks for amplification of that in a question, that is in order and will be ruled accordingly. I will take your suggestion to be ever vigilant on the questions that are asked.

94,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I ask a question in relation to the matter just put to you by the honourable member for Moore regarding standing order 144(b). I draw your attention to. a recent practice which was repeated today. It has now become a practice of the of members to ask dorothy dix questions of a minister about the government's 'intention'. It appears that on each occasion this particular word is used we then get an announcement of policy. Would you have the Hansard reviewed to see how many times after the word 'intention' is used in a question the answer is in fact an announcement of policy which is in contravention of the standing orders?",85

97,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I seek leave to make a ministerial statement relating to the white paper on employment, industry and regional development. Leave granted.",86
98,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"This white paper reflects the collective concern of Australians and their collective ambition. Their concern for their fellow Australians, their ambition to make this a good society and a great and successful country. It is a statement about the two imperatives of a decent society-compassion and strength. About the bonds which exist between all Australians-and the premium this country places on the talent and energy of every individual. It is about the desire to extend the safety net and basic services which expand equality of opportunity and go to make a truly civilised society-and the ability to pay for them. This is a white paper for the times we live in: an era of unprecedented change and equally unprecedented national opportunity. It is also an era in which hundreds of thousands of Australians, through no fault of their own, are bearing the burden of that change and are denieq their share of opportunity. Unemployment is without question the greatest problem we face. Unemployment saps the confidence and self-esteem of our fellow Australians-which in turn saps the nation's. It damages the social fabric. It has profound consequences for our social cohesion. As we have seen in other countries, ignored and neglected as a social problem, left to a fate to be decided solely by 'market forces', unemployment threatens to create a permanent underclass.lt threatens to create the conditions for social decay. We are not alone among nations in this-it is endemic to the Western developed countries. This government for one is determined to deal with the problem. I said on election night last year that we will not leave - the unemployed behind. And I said on Australia Day this year that this recovery must be shared by all of us. The white paper I present to the House today, entitled Working Nation, delivers on those two commitments. But success will not come easily: with this white paper we cannot say that the battle has been won, but we can say that it has been joined, and we sincerely hope not just by the Commonwealth government. It has to be understood that success here depends upon all Australians joining the effort. That means business and trade unions and communities. It means all tiers of government. If we-do want to reach the point where we can say that every Australian who wants a job can have one, it will require a conscious and concerted national effort. So we do not say that this white paper will wipe away the problem at a stroke, but we do say that Australia will not leave people neglected and forgotten. Through this document, Australia says to those who are out of work: we believe you are entitled to the benefits of recovery and a chance to contribute to it. If you do not have the appropriate skills, we will help you get them. If you are young, we will see that you are trained. If you have been a long time out of work, we will offer you employment and training, if that is what you need. It says we will do all we can to help make you ready for a job. The means of giving concrete expression to our intentions constitute the most profound reform of Australia's labour market and social security provisions since World War II. The new provisions are tailored to meet the needs of the unemployed in the modem Australian economy. They will serve Australia for many years. The white paper is a statement of policy on employment and growth. It takes the viewthe incontestable view-that economic growth is the key to employment growth. The evidence is very plainly there in this recoverywe have already seen 230,000 new jobs created in the past 12 months. That is why a substantial part of the white paper addresses itself to the means by which Australia can achieve higher levels of competitiveness. One of our great goals in these last years of the century must be economic efficiency, and the micro-economic reform and other measures described in this paper are no less important than the training, labour market and social security reforms. The government believes that Australia can sustain or improve upon the present rate of low inflation growth through to the end of the decade. The period wi\l be characterised by a continuation of the trend towards successful small and medium size enterprises producing sophisticated manufactures for export. It will also see continued growth in sophisticated services. Australian business and industry will need to be increasingly flexible, innovative and responsive to customer needs. It will need these qualities to succeed in the increasingly competitive markets of the world. As these companies grow, jobs will grow with them. But we know from the experience of the 1980s that very largely these new jobs will go to new entrants to the labour market and not to the long-term unemployed. As the green paper indicated, even with strong economic growth, without intervention of the kind we have decided to undertake in this white paper, by mid-1998 there would still be some 290,000 people in the pool of long-term unemployed. This is not only profoundly unfair, it is profoundly inefficient. It is a waste of our greatest resource-the talent and energy of our people. Returning the long-term unemployed to the productive process of the-nation not only returns them to the income, social interaction and creativity which work provides, it taps their potential for the good of Australia. As the white paper says, when we employ these otherwise wasted human resources we are made stronger. Large numbers of long-term unemployed people demand large outlays on social security and other assistance. Furthermore, having so many people effectively disqualified from the work force reduces the efficiency of the labour market. In this recovery, the complement to skill formation in the labour market is not going to come from migration. This time it has to come from training our own people, including those who are presently unemployed. The details of the government's policy reforms are speJt out in the second volume of the white paper. The measures I am announcing today will cost $1.7 billion in their full year. Those who may question the cost of these measures should ask themselves what are the costs of doing nothing. The cost of failing to introduce the major efficiency and equity benefits to the labour market, industry and the regions that this package describes. It is important to note that we have been able to accomplish these fundamental reforms consistent with' our target of a deficit of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. For the information of honourable members, I will concentrate on only the most substantial of the new measures. Central to the government's strategy for getting the long-term unemployed back into work is the job compact. The job compact puts new obligations on both the government and those receiving unemployment benefits. The government will provide to those who have been on unemployment benefits for 18 months or more individual case management, training and support and the offer of a job for six to 12 months. Individuals will be expected to take the job or lose their benefits. We will also introduce measures to identify people at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Together with those who have been continuously unemployed for' 12 months, these people will be given individual case management, including remedial action in such areas as literacy, numeracy, language and vocational training and access to relevant labour market programs. It is expected that over half a million people will receive individual case management each year. This is a radical program, a qualitative change in the way we approach labour market problems. The objective is to make long-term unemployed people ready fora job,and break forever the pattern in which the ,long-term unemployed become steadily more dispirited and unqualified for employment, while employers become steadily less inclined to consider them employable. In other words, the purpose of the job compact is principally to see that a substantial proportion of the new jobs in the recovery go to long-term unemployed Australians. A new training wage will be introduced to first provide employers with extra incentives to hire long-term unemployed workers and invest in their training. The training wage encourages employers to provide training places in two ways. The award wage will be discounted for accredited training and the employer will receive a wage subsidy from the government at a level above what it would be if no training were involved. This represents a substantial incentive for employers to play their part in the national effort. . An in-principle agreement on the training wage has been reached with a high level ACTU committee which will be recommending its adoption to the ACTU executive. The government will also be consulting with employers on the details of the training wage. To deliver case management and job placement services, the government will radically change the labour market by engaging community and private sector agencies. Job seekers will have a choice between these and the CES, with the competition between them regulated and encouraged by a new authority-the Employment Service Regulatory Agency, ESRA. The CES will be revitalised to meet the greater responsibilities placed upon it by the job compact and other initiatives. Additional resources, extra training of staff, external recruitment and improved information technology will be brought to the operations of the service. The emphasis will be on closer relations with employers, greater skills and efficient delivery through more sophisticated technology and coordination. For instance, job boards and job cards in CES offices will be replaced with computerised vacancy systems featuring user-friendly technology to encourage self-help job searches. As the white paper says, we are never going to return to a world where large numbers of full-time jobs are available for unskilled young workers. As the keys to a successful modem economy are skills, ideas andinnovation, the keys to employment are· education and training. It cannot be stressed too muchin the modem economy skills are our greatest competitive advantage. Whether it is in global enterprises or local small businesses, it is on the ability of our people to add value that our standard of living depends. It is on skills that every individual's standard of living increasingly depends. In the past decade, the number of young people completing year 12 or an initial postschool qualification has dramatically increased. However we are still below the average for the DECO and well short of the goal that all Australian governments have set-namely, 95 per cent of 19-year-olds by 2001. The white paper describes the governmenfs program for building the skills of young Australians. The three principal elements of new government policy are: first, the government aims to encourage young people to stay in education and training by giving them appropriate financial support and more relevant courses run jointly· by schools and industry. Second, we will be increasing the number and range of entry level training places for young people-by an estimated 50,000 by 1995-96. And thirdly, we will be introducing as a major policy change a youth training initiative for unemployed young people. The key .to success is to provide help at an early stage in the unemployment cycle, which means with the least possible delay after leaving school. The principal features of the youth training initiative are: intensive case management, with an initial assessment of skills and knowledge, .fot all unemployed people under the age of eighteen a doubling of the number of labour market and vocational training places for young people assistance in finding a job, and reformed income support arrangements to help keep. young people in education or training. Under the youth training initiative--,.in the clearest possible signal that every young Australian should be in education, training or employment-unemployment benefits-or the jobsearch allowance will be replaced by a youth training allowance. Investing in skills of Australians, particularly young Australians, is the best investment we can make. This is recognised well beyond the realms of government. Industry is increasingly recognising it and increasingly. indicating its desire to playa part. We are very well aware of industry's concerns about the relevance of current training and for this reason we are anxious to engage industry in both the design and delivery of courses. In future, Australian vocational training will be available through traineeships based in schools, TAPE, industry and labour market programs and will be available to adults as well. A training wage which offers a much simpler alternative to the multiple industry-specific rates currently applying will be available to employers who provide entry-level training. The social safety net was a term first used in the 1940s by Ben Chifley. He thought of it as the net under a trapeze artist, 'to break the fall towards destitution and sustain a man and his family while they help him climb the ladder of opportunity again'. The basic principle of the safety net remains the same-and so does the basic necessity in a decent society to maintain it. But circumstances have changed and so must the way we design the net. The most fundamental difference is that no longer do families depend on the man alone to bring in the income. In general, the present social security system continues to assume that only one member of a couple, in most cases the husband, will be actively looking for work while the other will be a dependant. This ignores the increase in employment for women. It means that unemployed couples have not been encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities in the labour market. Over the last 10 years, the gap between income support for a married couple and income from lower paid jobs has also narrowed and the incentive find work has been greatly diminished. In another basic structural reform· of our income support system, young unemployed couples without children will need to qualify for unemployment payments in their own the right and the joint income test for unemtunity ployed couples will be abolished. The effect of this will be to encourage both partners to seek work. It also means that many low income working families will gain extra income support. Under the current social test, after a modest level of income, for every dollar of income earned, a dollar of income support is lost. From July next year dollar-for-dollar taper will be replaced with 70c in the dollar taper which will mean that people will always be better off from working because work will always increase their total income. In another radical initiative, a parenting commitment. allowance will be introduced to provide an independent source of income for parents in low income families who care for dependent children under 16 years of age. The parenting allowance will effectively provide a payment for one parent free of any obligation to .Seek work. There will also be a more generous income test for those who wish to combine parenting economy. with paid work. By any measure, this is a major reform. The simplest measure is thisit will mean an extra $59 per week on averachievements age for nearly 120,000 low income families. The parenting allowance signals a new apuneven proach to income support based on the right of people to be paid as individuals, rather than as dependent partners. In this, and in fact that it constitutes greater recognition women's role in the work force and the ing growth in part-time and casual employment, the parenting allowance is consistent with changes to income testing. If we do not take remedial action, the long term unemployed and many young Australtax ians' at risk of joining their ranks, will be relegated to the margins of our national life and miss out on the opportunities offered the present recovery. The same can be said of many of the regions of Australia. The to paper presents a new Commonwealth approach to regional development. If we are to make the most of all our national resources, including the skills and energy of our people, we need to ensure that regions of Australia are given the opporto flourish-that they become partners in Australia's growth. As the white paper says, to neglect the regions is to neglect not only a great many Australians and all that they have to give this country, but to pass up the opportunity to build a stronger and more security income diverse economy. Three reports on regional development have been received by the government in recent the times-the Kelty task force report, the a MCKinsey report and the report of the Industry Commission. The principal lessons to be learned are that the regions, though presently enjoying very different degrees of success, have in common an abundance of energy and The government takes the view, with Kelty and MCKinsey, that the most effective approach for the Commonwealth is to provide strategic assistance of a kind that will help the regions to make the most of their human and physical resources. More often than not, this will require them to integrate their local economies with the national and international The white paper instances some remarkable and some other places where major obstacles have yet to be overcome. The performance of our 'regions in large part flows from an uneven quality of organisation and leadership. The white paper details the the way in which the Commonwealth governof ment will support the formation· and functionof regional groupings and provide assistance to regions so that they can develop and the implement effective strategic plans, with an emphasis on international best practice. We will also be significantly modifying the treatment of infrastructure bonds and taking other steps to encourage private sector investment in regional Australia. We will also by provide funds for capital works where it can be demonstrated that their completion is vital white to local economic performance. The white paper nominates two regional development projects the government will support which may be taken as models for other regions in Australia. The. Goulburn tures. Valley and the. Sunraysia have developed plans for ecologically sustainable, highly productive, self-funding, irrigated agriculture whicp will repair the environment and greatly increase the contribution to GDP: The Suriraysia is expected to double output in next two decades. The government will prm'ide funding for essential capital works projects and support for restructuring through the rural adjustment scheme. I will be going to the Sunraysia on Friday to see first hand the proposed projects and meet with some of the region's leaders, It should be noted also that reforms to the labour market, education and training and social security contain provisions f<?r grams which will be specifically. tailored to regional needs. In addition, some 60 DEET area consultatiers tive committees will be created and they seek to establish direct links with successful regional development. organisations. The consultative committees will include employdecade. ers, local and state government representatives and education and training providers. Just as it is essential that we do not allow the long-term unemployed to become cut off from the mainstream of society, it is equally important that we take steps to see that regions of Australia are not left to drWt outof the nation's economic and social life. reforms and initiatives necessarily depend on continuing economic growth. They depend the ability of Australian enterprise to flourish and carve out a future in the world economy and especially the Asia-Pacific. For that reason the white paper contains a statement the government's indu""stry policy. In summary, thethr.ust of government policy is towards globalisation, ness and productivity. We are seeing major success from measures already taken: a dramatic increase in exports, the rise ""dynamic small and medium sized businesses which have been born of the export culture developed in the last decade-'born global' in other words..,..;.the growth of manufactured exports to rank now with agriculture and mining as a proportion of GDP and the rapid growth in exports of sophisticated manufacThere is no question that our policies, including our tariff policy, are enabling Australia to be a competitive player in the regional and world economy. There is equally no question that we have nQ choice but to the continue the process of reform which alone will keep us in the race. The white paper contains a broad statement of the principles governing our industry policy and a number of specific measures consistent with those principles. The process of micro-economic reform will continue. A consistent goal of the next few years must be economic efficiency. The principles of best practice, which many Australian companies prohave adopted, must be adopted by the nation itself. In this, as in all the measures described in this white paper, much depends on other of government, on trade unions, business, will communities, the people of Australia themselves. It demands a continuation of the great cultural shift which has occurred in the past .'Fhe government sees its proper role as creating a competitive environment for industry and, by strategic intervention, helping to create competitive companies. As the paper says, our policy must be to harness the power of markets, while recognising that, left to themselves, markets will not always give us These . the best possible results. There are measures described in this white on paper to remove impediments to business efficiency, to facilitate exports, to encourage research and development, to make access to finance for small and medium sized business of easier, to remove. regulation and lower business costs and, among the latter, the white paper announces the suspension"" of the traincompetitiveing guarantee'. One significant initiative will be the establishment of a body to improve coordination of and delivery of government programs for business. The body, to be called Ausindustry, will be within the portfolio of the. Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and will be guided by a. board comprising people with experience in all aspects of business, from research and development to international trade. The establishment of Ausindustry is a direct response to two recent studies by MCKinsey which found that business was often confused about the range of services available under government programs. Our success will also depend on the capaCity and willingness of Australians. to strike productivity bargains in the nation's workplaces. The Industrial Relations Reform Act introduced last year provides the framework for this process to rapidly proceed. Much now depends on· the willingness of employers and employees to strike the kinds of bargains which will be mutually rewarding to them, and rewarding also to Australia's economic future. We have seen in a very short time a sea change, not just in the shape of the Australian economy, not just in its orientation and in the waywe do business, but in the way we think about our business practice. We understand both the need for, and the prinCiples of, competitiveness. We understand the need for cooperation in the·workplace. We understand the need for skills and creativity.· We know that we must be a nation which makes things and sells things in the international the world. We know these things prinCipally because we know that not to do therri will mean to fail as a nation. It will mean a lower standard of living for this and for future generations. The major reforms announced in this white· paper should be seen in this context. We do not accept that we can raise the standard Of living of Australians by allowing a large number of people to drift permanently out of the system. We do not accept that we can afford to waste. their potential. Nor do we· accept that the only way to maintain our standard of living is to lower the wages of Australian workers. The white paper is underpinned by the belief that Australia must and can be a high wage and a high productivity country'. A hundred years ago, the Australian colonies federated into a nation which numbered among its watchwords· 'the soCial laboratory of the world'. The Australia of a hundred years ago prided itself on advanced soCial policy. Just 50 years ago, with· the white paper on full employment, another Australian Labor government codified and consolidated soCial policies which together formed the basis of the Australian soCial welfare system. That was a document of its times-in some essential ways, a· much more modest document than this one. .This white paper is a document for these times. .. These soCial programs, together with those introduced in recent years, mean that in this decade we should take pride in the fact that, faithful to previous generation- of Australians, we have made this one of the most sophisticated soCial democraCies in the world- It would be no bad thing if, in this decade, we also developed pride in the great changes we have ·made to our economy. We should be proud that we now compete in areas we once thought beyond our capacity. It would be a very good thing if, at the end of the century, we defined ourselves as one of the very fair soCieties in the world and one of the most creative. That is the philosophy which underlies this white paper. It is a program for employment and growth. It underlies all the poliCies of this· government. I present the markets of following papers: Working nationWhite Paper on Employment, Industry and Regional Development. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.

99,Mr SINCLAIR,BUSINESS,"Not having been privy to the discussions with the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), in his absence, I rise to say that we accept the proposal put by the government. I know that on other occasions my col1eague the honourable member for Bennelong has referred to what we stili see as some of the fundamental difficulties in the change of standing orders. Whilst I know that we had a brief debate on this subject yesterday, as one who has experienced different times for questions, I think it is unfortunate that we have chosen to preserve this system of having rostered ministers and having questions without notice at 3 o'clock. I regard it as being too late in the afternoon. The general approach of the government towards the operations of this place, even with the standing orders which it has implemented, was quite' apparent today when the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) did not even bother to be present on time. While the opposition accepts this notice and will not oppose it, it is about time the government considered the extent to which it is denigrating this institution, the House of the people, by its procedures and practices. It detracts from democracy and the efficacy of members being able to fulfil their responsibilities. I accept the motion only because there have been discussions with my colleague. It would seem that the government is intent on preserving what I see as a ridiculous modification to the sessional orders to the disadvantage of this institution. '.

102,Mr JULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Australia was horrified on 24 April to learn of the crash landing of a DC3 aircraft in Botany Bay. Thank goodness, 25 people escaped from that particular disaster with their lives. I am sure that the people of Australia were even more horrified when they learned that absolutely no regulations governed the.operation of a DC3 charter aircraft for a seven-hour trip over an ocean to Norfolk Island. I am sure that they were absolutely horrified on the weekend when they saw yet another disaster near Maitland in New South Wales, where a vintage Tiger Moth aircraft crashed, killing two occupants. I am sure that they have been horrified by the exposes undertaken by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) into the crash of the Monarch aircraft I am sure that they have been horrified by the crash of the Dove aeroplane a few months ago at Essendon. I am sure that they were horrified to hear the answers that were given by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in this House today. The reality is that over the last five years the administration of aviation in Australia has .bec,ome an absolute disaster zone. To' give the House an indication' of just how bad things are becoming, not only in the oper..: ations but in the administration, I will quote from the minister himself. He was asked a question in the Senate a few weeks ago and gave this answer on 14 March. The question concerned how many accidents and incidents had been reported in Australia in the three year period to the end of November 1993. The minister answered that 10,000 accidents and incidents were reported in Australia for the three-year period to the end of November 1993. While it is true that some of them would not be regarded ·as major issues, the facts of the matter are that the second and third tiers of aircraft operation in Australia are areas of very great concern. In the 12 months from November 1990 to November 1991, 24 acciden,tswere classified in category 2namely, regional airline operations-and 22 incidents. From November 1991 to November 1992, there were 20 accidents and 10 incidents. From November 1992 to November 1993, there were seven accidents and one incident. Thank goodness that there have been no category 1 disasters and .that our major carriers at. least. have a very safe level of operation. The plain facts are that Australia's skies are not as safe as they once were or how people think they may be. Much of this has come about because of the government's failure tei control the development of ,safe aviation in Australia. I remind the House of some things that have happened in recent years. There was an absolute debacle concerning the radar contracts. We remember the tremendous efforts of Senator MACGIBBON in the other place and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) here in making sure that that was all exposed. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were wasted by the Civil Aviation Authority because it had to go back and redo the whole radar contract system. Remember the debacle, which is still going on, over the new provisions for airspace or six management around Australia. We were supposed to go into this new system last November, but there were such objections, concerns and fears raised .in the' aviation industry that the implementation date. has been put back. Perhaps we will sedt happening· a little later this year. There was utter confusion within the aviation industry as to what many of those changes were all about. I suppose that nothing better exemplifies this than the report that appeared in the Australian on. Friday, 29 April 1994. The headline read 'Row erupts over air safety'. Two differenLdepartments-the Civil Aviation Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation-had a go at each other because they disagreed with the violations of controlled airspace over a five-year period. BASI brought to everyone's attention the real dangers that were starting to exist in air space management. As usual, the CAA said, 'Everything will probably be all right.' , '. We have been through another situation. The department has insisted-probably rightly so-that beacons be installed in all operating aircraft. A row then developed as to what sort Of beacon it should be. They should have been in place by now, .but, once again, because of the dithering of this government, that project has been delayed. We will not see the introduction of those beacons until the middle of this year. It does not matter where you look in all the rows about safety, people are concerned at the obvious decline in safety standards in Australian aviation. . On 28 April, a report from Australian Associated Press indicated that a Worksafe report had found that proposed changes to work hours for pilots might compromise pilot and passenger safety. The Australian International Pilots Association, one of the most responsible unions in the aviation industry, released a summary of the report which it will use to argue against a Civil Aviation Authority proposal to increase the maximum duty period for flight crews from 16 to 22 hours per day. ' , Theassodation is concerned that there is no 'other country that has those particular provisions.For some reason the Civil Aviation Authority has decided that they should be examined as a real proposition. The governIrient is yet t{) make a detenriination on what is going to happen there. I think one of the great tragedies is, that, while we can still proudly boast; orie of the safest aviat'ion systems in the world, the plain fact is that has been more and more challenged. It is being challenged'1ecause we have seen a d-line in the capacity of governments and departments to administer safety standards in Australia., In question time today I, was interested to hear the minister say that as a result of the issues that were raised yesterday by the honourable member for Hume and me, he actually rang the chairman of the CAA this morning. He has only been the minister for four months; we cannot expect him to get onto these things too soon-especially when it comes to aviation safety. What an absolute disaster! . One of the great criticisms of this minister that I get from all sections of the aviati,on industry is that they can never getin to see him. The General Aviation Association and the' airports people are all saying that it is physicalIy impossible'to make an appointment to discuss these matters of great moment with this particular minister. In the meantime we have a Civil Aviation Authority that has been charged, with raising so much revenue that it would' almost seem that that is its prime responsibility rather than determining ,the safety standards and regulations of Australia. We do have sqme very dedicated and very good People in those departments, but they are frustrated now to the point where the morale in the Civil Aviation Authority is at an absolute low. I am surprised that, when the minister rang this morning and suggested that something should be done, he did not say, 'Why hasn't something been done over the past several years by the, CAA board to bring this whole administration into shape?' Obviously, at the end of the day, even with independent statutory bodies of the government, the minister has the ultimate responsibility to make sure that it has that capacity and, in fact, delivers on producing, the' best aviation safety standards so that all Australians have the capacity to fly around Australia knowing that they will arrive at their destinations. If we look at the administration of civil aviation in Australia and all its facets over the last several years, we see that it is a disaster. .it Let us look at the operations of the Federal Airports Corporation. I was fascinated in the white paper from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to see that we got a one line mention. Theone line mention is the alIocation of $73 million for some work to be done on the Badgerys Creek airport west of Sydney in the financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97. It is hoped that it might all be finished by then.",93
103,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Additional.,95
104,Mr JULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, additional money, but two hours before that we had the honourable, member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the chief government whip in' this House giving long tirades on the necessity for the development of Badgerys Creek airport. Of course, they were absolutely right. But does the minister honestly believe that' the present alIocations plus these additional allocations that have come in on this white paper have the capacity to present a full international facility for the people of western Sydney? The answer is obviously no. If I were the honourable member for Werriwa, after my commitment to making sure we were going to get the development of Badgerys Creek airport, I probably would have to go outside this place and either resign my seat or slash my wrists as a result of those statements in the government white paper. Badgerys Creek is essential for the proper development of airport infrastructure in Australia. We need only look around Australia tq see this. We had a question today about the state of Adelaide airport. We know the confinement that the length of that runway is having on the international operations there and the requirement for its extension for the development of proper freight facilities in that part of the world. We know the absolute disaster of the com;truction of the new tenninal at the Brisbane international airport. It was promised for years and years. Finally it decided to build it. Already, according to the Courier.,Mail reports, industry representatives are saying that it is too small and that already it is going to have to start looking towards some more extensions on that edifice that is being. built. Brisbane international airport is going to be the second busiest airport in Australia by 1998. To go a little bit further, we can go around the regional areas of Australia and see the difficulties that are being experienced in many of the remote areas of Australia in tenns of being able to maintain airstrips as a result of the government's decision under the airport local ownership plan to wilJy-nilJy hand over the airports to those operations and expect them to operate them profitably. With the regional disasters that we have around Australia, and the recession, and the droughts, it is virtually impossible for people to provide that infrastructure. This is a little bit like a Demtel television commercial: 'If you want more, we've got more.' Let us look at the International Air Services Commission. There is some magnificent stuff going on there. At the moment we have a fight going on between Qantas and Ansett. The government, in its wisdom, decided to introduce a second carrier on international rights. Quite properly, the IASC awarded Ansett a number of international services. It is picking up the Osaka service and the Hong Kong service, and it is operating the Bali service. But it has rights to Malaysia-a huge source of tourism to Australia-that it is not going to pick up, and it is not going to pick up its rights over the New Zealand route. Qantas has rights that it has not used. On many of these services we have been asked to provide more capacity because the full development of Australian tourism is being wound down· because of the lack of availability of seats on those routes at certain times of the year. Let us look at the great initiative that the government had about the common aviation market between Australia and New Zealand. That was supposed to all be in place at the end of last year. We have got no further on that. We have put question after question on the Notice Paper. We never get a response from the minister. Who knows what is going to happen there. We have a situation where an air carrier has been given rights to China, but it does not look as though it has the capacity to raise the money to buy an aircraft to operate the services. In the meantime,Qantas is terribly concerned about that, and we have the Chinese wondering what the devil is happening. The potential in and out of China is absolutely enonnous. Late last year we had bilateral brawls between Australia and the United States in tenns of the North West Airlines services over Osaka and the absolute debacle _that happened there. In the end Australiawon absolutely nothing, North West Airlines walked away, and we looked like absolute fools. I guess we wilJ have another fight pretty soon, when United Airlines decides that it is going to try to claim those rights. What will the government do then? Back down as usual-no problems at all.. 'We have just had a situation where Qaritas applied for extra capacity over Thailand. 'What happened? The Thais said, 'The deal is not good enough for us. You cannot come in.' Qantas has said, very reluctantly, that now it is going to switch its services to Singapore because the government has not had the capacity to negotiate those air rights. We have problems; it· does not matter whether we look into the administration of the safety aspects of Australian' aviation or at the independent statutory corporations such theas Federal Airports Corporation. After all, the FAC is supposed to be a commercial entity. It could pay $11hmilJion for a share in a fresh food service at Sydney and Brisbane airports, and in the first year of operation it managed to lose about $277,000. One has to question some of its commercial capacity. It does not matter whether we look into that whole area of air rights; we have problems there as well. The plain fact is that the decade of the 1990s has ended up an absoiute disaster iritenns of the administration of Australian aviation. . My good - dvice to the'minister, seeing as he has only been in the chair for four months, is tostlirt to kick a few heads; look at the composition of the b?ard of th- CAA and see what he can do to Improve It; look .at the cotriposjtion of the Federal Airp--s Corpor-­ tion' and look .at the composItIon of hIS dep-rtment. Australia's public will not accept second-rate standards in .any of these areas. He owes it to the Australian population to provide a safe, sec-re and. viable. avia!ion industry.. The way thl-. government IS gomg, it is not going to get It.",95
105,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Kingsford-Smith-. Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (4.49 p,m-)-There are two things I would absolutely agree with the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) about: firstly, his comment that we in Australia can still proudly boast one of the safest systems in the world-I. was very pleased th-the made that admission-and, secondly,' hIS comment that the Chinese would be wondering what is really happening. I agree with that because, if the Chinese had heard his speech this afternoon, they would not have any idea what is really happening in this House or i.n the opposition's view of aviation in thIS country. The honourable member gave us a diatribe starting with air safety, which is, of course, the matter of the moment, but then he ranged off in one direction' or another' to deal with the Federal Airports Corporation, its alleged shortcomings, the question of airport expansion the length and breadth of Austrahafrom Adelaide to God only knows whereand the development of Badgerys Creek. He commented upon debates earlier in the House today, he dealt with the Internation-1 Air Services Commission and the questton of Ansett flights to Bali and non-flights to Malaysia, and the fact that it is not taking all the rights awarded to it. He menti-ne? the common aviation market as well as aIr fights to Cbina itself, not to mention the North West Airlines flights via Osaka. But the real question before the House is none of these things; it is the question of what do we need to do additional to what is already being done to guarantee the highest standards of air safety in this country, to guarantee that we can continue to proudly boast,in the words of the honourable member, 'the safest system in the world.: I areasonably well qualified to speak m. thIS debate because for 24112 years I have represented at both the state and federal level, constituents who live directly under the flight paths to the biggest and busiest airport in this nation. We have lived with aircraft every minute of every day, except when the curfew was in place, and even then we have lived with those curfew flights, whether propelIerdriven or jet, that have been allowed into Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. As I indicated in the House today, as someone who has personally witnessed crashes and seen the carnage involved, who, as a boy, marvelled at the ability of. a DC3 to float for some time before it sank mto the Lakes golf course pond in the mid-1950s and who later witnessed what I said was the worse carnage and the most horrificaccident that I ever thought could occur, being the crash of the Advance Airlines King Air in 1980, I feel a particular responsibility to pursue with all my vigour the question of air safety and to ensure that we do everything in our power in that regard. The honourable member for Fadden misrepresented me today when he suggested that I have only just-in the last 24 hourscontacted General Gration and the CAA in regard to air traffic safety. The honourable member should be aware that I have been in regular contact with the CAA from the moment I took up my duties as Minister for Transport. I have met with representatives .of the CAA several times, I have spoken WIth them on the phone on numerous occasions andasI confirmed to the House, I spoke up again with General Gration this morning to make sure that he and I are on exactly the one wavelength in terms of pursuing these issues of great concern. I am plea,sed to report to the House today that we are. He indicated to me that he agreed with me completely that we should put all our energy into doing everything possible to see a complete response to the matters of concern regarding air safety. I indicated to the House earlier today that, of the 58 identified recommendations of the Terrell report into air safety last year, 38 have already been put into place by the Civil Aviation Authority. General Gration was able to guarantee that the remaining 20 recommendations-bringing it up to the full quota of 58-'-will be in place by the end of June this year. I was pleased to obtain that assurance. We were able to talk further and to discuss this very question raised in the last few weeks about the circumstances in which a DC3 aircraft was all owed to take off-it did not get very far ""-and fly for seven hours across the Tasman Sea carrying no fewer than 25 people, the majority being the children who comprise the Scots College school band. If it is true, as has been suggested in press reports, that had that aircraft been built after 1963 it would not have been allowed to undertake that flight, I think there is something seriously wrong with the regulations. I have asked General Gration to make sure that that is addressed as a matter of absolute urgency. Let us not wait for any BASI inquiries into that crash; let us get on and tackle it now. In respect of the matters that have been of great concern to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), there is one big issue that I think requires attention over and above what we know of the circumstances of the accident to date-that is, the question of companies which might be in some financial difficulties, and whether there should not be a system of credit watch adopted by the Civil Aviation Authority where it is on a sort of red alert, as it were, to pay particular attention to companies that are fairly close to that viability line. I am not sure how we would go. about that, but it is one of the things that I have asked General Gration to pay particular attention to, and I am hopeful that we can devise a system that will all ow a lot more attention to be paid to airlines that fly in the future whose financial circumstances are similar to those sad days leading to the awful disaster of Monarch's aeroplane in June last year. I am able to assure the House that we are concerned about this issue and we are intent on doing everything within our power to pursue a series of regulations and recommendations that will leave Australia absolutely confident in the quality of our air safety. But I will not go out and pre-judge these issues. I know that, in the emotion of the moment when a member is representing ito electorate - here people have been touched by a great tragedy; where a community has been enormously affected by an accident such as the King Air, there is a tendency to race out and say, 'This one is to blame and that one is to blame.' I will not be in on that. What I will do is pursue recommendations as they come from the appropriate authorities to make sure it cannot happen again and to make sure that, if those recommendations suggest that actions of a criminal or disciplinary nature should be taken against particular officers, that is pursued and pursued with all vigour. But I will not come out and act as judge, jury and executioner in this process. That will be for the proper authorities. But I will be-and this government will be-the facilitator of making sure that attention is paid by those authorities to all these issues. The fact is that the opposition has been at sixes and sevens about the question of the powers of the Civil Aviation Authority. There is no better way of illustrating. that than to look at the various quotations of the honourable member for Fadden or, alternatively, the honourable member for Hume or, going to the other place, none other than our friend Senator MACGIBBON. If honourable members read the things they have said-and I have had a chance to do so-they will see that they take a very different attitude as to how the Civil Aviation Authority should pursue its role. There is no ambiguity about the position of the honourable member for Hume. He is on the record as saying that the Civil Aviation Authority's role is to be the policeman for all air services in Australia- He is quite clear in his mind as to how the Civil Aviation Authority should function and how it should pursue its duties. On the other hand; the honourable member for Fadden has been a touchtnore circumspect, or he certainly was on 27 October when he said: I' have n- problems with deregulation of the airline industry at all. In fact, deregulation does not mean and it should not mean, the lowering of safet; standards. I hope we can find that this-'he was talking about an accidentwas an isolated incident rather than one of laxity by the department in allowing some of those standards to slip. I am sure that the latter was not the case. The honourable member believed that the standards could not slip. On the basis of these comments, he has a great deal of confidence in the Civil Aviation Authority. He went on to say: . Therefore, I would hope that we would not be going into a frenzy regarding the reintroduction of a fully regulated airline industry when there are obviously so many savings that can be made in a deregulated environment. Perhaps I should not say any more than that until such time as the full report from the Civil Aviation Authority is released regarding this particular accident in Young. That is the Monarch airline accident. I agree with the honourable member that we sh-uld wait until we have that report. I have indicated that it will be available very shortly. I wIII then share it with the honourable member for Hume and we will pursue its recommendations. But the opposition's po""sition does not run from that point to the other. It goes a long way further in the utterances of Senator MACGIBBON, who is 01} the record assayjng: We certainly need a cooperative approach from the Civil Aviation Authority ... We have to get a civil aviation authority that wants to work with, not against, the aviation industry. The nonsense that is going on today has to. stop and it has to stop rapidly, otherwise a lot of people will die needlessly in the VFR field in Australia. Once upon a time the department of civil aviation worked in cooperation with the industry. It led by example, it counselled people and it advised them. So there are a diversity of views in the opposition.Some believe that the CAA should be the policeman. Others believe that we should wait and see. Others believe that the CAA should take a hands-off approach with a full commitment to self-regulation. We have to get the balance right. We have to make sure that there are appropriate rules and regulations. When I see an old aircraft carrying a lot of kids crash into Botany Bay, I am enormously thankful that not a life was lost. But I ask myself: what steps should we be taking to make sure that this cannot happen again? When I see tragically a couple of people burnt to death as a result of a wing-walking stunt exercise on the weekend, which· I know horrified every television viewer who unfortunately saw it, I say, 'Why are we stiII doing this? Didil't this cease with Robert Redford and The Great Waldo Pepper all those years ago?' That is one area, along with the question of old aeroplanes operating over the ocean for long distances, which I have asked . General Gration to address as a matter of urgency. I repeat to the House that I have the greatest of confidence in General Gration. I consider him to be one of the finest Australians that this nation has ever produced. I think we are enormously fortunate to have such an outstanding Australian available in the leadership role of the Civil Aviation Authority. He has told me that 38 of the 58 recommendations of Terrell have been implemented, and I know that is the case. He has told me that he is pursuing the remainder. He has told me that these other issues, stich as wing-walking and old aircraft, will be pursued by him with all his vigour and that he will do everything possible to tighten up ·the .internal affairs of the Civil Aviation Authority as a result of the Monarch accident arid the lessons learnt from the Monarch accident. It may take some months before we have the final recommendations of BASI. We will certainly have an interim report either today, tomorrow or before the end of this week. I hope it contains sollie things which we can proceed to implement immediately. But we will not be able to attribute blame until such time as we have final recommendations and the results of the coronial inquiry. I implore the honourable member for Hume, in spite of the high emotion he feels on behalf of his constituents who have been so dramatically and tragically affected, to wait and see before we act as judge and jury against the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority, the pilots, the owners of Monarch Air or any other party. When the recommendations are available and the determination of the coronial inquiry is before me, he and the House may rest assured that we will do everything possibleindeed, everything necessary-to guarantee that we can proudly say that we still boast the highest record of safety anywhere· in. the world. So, with those words and assurances, J am pleased to have had this bpportunity to contribute to the matter of public importance submitted by the honourable member for Fadden.",97
106,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was interested to hear the remarks of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) both in this matter of public importance and in question time earlier today. His response was interesting. For example, he mentioned the viability or credit watch of the airlines around Australia that provide a service to the travelling public. I think this is a critical issue. Had it been in place in Australia, as it is in the UK or the US, Monarch simply would not have been operating much beyond 1991, for the simple reason that Monarch was technically bankrupt at the. time. The importance of this, which is learnt from .investigating incidents such as the, Monarch crash, is that, if an airline is not operating profitably, the first . thing it does is cut corners. The corners that it cuts involve things such as maintenance and flying operation procedures. In my view, that ultimately helped contribute to the tragic loss of those sever) lives at Young on. 11 June last year. I was also interested to hear that the minister will pursue this matter as far as he possibly can. I was very pleased to hear that. But I will give the minister a little bit of an idea of the tiger that he will have to wrestle with. Over the years theCAA has run quite out o- control. I have many examples of this, and I will talk about a couple of them today. The Moriarch accident is one. This airline was technically bankrupt. The aircraft were not being properly maintained. Indeed, the aircraft that crashed had had the autopilot removed and several vital instruments had been made inoperable. . . I can highlight other instances. I draw t9 the attention of the House the inGident involving Western Airlines that operated out of Wagga. That airline was a standing joke, particularly in Canberra. The joke was that, when a Western Airlines aircraft pulled up, drip trays had to be put under the aircraft to stop the oil spilling all over the apron. In Wagga the airworthiness inspector proposed to his senior managers in the CAA that that airline have its AOC, air operator's certificate, withdrawn and that the aircraft be grounded. Do honourable members know what ended up happening? The senior managers did investigate the claims made by the airworthiness inspector. They were all .found to be correct. But, instead of punishing Western Airlines, they punished the airworthiness ipspector. He was sidelined. His career is now doomed. But Western Airlines continues to fly. That is the sort of attitude that prevails within the Civil Aviation Authority. Let me give another example. Seaview Lord Howe Island Ply Ltd operates a Navaho that flies between Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. The Navaho can take nine passengers but, because of the length of the strip at Lord Howe Island and the 480-odd nautical miles that has to be flown between the two places, this Navaho is licensed to carry only six passengers because it has to carry a full load of fuel, taking off on a short runway. The chief pilot of Seaview Aviation reported to the Civil Aviati9n Authority that he was being forced by his employer to carry nine passengers, against the licensed regulations imposed on that aircraft operating that service. The end result was that the chief pilot was sacked by the airline. The airworthiness inspector recommended that the aircraft and the airline be grounded. What happened? The airline continued to fly. The guy who blew . the whistle was punished by being sacked a.nd the airline that W/lS breaking the law.continued to fly. That was not the only thing it was doing. The airline was operating ascheduledservice and yet it was not licensed to provide regular public transport. It was' breaking the law because it was carrying more people than it was licensed to carry. It was breaking the law because it was providing an RPT service when it was not licensed to do so. It was also breaking the law because life vests and life rafts were not carried when aircraft were flying over water. Yet this airline which was operating so dangerously and which· was putting people's lives at risk continued to fly. I have many other examples. I have a list as long as your ar:m that I could have given yesterday in my speech, but I am afraid that time did not permit me to do so. There are other examples of things going on in the Civil Aviation Authority that should concern the minister. Yesterday I mentioned the possibility. of corruption. I cited the instance of flying operations inspectors, who are pilots, who are able to finesse a problem that air operators have on the basis and the understanding that, if they do it, there is plenty of free flying time for them in that airline company's aircraft. This has been suggested. I cited a particular example of it yesterday. But there are more problems than that. There is another activity that occurs with flying operations inspectors and it is called line flying: the CAA's flying operations inspectors fly with airlines. This is designed to give those pilots who work for the CAA flying experience to keep their licences up to scratch, and it also saves the CAA money. But many of those flying operations inspectors are abusing that system. One inspector in particular dons the uniform of one particular airline and flies every fortnight. Asa result of this the people who are supposed to be administering, regulating or policing the law-whichever way we want to describe itare working with and alongside the people that they are supposed to be regulating, resulting in a club-like matey arrangement. Tha.t is part of the problem because it is the flying operations inspectors who are overriding the recommendations of the airworthiness inspectors. Let me give another example. A CAA district officer recommended to the Director of Public Prosecutions that a particular airline operator be charged. The Director of Public Prosecutions looked into the matter and found that a prima facie· case existed, so charges were laid. A flying operations officer based here in Canberra, who was at the time acting in what is described as a very senior position, intervened in this matter, spoke to the officer in charge of that district office where the original complaints had come from and demanded that those complaints be withdrawn. However, the DPP had taken those complaints'to the point where they could not be withdrawn. But had that flying operations officer been successful, that case would never have gone forwar& As it was the case did go forward and the air operator was found guilty of the charge. That would never have happened if that flying operations officer based here in Canberra had had his way. There is something awfully wrong with the way the Civil Aviation Authority is operating. If the minister is going to do what he says he is going to do, he has a big task ahead of him. There is another critical aspect to all of this which the Monarch Air crash and another crash that took place in Victoria down near Seymour two years ago highlight-that is, the matter of insurance. People are staggered when they realise that insurance for these types of airlines is not compulsory; 'it is an optional extra. That is absolutely wrong. I guarantee that all passengers who get in commercial airline aircraft in Australia would believe they are properly insured, but it is not the case. Many of the third level airlines do insure even though it is not required. But even if they do, as was the case in Victoria and has now proven to be the case with Monarch Air, the insurance company claims immediately there was a breach of the Air Navigation Act therefore the policy is voided, therefore there is no liability, and therefore there is no insurance for the victims' families. That is usually what happens. But if the insurance companies do not do that and they do payout, there is a maximum payout of up to $180,000. If the Minister for Transport were driVIng his car, had a crash and was made a quadriplegic, he would expect to get $3 million or $4 million in compensation. But if the minister were flying in one of these aircraft, it crashed and he was made a quadriplegic, he could expect to get only up to $180,000-that is, if the insurance company ever paid up. That is downright unfair. It is inequitable and it has to be addressed. What the minister also has to do in the months ahead of him, as he fulfils the promise that he has given this House today, is to fix the problems of the Civil Aviation Authority and the aviation industry here in Australia. I hope he. does live up to what he says. It is terribly important that he does because the lives of many Australians swing on his ability to turn the rhetoric that he has expressed here in this House today into action. If he does not then there will be many more Australians go to their graves as those 25 boys from Scots College nearly did the other day and as some of my constituents did on 11 June last year at Young in an accident that really should never have happened.",100
107,Mr OKEEFE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In a debate like this and with a topic as significant as aviation administration there ought to be a both reasoned· and considered form of debate that takes place between us. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) was what I would call very measured in his discussion of this topic, and I think that the contributions made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) were in the same vein. I am not sure that it is the kind of topic that ought to be brought on in an MPI, but here it is. The starting point in this debate has to be the issue of general air safety in Australia. the top level is the question of world envy of the fact that Australia has such an excellent air safety record, particularly with regard to the major commercial airlines and the major passenger traffic. There are lots of reasons that, not the least .being the very heavy and intense effort put in over many years by the Civil Aviation Authority and its predecessors requiring those standards, and the requirements instituted under the old two-airline agreement. Following the. opening up of aviation to competition, and in this current climate of user pays and more and more intense pressure on the dollar in all industries, there are many more planes flying than was the case in the past. They are flying on much tighter margins and governments are under pressure from the industry, from taxpayers, from everyone, to minimise the bureaucratic costs involved with regulation and supervision. At the same time operators are under cost pressures that can lead to short cuts. Those short cuts can often be in the field of safety. There is nothing in the performance of the airlines or the statistics to date that gives us any reason to believe that this situation is any worse than it has been in the past. But that is not to say that we should not be seriously cognisant of it. I have to say to the honourable members for Hume and Fadden that in the kinds of policies they were coming forward with at the last election there was one little policy complication they got themselves into and have not yet, at this point anyway, jettisoned. In their Fightback proposals they were proposing that this industry bear the full cost of air safety charges: in other words, total user pays. The government maintains a regime whereby we finance the operations of the CAA in the field, and there is a subsidy involved because we believe in our commitment. Had that policy come into effect not only would the opposition have been adding a GST to the airline prices but it would also have been removing some of the assistance that is given in a financial way to the supervision of safety; in other words, there would have been a further direct squeeze on this issue of air At safety. It is a little puzzling that too much is made of this issue in that context. I heard the honourable member for Hume on radio this morning. People often ask me, 'What's he like?' and all that sort of stuff and for I say, 'I've known him fora few years. We came into this place together. He's very articulate and he delivers his views, but he is prone to stretch the point a bit and in fact is not always absolutely accurate.' Tharis a nice way to put it. On the 'radio this morning in respeCt of the Monarch incident-and I fully understand his close interest in and concern about this matter-I heard him say, 'Here it is. It happened all this time ago and nothing has happened.' I do not believe that he.really thought that nothing had been done. I hope that he is reassured by the answer given in question time today by the minister, who indicated that there has been extensive investigation undertaken in respect of that accident and there are a number of recommendations being brought forward right now. It is not true to publicly paint a' picture that it happened and has been ignored or forgotten. It is also fair to say that the government shares some of the concerns about the capacity of the CAA, in the form that it was in, to deal with this air safety issue. That is why significant action has been taken to provide some restructuring and some separation of issues, such as the airworthiness section and the licensing section. It is my understanding that the structural changes that bring about those s'eparations are already· in place. If is so, the honourable member for Hume was giving examples on radio this morning and again in this parliament about practices that no longer exist. They are colourful illustrations' of the point, but the point needs to be made that they are no longer in existence. So, to the extent that that is the case, it is worth my making that point. I share the minister's acknowledgment of the regard in which everybody holds Peter Gration, who has been appointed to the position of chairman of the CAA. He has a track record of getting things done, and he has put this matter at the top of his priority list. I think we can expect some very prompt implementation. of changes or assurances that a number of these matters that may cause concern are being and will be addressed. Having said those things, let me flag in this discussion something about which I think we all have to do some thinking. While we may have had these wonderful safety procedures and records, the fact of the matter is that flying around Australia is not all that difficult by world standards. It is basically a flat country and most of the major airports are on flat land near the seaboard. Whether it is by good management, good luck, good geography or whatever, we have enjoyed an enviable safety record, and the world acknowledges that. But the number of aircraft Oying around . in the skies over Australia is increasing -. population shifts and increasing wealth, lots of changes are taking place in commuter patterns and the pressure on airports is increasing. It is incumbent upon government and the industry to ensure that the infrastructure and the standards are· in place, be they improvements in airports, in air traffic control, in training of the people involved or a higher degree of safety and responsibility on the part of the operators. I happened to be in south-west Tasmania last week and I flew back from a remote airfield to Hobart airport. As we approached the airfield, I had headphones on and was listening to the air traffic discussion between my pilot and air traffic controllers. As we were flying over Hobart, there were. several aircraft in the sky. The pilot was told where that they were and to keep his eye out for them. He was looking around everywhere, and so was I. . However, the ppint is that maybe that is not satisfactory over time. Perhaps relying on pilots doing visuals under 3,000 feet will not be satisfactory in time, particularly if the equipment in the aircraft is not up to that. I think a lot of work needs to be done, as there are more and more of these aircraft flying around, to ensure that these standards are developed and maintained. I do not think the MPI is of substance, but I am happy to make that contribution. . Mi-DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Rocher)Order! The discussion is concluded. COMMirrEES Public Works Committee Reports",102
108,Mr HOLLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public WorkS, I present the second and third reports of the committee for 1994 relating to' the refurbishment of the Australian Federal Police College, Barton, Australian Capital Territory, and the relocation of the Salisbury explosive ordnance testing facilities to Port Wakefield, South Australia, Ordered that the reports be printed.",103
109,Mr HOLLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"by leave-I thank the With House. The first report which I have tabled deals with the refurbishment of the Australian Federal Police, College, Barton, Australian Capital Territory. The report recommends that the refurbishment should proceed, although there is a condition attached to this recommendation which I will explain later. The estimated cost of the proposed refurbishment is $10.5 million at July 1993 prices. The report mentions that the existing college building, although partially extended and later renovated, is nearly 50 years old and the standard of living-in accommodation and training facilities reflects this. If the Australian Federal Police is to have adequate facilities for the training of police officers and officers from other agencies, there is a definite requirement for better facilities. The A,FPexamined a numbe,i' of options, including the use of a surplus school and the integ'ration of the college with a new AFP headquarters. Neither option proved practicable or financially realistic. Accordingly, the AFP proposes to upgrade the building to comply with current regulations, fire s a f e t y . · I heaIth and sa fie ty; establ'ISh not and occupat IOna 'f t' I c IearIy defi ne d unc lona zones an re ne .

The committee's report concludes that the extent of the proposed refurbishment is sal. necessary due to the age and condition of the building and' a requirement to provide a modern, integrated training establishment offering facilities consistent with contempoal rary standards and expectations. Therefore, standard of accommodation proposed is consistent with a need to cater for the diversifield, ty of personnel attending training courses. Similarly, the extent of the proposed upgradhazard ing of building services reflects the requireable ment to repair and maintain deficiencies in existing systems and to modernise them, where necessary. The committee has made recommendations concerning a number of design and consultais tive matters. On the question of fire safety, the committee recommends that the involveSalisbury ment, of the ACT Fire Brigade should conlishment tinue throughout the design and delivery the completed project. The committee also avoided. , recommends that an energy audit of the college should be carried out 12 months after completion, of the project. The committee recommends that the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled should be involved in the design of refurbishment work relating to access and other facilities for the disabled. The committee recommends that the AFP should formalise arrangements with child-care centres aimed at providing certainty about the availability of child-care places. I said at the outset that the committee's recommendation that the work should proceed is conditional. This conditional approval stems from the impact of the law enforcement review, now completed, on the structure and functions of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. ,The review had not been finalised at the time of the committee's consideration of the proposed work.

In this place we all understand stress; indeed, it is an occupational for us. But, for the benefit of honourmembers, I will try to explain what environmental stress testing is all about. It involves subjecting items of ordnance to a variety of tests which simulate their handling, transport and storage. At present, this testing carried out at Salisbury. The transportation of environmentally stressed ordnance from to the proof and experimental estabat Port Wakefield poses risks to the of public and Defence personnel which could be The scope of the proposed work examined by the committee involves the construction 12. test. laboratory buildings, control and administrative ,buildings, four storagemagaable zines and associated infrastructure. The estimated cost of the proposed million. The committee has recommended that the proposal proceed. In arriving at this recommendation, the committee considered . that environmental stress, testing of explosive ordnance is essential to ensure the safety of defence personnel required to transport it and to ultimately operate the weapons system. The committee also' conchided that there a need for the stress testing to be undertaken at a safer location, preferably in close proxreports imity to a proofing range. Defence a number of possible locations and concluded that Port Wakefield is the best one. I must that, having inspected the proof and experiindeed, mental establishment there, the committee agreed with this assessment. The committee concluded that the extent of the proposed work could be justified on the basis of the specialised functions which need to be out by or in the various buildings proposed. . The committee sought assurances from Defence on a number of safety, and environparticular mental issues. The committee was assured that the location and size of the proposed provides adequate clearance and·room for expansion. Preliminary engineering investigatinterest ions have indicated that the site is suitable for constructing the buildings proposed. There will be no significant deleterious environhis mental impacts from the proposed facility. There will be no additional firing and associout ated noise from the proof and experimental establishment as a consequence of therelocaof tion of the ordnance ·.environmental stress facility to Port Wakefield; Again, the committee sought a-surances about the long-term viability of the proposed facility in the light of possible future policy changes. Based on the evidence presented to I welcome it. it, the committee concluded that, in the event of policy changes occurring in the future which may place the responsibility for all or some environmental stress testing of ordnance on Australian manufacturers, need for and the use of the proposed facility will remain. terms of revenue from testing ordnance, the of committee concluded that provision. of a new purpose-built facility will provide considerscope for Defence to undertake additional commercial work withemt the need' for work is $8 additional staff. A feature of the construction of the new facility will be the involvement of army engineers as the primary construction agency. The decision to use army engineers was made on the basis of the relatively remote site, the benefits to be gained from. training and value for money. Army engineers are presently is involved in the construction of RAAF base Scherger, near Weipa in Queensland. From all that I have received, it is proving to examined be a very successful exercise. Finally,' I mention that the proposal has say considerable local government support and, strong support from the local federal member. The proof and experimental establishment has been at Port Wakefield since 1928 and considerable goodwill exists between civilian and military authorities there. carried I commend the report to the House.",103
110,Mr ANDREW,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"by leave-As the member for Wakefield, I welcome this work. I should, however, indicate to the House that I am also a member of the site Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works. As such, it could be said that I have a vested in. this work proceeding. The chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), has, in usual generous manner,indicated my enthusiasm for the project, but I should point to the House that, following the public works committee hearing into the relocation the proof and experimental testing facility from Salisbury to Port Wakefield, something of a local controversy has erupted. It is for that reason that I would like to participate in the submission to the House and indicate to the 'House just what the work will do and why There are two issues currently before the House on the question of testing ordnance. The first is that there exists at Port Wakefield, which is at the top of the Gulf of St Vincent, a proof and experimental establishment. It has In been there since 1928. The proof and experimental establishment is there simply so that all of the service arms of the Australian Defence Force can test ordnances by firing them down the gulf. It may seem a little odd that anyone should choose to fire from Port Wakefield down the gulf towards the city of Adelaide, but Port Wakefield is in fact located at least 90 kilometres from the city of Adelaide. Even though the proofing range takes up about 30 kilometres of that stretch, the simple reality is that the firing occurs there because the Gulf of St Vincent is unique in world terms. The gulf is unique in world terms in that has lengthy and wide, sandy beaches and a huge tidal movement so it is possible for the proof and experimental establishment to fire from its location just south of Port Wakefield down the east coast of the Gulf of St Vincent and to have the projectiles land in what' will be about two metres of water; They will safely and without sustaining damage sink the bottom. The tide goes out and the proof and experimental people retrieve the projecWakefield."" tile. The whole object of the proof and experifacility-it mental range is to be able to ta-e that projecenvironmental tile and, having tested it with radars and having tested its trajectory, determine whether or not, since it has not been damaged in the landing process, it is distorted in any way a result of the firing-.This procedure has on since 1928. Since 1928 it has been posThat sible for Defence to test its barrels, its the shell casings and the projectiles in manner. So successful has this testing been that we have now attracted work from around the globe. Naturally, the firing process in itself causes a good deal of noise and some angst to local community. Many members of the personnel community are accustomed to it as it on since 1928. During World War II the range was extensively used and the extensive . use of the range in wartime conditions, when there was an urgency for all types of tests occur; meant that there were occasions when orclnances that ought to have exploded failed to explode on impact and so sat on the botproposal tom of the beach. As a South Australian I must confess that the beaches now occupied'by some unexploded ordnances resulting from World War II testing are beaches that South Australians would like to use for crayfishing. Just to the south of the range, in fact, there is quite a vigorous little crayfishing pori: called Parham. It simply will not be possible, I regret, for South Australians to occupy this east coast of the. Gulf of St Vincent because since World War II there has been all of this exterisive testing. The controversy that has erupted over the it relocation of the Salisbury facility to Port Wakefield is that there are people who believe it will result in additional firings from Port Wakefield. I want to pick up the point made \ by the chairman when he said that the com. mittee was assured that 'there will be no additional firing and :associated noise from the then Proof and Experimental Establishment as a to consequence of the relocation of the ordnance environmental stress test facility. to Port The ordnance environmental stress' test may seem a little odd to have an testing facility involved with .munitions.,--is a facility that exists at Salisbury and will be relocated to Port Wakefield. Prior to its relocation, all of the testing done as on of'df)ances.in Salisbury were nothing more gone than environmental testing,. hence the name. is, the ordnances were either frozen or shells, heated as the case may be. As the chairman this and members of the committee and I witnessed, they are dropped off pallets to simulate what would happen if in the loading of a vessel,for example, the forklift or the pallet slipped and these munitions then fell onto the deck of the ship. Clearly it is in the interests the of the Australian Defence Force and of all that they explode in the barrel of a has gone gun and not on the deck of a ship. This sort of test goes on and it goes on at Salisbury in what is now a metropolitan area. to Having been tested at Salisbury, the ordnances are then carted to Port Wakefield for firing. The public works committee has endorsed the to transfer the testing that happens at Salisbury to Port Wakefield and then fire the ordnances. So there is no additional firing involved. . As the chainnari has indicated, the committee has endor-ed a proposal that says we are prepared to spend a total of $6 million in building the necessary laboratories so that . conditioris can be simulated in which the muriitions can be either frozen, heated· or exposed to abrasive circumstances, vibratedas they would be on road or rail transportand generally treated to ensure that they are stable. I just want to put on record in the parliament the simple reassurance that I offer those few people who· have since become apprehensive about this work: there is no proposal, nor is there any need for additional firing from Port Wakefield. .. In addition, I point out. to any South Australians who might perchance pick up the Hansard that the facility that now exists at Port Wakefield is generating export income for Austral,is and for South Australia. I regret that some people have been inconvenienced by it· I restate that the area is already, as it were, polluted by World War II firings. No pollution occurs now, since the projectile and the trajectory are always monitored when it is fired. Defence knows precisely where the projectile has landed. It can be marked on the map so it is easy to locafe or at least Defence knows the general area where it is if it cannot be located. Currently, because we have guns that now fire over a much larger distance, some firing occurs from the west coast of the Gulf of St Vincent across to the east coast. I know that has caused some dislocation,some concern to Defence and some concern to my constituents over the past two weeks. It is regrettable that this extended firing to doa particular job for Defence occurred with the announcement of this proposed change to the Port Wakefield. range. As a result of that, some of my constituents are certain that their federal member' deceived them in his commentS to the public inquiry into the location of the proof and experimental station. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure them, as I assure you, that there will be no additional firing. and' there will be an opportunity for additional export income as a result of this work. As a South Australian, I welcome it. NA NA (COLLECTION OF INTERIM LEVY) . BILL 1994 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Sciacca, and read a first time.

However, I suppose when' we ·consider that the debate is all about something that wedn this side of the House are extreme1994 ly proud of, it is fortuitous or symbolic that it was delayed, to allow the Prime Minister ·(Mr Keating) to advise u's of the nature of the white paper arid its issues, which we on this side of the House will be proud of for a long time to come. ' . At the time the debate was suspended I was in the middle of explaining why the child-care cash rebate is such a great initiative. This initiative will help families with the cost of ch.ild care associated with employment, training,education or job search. A feature of this support is that. it will not be income tested. It will provide up to $61.20 per week for two or more children. Unlike a tax concession, the cash rebate is claimed as the cost is incurred rather than up to 18 months later. That is why it is fundamentally fairer than a tax concession. It does not favour high income earners. The cash rebate will make sure that women with low incomes also benefit, including women in part-time work or studying, who have no taxable income. It will not force low income women unnecessarily into the work force. An estimated 230,000 families will benefit at a cost of $149 million a year over the next four years. The child-care rebate legislation which establishes the child-care cash rebate was not opposed by the opposition. I thank the opposition for that. I urge h'onourable members to support this current legislati()n, which will implement changes to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill so that the child-care cash rebate scheme can be administered by the Health Insurance Commission. I am proud that this government has elevated child care to a central role in our nation's economie and community life. With 1994 being the International Year of the Family, such an initiative is indeed timely, giving added .financial support to families. only timely-it is indeed appropriate.",108
112,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Bass) (5.53 p.m.)It gives me great pleasure also to speak to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. In doing so I support my colleagues the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the honourable member fQr Paterson (Mr Home). I was also very pleased to hear the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) say that some very good points are contained in this legislation. I commend her for those comments. But as is often the case, the honourable member for Moncrieff was rather selective in some of her comments. At one point the honourable member for Moncrieff actually claimed that she had been misrepresented by the honourable member for Moreton. I would like to take up that issue. The honourable member for Moreton-I take it from the Hansard green today-stated: It is a particular nonsense when shethat being the honourable member for Moncrieffhas been the one to lead the coalition charge attacking us because we did not put a means test on the child-care cash rebate. The honourable member for Moncrieff said that she had been misrepresented in that she supposedly led the charge. In my book, if you lead the charge you are obviously the one in front. Back in 1993, on 20 October, the honourable member was the first person to speak for the coalition-therefore leading the coalition discussion-in demanding that a means test be imposed on the child-care cash rebate. She was, I reiterate, the first speaker from the coalition on this bill and therefore in the lead. I would like to quote a couple of passages from that speech on 20 October 1993. The honourable member for Moncrieff stated: The coalition will not oppose the biJI but wiJI move to amend it, to cap the payment of child-care rebate, to remove the child-care for millionaires element. Furthermore, under the coalition's proposed scheme, a rebate would not have been payable beyond a combined income of $60,000, with payment of a rebate tapering out between $50,000 and $60,000. It is not The speech goes on to say: 1being the honourable member for Moncrieffpoint out that the coalition supports capping the level of income able to be earned in order to be eligible. For many years there has been increasing community recognition of the expense and the inequity of open-ended government assistance and the desirability of targeting those in most need. The coalition believes that this approach would be an appalling misuse of scarce' public resources and unnecessarily limits the capacity of government to provide adequate assistance to those in genuine need. We are talking about assisting those in genuine need. The amendments here that we are discussing today are largely, as we have heard, of a minor procedural nature. They provide for the recovery of costs incurred by the Commonwealth in the provision of rehabilitation programs. The amendments in section 23, as· we have heard, will serve to strengthen legislative support for the recovery of costs by the Commonwealth for rehabilitation programs provided to clients with comin pensation. The bill further goes on to require decision makers under part 3 of the Disability Services Act to notify persons affected by their decisions of the making of those decisions and of the right of appeal. Part 30f the bill relating to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 is consequential on the passage of the Child Care Rebate Act of 1993. The amendments will provide that, consistent with the existing scheme of operation of part 5 of the HIC Act 1973, part 5 makes adequate provision in relation to the child-care cash rebate functions of the commission. Part 5 of the Health Insurance Commission Act deals with financial matters. So accordingly the HIC will be required to prepare estimates of receipts and expected expenditures related to the performance of its child-care cash rebate functions; to expend its moneys in relation to those functions only in accordance with approved estimates of expenditure; to apportion its assets and expenditure appropriately and to open bimk accounts reqUired to. enable it to properly handle its moneys. What is most noteworthy about this bill is that the Labor government has recognised that it is difficult for women to participate on an active basis in the workplace. We have had that come to our attention on many occasions. Women are often constrained by access to affordable child care. I reiterate here something that has been often stated by the women members of this parliament: women are over 50 per cent of the population and have. a diversity of skills and abilities to offer are extremely valuable to the economy. Yet, in many instances we are unable to make use of that incredible pool of knowledge. The limited access in the past to affordable child care has been part of the problem. The cash rebate will substantially increase the ability and the affordable opportunities of women who wish to work or undertake further education amI/or participate in training programs. Let us be realistic. This legislation now allows many more women to contribute their great talents and capabilities to our national growth and future prosperity. We have to forget tagging child care as a welfare issue. It is not a welfare issue any more. It is a vital part of this government's approach to building and rebuilding a well skilled and capable work force in Australia. The child-care rebate forms part of the Labor government's child-care policy, which is an extremely comprehensive package that recognises that most parents, at some stage of their working lives, will require affordable access to quality child care. In 1983, when this government was elected, there were approximately 46,000 child-care places available. By the end of the 1993-94 financial year.,.. - lO years later-that will have increased to approximately 237,000 places. This government promised to meet all demand for work related child care by the year 200 1. From the results to date, and with the implementation of the child-care rebate scheme on 1 July 1994, this promise is well on target. The Prime Minister (MrKeating) saidin Investing in the nation that the child-care rebate recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents earning an income. As with other expenses incurred when earning an income, it will not be means tested. The introduction of this scheme recognises at long last the costs that are borne by parents-I reiterate 'parents' - and particularly mothers in earning an income. This 'bill recognises that all working families are entitled to some form of recompense for the cost of work related child care. However, to ensure that this recompense was equitable and that benefits flowed to lower income families, which Ii decision was' made to introduce a cash rebate so that families could claim as the expense was incurred. I will outline the main features of the childcare rebate scheme. The rebate will be payable by mail or in person through Medicare offices of the Health Insurance Commission with effecf from 1 July 1994. The rebate will be avai'lable to parents who are employed, studying, training or looking for work. It will be paid for any wor,k related child-care expenses for children under 13 years of age. After the first $16 of weekly child-care costs, families can claim 30 per cent of their costs up to a ceiling of $110 per week for one child in care and $220 per week for two or more. The maximum weekly rebate will be $28 per week for <?ne child in care and $61.20 per week for two .or more children in care. The rebate will be payable over and above childcare assistance and it will not be income tested. All work related child care in the formal child-care sector will be eligiblelong-day care and occasional Care centres, family day care, outside school hours care and vacation care. '. Infonnal child care is defined as child care that is not currently eligible for Commonwealth. ancl/or state funding. It can be either in the child's home or in another person's home. In the infonnal child-care sector, carers have to be 18 years old or over. Parents are excluded from claiming for the cost of caring for their own children. Carers can be a child's stepbrother ,or stepsister or other relative. Infonnal carers must meet state or territory regulations relating to infonnal care where they apply. Eligible child-care expenses must, be directly associated with the provision of work related care. To participate in the Commonwealth childpersons care cash rebate scheme, families will need register with the Health Insurance Commisinjuries. sion, and it is expected that that is now well under way. To be eligible to claim the rebate families will have to satisfy some criteriacash rebate will be available for child-care expenses for the care of children under 13 years of age incurred by families where both parents are engaged in one or more of the following: full-time or part-time work, study, training, or looking for work. In the case sole parent families, only the custodial parent needs to meet one of these criteria. Families will be required to substantiate their work force status and the birth dates the children they wish to register. Families will have the option of allowing the Health Insurance Commission to use Medicare 23(5) enrolment details to verify birth dates of children. In order to be eligible for the cash rebate, families must be Australian residents as defined under the Social Security Act; that is, they must be Australian citizens, or have a valid entry penn it, or a return endorsement, or a resident's return visa. Some categories non-residents will also be eligible: Australian g()vernment sponsored overseas students and hardship cases. Registered families who meet CRS. these criteria will be able to claim the childcare cash rebate by presenting receipts for work related child-care expenses incurred with a registered child-care provider from 1 July 1994. The bill is to be commended. It has opened great, positive initiatives, not only for the working women of Australia, those who wish to become working women and those who are training, but for families, no matter how they are made up. I commend the bill to the House.",109
113,Mr KNOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. This bill proposes amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. The amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986 relate to the recovery of costs of rehabilitation programs provided by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to eligible to receive compensation from to other sources, such as insurers, for their Section 26 of the act relates to a client's right to have a decision reviewed by the secretary and to the right of appeal to the The Administrative Appeals Tribunal. An amendment to section 23(5) brings the legislation into line with what has been common practice for many years. It has been the practice to serve notices in relation'to the recovery of rehabilitation costs on insurers prior to the of settlement of litigation between the insurer and the insured person, on the basis that the insurer is 'the person liable to pay compensation' referred to in the act. It is of accepted that no payment would be received until a court case had been s-ttled. , Legal advice indicates that, under section of the act, notices should not be served until it has been detennined by a court, or by agreement between the parties, that the insurer is liable to pay compensation. The Attorney General's Department has been consulted and its advice supports the need for legislative amendment. If notices were not sent early it of would have a serious effect on the recovery of costs of programs provided and consequently on Jthe revenue targets set for the An amendment to section 23(5) of the act will enable notices to be sent to insurers who are potentially liable to pay compensation well before the matter comes before a court or is settled between the parties. The second amendment to section 23 is to subsection (7) , which presently requires an insurer not to pay any moneys awarded to the client until the amount owing for the rehabilitation program has been specified by the Commonwealth. It does not require the insurer to discharge the debt to the Commonwealth before paying the client. Difficulties are often created for the CRS when the insurer pays the client without regard to the sum owing to the Commonwealth and the CRS is obliged to seek to recover the amount owing from the client. It should be noted that even when the payment is received from the insuf{!r,the client has the right to seek to be released from any liability and could, in special circumstances, have all or part of the moneys paid to the Commonwealth refunded. Advice from the department's legal branch supports the need for a change, and the amendment requires payment of the debt to the Commonwealth before paying the remaining award moneys to the client. The third and final amendment is to section 26(5) of the act where a note - has been appended to the subsection to ensure that all clients are advised in writing of their right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if the review decision made under section 26 affirms the original decision with which the client was dissatisfied. This would bring the act into line with the requirement in a recent amendment to section 27 A of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 which requires advice of appeal rights against reviewable decisions to be given in writing, and defines reviewable decisions to include decisions reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and those taken in an internal review procedure. The administrative chariges to the financial provisions of the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 also form part of this bill. The amendments in part 3 of this bill are consequential to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. These amendments· aim to ensure that the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 example, makes adequate provision in relation to child-care cash rebate functions of the com-, mission. They follow previous amendments the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Act of May 1993. The new cash rebate system is a major part of this bill. For the people of Gilmore, the people who I represent, I would like to put it in these terms: the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate will cut child-care costs for working families. Around 230,000 families with about 350,000 children in informal and formal child care are expected to benefit from this new non-means tested payment. From 1 July this year, parents using child care while working, training, studying or looking for a job will be eligible for a 30 per cent rebate on the cost of child care. The rebate will be paid for all work related child-care expenses for children under 13. The cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents. Unlike other concessions for expenses incurred in earning an income, the new child-care cash rebate will not be means tested. The introduction of this scheme marks an enormous change in our attitude towards child care. It recognises that child care is an important economic issue and not just a welfare issue. I will. go further to suggest that it is not a women's issue; it is a family issue which relates to our whole population. The maximum weekly rebate will be $28.20 per week, or around $1,466 each year, for one child in care. An - amount of $61.20 per week, or around $3,182 each year, will be paid for two or more children. Families will pay the first $16 of weekly child-care costs and then be able to claim 30 per cent of their costs up to the fee ceiling of $110 per week for one child in care or $220 per week for two or more children. To ensure the payment of the rebate from 1 July, families and childcare providers are urged to register with Medicare by person or by mail as soon as possible. Because it will be paid for both formal and informal care, the new scheme will also make child care more accessible and affordable. For it will be paid for expenses incurred the by parents using long day care centres, pre-schools, family day care, outside school hours to care, vacation care, private child care and arrangements including paid care provided in the child's home, although parents may not claim for looking after their own children. The improvements in child care that have been made by this government in its 10 years of office, the recognition that has been given to child care as a major issue in the employment and social spheres of Australian society and the reorganisation ofsociety that has been taking place are truly amazing. The ability of a person of my age and generation to see my male and female contemporaries having more equal opportunities than perhaps my parents did is an indication of the .changes that have taken place in Australian society. Those changes have allowed more egalitarianism and a more efficient and progressive use of the human resources in this country. A woman going out to work was once thought to be an abomination. However, fortune and intelligence have finally broken . through to the point where 51 per cent of Australia's population"""":""that is, the female section of our population---'-has equal, if not more, opportunities to expand their intellectual ability than comparative males. The sickly thing is that in the past women have been suppressed. They have been prevented from reaching· their economic, employment and academic goals and their intellectual capacity. They have not had the basic right of being able to reach. their potential. . Fortunately, this is changing. I would not suggest, particularly to the. Parliamentary ,Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr TheQphanous) and the shadow minister at the table, that at any point we have reached equality, because quite clearly we have not. The membership of this.chamber is an indication of that. In order to understand the reasons why we have essential division on this issue, one should look. at what has happened in the area of child care. I hope that our moves in the area of child care and the freeing of half the population in order to enable it to play a more pro-active role in our community will change women's desire to be in this place. Quite frankly, many of them look at this place, but they do not have a great desire to come here because, in the view of many people, this place is held in low esteem. However, I support the suggestion of Jim Carlton, the former member for Mackellar, that we should have 50 per cent female representation by legislation. Each seat should have two representatives-a male and a female. But in order to do that we first have to realise that males and females are human beings that have responsibilities. It is· of particular interest for us to realise that we are members of families. This is the Year of the. Family. 'Families' is not just a word that can be pulled out every time that, for example, the National Party wants to say something in order to get a warm, glowing feeling. Families are units of individuals. They are an active and dynamic grQup of relationships. What has tended to happen in traditional society, both in the developed and undeveloped .world, is that an undue part of the physical work has been taken on by one. sex in that relationship, predominantly the female sex. In order to even that up, we need to have a realistic approach to the division of labour within the family and the home. No-one can expect an individual to go out and work a 40hour week or longer and then come back and do the same thing in the home. Unfortunately, that is exactly what is happening. To the exten(that I can possibly do if, I will attempt to alleviate that in my home, because I know that I am also guilty of it. In the last 20 to 25 years, the women in our families have been in the workplace and done their fair share of bringing home the bacon via a pay packet, supplementing the family income or even being the sole income earner. They have also been expected to look after the children. . . Child care liberates women and enables them to reach· their potential in the employment market if they so desire. Their being liberated and not tied to those targets requires financial backing, which comes from the provisions of the new child-care cash rebate scheme in the Human Services and He./llth Legislation Amendment Bill. Its set-up through the use of the existing infrastructure-that is, Medicare, et cetera,""""""""""is most appropriate. It avoids the duplication of infrastructure, which all too, often happens, and bureaucracies, which may not be·beneficial for the long-tenn economic efficiency of our community. I highlight the fact that this govern merit has really delivered in the areas in which we have promised to deliver. I take a great deal of pride in standing up here as a member of the government. In the March election, I was one person who put our record on child care' as one of the reasons why I should be elected. OUT promises of continued action in the area of child care is one reason why we should be returned to office again and again. This government has delivered and continues to deliver on one of the most important issues that faces working families. We have delivered iri a way that is fair and equitable. We have delivered in a way so that there is social justice. We have delivered in a way so that the people who need access will obtain access. ,I suggest that those people who are responsible-and I see one of them in the chamber, the parlil,lmentary secretary, at .the table-are owed a great debt of gratitude by the people of Australia because of the way that they have come forward and put this to the Australian people .in such a good and wholesome fashion. I can give an indication of the child-care costs that confrorit the average family. The arrangements that are made in this case, area little pe,culiar;nonetheless, this example is relevant. A certain woman I know wished to have significa.nt time with her children, so instead of working five days a week' she chose to work three days a week. Her remuneration was such that, after she had paid child care for the three days that she did work, she ended up with $150 a fortnight. These arrangements will substantially change that. I know about that example because that woman happens to be my wife. I suggest that to a woman with intelligence and career objectives there is more to life than just her children. It is not a case of fleeing from those children; it is a case of having conversations with people over the age of three and having interests broader than just the marital home, the garden and the shops. Employment allows these women to have a broader perspective on life. It allows them to have broader interests. It allows them to relieve some of the strain that comes from being a parent. I love my children very much. I hope that the relationship is reciprocal and that it is very loving and close. But I can assure honourable members that 24 hours straight with the little beggars and one starts to climb the walls. There is need for people to have fonns of escape. Employment is one of those fonns of escape. It is a fonn of escape which allows people to develop their own interests and further their own intellectual capacities. I believe that these arrangements will enable more people to be involved in our work force and enable us to have a very compassionate attitude towards the new family that is evolving in the Australian social scene. The new family in the Australian social ,scene involves two people working, whether it be full time or part time, and having broader relationships outside. Hopefully we will be able to tie in with the broader concept of what previot-sly enriched our lives-that is, the broader family context of grandparents and other family members. I thank the government for its action in this regard. The responsibility has been heavy. There are a lot of competing needs in the community. For this government to recognise that child care is one of the major issues in the last decade of this century puts us in good stead to allow all members of our community and all members of our society to participate at a level commensurate with their ability. If this enables women to advance to the higher ranks in business, if this enables women to go forward and take their rightful place in our community, I think"" that in the longer tenn, when in the future the history of 'this nation in this' century is told by honest players---,people such as Manning Clark-we will find that this Labor government will be held up in high esteem as a government that cared about its people, both male and female. I thank the House.",111

118,Mrs SULLIVAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I will explain very briefly. I am not going to debate the issues, but a certain ,matter has to be put straight on the record. Earlier today in debate on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bil11994 the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) made certain statements in relation to me and my expressed views on subjects covered by this bill. I took the opportunity to make a personal explanation at the time. Earlier this evening the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) referred to the speech by the honourable member for Moreton and quoted from a speech that I made here in October last year on the subject of child-care rebates. Although I had requested a copy of the green of the speech from the honourable member for Moreton, did not r have it at the time, so it was not possible for me to reply immediately. Obviously it was important that I had the actual words in front of me. I will quote what the honourable member for Moreton said in relation to views I expressed.",115
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! Is this the honourable member for Moreton or the honourable member for Bass? Mrs SULLIVAN'-I just wanted to say what I was making a personal explanation about. Effectively the honourable member for Bass said that my personal explanation was not correct. She quoted from a speech I had made on a subject last year which in the context in which it was given would have appeared to contradict what I had said.,115
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member should move quickly to clarifying her personal explanation to show where she has been misrepresented.,115
121,Mrs SVLLIVAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Moreton said: It is an absolute nonsense for the honourable member for Moncrieff to suggest that we should have no means test whatsoever on family payments. It is a particular nonsense when she has been the one to lead the coalition charge in attacking us because we did not put a means test on the childcare cash rebate. That was the matter on which I took a personal explanation this afternoon. An examination of the record will show that my. criticism todayrelated to means testing the home childcare allowance - In fact, I made no reference to the subject of means testing the child-care cash rebate, which was the particular family payment that both the honourable member for Moreton and the honourable member for Bass referred to. It was not an issue that I had referred to. That is the substance of my personal explanation.",115
122,Mr LEO MCLEAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Watson) (6.28 p.m.)I am glad the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs SuIlivan) is apologising for s9me of the rather extreme positions she has taken in here in the past. The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is an omnibus bill that covers a number of amendments to various pieces of health and human services legislation. In particular, the amendments made by part III of the bill are consequential to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. That act was another important step to ensure that child care is affordable for all working families. From 1 July this year parents using child care while in employment or while training,. studying or looking for work will be able to claim 'a cash rebate for part of their child-care expenses. An estimated 230,000 families with 358,000 children will benefit from that scheme. It would be good if the honourable member for Moncrieff could take note of these particular statistics. This piece of legislation will help 230,000 families with 358,000 children. That is something that she ought to be a bit interested in rather than nattering about on the side. The Commonwealth cash rebate will be administered by the Health Insurance Com. mission on behalf of the Department of Human Services and Health, and the cash rebate will be payable by mail or in person through Medicare offices of the Health Insurance Commission. I think .that that is a very worthwhile social reform. In fact, I believe that in years to come this government will be remembered fOf'its initiatives focusing on supporting the family unit. In my years as a member of the federal parliament, it is hard to remember a more popular initiative than the child'-care cash rebate. This fulfils another promise that the government made during the election campaign. I have received hundreds of phone calls from constituents commending the government on this initiative. I think the opposition would be hard put to find one parent who did not believe that he or she needed this assistance. Even among the opposition, only one honourable member has stQod in this House today to oppose the legislation, and I think that, in a sense, that might be voting with the constituents. It is unfortunate that opposition members are carping that this . initiative should be income tested when in the same breath they are telling taxpayers that they want 'to introduce. income splitting so that well-to-do people earning over $100,000 a year can pay less tax. I do not know where they think there is any equity in that but, then again, faulty thinking is something that in recent years we have come to expect from the opposition on matters such aI) this. I think that opposition members know that few households with young children earn more than $100,000. In fact, according to the 1991 census, in my electorate parents earning mote than $100,000 represented just 0.1 per cent-about 80 people1 have to say that, if the government can look after the rest of those people and provide some assistance, I think that is pretty fair. fact, I beHeve all members of this House, be they in government· or opposition, would be hard pressed to find, in my electorate or anyone else's,a great number of families in the $100,000 income bracket with children ycmng enough to require child care. Maybe the honourable member for Moncrieff, who represents avery affluent part of the Gold Coast, has a lot of these very high income families in her electorate, but I know that Mr Deputy Speaker,representing an electorate in Victoria, and I;' from Sydney, do not have a lot of families in our electorates that earn such incomes. To give some examples of the circumstances in my electorate, recently the Rockdale Council, which covers part of my electorate and part of the electorate of the honour pleted a demographic survey of the municipality.. Some very interesting results came out of that, and I would like to share them with the House this evening. Of the 30,400 households, families make up 70 per cent, and 70 per cent of the families have dependent children. Of those households with dependent children, 6.9 per cent are lone parents and, of those. working parents with dependent children, 73 per cent employ the full-time use of child care in one form or another. However, .it should be noted that Rockdale a is rather settled area; and the figures would be relatively low compared with other parts of my electorate. Nearly one quarter of the people who live in Rockdale live alone or are elderly. In the adjacent Hurstville and Canterbury local government. areas, for which I have not got.anyfigures available at present, I will hazard a guess that the number of young families with dependent children would be twice the number of Rockdale. There is no doubt in my mind that working families with children are a very significant proportion of our society. I believe, and the government believes, that they deserve the very best we can provide in this, the International Year of the Family. That is what they are receiving from this government-assistance where they need it and when they need it. It is a pity that the opposition cannot join with us in totally In supporting this very worthwhile initiative. Another important aspect of this initiative is the recognition of the informal child care sector. In the past, things such as fee reliefwhich I will go into shortly-were available for people in the formal child care area. But for the first time this legislation takes account of the fact that a large number of people have their children cared for by family members or you, friends, The government is taking account of that and providing assistance in that area. I think that the oveiwhelmingly larger part of the provision of child care is in that infonnal area. The government's record on the provision of child care is unequalled, with record growth in the number of places-increasing from 46,000 when we came to office to 257,000 by Junethis year-and our interim target will be 300,000 places by 1996-97. Nevertheless, that still does not provide enough assistance in the infonnal child care area. As I said earlier, for the first time-and only under a Labor government-the childcare cash rebate acknowledges the work of neighbourhood baby-sitters and of grandparents. This aspect alone is a very big leap forward in assisting working parents and ensuring the provision of child care for them. It is very interesting to note what one might say is the mal appropriation of child-care services in Australia; that those parents who come from middle class areas tend to have far greater access to the fonnal child-care system of preschools, nurseries, family day care, et cetera. For people in working class electorates, who by dint of economic circumstances in many cases have to make a decision for both parents to work, there is far less access to a variety of child-care provisions. It used to gall me in the past to see those middle class areas in my city of Sydney having a disproportionate amount of childcare centres and people in working class electorates such. as mine-particularly the very working class areas of my electorate such as Campsie and Lakemba--..:.having access to mostly family day care, neighbourhood friends or relations. With family day care, people got some assistance but, if people had their children being minded in the informal area, there was no assistance at all. I think one of the great provisions of this piece of legislation is a mechanism to allow us to pay people in the infonnal sector. The government has never been content to rest on its laurels. IIi addition to the child-care cash rebate, which we are dealing with in this legislation, we have already introduced a home child-care allowance. Today, as announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the white paper on employment and growth, we will be introducing a new parenting allowance. The parenting allowance will provide payment to one parent free of any obligation to seek work. There will be a more generous income test if the person chooses to combine parenting with paid work. It will mean an extra $59 a week for over 120,000 parents. I think that is something that members of the government and the Prime Minister himself, who has taken a very close interest in this area, can be very proud of. I hope that the opposition, in its response to the white paper later on in the week, will show some decency and embrace at least this portion of the white. paper. This allowance· will be paid at. the maximum of $132.65 per week when the recipient's income is less than $231 per week, reducing to $30 per week when the partner's income exceeds $378 per week. The home child-care allpwance, scheduled for introduction in September this year, will be incorporated into the parenting allowance from July 1995. This will mean that the person receiving the parenting allowance will retain a $30 per week non-taxable payment irrespective of his or her partner's. income. This allowance, along with other changes to the payment'of social security benefits, including the partner allowance, recognises the right of individuals to be paid. In introducing these initiatives which focus on families, the government is recognising that Australia's most valuable resource for the future development of both our economy and our society is our children. Ensuring that our children receive quality care at the beginning of their lives is one of the major priorities of the government. When that is coupled with the government's support for schooling and training after schooling, it shows that the government believes that we should be giving particularly low inc:ome families the best chance we can. These are things that we can look back on in the future and say that, if we did nothing else in our lives, being part of a government that brought forward proposals such as these was a very important thing· to do. These initiatives will be describeq as an apt response by the government in the International Year of the Family. But I think they represent much more than that. They represent an historic shift in the way we view our society working and rightly recognise the importance of the family unit to the social fabric of our nation. As I said earlier, we can look back with pride on a number of very worthwhile initiacare tives that the government has introduced. It worth reconsidering those. In 1983, when we came to office, there were 46,000 operational child-care places. There are now more than 220,000 child-care places, which is an infrom crease of 478 per cent. We reached the figure of 220,000 in December last year. The 1993married 94 budget provided for the provision of 31,000 new places, bringing the total number of places that we hope to provide by the end of this financial year to just under 240,000. We have also provided over 26,000 places to the children of clients on JET, the jobs, employment and training scheme. This congratulate scheme assists sole parents entering or returnPrime ing to the work force. The overall success rate of JET clients being assisted to find a child-. care place is currently running at approxithe mately 96 per cent. The Commonwealth outlays on child care have grown from $65 million in 1983, we came into power, to over $680 million this financial year. That is an incredible increase which shows the commitment the government has to this area. But we are still some way from meeting all the work related demand for child care. Our 1993 election commitment was to meet all work related child-care mand by the year 2000;· The government has set an interim target of 300,000 1996-97, and we are well on track to meet that target. I refer to a number of other schemes have been outlined tonight. One of them which I mentioned earlier is child-care assistis ance, which was formerly called fee relief. That is provided to assist families on low and middle incomes with the cost of child care. is provided to approximately 175,000 famihostility lies. The Commonwealth outlays on assistance are approximately $500 million. I think that is also something that we can very proud of. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, there are 344,000 children from 275,000 families. using Commonwealth funded childcare services. That is a proud record which the opposition, with all its fuzzy thinking, is unable, unwilling or just too plain. mean to appreciate. This government has made child affordable for ordinary working people. is That was our aim and we have met that aim. My wife has worked on and off for most of our married life. lknow how hard it has been time to time for her to have access to child care. I know that the access that young couples or other people with young families have now is far better than it was when my children were young. In the main, that is because of the activities of this federal Labor government. I commend this bill to the House. It has been another milestone in the road we have taken to provide equity in our society. I the minister. I congratulate the Minister, in particular, for the interest he has taken in this very worthwhile program. I think it shows. that the government, unlike opposition, is meeting the goal of the International Year of the Family. I think we can modestly say that we can hold our heads when high in this particular regard.",115
123,Mrs EASSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I congratulate the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) on his contribution to the debate relating to child care. I am very pleased to be speaking on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. ·deSince joining this House I have spoken on several occasions on matters to do with health places by and human services. The health of Australia is a matter that must be very greatly at the forefront of concern of that any government of our nation. We are a society and not primarily an economy. Health not a product; it is a human right. I have always thought that it is a very unfortunate situation that health in Australia is a matter of It such contention and that such diametrical exists between the government and child-care opposition on this issue. The support for Medicare and the full range be of public medical health is extremely widespread in Australia. The opposition partiesdo ,themselves and Australia no good by refusing to commit themselves genuinely and irrevo,cably to the concept of a public medical system financed by a levy on wages and salaries. . . Honourable members will be aware that I am here because I defeated the· opposition spokesman on health in the seat of Lowe. Health was a major issue. I can assure the House that the fear of the health provisions of Fightback was very real and very widespread. Women especially were concerned that the opposition would in fact have a worse system than it was actually promoting in Fightback. Why does the opposition still cling to this view that health is a product like Coca-Cola .or jeans, a product to. be sold to those who can buy and be denied to those who cannot? I know that the opposition said that this was not its policy, but I can tell honourable members that people, especially women, were convinced that this would be the real outcome of the opposition's health policies. The result: major distrust of the opposition on this matter of health. This distrust continues and again, especially amongst women voters, it is a major communication problem for the opposition. Now one may ask why should Ibe worried if the opposition insists on clinging to a health policy outlook that is poison' at the ballot box,· I am concerned because I see the genuine fear and worry of many men and women on low income levels at every election. They fear the result which would see Medicare dismantled and they fear the decline in their famflies' health from such an act. To remove such fear I would suggest that the opposition parties actually have a change of heart and embrace the public health system as exemplified by Medicare. Realistically, I am not too confident that the opposition will take such excellent advice. In urging this I am not saying that there is no place for private health; there is. I am not opposed to private health insurance or private hospitals; they have their place. Australia is a success because we can fit together public and private facilities into one society. By taking this cooperative approach, we include everyone in our vision of Australia. Australians want to be included and they want to belong. They want security. They want a decent standard of living where they do not have to worry that illness will crush them either financially or socially. We Australians are actually different people from others in the world who speak English. Our society is a serious success because of our peculiar avoidance of the pitfalls of class, race and religious bigotries. How this came about is a good question for historians. I will not pretend to know, but what I do know is that . we are differentbecause we look upon each other not as competitors for scarce resources but as cooperators in building a decent place to lIve. This smooth plain of cooperation is not perfectly smooth. Some Australians still see health and human services as a great field for profit and enrichment. I am insistent that highly trained and dedicated medical staff must be properly paid and work in proper conditions. However, I would remind the House that health and human services do not always lend themselves to the achievement of a profit. Can the Flying Doctor Service tum a profit? Can major children's hospitals tum a profit? Can medical research always tum a profit? The ideas of the opposition lead many of us to think that a coalition governmentMrs Sullivan-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am very reluctant to do this because the honourable member is making an interesting speech. But I think she is misled as to the content of the bill that we are debating. We are getting a speech on health. In fact this bill is not about health at all. The Health Insurance Commission is only involved because it is being used as the means to pay the child-care cash rebate. The issue is one of child care, it is not one of health provisions, insurance or anything like that.",118
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Newell)As is the custom in speeches on the second reading, the debate usually involves public policy. An honourable member's speech can range across public policy being affected by the bill. While not acceding to the point of order, I just point that out and leave it to the honourable member for Lowe to ensure that her remarks are addressed towards public policy.",119
125,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is a general bill on human services and health. Although there are specific clauses, all previous deputy speakers have allowed in relation to this bill a wide-ranging debate on a whole range of issues, including the speech made by the honourable member for Moncrieff.",120
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I thank the where parliamentary secretary for his assistance. I have ruled on the matter. Mrs Bishop-On the point of order raised by the parliamentary secretary, which is a separate point of order from the one you ruled on: I would remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, what was said in the minister's second reading speech. He said that the rangements. amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen. Quite frankly, listening to the honourable member's speech, she must have picked up the wrong copy, thinking it was a different bill. I really ask you to call her back to subject matter of the bill before this chamber.",120
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,I am sure she in will do that.,120
128,Mrs EASSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I take the interpretation that even though the issue of child care relates directly to this bill there can be wider definition in terms of health issues well. So I think it is quite in orderMrs Bishop-That is not what the Deputy Speaker just said, so you better just rail it",120
129,Mrs EASSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,You really are very rude.,120
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable AIDS member will address her remarks through the chair.,120
131,Mrs EASSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I apologise. In my electorate of Lowe, 14.5 per cent of people have shown a need for child care for children 0-5 years of age. It has one of the highest demands for child care. This government has seen the need for child care by We know, as we have heard in the speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) this afterCommonwealth, noon, that this need has been further catered for in the white paper on employment. But clearly we have a situation where child care has gone to two different categories: people who have been needing more facilities and people who have been needing child care not only for employment but for the seeking of employment. Clearly there has been a great need· to see a financial commitment by the government to those who pay for child care. Of course, there was the previous situation people were able to get child care But allowances that were means tested. For people who had been using other means of child care, be they private arrangements, nannies, grandparents, et cetera, there was a difference have that had to be met. Clearly we now have a situation where the government has met this need by bringing in the new child-care arI would also like to make some reference to AIDS, if I may. I hope this will be in order, Mr Deputy Speaker, with regards to the fullness of this bill. As many members are aware, the AIDS epidemic is spreading across the world. Scientists are losing hope that an the effective vaccine will be developed in the foreseeable future. In some African cities one three of. the population is HIV positive. Blood can only be accepted from primary school children. The World Health Organisation estimates that 45 million people will be HIV positive within six years. In Europe and a America there are signs that the disease is as spreading, especially among the poor. Around the world there are about 15 vaccines under development. However, it may not be possible in. to find one that protects against all of the strains of the virus. At the end of 1993, nearly one million cases had been formally notified by the World He.alth Organisation. However, the real . figure· is likely to be more than three times this, with two-thirds of the total in subSaharan Africa. The AIDS catastrophe is from expected to dramatically slow population growth, lower life expectancy and raise child mortality rates in every one of the world's these people. poorest countries. For example, in Uganda, a member of the life expectancy by 2010 will be 32 years,down from 59 years in 1990. In the same period, Thailand, with whom· we expect to trade profitably, will"" see its life expectancy fall frQm 75 years in 1980 to 45 by 2010 .. To take the Thailand example further; child mortality rates are expected to rise more than fivefold over the currentMrs Bishop-How is this related to childcare rebates?",120
132,Mrs EASSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Because this issue is very relevantto issues of health as well. In Thailand, child mQrtality rates are expected to rise more than fivefold from the current 20 deaths per thousand born to 110 deaths per thousand born in the year 2010. Unfortunately, all the various international agencies agree on these shocking statistics. This, is a matter of the gravest concern for Australia and the world. We would be well advised to take this epidemic very seriously and not delude ourSelves that thi's is a matter that only group of people and, therefore, the rest of us need not worry. Thi- House has a serious moral duty to the nation to look at this problem in a totally scientific way and not to wrap itself up in smug self-righteous attitudes. Even if we limit ourselves to the most basic level, of our economic ties to the rest of the world, I would remind the House that half the woTld's population in 1994 was to be found in just five countries: China, India, the United States of America, Brazil and Russia. These countries have a major problem with AIDS and not one of these countries is handling the epidemic very well at all. The capacity. for destruction by AIDS is unparalleled· in modem history. For example, in Brazil, Haiti, Thailand and 13 African countries, the AIDS epidemic will slow growth rates so dramatically that, by 2010, these countries will have 101 million fewer people than had been estimated in 1990. For those who smugly suggest that AIDS is just an epidemic amongst homosexual men; the Asian Development Bank has recently written that the AIDS epidemic in Asia will be a higher threat to women than to men. The epidemic is certain to have major socio-economic implications for Asia and the Pacific. At present; more Asian men than women are infected· with HIV. But there is strong evidence that social conditions in Asia, particularly south Asia, may lead to a trend'where mariy more· women become infected. The reasons for expected rising infections among women are biological factors: frequent births, which may require blood transfusions; and the low status of women, which inhibits them from acquiring the means to protect themselves from AIDS. In Australia the situation is a lot better than in any other country. rroper scientific approaches to the problem have existed from the beginning. Adequate education- funding and community concern have resulted in a serious assault on this epidemic. Many people are to be thanked for this timely and, so far, successful campaign. The typical, sensible, bipartisan Australian approach has paid off and I, for one, am most anxious to see that affects a certain this continues. In the weeks aheaq, I will be vi-itingthe . AIDS ward of St Vincents Hospital in Sydney to see and hear for myself at first-hand the current situation with AIDS in Australia. I w:ould urge all members to take' such an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the most up-to-date intelligence on this medical and social catastrophe. Australians have a proud record in medical matters. Oui' predecessor parliaments have always been'supporters of medical research, be it for polio, diphtheria or any other communicable disease.! am confident that this 37th parliament can be worthy of its forebears and stay up, to the mark on this epidemic of AIDS for as long as necessary. I commend the bill to the House. DrTHEOPHANOUS (Calwell-'Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Serv'icesatid Health) (7.03 p.m.)in reply-Itharik all honourable members who have spoken on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. We have certainly had a very wide ranging and interesting debate. We have heard from the'honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), the ,.honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the honourable member for Paterson (MrHorne); the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith); the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) and the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). So we have had a very significant debate on and contributions to this legislation. We have also had the occurrence of a very unique event, in that in the middle of the debate-we started the debate in the early afternoon-we had the presentation before this parliament of one of the most revolutionary pieces of policy by any government for many years. I am referring to the white paper on employment, Working Nation. Elements of that paper affect the issues that have been discussed and, indeed, some of the questions raised by some of the speakers. I will referto that later. Let me begin on one point made by the honourable member for Moncrieff. She made a number of points and she would be very disappointed if I did not respond to them. The first important point was, 'Why isn't Dr Lawrence here to handle the legislation?' Obviously the, honourable member for Moncrieff knows that I have responsibility within the government for legislation in the Department of Human Services and Health, and I have held that responsibility on behalf of a number of rninisters. Mrs Sullivan-I thought the minister has the responsibility too.",121
133,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Moncrieff obviously does not understand the way things operate. Perhaps she ought to go and study the system as it is operated. But the Minister for HumanServices and Health (Dr Lawrence) has approved the policies and the legislation, and the department has been involved scrupulously, with the very hard work of our officers, in putting forward the legislation. That. point made by the hOl:lOurable member for Moncrieff was a furphy. She was trying to raise the point as though the minister were not concerned with the - issues involved here. The minister is very much concerned with the issues raised here in this bill and with issues that honourable members have raised, including those raised by the honourable member for Moncrieff. I refer to the issues of child care and the home child-care allowance. Mr Williams-She has to take your word for that.",122
134,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am telling her. Of course, the honourable member for Moncrieff, if she can get the call from, her leader, might ask the minister a question at some appropriate time and she will get a further explanation of whatever she wants to know. ' Some of my colleagues tried to reply to the issues raised by the honourable member for Moncrieff. She took a number of paints of order, and made a personal explanation because she did not consider that they had properly dealt, with her arguments. She accused them of not referring to the right policy. But, of course, one of the problems we have witli the opposition is that it appears to consider it is okay to means test some things but not others, without any rationale on its part whatever. I could not follow why she objected last year, to the means testing of certain things and then objected when certain other things were not means tested. We seem to have some confusion on the part of the opposition as to' this whole issue of what is to be means tested and what is not. Obviously, it would be good to have a general philosophical position on this, but that is a vajn hope, given that the opposition as a whole has very little philosophical position on social, issues. It needs to think through some issues. Maybe it could learn some things by talking to some of the conservative parties in other countries that have moved beyond the New Right Thatcherist ideas in economics and have tried to do something on social policy. The opposition might actually develop some social policy and we might be able to have a debate in this chamber. As the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) mentioned during question time today, it is no good the opposition simply picking one little piece and saying, 'You should spend more money on that or you should spend more money on another little policy' when its key economic spokespersons are saying, 'Cut out billions of dollars, $5 billion, $6 billion or $7 biIIion, from the budget,' which essentially means the social budget. That is what it means and meant in the last election: the social budget. If the opposition were going to cut th-t money out of the social budget, it cannot come in here and demand all sorts extra spending. That basically was the ment from the honourable member for Moncrief£, Her argument was that we should spend more money, on the parent who is home,whether the wife or the husband, looking after the children. The government, unlike the Liberal Party, is actually concerned with this issue and . brought· forward the home child-care allowcuts ance. What is more, th- government has funded it, notwithstanding the fact that opposition keeps saying, 'Cut the budget.' the same time, we have funded it. MrWilliamsBy borrowing overseas. Dr THEOPHANOUSThe shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for on the other. Tangney, says 'By borrowing'. What is he going to fund it with? Money from trees? reality is that we have to face real economIc and social decisions. There is always a balday? ance judgment between economic and social decisions. What differentiates the Labor Party from the opposition is that we have always been involved in balancing social justice and economic development. The balance between social justice and economic development is the key issue. That is what government is all about in the modem world: finding the right balance, not ignoring social priorities, drastically cutting creating an underclass as Mrs Thatcher did in Britain. The British people are still suffering years afterwards and will probably continue to suffer for many years into the future because of: the lack of concern for social justice and social policy. The honourable member for Moncrieff talked about recognising the role of women men at home. The government has issued a number of papers talking about the r-cogni­ tionof their role and has actually put into place the home child-care allowance. We had another interesting development today with the presentation of the white paper. What we see in the white paper? We see a further development of this matter by the government with the introduction· of the new parenting allowance, which will further support parents at home. What is most interesting is that is a clear social justice measure. In particular, of 120,000 low income families in Australia will argureceive an extra $59 a week on average. We are talking about social justice in at action. We are not getting up and saying, and 'This ought to be done,' and then turning around without the money to pay for it because the economic spokespeople are trying to please certain right wing think-tanks has around the place by talking about massive to the budget. Those QPposite cannot have it both ways. The opposition might have the dropped Fightback and it might have dropped At all of its policies, but it will not be allowed to get away with the idea that it can talk about big cuts to the budget on the one hand and about social concern and social policies Why did the Leader of the Opposition (Dr T-e Hewson) issue a statement attacking the central concept of the jobs compact the other He attacked that idea. In attacking that idea what was he talking about? He was talking about the central social justice idea to assist unemployedpeople. He did that because he recognised that if his party were in government it could not afford it. If one looks at the Fightback package, one. will see that the coalition was going to significantly reduce spending in these areas. How then would the unemployed, especially the long-term unemthings and ployed, have been able to benefit? When talking about people's choices, as the honourable member for Moncrieff did, especial\y choices for women, the basic standard of living which we are able to supply. is of crucial importance- The choices people face are not abstract; they have to be real. They have to be based in real, concrete, economic or and social circumstances. It is no good saying toa person facing abject poverty, 'You've got some choices. ' That person has to actually be offered concrete assistance to make those choices real. This is what this government is doing in relation to child care and in relation do to assistance for women, and in certain cases men, staying at home looking after children. We do believe in the right of choice, contrary to what the honourable member for this Moncrieff said. But unlike the opposition, which talks about the need for there to be 'a right of choice while not providing any substance or any money to support social programs, we actually find the money by a difficult balance between economic and social requirements. That is what is most important with respect to those choices. I totally reject the allegations made by the honourable member for Moncrieff. We are doing more all the time to offer those ch()ices. Choices are becoming increasingly available to women who stay at home, who seek opportunities in the work force or who participate in society in other respects. They are becoming increasingly available to them because of the policies of the government in relation to child care on the one hand and to support for those who choose to stay at home on the other. It is not a question of not offeringequalchoices. Equal choices are being offered and people will be increasingly taking them up. I come back to the point I made a moment ago. There is no point talking about choices in the abstract. There has to be a firm, serious commitment to funding. There has to be a firm, serious commitment to working out the bureaucratic arrangements that will deliver these things. That is what government is about. It is not just a question of making pronouncements. These things are. never easy. It is difficult to administer these .things erly and to make sure that the people who deserve them get them. Of course, we are open to suggestions from the opposition in relatiori to these matters,' but what we have had from most of the spokespeople from the opposition is a refusal to even concentrate on these issues. The honourable member for Moncrieff talked in her speech about the participation of women in parliament. That is a very distant topic from this bill. However, she managed to talk for five minutes on the participation of women in parliament. We will - ssume that the debate was wide ranging at that time. She protested about the honourable member .for Lowe talking about health on the health bill, yet she talked for about five min-tes on the participation of women in parliament. I think it is a very important matter. The honourable member for Moncrieff made the interesting point that there are few women in parliament who were here at the time when they were actually rearing children. I think that is a matter that needs some attention. With respect to the participation of women in parliament, obviously the provision of significant child care and the provision of allowances and support will be very important in assisting them to participate more fully in society, including in the political process,and therefore be able to take up opportunities when they arise. We do not disagree on that point. I do not think the honourable member should try to make some political point against the government by claiming that it is not interested in supporting women who wish to stay at home. As I have mentioned, the allowances announced today further support that, especially for low income earners. I also want to refer to some other important matters which are quite relevant to the childcare allowance. It is very important for people to recognise that they can apply for this allowance now, and they should be applying for it. It is clear that the benefit from that allowance will further strengthen families and the participation of women and their role in society. I strongly urge people to become aware that they can apply for the allowance propnow. We need to do more to encourage people to do so. I conclude by congratulating the govern,. ment and the ministers involved for putting forward the white paper, especially for what it does for the general issues of soCial justice that we are discussing here. The white paper makes a tremendous contribution in the area of social justice. It gives a massive $6.5 billion injection to a whole range of programs: programs to assist women, young people in trouble and a whole range of disadval1taged people:-those from non-English speaking backgrounds, Aboriginal people, those with disabilities and the homeless-and, most importantly, programs to assist the long term uneniployed to get back to work. In this the International Year of the Family it is very important to realise when we are talking about helping people-especially women-that most of us participate in society because of our family circumstances. For example,if in a two person family both people are long-term unemployed, desperation occurs-a certain sense of inability to participate in and be part of society. The formation of an underclass of people who feel rejected by society is a very serious matter. The white paper has addressed that; which is a very good thing. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",122
135,Mrs SULLIVAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Moncrieft) (7.24 p.m.)I think it would be appropriate at this point put a couple of points straight that have in the course of debate. Early in my speech on the second reading I made reference to the fact that I was disappointed that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was not here, given that the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill is her first bill. The Parliamentary Secretary to theMil1ister for Hurrian Services and Health, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), in his reply said that I was in error. Did I know that, as parliamentary secretary, he did legislation? He said that the minister approves policy and legislation and then he. handles it here. I am well used to the honourable member for Calwell handling legislation for the Minister for Health, but the previous Minister for Health was a senator, and I really did not expect former Senator Richardson to appear in this chamber and handle this legislation. I was disappointed that, now that we have a minister who is a member of the House of Representatives, she is not here. This is not meant in any way to denigrate the parliamentary secretary; he knows I would not do that. But I just remind the parliamentary'secretary that this arrangement can lead to an ul1satisfactory situation. There have been .times in debate in the committee stage in this House when certain matters have been raisedamendments and explanations and so on-arid the parliamentary secretary was not in the best position to reply for the government. Instead, we were given an indication thaUhe government could well consider favourably the amendment but was not' capable of doing it here because the minister was in the Senate. So the House had to pass legislation :.vhich, it was acknowledged, could be deficient and send it to the Senate to be fixed up. I do not think that is something that any member of this House would like. I want to knock on the head the idea that, because a minister has a parliamentary secretary, that minister has absolutely no obligation to this House and that the parliamentary secretary has the obligation to be here for legislation. I recommend to the parliamentary secretary at the table that he take a look at the to record of, for example, the Minister for arisen Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). That minister also has a parliamentary secretary, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). Nevertheless, the Minister for Employment, Edul::ation and Training makes a point of reading his own second reading speeches, of being present for his own debates,. of moving his own replies to second readings, and carrying any debate that there may ·be in the detailed consideration of the bill. I lament the idea that ministers no longer have any sort of obliganot tion to the parliament when' it comes to the handling of their own legislation. That is enough on that subject. Coming to the subject of the debate, the parliamentary secretary seemed to be' very proud of the fact that the home child-care allowance is funded. I remind theparli<l:mentary s-cretary that rebates for child-care costs, where they are costs of employment, and equivalent payments for home child-care allowance were part of Fightback. Those very generous measures were part of the opposition's policy before the last election. It was after we had announced the details of our policy that the government came up with policies that it certainly had never mentioned before but which appeared to be 'equivalent to the. coalition's policies. What the government. did not· mention at any stage, of course, was that it was going to fund the home child-care - llowance by cashing out the dependent spouse rebate. I have already indicated that there is no problem with that. There have been many reports over the years that show that the dependent spouse rebate was a very .poorly targeted benefit and that this is a better way of targeting it. However, those who might have been tempted to vote Labor, believing that there was going to be increased support for the family where a parent was full time at home playing the parenting role, have been disappointed because there is a cashing out of the benefit. There is no increased benefit. I wish I could share the parliamentary secretary's 'enthusiasm for the announcement of the parenting allowance today. I am going to wait until I see the fine print, as indeed voters of Australia should have done. They did not wait for the fine print on the government's election promises last time. (nme expired)",125

137,Mrs SULLIVAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Moncrieft) (7.29 p.m.)I must hark back to the matter of family payments and certain statements that have been made here today. For example, I made reference in my speech-a reference which has been ignored by government members since-to the family allowance which was introduced by the Fraser government. This was achieved partly through a cashing out of the dependent child rebate. The major part of the cost of the introduction of the family allowance was achieved by means of very vastly increased ;family"" payments derived from the increase in the then fuel excise. NA",126
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Fringe Benefits Tax",126
139,Mr RICHARD EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"Since 1 April 1994 amendments to the fringe benefits tax have been implemented which have caused considerable concern throughout the community. Small businessmen and women have been placed in a position where company owned assets previously exempt from the fringe benefits tax now qualify. The concemwhich has been raised with me has been initiated by an elector within the Cowan electorate, Mr Bri,an Aitken of Kingsley. He has asked ask me to present his case to the parliament. Needless to say, this is only one example of the many businesses within the electorate of Cowan' and throughout Australia that are concerned,about these amendments. Mr Aitken writes: lam an insurance broker contracted to a major insurance broking organisation, and my wife and I operate through a proprietary limited company servicing insurance needs for some 500 clients, utilising the facilities, systems and backup of a major insurance broking house. I have an office at the home, however by necessity, and convenience, travel to the inner city office where I utilise the computer systems and clerical backup, which is provided. It is necessary for me to use my car regularly in carrying out my business and to be available on demand to visit any such clients as may require my services from time to time. In addition I need to be mobile to respond to any new business opportunities that may arise. I have chosen to purchase a regular parking spot close to the office (approximately 200. metres). For that I pay $225 per calendar month. Up until 1 April 1994 that cost was a tax deduction as a business expense reasonably incurred in earning my income. From 1 April 1994, with the cynical wave of a pen, the federal government has determined that such an expense is deemed to be a fringe benefit in that the parking paid for my company (as indeed the vehicle is owned by my company) and the company must pay fringe benefits tax on the cost of the parking. Mr Aitken continues by pointing out the bureaucracy which he is now facing to resolve the issue. He says: I am told that if I can establish that I am absent from my office into'wn for "":lore than four hours per day I may be exempt from this impost, but as I maintain a regular parking spot this will be difficult to establish. hi addition, because of the nature of business, such activity, whilst it maybe the case for several days, may not be the case on every day and therefore I will need to prove such absence from the office and apportion a comparative cost accordingly. The clerical and accounting costs involved in such an exercise will be horrendous. Whilst it may be that Some people could obtain a fringe benefit by having an employer pay for parking in .an area close to an office, I am not completely convinced of this. I fail to see how it could be deemed· that I am obtaining a fringe benefit whatsoever by my company paying for a parking spot which is necessarily required to enable me to carry out my duties as a director of that company and consequently ea- my in-ome. I see the cost as merely another cost In runmng a motor vehicle which isa necesSary tool of my trade and of my business. My wife and I own a family car which we use for such family occasions, and rarely is the business car - ed for such private activities. While the amendment .to. the fringe. benefits tax that Mr Aitken is alluding to. may have seemed a go.o.d idea in theo.ry, it is o.bvio.us that it is yet ano.ther example o.f the ineffectiveness in practice. Like the Family Law Act and the Child Suppo.rt Agency, it seemed like a go.o.d idea at the time. It is typical o.f this Labo.r go.vernment.It has clearly stated the - myth again this week that· it is supporting small business. I wo.uld cite Mr Aitken o.f Kingsley as an example o.f the way the Labo.r go.vernment igno.res the needs.of small business and the business co.mmunity as a who.le in Allstralia and co.ntinues to. run rampant thro.ughthe ever decreasing sto.ck it has with small businesses. I ask that the go.vernment, if it is sincere abo.ut lo.o.king after small business, co.nsider the needs o.f small business in the fringe benefits tax area. Ferry Services: Disabled Access ..",126
140,Mr CHYNOWETH,ADJOURNMENT,"The Royalauto o.f April 1994 states: Fourteen times a day the brand new $5 million, 750-tonne Queenscliff-Sorrento ferry links the Momington and Bellarine Peninsulas on a picturesque and calm 35-minute voyage. Ferry fares? They vary slightly according to the make of vehicle and time of year but a guide is for a family sedan, $35 for one way, plus $3 for each adult and $2 for children aged five to 15. The Queensclijf can carry. as many as 60: vehicles and 500 passengers .on each crossing of Port Phillip Bay. ... :., John Mackeddie, general manager of Peninsula SearoadTransport, says it has rarely missed its scheduled quota of 14 crossings each day. . This is the same MrJo.hn Mackeddie that started a ho.vercraft business with mo.ney from the VEDC and left a co.ncrete ramp down at Frankston. I believe that the Franksto.n people are paying fo.r that to. be cleaned up and taken away· as a result o.f the ho.vercraft service go.ing broke. I received a letter abo.ut this ferry from one o.f my co.nstituents, who. wrote to. the ferry co.mpany. The letter states: I travelled last week on your new Queenscliff to Sorrento ferry accompanied by my family, a member of which is in a wheelchair, a young woman paralysed from waist down with Multiple Sclerosis. To my horror I found no facilities whatsoever for such people. From the car level there is no lift to the loungeroom and all facilities are upstairs. On talking to one of the officers of this vessel, I was told of the rush to make this boat available for, the Christmas period and was advised she could either remain in the car or in her wheelchair on the car level. I must state that as a ferry it is very comfortable for the normal homeo sapien. Was it not made mandatory that all tourist and recreation facilities must include at least one facility for wheelchair victims. Thank God she did not require the use of a toilet or become seasick. Can. you imagine this dilemma? I. would strongly recommend that you give this deplorable situation your urgent attention especially as it was awarded a Tourism Award for Transportation 1993. I co.ntacted the. federal Minister fo.rTranspo.rt (Mr Brereton) to. ascertain fo.r which areas the federal go.vernment has respo.nsibility in this matter. The car ferry. operates o.nly within Victo.ria and as such falls under the jurisdictio.n o.f the Marine Bo.ard o.f Victo.ria. The Co.mmo.nwealth's marine safety autho.rity, the Australian Maritime Safety Autho.rity, has no. jurisdictio.n o.ver vessels o.perating intrastate. I co.ntacted the Marine Bo.ard o.f Victo.ria and it is still having. discussio.ns with the Disability Adviso.ry Co.uncil o.f Australia. I also. spo.ke to. the minister'so.ffice which has asked the Department o.f Transpo.rt to. investigate what steps can be taken to. guarantee access. This ship has no. specific facilities fo.r disabled travellers. A disabled perso.n has the optio.n o.f staying in his o.r her vehicle or sitting next to. the vehicle in the wheelchair travelling as cargo.. Altho.ugh it is a mu1tisto.rey vessel, there is no lift so. that these people may use the same viewing, eating and to.ilet facilities o.ffered to. able-bo.died travellers .. There is a clear case of discrimination, as disabled people are not offered a concession rate for travelling. Therefore, disabled people are forced to travel steerage class as cargo but pay the same rate as able-bodied travellers who are able to enjoy and use the full facilities of this vessel. The company does acknowledge, however, that there are toilet facilities for the disabled at each of the three ports-not much help when one is aboard this ship at sea! Queensland Cement Ltd",127
141,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to applaud yet another significant milestone for Central Queensland and for Gladstone, which is rapidly becoming the new age industrial capital of Australia. On 8 March I attended the official opening of Queensland Cement Ltd's $33 million expansion at Fishermans Landing just north of Gladstone in my electorate of Hinkler. QCL, which is owned by the Swiss based Holderbank Group, is Queensland's largest manufacturer and distributor of cement and is one of Australia's major marketers of cement products. The expansion at Fishermans Landing involves the addition of state-of-the-art cement milling, storage, bagging and palletising facilities. The new installations complement the established limestone mine at nearby Mount Larcom, also in my electorate, with its unique slurry transport system and existing clinker production plant at the Fishermans Landing site. For those not familiar with cement processing, I will give a quick sketch of what is involved. The first stage of cement manufacture is the production of clinker. The main raw materials in clinker are limestone, silica, iron oxide and alumina. These materials are obtained from QCL's East End mine near Mount Larcom and from sandmining leases near Gladstone. The raw materials are crushed and mixed with water to fom a slurry and pumped at the rate of 250 tonnes per hour, 24 kilometres via an underground pipeline to Fishermans Landing. At Fishermans Landing the slurry is dried and then fired in a special kiln to form clinker. To complete the process, the clinker is combined with special amounts of gypsum and limestone and fed into a ball mill that grinds it into a very fine, light grey powder which we commonly know as cement. The cement is conveyed to a 20,OOO-tonne silo and is ready for dispatch either in bulk or bag form for distribution to Central 'and North Queensland or for export. ',The expanded facility has. meant that QCL Gladstone can produce and dispatch approximately 600,000 tonnes of cement a year, or,approximately 10 per cent of Australia's current consumption. The new additions ensure that QCL Gladstone is an internationally cost competitive cement manufacturing plant,giving the company a competitive edge in marketing cement in Australia, Oceania, and South-East Asia. I tum briefly to the human face of' the company.' QCL Gladstone employs around 100 skilled' and dedicated people; Recent workplace changes have resulted'in the adoption of many innovative work practices, ensuring an effective workplace.Thecompany also has its own environmental policy which provides for the efficient use of natural resources, minimising the creation of wastes . and, where possible, the recyCling of those wastes. In summary, I see QCL Gladstone as significant for three reasons: firstly, it sources nearly all its raw materials locally; secondly, it is a classic example of value-dding, with the company now upgrading 'its operations to produce both clinker and cement; and, thirdly, the QCL facility at Gladstone is - prime example of regional development at its best. Would to heaven 'there were more QCt. type initiatives in today's lacklustre white paper. Mr Knott-Oh, come on.",128
142,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"It is bad; is it not? QCL's establishment of a clinker plant back in the early 1980s saw the company contribute $12 million to the infrastructure of Gladstone, including the first bridge across the Calliope River in the near-Gladstone area,. At the northern end of Gladstone Harbour; where it established Fishermans Landing wharf, it has improved the harbour access and"" has pioneered the Yarwun industrial estate justnonh of the city, which is now home to several major chemical plants, including ICland Minproc. In other words, QCL acted as a catalyst further development in the region Jiteral1y cementing-excuse the punGladstone's reputation as an industrial centre. r regret I was not able to raise this matter developing during our sittings in March, but belatedly I wish to congratulate the company, its executives"" its staff and the .wider Gladstone . comes community, for what really is a landmark in regional development. Export Access Program",128
143,Mr GRIFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to. inform the House tonight of a recent visit to my electorate by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), and a visit to a local company which is an example of how sucinternational cessful some of the government programs have been in relation to encouraging exports. Champion Compressors Ltd is a small comfocused pany established in 1970; specialising in the manufacture of industrial electric compressors. The company has a turnover of approximately $20 million per annum. We were met at the factory by Mr Gerry Mussen, the Ma:naging Director; Mr Wayne St Baker; and also a representative of the export access program. The company noW exports some 25 percent of its products, and the company's turnover has increased by approximately $5 million from $15 million to $20 million. A lot of that has had to do the export access program. An. article in local newspaper states: Champion's marketing and export directo- Mr Wayne St. Baker said the company's success had already paved the way for extra jobs and more could follow depending on the movement of Australian dollar. The article further states: Mr St Baker, tol,d 'The Journal' his company ""got its foot in the door"" at the 1993 Beijing access. International.Fair where it secured four orders for product and received 15 inquiries from potential distributors. ""It - s - Imost impossible for a small company make It In the export market because you just don't have the capital,"" he said. ""Without the program we would never have had a chance and without adequate research and expertise there's always the question of 'where do for we go'-we may have tried a dozen markets as well as without a strike. ""Frankly, we would never have considered China as a market and now we're well down the track in very positive business throughout the Asian Pacific region. ""Already we've had to increase our staff to 125 people, an increase of 15 per cent, and as business in, more local jobs will be created."" This program, export access, is something that we then advertised through the local papers and already we have had in the last two weeks four inquiries from local businesses which we passed on to the program to ensure that they were able to access this assistance. Professional help is readily available for small and medium size firms seeking to enter markets. Although many small and medium size enterprises, SMEs, have realised that they had to be internationally if they wanted to be around. in the 21st century, access to export assistance was screw often difficult to find. When export access started two years ago, . it created a lot of interest with SMEs as they recognised that much of the assistance·which they were seeking would be provided by the program. Export access has also been seen to be a fast track into export markets for many businesses as well as being a we)) structured program for firms which are about to enter international markets for the first time. Fundwith ed and administered by the Commonwealth a government, export access is delivered by the private sector and participants do not pay any fees or charges. A team of project managers is located throughout Australia in leading industry the associations providing intensive hands-on assistance.to help SMEs develop new business in selected overseas markets. However, applicants are not required to be members of an industry association to participate in export .Export access is not a grant scheme. The program offers a comprehensive package of to training and practical assistance to SMEs looking to develop offshore activities. Partici' pating firms appreciate the program 's simplicity, flexibility and having their business appointment schedules arranged for them by the project managers. These business appointments are set up through a strong international network of private sector industry associations and other appropriate programs and networks. Export access is also unique in its concept as all applicants receive a visit manager to evaluate their potential and suitability for the program. It is a government funded program which goes out to the potential clients. Strong bonds are often formed between the project managers and their clients through the hands-on assistance provided by the account manager concept. A fundamental aim of - xport access..is to prepare and train smaller firms to survive and prosper in the international marketplace. Launched in October 1991. as a pilot program to handle 250 firms over three years, export access has received significant funding boosts, initially after its first 12 months in the One Nation statement in 1992, and more recently with a further commitment of $8 million in the 1993-94 Commonwealth budget. The $20 million funding allocated to export access will enable 1,400 SMEs to be processed by the end of 1995. The funding supports the operations of 25 project managers. located in major industry associations throughout Australia and overseas Australian business offices in St Louis, Osaka and Amsterdam. Four hundred and eighty-five firms have been accepted into the program as at 11 March 1994 and approvals are proceeding at a rate of approximately 50 to 60 a month. Export access has already gained an enviable performance record from the 485 clients who have entered the program. Over 170 firms have now finished the export access program and are completing formal exit questionnaires and evaluation surveys. The first 107 surveyed have shown spectacular results, with 84 per cent of the companies successfully arranging long-term busi.ness relationshi ps. Whilst lead times for doing export business can be .quite protracted, the 100 firms surveyed have already achieved sales of $7.6 million, a figure which they expect to reach $78 million in the next three years. These firms have demonstrated a commitment to export by appointing new business arrarigements through the export. access program. It is a great success and it will continue from there. I thank the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for his assistance during from a project tonight's debate. Superannuation: Casual Employees",129
144,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Grey) (7.48 p.m.)"":""-r rise to speak about superannuation and its limited benefits for. casual or itinerant workers. The honourable merriber fcir Moreton (Mr Gibson) I trust will not assist me as well. . Mr Gibson interjecting",130
145,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Many of my colleagues have noted this before. However, J would like to highlight·the absurdity again. Simply put, superannuation for many casual employees is a farce. On 17 August 1993 the. former Treasurer acknowledged the problem which superannuation poses for casual employees. Mr Dawkins noted then that relatively small amounts of. money which had to be contributed on behalf of many casual and itinerant employees could be eroded by the fees and charges applied by their superannuation funds. This concern was echoed by Susan Ryan, the executive director of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia-she is well known to this place, particularly to the Senate-on 21 April 1994 in an article in the Australian Financial Review. Ms Ryan said: There are genuine shortcomings in the (superannuac tion) scheme, partiCularly as it applies to lowincome and casual workers or people not in the paid workforce: Our superannuation scheme is geared towards a person who works continuously for many years. Thus, it discriminates against people who are forced to work on a casual basis. It discriminates against many women whose working pattern is often int-rrupted by childbirth and some years in the· home looking after children, It discriminates against rural and itinerant workers, who are forced by the nature of their work to move. around the country and to work as the weather permits. It also discriminates against people who only pick up work from time to time, who form a growing group in today's economic climate. I had some experience of the problem of superannuation for casual employees after recently employing a person for only a few weeks. Because the employee earned more than $1,000, I was required by law to pay three per cent of her income towards superannuation. As we all know, this money has to be paid into a complying superannuation fund. Unfortunately, the employee did not already have ,a superannuation fund. She had to open one specifically for the superannuation. By the time 'she reaches her retirement years-in fact, well before-the superannuation she earned while working in my office will have been eaten up in administration fees. This is not news to the many groups which have lobbied the government to amend our superannuation rules. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is examining the problem of casual employee superannuation being consumed by - dministration fees, taxes and other charges. My colleague Senator Watson from Tasmania is the chairman of that committee. He understands the chaos of superannuation as it relates to casual employees. Committee members have already received many representations from casual workers, who are concerned about their superannuation being consumed by fees and charges. I note that· the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations has made a submission to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to combat the problem. The federation proposes to establish Ii central fund to collect superannuahappened tioncontributions for part-time and casual workers. This central fund would apply to people who have a number of part-time or casual jobs throughout the years and would enable them to pay their superannuation into one account, giving them a greater chance of accumulating something for their retirement. The number of part-time and casual employees is growing each year as the structure of our work force changes to combat our high unemployment. Clearly, something needs to be done about the superannuation scheme as it applies to this growing section of the work force. Superannuation is meant to be a reward and a security net for all workers. At the moment, it is simply absurd. In conclusion, the New South Wales Farmers Federation said: . . . the superannuation system at the moment looks as though it was designed by a committee of misdirected people locked away in an air conditioned room in Canberra and totally detached from the real world. It was! Until oUT,superannuation system is changed, many workers, particularly women and rural workers, will be at risk of receiving absolutely no benefit from the superannuation scheme which purports to help them. . BougainviIle: Parliamentary Delegation",130
146,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, I have just recently come back from a delegation assigned from this House which went to Bougainville. I do not wish to speak on the contents of the report, which will be placed before this House in four or five weeks. However, I wish to make some comments about some observations that were made there. . ' The .delegation was led by Senator Loosky. The deputy chairman was the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). It was also attended by Senator Vicki Bourne, Senator Paul Calvert and me. The time of the delegation was just prior to ANZAC Day. We felt it would be very good for us, particularly as we were going there, to visit the war graves in Rabaul. One of the most moving things that have to me for a long time was going through and looking at a place where Australian soldiers from the First World War and the Second World War are lying at rest: To see the, graves that contain messages from the families of those people who had fallen was indeed a remarkably moving thing. One of the recurring themes was the ages on those Second World War graves. Most, many, a lot-whatever word or percentage we would like to put on it-listed people who were 18 or 19 years of age. I think I saw three or four graves of people who were older than I am today. One particular grave had an inscription on it which referred to a wife left and a small boy who would now probably be in his 60s. It seems to me, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I could not come back into this House without making some comment on those people who have been before us and whether war is right or wrong. I think you know that I am a peace activist; I am not a pacifist. There are moves by others in this House to have ANZAC Day recognised as a national day of remembrance. My family always chose 11 November as that day. I have no objection; in fact, I would support greatly ANZAC Day being marked in a permanent way on our calendar. But I think one of the things that motivate me in this House, and will always motivate me in this House, in terms of what I do and in terms of conflicts abroad and at home, will be what I saw in Rabaul. I believe that what the others were all significantly touched by was that, irrespective of the cause of war, the results are pulled out of the community itself. I would like to ,state in this House that whatever I can do to make sure that this country has a peaceful existence in the future, I will do. I honour those people who have passed before us and who have given their all, and I hope that all parts of nation will forever honour the service that they have given, the sacrifice that they have made, and the fact that they cannot be back with us in this country. The fact that maybe some of their people will never see the graves where they lie scattered all around the world is a tragedy. But probably the biggest tragedy is the holes that they have left. I assure honourable members that there are still many people, many women and many families, who still have holes in them from our previous engagements. I was against the Vietnam War, but I am all for those people who participated. (Time expired) Greek Cypriots",131
147,Mr DOBIE,ADJOURNMENT,"In tonight's adjournment debate I want to raise an issue which is significant to the Greek Cypriot community within Australia. I have had considerable contact with constituents of mine with Grecian heritage over the past few weeks, but it is not my intention to canvass the Macedonian issue tonight. I want to use this time to draw the attention of the House to another issue which is important to Australians of Greek Cypriot heritage. It concerns the fact that Australian citizens of Gre-k Cypriot heritage are being de,nied their property ownership rights in the Turkish occupied part of Cyprus. Just over a third of the country of Cyprus has been occupied by the Turks since they invaded in July and August 1974, and it is estimated that some 200,000 people have been displaced as a result of the invasion. Many of ,those people who were displaced following the Turkish invasion have migrated to Australia, and the 'latest census figures confirm that there are something like 22,000 people in Australia who were born in Cyprus. It must be remembered that many Cypriots migrated to Australia prior to the Turkish invasion. One estimate 1I have seen is that 10,000 Cypriots own land in the Turkish occupied part of Cyprus. These people are Australian citizens who have maintained land ownership since migrating from Cyprus or have inherited the property from their parents or grandparents. It is not unreasonable to estimate the value of this property at somethis thing between $300 million and $400 million. My cause and problem tonight is that I am concerned that Australian citizens who are owners of this property are being denied their fundamental right of ownership by the Turkish government. This is clearly an unpalatable situation and one which must be rectified. I will finish my comments on a further occasion.",132

In February 1993 the then Commonwealth Minister for Land Transport, the Hon Bob Brown MP, and the Victorian Minister for Public Transport announced a revised estimate of $153m, reflecting the decision to build a dedicated freight line to Geelong. Some $118m of the total project amount is' to be spent on the Victorian section of ,the line. National Rail .has control of project management over this section.

Billiard TableCloth: Tariff (Question No. 815) Mr Hawker asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry,' Science and Technology, upon notice,on 17 December 1993: . . . Wil.l.th- Government. impose a tariff on imported billiard table cloth; if so, (a) at what level, (b) is cloth of this particular quality manufactured in Australia; if not, why is the tariff being imposed and (c) is the imposition of the tariff in line with the recent conclusion of the GATT negotiations. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) The Government does not intend to amend the tariff rate of customs duty on imported billiard table cloth. The present customs duty' rate is General 29%; Developing Countries 24%; Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province 27%; New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Forum Island Countries Free. (b) (i) Cloth which can be used on billiard is manufactured in Australia by Macquarie Textiles Pty Ltd. Macquarie Textiles do not manufacture high quality cloth, known as ""competition quality"" cloth, and a Tariff Concession (providing duty free importation) for such cloth was granted in 1991 but revoked on request from Macquarie on 21 September 1993. The concession legislation operating at that time required that the COfnptroller-General should not allow a concession if ""goods serving similar functions"" were produced or were capable of being produced in Australia in the normal course of business. Locally produced goods did not need to be ident.ical to the imported goods, it was sufficient under the system existing at that time goods served a similar function. That revocation decision would have meant that competition billiard cloth was subject to duty but the Government· introduced a new concessiol'l system on 1 November 1992 with broader reqtlirements than the old system. An application under the new system was lodged on 1 October 1993 and the narrower wording of this concession was accepted by Macquarie Textiles. The net effect of this action is sion for ""competition quality"" cloth has been granted, effective from I October 1993. (ii) No tariff rate has been ""imposed"" on billiard cloth. Billiard cloth is classified to a heading which has the rates previously mentioned applied to it. A tariff concession now exists which' allows duty free importation of ""competition quality"" billiard cloth This' quality billiard cloth has received the benefit of duty free admission since 1991. (c) As mentioned, the, tariff rate for textile products of this nature has been in place for some time and is not effected by the recent .GATT negotiations. The current concession allows duty free importation of ""competition quality"" cloth and that concession will rerriain in place unless an Australian manufacturer should commence manufacture of substitutable goods; Attorney-Get1eral's Department: Purchases (Question No. 853)  upon notice, on 1 February 1994: . Does the Minister's Department employ proper accounting procedures to record departmental purchases; if so, (a) what system is used, (b) are all purchases recorded and (c) to what extent are records accessible by auditors, departmental officers and other officials; if not, (i) why not and (ii) what procedures are used for appropriate financial management tables and reconciliation of purchases.",136
150,Mr LAVARCH,TOTALS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes, the Department utiHses various accounting systems to ensure proper accounting procedures are in place to record Departmental purchases. (a) The Department uses four separate accounting systems across the areas of the Department indicated below. The systems are all proprietary accounting systems with a full range of accounting functions. Core Department: (F1SCLE) which stands for that Financial Information System Clerical Legal Executive and is a product of Management Solutioris Pty Ltd. It has operated in the Department for 5 yearS. AUSTRAC: Open System Accounting (OS AS). This is a product of INTECH Software Pty Ltd, NSW and has been operating in . AUSTRAC since I July 1992. AUSCRIPT: Rainbow Accounting System. The Rainbow system is owned by PARKLANE Computing Ply Ltd, Victoria. This system has been that a concesoperating since I July 1991. Australian Protective Service: NOMAD FINANCIALS. This system is owned by the Department of Administrative Services and the Australian Protective Service has been using this system since I July 1990.. (b) All purchases are recorded on the various .. Departmental accounting systems. These systems a.\l operate integrated purchasing modules. These modules incorporate electronic controls to ensure that only authorised officers are able to approve and process purchases. With the exception of the Rainbow Accounting System, certificates under Finance Regulation 45A(3)(b)(ii) have been issued. These certificates provide an assurance that the system controls and local procedures can be relied upon by the users. This certificate is issued after extensive validation of the processes has been completed. A certificate for the Rainbow Accounting System is cmrentIy being sought. It should also be noted that all creditor details from those systems as at 30 June each year are the subject of scrutiny by the AlJStralian National Audit Office as part .of their Departmental Financial Statements Audit. ' (c) Access to the various accounting systems under my portfolio are available to auditors, Departmental officers and other officials on a needto-know basis as required. , Aboriginal Legal Services (Question No.·S71)",139
151,Mr NUGENT,TOTALS,"the Minister fot Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affai'rs, upon notice, on 2 February 1994: (1) Has he or the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) requested the Office of Evaluation and Audit to evaluate or audit, pursuant to paragraph 76(1 )(t) of the, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989, any or all of the Aboriginal Legal Services ,rec,eiving funding from ATSIC. . (2) WiII the. provision of future grants to Aboriginal Legal Services be subject to satisfactory evaluations or audits on the use of previous grant moneys:'"" (3) WiII the results of the:e-alu-tions and audits referred to in parts (I) and (2) be placed on the public record; if so, where and when will the results be made, public. (4) Are grant moneys which ATSIC provides to bodies corporate considered to be public':moneys; if so, (a) what level of detail is.available concerning how the funds are spent and (b) where can the information be, obtained. Mr Tickner---'-The answer to the honourable member's question is as fo\lqws: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question:' (1) No. An evaluationot'the Commission's Law and Justice component is currently being conducted by· the Office of Evaluation and Audit as part of the ongoing program of evaluations of Commission programs which the Office is required regularly to conduct. This evaluation was not requested by me or the Commission. (2) All recipients of grant funding from ATSIC, pursuant to section 18 of the ATSIC Act are already subject to annual and recurrent evaluation and assessment of their financial management and use of grant moneys as a condition of continued funding under provisions set out in ATSIC's Funding Procedures Manual.. (3) The.results of evaluations and audits conducted by the Office of Evaluation and Audit either at my request or at that of the Commission under paragraph 76(1)(f) are conveyed, by that Office, to me and to the Commission. Decisions on whether the results of the evaluations and audits will be placed on public record will rest with me or with the Commission as appropriate. (4)., Monies granted to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations by ATSIC have their source.in money appropriated from time to time by Parliament for ATSIC. In that sense the money is public money but once it is given to an Aboriginal Corporation it is, according, to legal advice, deemed at law to be the property of the grantee corporation. Although grants to Aboriginal Corporations are subject to grant conditions the corporations have ' the same. rights, privileges and discretions in the use .of those fUl1ds as any private corporation, provided the funds are not used in a manner inconsistent with the general purposes of that grant. The Aboriginal Legal Services are incorporated either under State legislation, or are incorporated undenhe Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act . 1976 (Cth). Both regimes require their registered corporations to lodge annual audited 'reports and c!etailed income and expenditure statements within a reasonable time after the completion of each financial year. Both eriactments provide for public access to such documents upon payment of a statutory fee. In i1dditi'on ATSIC would have documents dealing with individual grants, acquittals and other matterS'affecting 'funded bodies. Provision of documents by Commonwealth agencies is subject to the Freedom of Information Act, 1982 (Cth) and to its procedural provisions and its heads of exemp'.' tion in appropriate matters. High School Students: Tax File Numbers (Question. No, 884), "" Mr CAMERON asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice; on 8 February 1994:. . Is it a fact that schools are being paid by the Australian Taxation: Office (ArO) fqr eac'h high school student that the school' encourages to apply for a tax file number; if so, (a) what sum are the schools being paid for each student, (b) why is the ATO usi'ng this method to distribute tax. file numbers and (c) what sum has been paid to each school involved.",140
152,Mr GEAR,TOTALS,"The answer to the honourable member's quest,ion is as foHows: No. Schools are not being paid to encourage students to apply for a Tax File Number. (a) Schools will be paid $3 per application processed in recognition of administrative costs incurred by schools which choose, to participate in the Tax File Number School Service which the Australian Taxation Office has established. (b) This Service will enable Year lOstudents to apply for a Tax File Number in a cheaper and more convenient way than the usual application process, if they wish to do so. The ATO estimates that 80% of Year lO students have a Tax File Number before the end o,f the school year. The Tax File Number School Service is part of a new Student Education Program which is being establIshed to assist teachers of secondary and tertiary level students to educate their students about tax and associated issues. The introduction of the Tax File Number School Service will mean that students do' not have to obtain the usual proof of identity documents and forward them to the Tax Office. Instead, schools which choose to be involved in the Service will certify the identity of students applying for Tax File Numbers. The Service wiH make it easier for young people, particularly those in remote areas' without ready access to a Tax Office, to apply for a Tax File Number. . , The Service is entirely voluntary and this will be emphasised to schools, teachers,students and parents. (c) The Service was piloted in 68 Tasmanian secondary schools and then trialed in 23 Victorian schools. Payments to Tasmanian schools totl,llled $17,168.ln Victoria, payments to schools totalled $2,328. No other payments have been made to date as the service has only just been launched on a national basis. Veterans: Red Cards (Question No. 908) Mr Harry Woods asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 10 February 1994. (I) Is it a fact that veterans holding red cards must have served overseas in a war zone and white and yellow card holders may have been injured while on leave at home. (2) Are red card holders entitled to fewer pharmaceutical benefits' than yellow or white card holders; if so, why. (3) Is a yellow card holder entitled to specific pharmaceuticals for an affliction, such as bowel cancer, which was related neither to war service nor to the recipient's service in Australia; if so, why. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Government issues Personal Treatment Entitlement Cards (yellow cards) to: Australian World War I veterans, mariners and nurses; Australian female veterans of World War II who have qualifying service; Australian veterans who receive a Disability Pension at 100% of the general rate or higher; Australian 'ex-Prisoners Of War; , Australian age or invalidity Service Pensioners who receive a Disability Pension at 50% of the general rate or higher; - Australian age or invalidity Service pensioners who meet the treatment benefits eligibility test (under the income and assets test) and who also have either a .war or service related injury or disease, malignant neoplasia or pulmonary tuberculosis; Australian veterans who were in receipt of a Disability Pension for pulmonary tuberculosis before 2 November 1978; Australian veterans who receive an additional amount of pension for certain· war or service related injuries, ie. amputation of a limb and/or blindness; Australian age or invalidity Service Pensioners who are permanently blind in both eyes; and Australian war widow(er)s if sJhe is also a veteran and suffers from a war or service related injury or disease, malignant neoplasia or pulmonary tuberculosis Specific Treatment Entitlement Cards (white cards) are issued to veterans who have a war or service related injury or disease, malignant neoplasia or pulmonary tuberculosis, for treatment of their accepted disabilities only. Service Pensioner Benefits Cards (red cards) are issued to Australian veterans who: have no accepted waf or service related disabilities, and have qualifying service, and meet the' treatment benefits eligibility test under the income and assets test for service pension. It is possible that some white and yellow card holders may have disabilities accepted which were not incurred whilst serving overseas. (2) Red cards holders are entitled to pharmaceuticals under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), from which some 1,200 drug items are available. Yellow card holders are entitled to pharmaceuticals under the PBS plus those listed on the Schedule of Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits. White card holders are entitled to pharmaceuticals under the PBS plus those listed on the Schedule of Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits but only for the treatment. of their accepted disabilities. The Repatriation Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits consists of some 350 supplementary items selected by the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Reference Committee to meet the special drug treatment needS of veterans with war or service related disabilities. (3) Under the Veterans' EntitlementsAct 1986, PTEC (yellow) card holders are entitled to treatment of all injuries or diseases, whether war related or not. Australian veterans who have malignant neoplasia (cancer) are eligible to receive treatment for this condition, including pharmaceuticals, regardless of whether this condition is war rehlted or· not and regardless of which treatment entitlement card they hold. Red card holders who have cancer are issued with a PTEC card. Passenger Charter Flights .

153,Mr BRERETON,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under current charter guidelines, the Department does not assess passenger charter flight applications under test and develop or tourismoriented categories. However, the Department reviewed its approvals for 1993 and, had the charter flights been approved under the above categories, it estimates that 349 flights would have been test and development charters and 115 flights would have been tourism-oriented flights. (2) For each charter flight referred to in part (1), (a), the attached table shows (a) who operated the flight, (b) which carrier was used and (c) an estimate of how many passengers were carried- .It should be noted that charter operators are not required to submit details of whether or not approved flights actually operated or the numbers of passengers carried on each flight. However, where carriers have notified the Department of passengers carried, these have been included in the table. In all other cases, the number of passengers carried has . been estimated on the basis of 95% of the aircraft capacity in respect to tourism-oriented flights and 75% of the aircraft capacity in respect to .test and development flights. .

156,Mr BRERETON,TOURISM ORIENTED CATEGORY,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. In considering applications for charter programs one factor taken into account is the level of scheduled services already on the route or in prospect. No applications have been refused because of their possible impact on scheduled services. Labour Market Programs (Question No. 982),144
157,Mr COSTELLO,TOURISM ORIENTED CATEGORY,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 3 March 1994: (1) What is the agreed formula developed by his Department, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Finance for the net unit cost of assistance under his Department's labour market programs which are referred to in Table 4.2 at page 102 of the Committee on Employment Opportunities' discussion paper entitled Restoring Full Employment. (2) What are the relevant (a) costs, (b) savings and (c) other statistics used to arrive at the net unit cost of assistance for each specific labour market program in 1992-93. (3) Will he provide details of all work carried out by Dr Bruce Chapman for his Department since 1 January 1993, including (a) the subjects examined, (b) the findings and recommendations in each case and (c) the cost of each project including a breakdown of.expenses such as travel and travel allowance. Mr Crean- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Program NA Job Clubs SkillShare NA Special Intervention NA NA Self Employment Assistance (NElS) (3) (a) Dr Chapman was asked to prepare a discussion paper on long term unemployment, its causes, consequences and some possible policy responses to the issue. (b) The findings were published in a report in December 1993 (copies of which are available from (I) The net unit cost of each labour market program in Table 4.2 of the Committee's Report is arrived at by caIculatiJlg the average gross unit cost of assistance incurred by the Department of Employment Education and Training (DEET). This gross cost covers the cost of providing training courses, wage subsidies etc. as well as income support where the latter is funded from a DEET appropriation. The net unit cost is derived· by deducting from the gross unit cost the savings in Jobsearch and Newstart Allowances (JSA/NSA) accruing to the Department of Social Security (DSS) as a result of job seekers transferring from DSS benefits to a labour market program· which provides DEET funded income support.· The complex formula developed by DEET, DSS and the Department of Finance to calculate the net costs (or program costs less JSA/NSA offsetS) includes the following parameters: . duration of program assistance; proportion of participants on JSA/NSA; average JSA/NSA rates; probability that participants would move off JSA/NSA without assistance; possibility that participants may displace other jobseekers (ie net additional jobs created); and possibility that displaced jobseekers would become JSA recipients. The parameters used in these formulae are program specific and are derived from administrative, labour market and evaluation data. The parameters are updated each year. (2) The following table sets out details of gross unit costs, savings in DSS Allowances and net unit costs for the labour market programs in Table 4.2 of the Committee's Report.

A copy has been sent to the office of the honourable member. (c) The cost of this consultancy was $50,000. A further $6,000 was provided for elements of research which Dr Chapman subcontracted to other individuals. Defence Force: Right to Dismiss (Question No. 1004) Mr Harry Woods asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 22 March 1994: Did the Minister's predecessor propose in the answer to Senate question No. 1477 (Senate Hansard, 9 May 1990, page 175) that right to dismiss at pleasure from the Australian Defence Force co-exists with the statutory right to dismiss only for cause; if so, upon what authority did the Minister rely for that proposition.  member's question is as follows: Officers of the Australian Defence Force hold appointments at the pleasure of the Governor General under section 16(I) of the Defence Act 1910 in the case of Army officers, section 12(1) of the Naval Defence Act 1910 for Navy officers and Air Force Regulation 72(1) for Air Force officers. The holding of an appointment at pleasure also provides the power to the appointing authority to terminate that appointment. In all cases, the Acts and Regulations stipulate that an officer will dismissed without written notification of the reasons and without being given the opportunity to show cause why such action should not be taken.

Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourabfe member's question is as follows: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the Office of Indigenous Affairs, in the not be D-partment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, have provided the following information. (I) ATSIC has eleven Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander substantive SES· officers, of whom two are currently attached to other agencies. (2) The Aboriginal and Tortes Strait Islander Recruitment and Career Development Strategy seeks to increase the numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within ATSIC, the levels they are employed at and their skills. The Strategy has established several goals, including the following: . to increase numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in ATSIC; and to increase representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander officers in middle and senior management. The Strategy will work towards these goals with a range of programs-of recruitment, career development and staff support, based on those programs offered within the· Australian Public Service Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Career Development Strategy. (3) The objects of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 include the following: (a) to ensure maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait. Islanders in the formulation and implementation of government policies that affect them; (b) to promote the development of self-manageoutgoing ment and self-sufficiency among Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders; and (c) to further the economic, social and cultural development of Aboriginal persons and, Torres Strait Islanders: Under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989, it is a function of ATSIC to assist, advise and co-operate with Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander communities, organisations and individuals at National, State; Territory and Regional levels; (4) The Office of Indigenous Affairs (previously the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) is a Division within the· Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

The reappointment reflected desire for a period of continuity between the and incoming Board of Commissioners. The reappointment does not reflect on the capabilities of others who may seek to aspire to that office. It will be recalled that the Opposition moved . amendments to legislation in 1993, ensuring that the provision for the Minister to choose two Commissioners was retained. (6) In the period July 1991 to March 1994 the and following economic initiatives were funded: 60 Community Economic Initiatives Scheme Projects . 96 Business Funding Scheme Loans and 71 grants to 143 projects (7)(a) All current Community Economic Initiathe tives Scheme projects are economically viable in the short term but. it is too soon to report on long Indigenous Affairs term viability. 94 of the 96 Business Funding Scheme loans made to business projects are still in existence. As repayments are not required for grant only funded projects viability data is not maintained in the Commission's financial management information systems. These projects are monitored through financial returns and audit reports and visits by the Commission's project staff. (b) 59'of the 60 Community Economic Initiatives Scheme projects are still in existence. Of the 96 projects funded through Business Funding Scheme loans, 94 were operational as at 31 March 1994. (c) One Community Economic Initiatives Scheme project is currently inoperative but may be revived. Two Business Funding Scheme loan funded projects have been unsuccessful. (8) Community Economic Initiatives Scheme projects receive advice and support from a variety of sources, including: .

Business Funding Scheme projects receive advice and support from contracted Business Agents, specialist consultants, monitoring accountants, valuers, auditors, legal services and ATSIC staff as appropriate to the individual needs of the business a activity. Over the period I July 1991 t031 March 1994 the Business Funding Scheme has expended $6.7 million in the provision of support and advisory services to clients. (9) The ATSIC Board of Commissioners considered and approved the purchase of the AIcoota property and funding in theam<?lmt of $6 - iII-on at their September 1992 meeting (CommIssion Decision No. 802). The purchase included the pastoral lease, livestock, plant and equipment and working capital. Final funds expended totaIled $5,970,468. .

Unanswered Question on Notice (Question No. 1042)  the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 March 1994: When may I expect an answer to question No. 658 which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 22 November 1993. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that the response to question No. 658 was lodged with the House of Representatives Table Office on 13 April 1994. UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Question No. 1044) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Miriisterfor Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 24 March 1994: . (1) Will the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea enter into force on 16 November 1994. (2) Which states have (a) signed and (b) ratified the .Convention and on what dates. (3) Further to the answer to question No. 1706 (Hansard, 18 August 1992, page 108), what progress has been made in persuading the USA to support the Convention. Mr Bilney-':"" The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable rnember's question: (l) The Law of the Sea Convention provides for entry into force one year after the sixtieth ratification. On 16 November 1993 Guyana deposited its instrument of ratification of the Convention, bringing the number. of ratifications to sixty. The legal effect of the ratification by Guyana will be to bring the Convention into· force for the sixty ratifying nations on 16 November 1994. (2) I attach a list of states which have signed and ratified the Convention including the date of signature or ratification. (3) As confirmed in the answer to question No. 1706 (Hansard, 18 August 1992, page 108), Australia has been indirect and regular contact with the United States Government on law of the sea issues since 1981 when the House of Representatives conveyed its ,unanimous resolution on the LawJ,of the Sea. Convention to th- Unite.d States Government. ThIS contact has contmued smce that question was asked. Australia, the United States and other countries have continued their participation in informal consultations taking place under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General to explore the' concerns which industrialised countries, particuliuly the United States, have with the deep seabed mining provisions embodied in Part Xl of the Law of the Sea Convention. During the course of these consultations it has been acknowledged by all participants, whether from industrialised countries or developing countries, that global political and economic changes since the adoption of the Law of the Sea Conven-ion in 1982 had raised questions as to the appropriateness of certain aspects of Part XI. The major advance at the most recent consultations has been the development of a text which was put fOrward by key delegations including Australia, the United States and other developing and industrialised countries. The text contains a draft agreement which identifies all major questions at issue between industrialised and developing states and which would institute a number of significant revisions to Part XI to bring .it into· line with current needs. The text has attracted widespread support. At the most recent consultations, held from 4-8 April 1994, agreement was reached on the two major outstanding issues relating to Part XI, with all participating delegations generally accepting the resulting text. Negotiations were not, however, formally concluded because of a perception among developing countries that, as a matter of principle, those States which have not participated in the consultations should have the opportunity to study the text and express their views. The final round of the informal consultations will take place from 31 May-4 June 1994, with the first day set aside for NA Entry into force: 16 November 1994. Text: SD 30 Vol. I p. 1; ILM 21 p. 1261.

Significantly, all participating delegations have agreed that the agreement will be. adopted by a resolution at a resumed session of the General Assembly during the week of 25-29 July 1994. Although some uncertainties remain, the Australian Government considers that an agreement on implementing Part XI of the Law of the .Sea Convention is now within reach. This would enable Australia, as well as the United States and other industrialised countries,to give serious consideration to ratifying the Law of the Sea Convention, hence ensuring that it becomes the universally accepted law on the subject.

159,Mr CONNOLLY,UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION,"the Minister for Tourism, upon notice, on 24 March 1994: (1) How has the Forest Ecotourism Program been targeted. (2) What criteria were used to screen successful applicants. (3) Was an even methodology used in assessing each application. (4) Did he, or anyone on his behalf including departmental officials, direct other officers in his Department to identify ALP or Liberal marginal seats in anticipation of screening applications for grants from the program; if so, what grounds were used to justify the direction; if not, did more senior officers refuse to process the applications for his approval and if so, why. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Forest Ecotourism Program is targeted at ecotourism activities in forests as outlined in the Program's information booklet. (2) Applications were assessed against the Program's goals and objectives and other criteria outlined in the Program application form, a copy of which forms part of the Program's information booklet. (3) Yes. (4) No. Defence: Firefighting Pump Sets (Question No. 1058) Mr Halverson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 24 March 1994: (1) Was a negotiated contract to supply the Department of Defence (Army) with 72 diesel firefighting pump sets recently awarded to Hatz Australia. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether Hatz Australia (a) is solely an importer of diesel engines and (b) has no local facility to (i) test pumps to Australian Standard requirements, (ii) meet pump warranties or (iii) provide after sales service for pumps. (3) Did the tender documents for the contract specify that only the Darley HE500 pump manufactured in the USA could be supplied for the pump set. (4) Is the Minister able to say whether it is a fact that the Darley HE500 model pump is (a) not in general service in Australia and (b) considered unacceptable to and unsuitable by the majority of fire services and authorities in Australia on technical, economic, performance, reliability and servicing requirements grounds. (5) Is the Minister able to say whether W S Darley and Company is im accredited supplier of. pumps to the US Department of Defense orthe US Navy, Army or Air Force; if WS Darley and Company does not have US Department of Defense accreditation for the supply of pumps, why is the company considered suitable to supply pumps to the Australian Department of Defence. (6) What measures were taken during the tenderingprocess to (a) ensure Australian pump manufacturers could tender to supply the same or an equivalent pump to that specified by the Army'imd (b) ascertain whether any Australian pump manufacturers could supply to specification within the designated time-frame. (7) Is the restricted tender process a procurement option available to the Army; if so, (a) what criteria determine the necessity for a restricted tender and (b) how many times has the restricted tender option been exercised by the Army for procuring fire control equipment. (8) Was the contract referred to in part (1) (a) open to public tender or (b) awarded on the basis of the restricted tender process. (9) If the contract was awarded on the basis of the restricted tender process, what (a) particular considerations were taken into account and (b) reasons were given by the Army to justify the use of the process in this instance. (10) Did Army personnel provide oral assurances to other potential suppliers that public tenders would be called for the contract in early 1994. (11) Did any Australian pump manufacturer (a) contact the Army requesting discussion of the contract's requirements and (b) indicate to the Army that it could supply to specification before . the contract was awarded to Hatz Australia. (12) Does the Army specify that items it procures be Australian made wherever and whenever possible; if so, and the Army specified a foreign supplier, why did it do so. (13) Will pumps manufactured in Australia be considered for similar contracts in future.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) A contract to supply the Department of Defence (Army) with quantity 72 Hatz diesel engines and quantity 72 Darley HE500 piImpsets was awarded to Hatz on 22 December 1993. (2)(a) Hatz Australia solely imports diesel engines. (b) Hatz has a complete dynamometer testing facility to test engines and pumps to Australian Standards and has offered a two year warranty on the engine and pump, which it can meet, while providing after sales service. (3) The tender documents specified that only the Darley HE500 pumpset could be supplied to meet the contract. (4)(a) The Darley HE500 pumpset has been inservice with the Royal Australian Navy for four years. In addition it is understood the Darley pumpset has been in service with: the Country Fire Service the past 13 years; ACT Fire & Rescue Service for the past nine years; and various industrial fire services, including rigs and mining companies in Australia. (b) The Department of Defence is unaware of any Australian users of this pumpset who have had, or may have had any adverse technical, economic, performance, reliability or servicing reason for changing their source of pump. (5) Department of Defence Army is unable to comment on US Department of Defense use. However, the pump has been in service with the Royal Australian Navy for the past four years and has proven to be a suitable and reliable equipment. (6)(a) and (b) Prior to commencement of the tendering process an equipment survey was conducted by the Chief of the Army Fire Service of both 'off-the-shelf' pumpsets from Australian manufacturers and the in-service pumpsets used by the Royal Australian Navy and Australian state fire services. The survey concluded that: there was no acceptable Australian-manufactured pump capable of performing to the Army's specification; and the Darley HE500pump was the accepted inservice item which had been performing satisfactorily with the Royal Australian Navy and which met the Army's specification. In addition, an independent Fire Risk Consultant's report commissioned by the Director General of Accommodation and Works-Army in 1992 and subsequently endorsed by the Chief of the General Staff Advisory Committee in 1993 recommended the upgrade of the Army's firefighting equipment including all the pumpsets. The urgent safety nature of this equipment upgrade in combi nation with those equipment performance capabilities detailed in the specification determined that tenders would be restricted to the sole source supplier of the proven and compliant Hatz engine and Darley HE500 pumpset. (7)(a) The restricted tender process is a procurement option available to the Army. It was exercised in this case because of the urgent safety nature of this equipment upgrade in combination with those equipment performance capabilities detailed in the· specification. (b) There have been no other known recent restricted tenders by Army regarding fire control of South Australia for equipment. (8) The contract was awarded as a result of restricted tender action. (9)(a) The following criteria were taken into oil account when considering the replacement of the pumpset: The intended use of the pumpset and its specific performance requirements. The urgent safety nature of the upgrade. All known Australian manufactured pumpsets. All pumpsets currently in service with the various Australian state fire services. Pumpsets already in service in the Department of Defence. Other pumpsets commercially available within Australia. (b) The urgent safety nature of this equipment upgrade in combination with those equipment performance capabilities detailed in the specification and the limited availability of suitable equipment justified restricted tender action. (10) No Logistic Command-Army personnel involved in this project provided oral assurances to any potential suppliers that public tenders would be called for the contract in early 1994. (II) No Australian pump manufacturer contacted any Logistic Command-Army personne.\ involved in this project to discuss the contract requirements prior to the contract being awarded to Hatz. (12) The Army complies with the ideal of procuring through Australian industry where feasible and cost effective. However, in this case there was no suitable Australian-made pumpset. (I3) Australian-made pumpsets will be considered in any future procurement of firefighting equipment provided the equipment meets Defence specifications.",152
