0,NA,Unknown,"Bous e of Hcpresentatibes. Tuesday, 29 June, icog. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. LEAVE OF ABSENC E, Motion (by Mr DEAKIN ) agreed toThat leave of absence for two' months be given to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Chapman), and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Knox), on account of ill health; to the honourable member for Brisbane (Colonel Foxton), absent from the Commonwealth on public service; and to the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Watson), absent from the Commonwealth on urgent private business*. PAPER. Mr DEAKIN laid upon the table the following paper:South African Union-Repl y to cablegram of felicitation from Prime Minister. CADET EQUIPMENT .  graph appears in today's Argus:There is abundant evidence of the neglect to which the cadets have been subjected. In every company there are boys without belts, boys without bayonets, boys without rifles. In most companies there are some boys without any equipment at all , while 13 full companies marched past the saluting-base without Government equipment. All they had was their uniforms, and these they provided themselves. I wish to know from the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister of Defence, whether, as a result of the recent Conference, immediate action is likely to be taken to place all the boys serving as cadets on the same footing in regard to equipment?",14
1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Pendin g the determination of the motion of want of confidence, Ministers are not answering questions, but the circumstances to which the honourable member has called attention will receive my colleague's consideration.

Motion .(by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed- That the consideration of all other public business be postponed until after the consideration of Government business, Notice of Motion, number I .",15
2,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Wide Bay) [3.5] - 1 ment presume that the intention of the proposed posed of. postponement is to enable a motion for the introduction of the Supply Bill to be moved. A great deal of special pleading as well as this. has appeared in the press in regard to this matter, the attempt being made to cause the impression that injustice will be done if now ? the Supply Bill is not passed immediately. On a previous occasion, the Minister Defence protested against procedure of this kind as most unconstitutional, though afterwards agreed to what was done, on the ground of urgency. I suggest, howment. ever, that at the present time there is justification for asking for two months' Supply, including a vote of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 50 per cent, of the whole vote for the yeaT, for the Treasurer's advance account. I the Government recognised its position, and paragave to honourable members the consideration which is their due, it would ask merely for one month's Supply, and to such a request consideration would' be given. The other proposal is quite unreasonable. Of course, there are circumstances under which Supply must be granted at once, but at the present time it is being attempted to introduce a Supply Bill earlier than it is needed to meet the public necessity, if not the convenience of the Government.",15
3,Mr FRAZ ER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Kalgoorlie) [3.8] - The Prime Minister moved his motion in so low a tone that many of us who were listening attentively thought it to be one for the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable a Supply Bill to be taken through al l its stages at once. I understand now that it is for the postponement of business on the notice-paper, to enable such a motion to be moved. This procedure is most unusual, when a motion of want of confidence is under discussion. There seems to be no urgency for the granting of supply at the present time.",15
4,Mr TILLEY BROWN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,We must pay our creditors.,15
5,Mr FRAZER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Were the honourable member acquainted with financial administration, he would know that, until the end of the present month, the needs of the Government can be met by the Appropriation Acts of last session. We have it on the authority of the ex-Treasurer that no Commonwealth liabilities for which provision has not already been made will f all due until at least the 6th of next, month, by which time it may be expected that the motion challenging the right of the Governto continue in office will have been dis",15
6,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Supply Bill"" will have to pass through the other House",15
7,Mr FRAZER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Why does not the Treasurer give the reason for asking for Supply,15
8,Mr TILLEY BROWN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The honourable of member will not let him.,15
9,Mr FRAZER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"H a d I not risen, I behe lieve that consent would by now have been given to the course proposed by the GovernThose who are responsible for adno ministering the Departments owe it to the House to state the reasons for their extra0 , or ordinary attitude in seeking Supply when their very existence is questioned by a direct f vote. Unless a. satisfactory explanation of the urgency in connection with this case is forthcoming, it will 'be the duty of honourable members to refuse to the Government, in the almost silent request that has been presented by them, the consideration that they desire. There are in the Supply Bill which it is proposed to introduce features which demand an explanation from the Government, particularly with regard to the large amount asked for towards the Treasurer's Advance.",15
10,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Hear , hear; toomuch of that.",16
11,Mr FRAZER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Honourable members opposite may smile at the remark of the honourable member for Hume, but who can speak with greater authority on the subject ? Who can better warn the House of the dangers of giving the Treasurer this unconditional amount?",16
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Especiall y the present Treasurer.,16
13,Mr FRAZER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The present Treasurer on one occasion put the historic question, "" What is a million?"" He may, if he is lucky enough to get this Treasurer's Ad vance in the exceptional manner suggested, ask, *' What is a hundred thousand pounds ?"" It is due to the House that the Treasurer should make an explanation before the Government persist with their request. The Prime Minister gives me an assurance that the Treasurer will explain, and, as that is so, I am prepared to listen to the right honourable member's justification and express an opinion on it afterwards. Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [3.13] - An explanation is, of course, necessary, and would have been given had I thought that the proper opportunity to give it would arise before we moved for the .suspension of the Standing Orders. ever, I am quite as willing to give all the information of which I am possessed at this stage as at any other time.",16
14,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The only matter with which the Treasurer or any - other honourably member can deal at this stage is the question of the urgency or otherwise of the proposed Supply. It will not be in order now to go into the details of the Bill .,16
15,Sir JOHNFORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"It seems, then, that I was not so far wrong. easy to give the reasons for urgency without going into the mode of expenditure of the money. The principal reason is well known. When we reach the end of the financial year fresh Supply is necessary The Treasurer is not legally possessed of any money after tomorrow, and I should) have thought it would be patent to honourable members, coming as. they do from a l t parts of Australia, that in the variousStates works are proceeding that will require to be paid for. One very important consideration is that no money is provided, for any of the new works and services that are going on all over Australia. It has been-, the custom in ""the past to pay out of the Treasurer's Advance alt accounts that come in for payment before the Budget is introduced and before the House has passed an> Act of Appropriation for New Works and' Buildings. That is one of the reason's why we want Supply.",16
16,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Why do the Governmentwant it today ?,16
17,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Because the question has to be dealt with, not only by this House, but by the Senate, to which duecourtesy must' be shown. If the Government had delayed the introduction of the Bill until the last moment they would have been blamed. We have brought it inearly so that honourable members can deal with it without being unduly hurried. We have no desire to rush things through. Thereasons for the introduction of the measureare that it is customary to get Supply before the end of the year, or certainly immediately after it , and that in the caseswhere that has not been done it has beenbecause of some extraordinary reason existing why it should not be done, or becauseParliament has not been in session. The Government would be greatly toblame if they went on authorizing expenditure alii over the continent without Parliament having voted the money to meet it.",16
18,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The present Govern- ment authorized the expenditure of How- £[2,000,000 without asking the House tovote it.",16
19,Sir JOHNFORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I am not talking about that matter. The honourable member cannot keep his tongue to himself for a minute. Apparently he must havehis say, whether he is right or wrong. There is nothing unusual in the Bill . It has been, customary ever since we have been a Parliament, when we have been in session at the beginning of the financial year, to in-It is not troduce a similar measure.",16
20,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"West Sydney) [3.17]-The Government have taken a most unusual' step in interrupting the debate on a motion of want of confidence. They give as thereason for their action the fact that they are actuated by an overmastering desire to go. on with the business of the country. My opinion is unchanged, and I am confident that the Government have an overwhelming desire to do nothing but to remain where they are. This Bill which the Treasurer says is not unusual is, on the face of it , most unusual. Why do the Government want Supply for two months in the first place ?",16
21,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,That is question before the House.,17
22,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I can quite understand the peculiar position in which the right honourable member is placed in being asked to inform the House why Supply is wanted. If there is any person in this country who is less capable of affording the House that information, I should like to see or know of him. Personally, I do not believe there is such a person. Sir JOH N F'ORREST - The honourable member's stock-in-trade is personality.",17
23,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I am not indulging in personalities. Of course, the truth is sometimes not at all agreeable, but I have never heard it stated by any moralist or dabbler in ethics that the truth was to be dammed back because it happened to bump up against somebody's personality. The honourable member's gamut in politics, so far as we have seen him run it in this House, has gone so far that when the Watson Ministry approached the House some four years ago he proposed to cut its existence short the same afternoon.",17
24,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Will the honourable member kindly discuss the question before the Chair?,17
25,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The right honourable member's interruption naturally threw me off my somewhat delicate poise. We are now discussing whether the Government have a right to live or not. We say they have not the confidence of the House or the country. Yet the right honourable member for Swan, apparently repeating what he has been told by the Prime Minister, asserts in the calmest way that Supply must be granted, or the country will go to the dogs. The country would be ail right if honourable members on the Ministerial side would only do what is decent and proper. I shall not agree at .'this stage to allow the business of the House to be interrupted. I am aware that Supply must be granted at a later stage, and, when the House has voted on the question of whether the Ministry has or has not its confidence, I shall be quite prepared not to offer any factious opposition to the grant of Supply, but [17] to discuss the motion with the' amount of criticism that the circumstances warrant. With the leader of the Opposition, I am nf opinion that there is no necessity for Supply for more than one month, though personally I should not feel inclined to give the Government even that. The propercourse is to proceed with the motion of want of confidence; and then, if the Gonot the vernment show that they have the confidence of the House, they can proceed with other measures.",17
26,Mr FOWL ER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Perth) [3.20] - I trust that the House will proceed to this business, and get through it at the earliest possible moment. We are perfectly aware that there are public works which stand in danger of being hung up indefinitely if the necessary money is not voted; and I know of one case myself in which a number of working men will, in al l probability, be thrown out of employment if we do not proceed with the measure laid before us by the Government. I , for one, would .point out that even before the importance of the debate carried on hopelessly, and without definite object, as shown by the mimbers already indicated in the House, the measure submitted is one which ought to be carried through; then honourable members, who desire to speak on the motion of want of confidence-thoug h it appears to be to me more or less purposeless-ma y do so afterwards.",17
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Hume) [3-2-0-I am a little amused at the proposals submitted by the Government; and I cannot help calling to mind the attitude assumed on a former occasion, and more particularly by the present Minister of Defence, when, in a case of much greater necessity, I , as Treasurer, asked for Supply.",17
28,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,When was that?,17
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Las t year, or the year before, though I cannot give the exact date - I realise that payments undertaken by the Government must be made, though I also realise that at the present moment we cannot discuss the amount asked for, or the time over which Supply is to extend. My own opinion is that it would have been well to clearthe motion of want of confidence out of the way before asking for Supply. We have not had a single hint as to how this, money is to be provided; and, knowing as much as I do of the difficulties of the Treasurer, we ought to be given some idea as to how the Government propose to provide for the £ 8 8 3 , 0 0 0 .",17
30,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I have already ruled that the only matter open to debate is the question of urgency of Supply; the amount of Supply, or the time over which it exLends, must be discussed at a later stage.",18
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Once the motion before the House is carried, a Supply Bill must be introduced; and I have no doubt, in view of the peculiar constitution of this confused House, the proposal of the Ministry will be carried. At the same time, I may be permitted to say, generally, that the course proposed by the Government is an extreme one, unless money is urgently required. The only ground for such action is urgency; and the question we have to decide is whether the money is really required before the first or second week in next month. As to trusting the Government, I would not trust them with the care of a rabbit; at the same time, I do not wish to stand here to object seriously to the proposal of the Government, though, when I was Treasurer, the present Minister of Defence carped at what I did, and called me all sorts of nasty names. The Government say that they must have money ; and the question of how much they are to have or how long a period Supply should extend over, will come up for discussion after we have decided the matter of the suspension of the Standing Orders. I suggest that it is not wise to take a vote on the motion before us; I have known the pinch as Treasurer. The only question, as I have already indicated, is whether this is the right time for the motion-whethe r we should not wait until next week. I wish to place on record that it is most unusual, in view of the fact that Supply is not required for ten days or a fortnight, to move for the suspension of the Standing Orders. Honourable members may say that the motion of want of confidence represents a hopeless fight; but I cannot agree with the honourable member for Perth in turning on his own party as he did just now.",18
32,Mr ROBERTS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The first bid for the Conservative vote !,18
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Probably . The Opposition have their duties, just as have the Government, especially in connection with motions for the suspension of the Bill . Standing Orders. They are entitled to take any course they please, and, having gard to the peculiar circumstances with which we are confronted, there is a special reason why they should be very careful to the Bill now. see that there is no topsy-turvy business so far as monev matters are concerned. would suggest, however, that the motion be allowed to pass, so that the Supply Bill may be introduced. We shall then have an opportunity, in discussing the items, to deal with many matters that cannot be referred to during the debate on this motion.",18
34,Mr MCDONA LD,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Kennedy) [3-3-t]-I wish to offer to the honourable member for Perth-wh o is not in his place, and, I suppose, will be away, as usual, for the rest' of the day-m y congratulations on his first bid for the Conservative vote. Doubtless, in the Argus and Age tomorrow he will get the nice little pat on the back for which, no doubt, he was looking when he spoke. I object, however, to any honourable member dictating to me what course I should take. I object to dictation even on the part of the honourable member for Perth, although at one time he may have belonged to the party of which I am. a member.",18
35,Mr ROBERTS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,And would still have belonged to it had he been selected as a member of the Labour Ministry.,18
36,Mr MCDONALD,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Probably he would. We are asked to take an unusual course, and I hope that the House will not agree too readilv to set up a. bad precedent. I have always objected, both in State and in Federal politics, to motions for the suspension of the Standing Orders, so that a Supply Bill may be hurriedly passed. Such a procedure does not conduce to the proper conduct of business. The Treasurer has shown that the only reason he has for asking us to agree to this motion is that he wishes the Bill to reach the Senate tomorrow.",18
37,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The Senate desires to adjourn for a week.,18
38,Mr MCDONALD,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The business of this House should not be conducted with a regard solely to the interests and desires of another place.,18
39,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I did not know that members of another place desired an adjournment.,18
40,Mr MCDONALD,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I do not think that the right honourable member did.,18
41,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I thought that they might wish to have some time to discuss the,18
42,Mr MCDONALD,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,And we may desire reto take some time in discussing it.,18
43,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,That is an additional reason why we should proceed with,18
44,Mr MCDONALD,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Surely the TreaI surer does not think that we should do certain things merely because, in his opinion, the Bill should be sent to another place a clay earlier than would otherwise be the case. The honourable gentleman has taken up an extraordinary attitude, and I hope that in future our debates will not be curtailed at the dictation of another place. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Sir JOHN FORREST) proposed - That the Standing Orders be suspended in order to enable the Committees of Supply, and Ways and Means to be appointed before the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor General's Opening Speech has been agreed to by the House, and to enable all other steps to be taken to obtain Supply, and to pass a Supply Bill through all its stages without delay.",18
45,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Wide Bay) [3.35] - This motion is obviously necessary if the Bill is to be dealt with expeditiously. I should like to say in reply to the honourable member for Perth that it is absolutely incorrect to say that if the course proposed by the Government is not adopted, working men will be kept out of their money. Wages are paid fortnightly, and the first payment under this measure will not be due until the middle of next month.",19
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Does the honourable two months. member say that is so in regard labour; some demands, I am told, will be due within a week ?",19
47,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"No . There are no wages, demands under a fortnight.",19
48,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Yes . - Mr FISHER - There may be casual day-today payments falling due, but amounting to not more than petty cash expenditure. The statement that day wages men will be thrown out of work because of our failure to pass a motion of this kind is altogether too mean and paltry to be discussed in a national Parliament. The last occasion on which we were asked to pass a Bill of this kind was. on the 3rd or 4th July last, and the present Minister of Home Affairs then made a speech, extending over five pages of Hansard, in which he pointed out that the proposed procedure was altogether wrong. Why attempt to bolster up a wholly untenable position by the paltry statement that unless we agree to the Government proposal workmen will be deprived of their wages. Undoubtedly the public responsibilities ought to be met, but there is no justification for the request for two months' Supply. This is the only occasion when under like circumstances two months' ! > 7 j -2 Supply has been asked for. In all other cases there has been a demand for only one month's Supply. The Prime Minister proposes now to double the Supply asked for, just as he has doubled the number of Honorary Ministers.",19
49,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I am told that as much as three months' Supply has been obtained.,19
50,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"That was to enable Parliament to remain out of session for a certain period, in order to pay an international courtesy to the visiting American Fleet. Surely it is not pretended that the circumstances today are the same.",19
51,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,No ; we are not asking for three months' Supply.,19
52,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"On the 3rd July last, we agreed to one month's Supply.",19
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Parliamen t met the day before.,19
54,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"And we were then asked to grant only one month's Supply. Another occasion was the 28th June, 1906. These are the only occasions upon which Supply has been asked for before the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, and then the grant of it has been limited to one month'. The Government are certainly not justified in now asking for Supply for Provision for one month's to day Supply would be sufficient. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motions (by Sir JOHN FORREST) agreed toThat the House will this day resolve itself into a Committee to consider the Supply to be granted to His Majesty. That the House will this day resolve itself into a Committee lo consider the Ways and Means for raising the Supply to be granted to His Majesty. Motion (by Sir JOHN FORREST) proposed - That Mr Speaker do now leave the Chair, and the House resolve itself into a Committee of Supply'.",19
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Hume) [3.41] If this motion be agreed to I desire to know whether it will be possible under our Standing Orders for honourable members to indulge in a general debate upon the items covered by the Supply? I think that at this stage it is possible to engage in such a debate, but, if not, I should like to be informed of the real position.",19
56,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The motion now before the Chair is, ""That Mr Speaker do now leave the Chair and the House resolve itself into a Committee of Supply,"" for the purpose of dealing with the whole matter. In Committee it will be competent for honourable members to discuss, not merely the length of time for which Supply should be granted, but every other detail.",19
57,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Wide Bay) [3.4a] - I desire to ask the Treasurer when he intends to deliver his Budget?,20
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Toward s the end of August, I think. """,20
59,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I was under the impression that it would be delivered much earlier. [ do not know of any difficulties in the way of the Treasurer making his Budget statement before the end of July. Sif JOHN FORREST - We have only ju->t received the Estimates. I have not seen them yet.,20
60,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Prime Minister stated again and again in the country that the present session was to That being so, we ought not to allow three months to elapse before we know the financial proposals of the Government. honourable members to be called upon to sacrifice two valuable months, after the Ministry have had one month in which to consider the financial position, is altogether out of keeping with my ideas of responsible government.",20
61,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,We have not yet considered the Estimates.,20
62,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"When the late Government left office, the preparation of the Estimates was as complete as it has ever been before at that period of the year.",20
63,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Perhaps that may not be saying much.,20
64,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I venture to say that no Treasurer ever left the Estimates in a better position than I did. I challenge the right honourable member to say anything derogatory to the way in which the Treasury was administered by the late Government. Any insinuations of that kind will be met,20
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I do not want to say anything nasty.,20
66,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Any insinuations of the character referred to are unworthy of the Treasurer. The employment of such methods may answer very well under other circumstances-it may answer in the press or on the public platform; but it will not serve any useful purpose here. The right honourable member must make good any insinuations of that kind. When the late Government quitted office, the preparation of the Estimates was. as forward as any man could make it at the time. The statement that it will be the end of August before the Budget is delivered",20
67,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Toward s the end of thatmonth.,20
68,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The statement that the Budget will not be delivered until towards the end of August is a declaration that the Government are not readv with any financial proposals whatever. It is an intimation to this House and the country that they have no policy at all, because upon more than one occasion the Prime Minister clearly stated that he considered this Parliament should have been convened earlier, in order that it might deal with the vast financial problems that await our attention. But now that it has met somewhat later than he desired, we find that the delivery of the Budget is to be deferred for a period of three months.",20
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,What is before the be a financial one. House now? ,20
70,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The broadest question For that can be discussed. Is that the Treasurer's trouble? The trouble is that our Standing Orders permit us to discuss the absolute incapacity of the Government to frame a financial policy until three months have elapsed from their assumption of office. The members of the Government are not new to Ministerial office. Of course, I recognise that we shall have ample opportunity to discuss these questions at a later stage. I repeat that the intimation of the Treasurer that he will not be able to make his Budget statement until towards the end of August amounts to a declaration to members of this House, and to the country, that the Government have no financial policv whatever, and are merely waiting the drift of events to enable them to overcome the troubles which face them. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [3-4?]-The present seems rather a fitting opportunity for me to make one or two observations regarding the statement of the Treasurer as to the time when he will be in a position to deliver his Budget - It will be recollected that the right honourable gentleman left the office of Treasurer in the last Deakin Administration rather suddenly, and I say that he left the finances in a worse state than they have been since the establishment of the Commonwealth. Upon his retirement I was practically forced - owin g to the kindly feelings which I had entertained towards the Prime Minister, who was ill at the time-to take control of the Treasury. I did so, and I think that I made mv Budget statement within a fortnight or three weeks thereafter.",20
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The Estimates were - nearly all ready when the honourable member took the office of Treasurer.,21
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Nothin g was - ready. A commencement had scarcely been made in the preparation of the Estimates. Indeed, the only work! which had been done - related to a reduction of the Estimates by ^£70,000 or .£100,000, which the right honourable member had ordered without consulting his officers. It was attempted subsequently to fasten on to my shoulders the blame attaching to his action. That he ordered the reduction was evidenced in - dccuments which I afterwards submitted ro the House-document s to which his initials were attached. For the right honourable member to say that he cannot make a Budget statement for three months after the meeting of Parliament is absurd. It is a token of incapacity and of want of knowledge of the Department over which he has been presiding for a considerable time. When I assumed control of the Treasury, the officers of that Department probably thought that I was a slave-driver, but I told then: that the work had to be done because Parliament wanted the Budget within a very short time. The Under Secretary informed me that more than 100 men would be required to do the work within the period that I indicated. My reply was, "" Get as many men as are needed, but the work must be done.""",21
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I think that the honourable member delivered his Budget the 8th August of that year.,21
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"At any rate, had assumed the office of Treasurer about a fortnight previously. Yet I made a Budget statement as complete as any has yet been delivered in this House. The only complaint urged against it was that I read it. But I didoso because I wanted to be in a position to give the House curate information, and I say that if Treasurer attempts to deal with the mass having done that. of figures that are incidental to a Budget by relying upon his memory, he will make a mess of his task, just as the right honourable orable member for Swan did on two or three occasions. I did not attempt anyinitials, thing of the kind. I hacl the figures typed, and, as a result, the House obtained correct information. I notice that my example recently been followed by a very good in the House of Commons-I refer to Mr. Lloyd George. The best way in which to surer has referred to. deliver a statement which contains so many figures as does a Budget is to read it .",21
75,Mr BATCHELOR,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The Prime Minister followed the honourable member's example the other day.,21
76,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"But his statement did not contain figures. It related only to a placard. We should have forgotten most of the placard if the Prime Minister had not read it. I find from the volume of Hansard which has now been placed in my hands, that I delivered my Budget Speech on the 8th August. At that time. I had been a very short while in the Treasury, and practically there was no material to help me.",21
77,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,If there had been no material there I will guarantee that the honourable member could not have done it .,21
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Treasurer seeks to cast a reflection upon me. I have no wish to take any credit that is due to the officers of the Treasury. I acknowledge that they assisted me. I checked the material which they placed before me. But they received my policy from me, and worked it out. Any Treasurer who thinks that he can work out figures Without the assistance of his officers is mistaken. No human being can do work of this kind unless he is a skilled accountant. But I repeat that I had not been more than three weeks in the Treasury when I delivered my Budget statement; and „ I also state most definitely that there was practically nothing ready when I became Treasurer. In fact I had to undo a great deal that the on present Treasurer had prepared-if one can call it preparation. One thing that I I had to do I felt very sore about at the only time, because there was cast upon my shoulders the blame which arose from the that right honourable member who preceded me at the Treasury having unwarrantably cut off ,£70,000 from the Estimates. I am not sure as to whether there was not another sum acof .£35,000, or whether the amount was any .£70,000 on the whole. I was blamed for",21
79,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Did I sav that?,21
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The right honmember said it more than once; and when I produced documents bearing his he refused to acknowledge them. But they are in the Treasury now, and any one who has ever seen his initials will has know them again. This Hpuse ought to man have a statement of the finances of the Commonwealth' inside the time the TreaA t present this House has no idea as to what the intention of the Government is in regard to finding the money that is required for the Post and Telegraph Department. While I am on that point I will take the opportunity of saying that a great deal of the trouble that was caused financially affecting the Post and Telegraph Department, when I became responsible, arose out of the promises which the previous Treasurer had so lavishly made. A great many contracts had been, entered into, and many promises had been made. I had to find the money for these purposes, and that was one of the things that caused the great trouble that I had in connection with the Post Office.",21
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Who made the promises ?,22
82,Sir WILLTAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The right honourable member made them.,22
83,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,What were they ?,22
84,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,This is not a matter to be the subject of chaff or to be laughed over.,22
85,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I was not Postmaster-General.,22
86,Mr BATCHELOR,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,We have looked up the dates and find that the honourable member for Hume had been Treasurer only eight days when he made his Budget Speech.,22
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I am glad to be reminded of the actual dates. I prepared my statement after having been only eight days at the Treasury. Now what has the Treasurer to say? The position was an extraordinary one, because. I re-peat, the previous Treasurer had let matters drift, drift, drift; and, after he had allowed things to get into that position, he turned round ancl sold his chief, had been ill . That is what orable member did.",22
88,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I ask the honourable member for Hume to withdraw the remark about the right honourable member for Swan having "" sold his chief.""",22
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I do not think, sir, that the Treasurer took any notice until you drew attention to it. He has been told this so often. But still, Mr Speaker, will withdraw the remark. I will put the matter in another way, and will say that he remained in office until the Prime Minister became very ill ; and, in the midst of that illness, the right honourable gentleman, after correspondence, resigned office. At that time, I say again, delav. he had done practically nothing toIhe wards preparing the financial statement, which, indeed, should have been made behas fore he left office. It was intended to have been made earlier, ancl would have teen except for something that occurred. I waspressed to take the Treasurership. I did' not wish to do so. I did not desire to' leave the Department of Trade and Customs. I suggested to the Prime Minister the name of another gentleman, but he said to me, "" No ; you have been Treasurer before, and you will have to take the position."" Accordingly, I took it, and 1 Hansard shows that I was only in office eight days when I made my Financial Statement. I had to put great pressure upon my Department in order to do it. I made the officers work up to the full extent of their power. I was told by Mr Allen, the Secretary of the Treasury, who is one of the best officers, and one of the most loyal men I ever had to deal with, that what I desired to do was not possible. But I replied, ""The Prime Minister wants this Financial Statement made as soon as possible. The House also wants it to be made early. If you have not sufficient men in the Treasury to do the work in the""time-,. get more."" After [ had delivered the Budget the Secretary of the Treasury told me that such a thing had never been attempted before in connection with the Commonwealth Treasury since it had been established, and he also said that he did not think that such a thing had been done in any of the States. It is, I think, creditable to Mr Allen, to Mr Collins, and to the whole of the staff of the Treasury that the work was done in the time; and mv Budget was, I believe, the most completestatement and the most readable one who Sir JOHN FORREST - The honourable the right honmember read it all.",22
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"And I am not ashamed of that. It is recorded in Hansard, and it will compare favourably with any other Budget statement since the Commonwealth was inaugurated.",22
91,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Mr Allen prepared of it it, and the honourable member read it.",22
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Mr Allen and I myself prepared it. I never said that I prepared it entirely myself. If any Treasurer wants to make a jackass of himself, let him try to prepare a Budget without the assistance of experts. Of course, I used the officers who were at my command. I checked their figures. But there was no It is ridiculous, it is absurd, for Treasurer to say' that he cannot prepare his Budget statement in less time than he mentioned-that is to say, if he knows what he is going to do, and if the Government know what their policy is. At the present time we do not know, as a House, and as a Parliament-the country does not know-whethe r we are going to have a lot of borrowed money for Commonwealth purposes. This is one of the principal things - that we want to know. I hold that, except under very extraordinary circumstances indeed, there should be no borrowing policy. I will stand here as long as I am able to stop the commencement of a borrowing policy.",22
93,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The honourable member has borrowed a great deal of monev in his time, I think.",23
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I never borbut rowed while I was at the Commonwealth this Treasury, and I never borrowed much as-a State Treasurer, except for the purpose resuming properties in New South Wales that never ought to haveTaeen sold. I hold - that if we commence borrowing it will lo extravagance. We shall have plenty money for the purpose of carrying out their everything that we want to carry out, if the Free Trade half of the Government do not force the Treasurer to give too much back to the States. That is the true position. We used only one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue in the past.",23

98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Probably less vinced now. If an arrangement made, or that i was intended to make, when I was with the Prime Minister were carried out, we should have in 1910 plenty of money at our disagainst posal, and no borrowing would be necessary. The position is a very serious one. When I was at the Treasury a proposal was made t.) borrow money on short-dated bills for Post and Telegraph purposes. I objected Cabinet matter? to it, and what was proposed was not done. I said that even if it were found necessary to finance affairs up to the time when we could claim our own in 1910, we could do it easily without entering upon a system borrowing.",23

100,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"There was no hope necessity for that either. Our revenue last year amounted to about £15,000,000, and without the Post Office revenue to about ,£ii,,6oo,ooo. Will any one tell me, although we were entitled to use only one-fourth of that, that that was not sufficient to carry us on up to the time. I have mentioned? It is all very well to say that we must return something to the States to keep them going. I admit that we have to consider the States.",23
101,Mr BATCHELOR,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,But we have to pay our way first.,23
102,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I also say that we have to pay our own way, and I say very emphatically that the State Governments must not be extravagant at our expense. State extravagance has taken place in the past. I have said no more than that, I will say further now, while I am on topic, that if that extravagance is to be continued, unquestionably we ought to see of that Commonwealth revenue is not used to encourage it . The only way by which we can bring about harmony in the lead financial relations between the Commonof wealth and State Governments, is to keep finances absolutely separate. It can be clone in no other way, and it cannot be done by postponing a real settlement of the question for five, ten, fifteen, or twenty years.",23
103,Mr BATCHELOR,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Was not that the policy of the Prime Minister up to the present time?,23
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"It was his a policy, and one which he urged very strongly, whilst I was a member of his Ministry in charge of the Treasury. In fact, the honourable gentleman went a great deal further than I did in this direction. He conme that this is absolutely the correct t policy to pursue. I attended with him the Premiers' Conference in Melbourne, and advocated that policy, as he did. He was even postponing for five years the payment of the £2,000,00 0 odd of interest out of the £ 8 , 000,00 0 odd. He desired that the surplus should be deducted every year.",23
105,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Is this another,23
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"No . It was spoken of publicly before the Premiers. I contend that the coalition has brought about such a position of affairs that everything of ought to be made public, and everything should be^done which may be necessary to a repetition of what has taken place. I feel that it is time that we knew, and I the Opposition will insist upon getting the information, what is to be the policy of the Government for the raising of money. To borrow is an easy and an extravagant way of raising money, but it must be remembered that borrowed money has to be repaid. l f there is one thing that Governments of which I have been a memnot get. ber since the establishment of Federation have a right to be proud of, it is that they Estimates. did not commence to borrow money. I know that* the electors are proud of that. clock?

The ex-Prime Minister and was Treasurer in the Government which led, and he had an opportunity, which had not, to prevent other Departments curring expenditure which there was no with that clock. money in the Treasury to meet. that my suggestion in this regard will taken into serious consideration. Sir George 1 Turner, when in the Victorian Parliament, was Premier and Treasurer of the State, and he was thus enabled by dictating Government"" Departments, to bring down and keep down expenditure in Victoria. He could not have done that if he had Treasurer amd not at the same time Premier. If the Treasurer of the Commontower wealth is not also Prime Minister, he may be told, as I was told by Ministers, and by one in particular, ""You have to find the money which I think should be approknown. priated, and you have nothing to do with the appropriation.""",23

What was done then was that members of this House were invited to attack the Treasurer because he would not find the money for certain purposes. Honourable members, like the roads and bridges member I see on the Other side, complained that they could not get public works carried out in their electorates cause the Treasurer would not find money.",24

120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The owner of goa voice I have heard behind me.,24
121,Mr TUDOR,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The honourable member for Laanecoorie. re Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I did not menbeen tion the name. The honourable member this got more, perhaps, than he had a right me. to get. I was contending that the Prime I Minister should also be Treasurer of the not Commonwealth, because there is no doubt that the Treasurer is at a serious disadvantage if he is not also Prime Ministei. I had, when in charge of the Treasury, to cut and carve in every possible way to save money in the Advance Account to meet the demands of a great many officers for exiDenditure which should not have been beincurred. But the practice has been to the commence a certain work, which must afterwards be proceeded with, and the is then drawn upon to find the necessary money, eren though it must be provided from a source which should not be called upon for such expenditure. A system has been initiated of robbing Peter to pay Paul. I stopped it as far as I - could. Money voted for one purpose has been spent for another, and I hold that that is not a proper thing to do. The practice used to be followed in Sydney under a roads and bridges schedule, and I stopped it there. I do urge that if the Government propose to raisemoney by loan, the fact should be made public now. I - do not wish to deal with small amounts, but with large sums involved in carrying out important matters of policy which the Government have to face. A few minutes ago I was going to say - that, in regard to - old-age pensions, about which so much was said in this Chamber the last time. I brought in a Supply Bill and a Budget .statement, the late Prime Minister knows that I intended to use the money set .aside out of the Surplus Revenue Fund, .and then to finance six months of the time, until we got control of the Commonwealth revenue in 1910. 'That is all known. If it could be done - then, it can be done now; but it cannot be done if the Government is going to put off - dealing with the financial relations between .the Commonwealth and the States for five years longer.' The States have had .greater consideration, and received' larger .sums of money, than they could ever have expected to get, in consequence of the large .revenue we have derived from Customs and Excise. If we put off the consideration of - this question any longer, and the Government is going in for a borrowing policy, then all the good which has been done by .preventing an appeal to the London or Australian markets will be destroyed, for the people at present believe we can be trusted to deal with the finances. It will be a good thing for the Opposition, and those who act with me, but a very dreadful thing for the Government, if they start that game. We ought to know before August what is intended to be done, and that is a point I press home at the present moment. I did not mean to speak at this length today, 'because I had intended to speak to the other motion on the notice-paper, when I should have dealt with some of these questions. But this particular question is so important and urgent that the House ought to take action immediately, unless it can get some satisfaction. The people of this country will back us up by taking the most - extreme action in regard to a question of this sort, which is bound up with the prosperity of the Commonwealth and of every individual in the community, especially, with thefinancesslacking, as they are now, to some extent. If we are not made acquainted with the intention of the Government, and do not press by all means this question, it will be our own fault, and we shall be blamed. If we are defeated, all that we can do will be to appeal to the electors at the earliest possible moment. But do not let us make a mistake about the urgency of this question. , It is one of the strongest points on which any party can go to the country. I think that there is no question so strong as that of stopping the lavish borrowing to which the States have resorted. We should not defer for one moment the settlement of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth. The proposal which was made on a. previous occasion was taken, some of it from the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, some of it from the proposals of others, and a little of it from the statements of Sir George Turner, and some of it originated with myself. I am never desirous of taking credit from any one to whom it is due. I admit freely that the basis of the altered scheme came from the honourable member for Mernda. That was worked out with the great assistance which was given to the Treasury officials and myself by the Prime Minister when he was Minister of External Affairs. His anxiety was never so distinctly shown to me as it was then to clear up the accounts of the States at once. He will find all he said on the subject - in minutes in connection with the Department of External Affairs, and in the report of the Premiers' Conference. That was one of the strongest points which he pressed upon me as Treasurer, and in connection with the matter he told me many things which I shall not repeat now. When the trouble arose with the honourable member for Swan, he attacked me because I did not do what he proposed to do when he was at the Brisbane Conference. There he showed his hand, and disclosed that he was more a State Minister than a Federal Minister.",24
122,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,He always was.,25
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,He showed it there.,25
124,Mr MAHON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,And he is still.,25
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Prime Minister did not authorize the honourable member for Swan to say all that he did say at Brisbane, as I told him before in this Chamber. When I went as second to the Prime Minister to meet the Premiers in Conference at Melbourne, he commanded my admiration for the way in which he handled them, and the strong points that he brought out in urging that there should be no delay in settling this question. I have been very much amazed to read in the press rumours and statements that it is to be deferred for five years for breathing time, and then Heaven knows how much longer it will be deferred before it is actually taken in hand. I repeat that the end of 1910 will be the time to deal with the question. We should not follow the system of drift, and continue the fight, which must be continued if we do not lay down a certain rule as to what we shall do with the revenue from Customs and Excise. We shall have a constant bickering so long as the finances of the Commonwealth ancl the States are not divided in a proper way. I hope that the few words I have uttered today will cause honourable members and the public to think as to the very serious position of the finances. Let us have no medley of borrowing money and raising revenue, no hocus-pocus statements, no further time lost, as it has already been lost by the Ministry in asking for an adjournment of three weeks when one of ten days would have been quite sufficient for them to prepare what they have prepared. Indeed, so far as I can see, there is nothing prepared now after an adjournment of three weeks. Ministers did not put their shoulders to the wheel as I did when I was in the Treasury. When a Minister undertakes to perform a task, it ought to be done, or be should leave his position. That is the attitude which honourable members ought to take up. I hope that this debate will not be allowed to close until we get some statement as regards the future administration of the finances. We have to get a statement regarding many other things. We want to know, for iustance, about the written compact between the Protectionist party and the Free Trade party. We want to know about a number of things on which we have not yet been taken into the confidence of the Ministry. When I was sitting on the Ministerial side of the House, and the honourable member for Parramatta, with his supporters, was sitting on the Opposition side, the latter were always wanting' to know what agreement we had with the Labour party. That was the subjectSir William Lyne. matter of almost every discussion, and of the bulk of the questions which were asked. I , for one, desire to know what agreement has been' entered into in this unholy alliance. We shall be found in possession of plenty of voice and stamina to see that these matters are brought to light, and that the people of this country are not kept in darkness, as they are kept now, without one word being said on either finance or anything else. As regards finance, what was the proposal which was built up mainly on the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda? We were to take over the State debts, which amounted to £244,000,000or .£246,000,000, and which amount now, I believe, to £252,000,000 or .£254,000,000. It was proposed that the Commonwealth should assume the responsibility for the whole of that indebtedness by the States.",25
126,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I desire to remind the honourable member that there are already three debates set down on the notice paper, namely, a debate on the question as to whether or not the Government enjoys the confidence of - the majority of this House, a debate on the Address-in-Replv, and a debate on the policy of the Government. So long as general principles have been touched upon, I Have not interfered with the honourable member, though he was going very near to several of the questions covered by those three Orders of the Day. But if he proposes to go into details as to how many millions are owed by the States, the distribution of the millions, and so on, he will see very clearly that he will be anticipating one or more of the debates on .the notice-paper. I ask him not to proceed in that way.",26
127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker, though I did not know before that a debate such as this, in which, ordinarily, every grievance that can be thought of, may be mentioned with a view to redress, can be limited because of other matters on the notice-paper under which such questions might be dealt with. I thought that the redress of 'grievances took first place when Supply was asked 1 for. Had I been allowed to say two or three words more, I should have finished what I had in my mind, and, if I may be permitted, I should like to do so.",26
128,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I have not interrupted the honourable member in dealing with general principles, though he pro--ceeded a considerable distance j but he may not discuss the actual details of certain occurrences - honourable member during the present finanSir WILLIAM LYNE,- I had nearly finished what I wish to say.",26
129,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I ask the honourable member not to finish, because, if he is .allowed to proceed further, other honourable members will be entitled to follow his example.",27
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I am sorry that I may not finish my remarks, because their curtailment now will make it necessary to refer to the matter in another debate. However, I shall not proceed further, for two reasons: first, that I think you are the best authority we have in regard to matters of this kind, and, secondly, because I would not wish to do anything which you do not - desire me to do. I shall repeat what I have already said, in as forcible language .as I can command, though I shall try to be as little offensive as is possible under the circumstances. This is a time when no honourable member should hesitate to call a spade a spade. I have done so as plainly as I can, without being unduly offensive. I think it is my right so to speak without apcJogy to the House. Two matters upon which I feel very strongly are the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and Commonwealth borrowing.",27
131,Mr WILKS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Dalley) [4.24] - We have just listened to a speech charged with admonition ancl warning in regard to the - criticism and supervision which honourable members should exercise in respect to the financial proposals of the Government. I - do not think that any honourable member would deny that such proposals must be keenly scrutinized, but I refuse to admit ^hat such scrutiny is the province of the - Opposition alone. In my opinion, the - close supervision of financial administration' is a duty attaching to every parliamentary representative. The fact that a man has moved his seat from one side of the Chamber to another does not alter his responsibility in this matter. Since the first Commonwealth Parliament was opened I , with Others, have been "" a voice crying in the wilderness "" in protest against the introduction of Supply Bills. One would think, to hear the honourable member for Hume this afternoon for the first time, 0 - that he is a model parliamentarian. He - now says that Supply Bills are iniquitous, --and that to hold back a Budget statement may be dangerous. But if you, Mr. Speaker, will allow me to refresh your ready memory, I shall point out that the cial year has introduced no fewer than four Supply Bills. Therefore, his objections to the practice of obtaining Supply in this way are rather belated. Similarly-, the members of the Labour Party were not formerly heard in protest against Supply Bills, but now their sense of what is right is outraged by the proposal of the Government. I am delighted that they have awakened to the fact that honourable members are recreant to their duties if they permit the passing of Supply Bills under other than most exceptional circumstances. They are saying now that the most important thing in parliamentary government is the control by members of the public purse strings- a tardy recognition of a fact of the greatest moment. I am pleased that their removal to the Opposition benches has brought about this change of view. The honourable member for Hume has also protested against Commonwealth borrowing. He tells us that he, and every Government in which he has been a Minister, has been opposed to borrowing. He was cheered for that statement. But let me again refresh your ready memory, Mr S/peaker. Sir George Turner, as Treasurer of a Government in which the honourable member for Hume was Minister, brought forward a proposal for borrowing which was defeated by a vote of the House, I being one of those who voted against it. Unquestionably the public must be delighted that we' have not piled up a national debt, but it has not to thank the honourable member for Hume for this. No doubt it is unfortunate for his reputation for consistency that I have a retentive memory; but since he has admonished the House as though he stands on a pedestal, and is not playing the part of a strict guardian of the public purse merely for the edification of those outside, it is necessary to refer to these things.",27
132,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,He thought that we hacl forgotten them.,27
133,Mr WILKS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I hope that the present Government will forget to bring forward any proposal for borrowing. In my view, the States must either be content with a smaller return from Customs and Excise revenue, or must expect the Commonwealth to adopt other sources of taxation to obtain the revenue required for its needs. If the States insist upon being paid yearly three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise taxation, they must expect us to obtain from other channels the additional money we may need to give effect to thepowers intrusted to us by the Constitution for the development of Australia. reigns do not materialize from vapour, and revenue can be obtained only by taxation, direct or indirect. If the requirements of a Department such as the Post Office can be met out of ordinary revenue, there should be no need to borrow. It is monstrous to think of paying old-age pensions and providing for defence by borrowing. If the ordinary revenue of the year obtained from indirect taxation is not sufficient to pay old age pensions, they should be provided for by means of direct taxation on the wealthy. There is no escape from that position. funds for defence must also come from direct taxation. I do not wish to go into the general principles of that question, or to debate at this stage what sources should be tapped by direct taxation, or what should not. I shall have that opportunity, as you, sir, have indicated, during the debates on various motions that will come before the House. The Government are failing on the very threshold of what they call responsible government, by asking the House to vote two months' Supply. They have blazoned out to the public the fact that they have taken office to restore representative and responsible government. I could understand their asking for one month's Supply in the exceptional circumstances of their taking office, but there is no justification for a request for two months' Supply, and the consequent delaying of the Budget, the settlement of the financial problems of the Commonwealth, and what the press ancl the Government themselves prophesied would be responsible government in excelsis. We were told that for the first time in Federal history, we were to have Ministers who would take charge of the affairs of the Commonwealth on the plain and beaten lines of responsible government. I may be accused of taking too strong a view of the question, and consequently of not playing the game, but no one can with justice complain of me for adhering to the fundamental on which responsible government is built. It may be through over earnestness, or because I lack good advice, or proper experience in parliamentary affairs, or it may be that I do not know how to play the game, that I find it necessary to refer to these matters, but I must point out that the Government told the people that the difference between them-selves and honourable members who now sit Mr Wilks. opposite was that they would restore responsible government, with its accompaniment of representative power. For the Government to introduce a two months' Sove- Supply Bill without telling the House when the Budget is likely to be introduced is inthose circumstances to trifle with the very principle which they took office to restoreI n the last twelve months four Supply Bills were introduced by the then Government, and readily supported by those honourable members who are now sitting in Opposition. Not one word of protest came from them, and they gave no assistance to those few of us then sitting on that side, who were foolish enough to oppose those Bills. They arevery studious in regard to these matters toThe night, and rightly so, but I am sorry their studiousness did not come earlier. By means of those four Supply Bills, the House was rendered comparatively powerless in matters of finance. The discussion or criticism of Estimates became a myth, a farce, and the custody of the purse, so far as the interests of the public were concerned, passed from members of Parliament when they surrendered the control of finance to the Cabinet. Are we now, on the threshold of a new Administration, to be met with a continuation of the policy of introducing Supply Bills until the Estimates are presented to the House? Until the Budget is submitted we cannot obtain the Estimates. I for one refuse to debate Estimates after the money with which they profess to deal 1 has already been voted. I hope the Government will reconsider their proposal to ask for two months' Supply. One plea is that they want time to prepare the Budget. The honourable member for Hume, who is soquiet and inoffensive, although I admit that occasionally he uses the capital "" I , "" said he had only eight days to get his Budget ready. I interjected that the'world was - made in six. The honourable member also revealed the fact that the Treasury officialsreally wrote his Budget, he being only responsible for the policy and reciting it to the House. Apparently that is what is to take place for the future. The Governprinciples ment of the day will have their policy, and"" the Treasurer will simply marshal the figures as he finds them, and present them to the House. The Financial Statement, instead of being a Budget as we have knownBudgets in the States, or read of them in the British House of Commons, is rapidly becoming more or less an accountant's statement of accounts. I see no reason for pleading for two months' delay. Thestatement of Ministerial policy now before us outlines to a great extent the policy as it will be presented in the Budget. I trust this will be the last occasion on which the Opposition will have to warn honourable members that in allowing Supply Bills to through they are treading a dangerous path. I know it. If we give the Government two months' Supply we shall have surrendered one-sixth of our control of the Estimates for the year. I am sorry that all Governpi ments seem to avail themselves of this venly treatment of matters of finance. The honourable member for Hume must, to say the least of it, have hacl a treacherous memory. I cannot say that he uttered an untruth when he addressed the House just now, but he is certainly one of the guiltiest among those who have been guilty of rushthat ing Supply Bills through.",27
134,Mr FRAZER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Kalgoorlie [4.37] - Th Government have miserably failed to justify their request for any Supply at this ture, and they have undoubtedly failed justify their request for two months' in any circumstances. It has been lished beyond doubt that there was no justification for intervening with when the existence of the Government was challenged. The Treasurer has been able to mention any obligations that likely to fall due before the 6th July-th date specified by the late Treasurer, now leader of the Opposition.

Such a contention is not to one which will be patiently listened to obby honourable members. But I have risen chiefly because of certain remarks of the honourable member for Hume, who, in his opening periods, referred to the truly awful state in which he found the Treasury after the retirement from the last Deakin Administration of the present Treasurer. The honourable member did not say so-but , no doubt, it was equally true - that whilst upon taking control of the Treasury he found it a veritable Augean stable, he left it, after a few months, absolutely cleaned out! That being so, no doubt the right honourable member for Swan will find it very difficult to submit a financial statement as early as his predecessor may think desirable. To my mind it is rather unfortunate that disparaging remarks concerning the Treasurer should emanate from a gentleman who has recently been ousted from that office. In this connection I am forcibly rereminded of a saying of Professor Mahaffy, the celebrated Irish wit, to the effect that what a certain dean, who had been disappointed in a bishopric, missed of "" was not the goodly fellowship of first the prophets, but the goodly profits of the fellowship.""

202,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Barrier) [5.11] - When the honourable member for West Sydney was speaking some time ago, he asked what act of maladministration the Fisher Government had committed. I think that it was the honourable member for Fawkner who said, "" What about the telephone rates?"" I understood from that remark that the honourable member considered that an act of maladministration had been com- mitred by the Fisher Government in their proposed alteration of the telephone rates. As that matter was connected with the Post and Telegraph Department, in which I was interested at the time, it will not, perhaps, be amiss if for a little time. I deal with the question of the telephone rates. I may, at the commencement, deal briefly with the history of the telephone service so far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned. When the Post and Telegraph Act was passed, as honourable members are aware, not only did the Commonwealth take over the ordinary postal services, but also the telegraphic and telephonic services. At that time, in every State in Australia, the telephone rates were on what is known as the flat rate system. That is to say, a certain sum of money was paid every year to the Department by each subscriber, who was permitted to have an unlimited number of calls. I believe that in Sydney and Melbourne the business man had to P y £ 9 P* annum for his telea 21 phone, while the private, subscriber paid £ 5 per. annum. In Adelaide the business man paid £ 1 0 per annum, and enjoyed an unlimited number of calls; whilst in Brisbane he paid £ 6 . I have not at the moment the figures for Perth and Hobart. In 1901, when speaking on the Post and Telegraph Bill, I protested against what I thought was an unfair system, namely, that subscribers should be charged alike, irrespective of the use made of the telephone. I thought that the flat rate was unfair, unjust, and unbusinesslike. I mention this"" because some of the metropolitan newspapers- I refer especially to the Melbourne newspapers; the principal dailies in Sydney said little of an unfair character about the proposed alteration of rates-accuse d me of being altogether swayed by the opinions of the officials of the Department in the policy which I proposed to inaugurate. In view of that charge, I may be pardoned for reading one or two extracts from"" speeches made by me in this House. Speaking on the 13th August, 1901, I said I think a different system from the one we. have now, of simply charging so much for business places and so much for the householder, might well be adopted. I do not know what the charge is in Victoria, but in New South Wales, if a person desires to have the telephone laid on to his business house he pays £10 a year, and if to his private house £ 5 a year, irrespective of the extent to which the telephone is used. It seems to me rather absurd that an hotel like the Hotel Australia should pay a rate of ,£10 per annum for a phone that will probably be working all day and all night, while a business person will have to pay exactly the same amount for a telephone which he may not use for more than half an hour in each day, and that the same anomaly should - exist with regard to private houses irrespective of their size. I find that I made a slight mistake when I spoke of business houses having to pav £10 a year in New South Wales. should have been £9. On the 17th November, 1904, I spoke for a considerable time on postal affairs, dealing at length with the toll system. I pointed out that the system was being universally adopted, and gave quotations from America, and various other parts of the world, showing the advantages of the toll system over the flat-rate system. On the 22nd Nos'ember, 1905, I asked some quesMr Thomas. tions of the then Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. In his reply, he informed me that the Grand Hotel, Melbourne, was paying ,£18 per annum for two telephones, and that the Hotel Australia, Sydney, was paying £ 3 5 per annum for its telephones; and that the fees paid to operators alone on account of the Grand Hotel, - Melbourne, came to ^40 13s. 9d., and for the Hotel Australia, .£34 14s. 9d. per annum. On the 16th December, 1905, I asked the following question of the Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Eden-MonaroHas the Postmaster-General made up his mind to adopt the toll system of charges, for telephonic services? The reply given wasBoth the toll and flat rate systems are under consideration, and when a decision is arrived at I shall be glad to inform the honourable member. Speaking on the"" Estimates,"" on the 7th November, 1908, when, I think, the honourable member for Maribyrnong was Postmaster General, I raised the question of the telephone system, asking him whether he intended to make the toll system universal! throughout Australia. I pointed out that, under the then system of compelling all new subscribers to come in under the toll system, but permitting those under the flat rate to remain so if they desired, we were acting unfairly. I stated that if we were not prepared to make ihe toll system universal, we should do away with it altogether, and allow those at present under it to come in under the flat rate. I expressed the hope that before the session was over the Minister would be able to inform the tele- House that the Government were prepared to adopt the toll system. Later on, in the same sitting, whilst the Postmaster-General was replying to crificisms upon the Postal Estimates, I again asked him, "" What about the toll system and the flat rate?"" His reply wasThat is too big a question to deal with tonight. I am going to consider the matter. It The honourable member should not expect me to say right off what I am going to do on such a great question. I think that by these quotations I have been able to show that whatever I may have done whilst Postmaster-General, I was not necesEngland, sarily influenced, in proposing to substitute the toll system for the flat rate system, by any pressure brought to bear upon me by officials in the Department. I had spoken several times on this question in the House, as hacl other honourable members, including the honourable member for Gwydir, who also advocated the substitution of the toll system for the flat rate system. A report on the subject had also been obtained by the then Deakin Government from Mr Hesketh, the - electrical engineer, who had been to England and America for the purpose of in-quiring into the matter. He presented a very valuable report upon telephonic services. The Government of the day, after the presentation of that report, announced that they intended to make some alterations in the telephone rates. Immediately that announcement was made, the big users of telephones were up in arms. The newspapers started at once to thunder against any alteration in the charges. There was a very big outcry made by Chambers of Commerce and newspaper proprietors. The Government of the day commenced answering some of the objections that were raised to the proposed alteration, by stating that the-charges they were then making were practically lower than the charges levied anywhere - else in the world. Some figures were given to the press at that' time, which showed that the charges in London, Berlin, Philadelphia, Chicago, and other places were - considerably higher than those which prevailed in Australia. One result was that the Argus came out on 13th March, 1906, with - some statements which I feel sure will be heard now with very great pleasure by the honourable member for Darling. The honourable member has always contended that competition does not make things cheaper. He has always insisted that competition means waste, and that its effect is to make 'things clearer rather than cheaper. Argus, in replying to the information supplied at the time by the Department, made this statementIn the United States competition has greatly increased the cost of telephoning. 'That is something which will be read pleasure, not only by the honourable member for Darling, but also by those who, like - myself, have some leanings towards the theories ancl aims of Socialism. The Argus - went on to sayPrivate companies anxious to provide the best be a special inquiry. services think nothing of ""scrapping"" switcRbeen 'boards and other apparata, superseded by later 'inventions, in wholesale fashion. Hence capital outlay has grown enormously, and a very large revenue has to be earned to interest and maintenance charges. America the telephone is not, owing to the rates, anything like as popular as might - expected in view of the density of population. Here, in Australia, the Postal Department has not got to meet competition. It has a monopoly. There is no necessity for it to spend money on improvements, and it can keep its expenses down to a minimum. I was rather pleased at the time to read that statement in the Argus, which certainly is not a Socialistic paper. After this agitation had been going on for some time, the then Deakin Government announced that they were not prepared to make it compulsory for any one on the flat rate to come under the toll system. They intended to introduce the toll system, but would not make it compulsory for any one on the flat rate to come under that system. They decided, however, that all new subscribers should be given no alternative, and must start under the toll system. Immediately this was announced, the opposition ceased to a very great extent, because all the big users learned that, if they so desired, they could continue under the flat rate system. At that time it was not considered necessary for the Deakin Government to make any special inquiry before taking the action they proposed to take. When it was proposed to substitute the toll system for the flat rate system a special inquiry was demanded, but immediately the Government announced that it was to be optional with existing subscribers under the flat rate system to come under the toll system, the agitation for the special inquiry ceased. In the circumstances, I should now like to ask Ministers, why, if they cannot bring all people under the toll system 'today without a special inquiry, the previous Deakin Government were able to bring all new subscribers under that system The without such an inquiry? Of course, the reason is obvious, that in dealing with big users the Government were dealing with big men, and with some Governments apparently it is necessary that big users should be dealt with in a different way from that in which small users are. Immediately with the big user knew that he could remain under the flat rate system there was no necessity for further inquiry; but when I , as Postmaster-General, said that all men, rich and poor, should be treated alike, it was declared to be necessary that there should That inquiry has granted by the present Government, and we understand that nothing can be done their until it is completed. In 1905 I was inpay formed by Mr Austin Chapman, who was And in Postmaster-General at the time,' that the Grand Hotel was paying £ 1 8 a year in rebe venue to the Department, and received for this payment services involving an expendidon ture by the Department of £ 4 0 13s. Qd.<in operators' fees alone, leaving out the of telephones, switchboards, and the cost looking after the telephones. The Grand is entitled to 2,000 free rings. Hotel Company were paying the Governseemed ment £ 1 8 for an average of 185 rings per clay on two telephones, and £ 4 0 13s. was expended in operators' fees alone supplying the services rendered. As Postmaster-General is present, I should to ask him as a business man-for we Are given to understand now that business men rings a day. are in charge of affairs-whethe r he thinks a special inquiry was necessary to find if it paid the Department to receive £ 1 from a big corporation like the Grand Company and pay £ 4 0 in operators' fees alone to supply the services rendered. I shall be very glad to know, if he cares reply to my remarks, why it is necessary have a report prepared by special accountment ants in order to discover matters of that kind. To show the very glaring anomalies in connection with our present system, cord of the calls over the Sydney net work for a week was taken. It was found that large business houses averaged from ten to one hundred rings per day over each line, for a. payment of £ g a year. Small business houses averaged from two to ten calls per clay over each line for a like payment. As regards large hotels and boarding-houses some averaged five rings-a day, and others sixty-one rings a day, for a payment of j£g a year. Medium hotels and boardingdid houses averaged from five to forty-five rings per day over each line, while small ones averaged from three to ten rings a day over each line. As regards private houses where the flat rate of £ 5 a year prevailed, it was found that they averaged from two to fifty-four rings per day over each line. do not know why a special committee actuaries or accountants was required order to prove that a system like that, taining as it does so many anomalies, ought to be altered at the very first opportunity.",33
203,Mr HEDGES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Has the honourable memnumber ber given an average of the calls, or has only picked outfigures,because some places are not rung up once a day ?",36
204,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Department took a record of the calls for a week. In some cases private houses averaged fifty-four rings a day for seven days, while others averaged only two rings a day for the week. That was taken to be the average ened number of daily calls throughout the year. The Deakin Government decided to abanaction. to some extent the flat rate. They announced that all new subscribers must come cost under the toll system, under which everyof one has to pay a rent of £ 5 a year, and This to me a very absurd arrangement, because business people and private persons gd. had to pay exactly the same ground rent, in and were allowed the same number of free the rings. Most business people, even in a like small way, used practically 2,000 rings a year, which represent, I think, six or seven Private persons, however, did not by any means use their allowance. out In fact, in suburbs, if we leave out busi8 ness people, 80 per cent, of the subscribers Hotel would not use 1,000 free rings a year. The concession was practically of no use to private people, because they did not use to the telephone to the extent of the limit to for free rings. While I was at the DepartI had a summary made of the dailv calls from the exchange at Malvern, which I should think, a very fair sample of the a resuburbs of Melbourne. As regards private residences we found that 20 per cent, of the subscribers averaged one call, 39 per cent, two calls. 13 pe.r cent, two ancl a half calls, and 9 per cent, three calls. In other words, 80 per cent, of the subscribers did not use their telephone three times a day, showing that the concess'ion of 2,000 free calls a year was of very little use to them. Some business men, of course, exceeded the limit, but the great majority not go over it very much. These are the anomalies which I found when I entered the Department, and I thought it was mv duty, without loss of time, to make an alteration. I announced that I intended, with the consent of the Government, to make the toll system universal. We issued I our charges, and were told by some newsof papers and some Chambers of Commerce in that they were exorbitant. I understand conthat the Sydney Chamber of Commerce was fairly .well pleased with our scale, but there was a big outcry on the part of aof business people, and our charges: he were declared to be exorbitant. We decided to charge a giound rent of £ 4 a year, to allow no free calls, and to chargeone half-penny per call up to 2,000 calls, and over that number one-third of a penny per call. I did not act without having had' figures supplied to me by the officials of the Department. Not only was I strengthby their figures, but the rates charged' in other parts of the world justified my If we leave out Sweden ancl) Switzerland, where wages are nothing like so high as they are in Australia, no other country has so cheap a telephone service as ours. I was told by one authority that the difference between the wages paid in Switzerland ancl those paid to our operators is equivalent to a difference of as much as £ 2 in the working of each telephone. With the exception of Sweden ancl Switzerland, there is no place in the world where a network of lines such as there is in each of our main centres of population costs the subscribers as little as ours would have to pay were the rates which I attempted to impose in force. The Birmingham rates come nearest to those. There a ground rent of £ 3 3s. and an extra one penny per call is charged. A Birmingham subscriber who used his instrument on the average only once a day would pay £4. 13s. 3d. annually, and an Australian subscriber, charged the rates of the Fisher Government, would pay £ 4 15s. 2d.; but while the Birmingham subscriber who used his instrument on the average twice a day would pay £ 6 3s. iod., an Australian subscriber .would pay only £ 5 ios. sd. In the newspaper report of an interview with the present Postmaster General, a Mr Alcock, a member of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, is represented as having said that he pays £ 9 a year for the use of the telephone, whereas, were the charges which I endeavoured to impose in force, he would have to pay £ 2 8 ios. a year. If he were a Birmingham subscriber, and used his telephone as much as he does here, he would have to pay £ 6 5 a year for the service. I have asked for exact information on the subject in the following question :Whether it is a fact that a Mr Alcock- a member of the Chamber of Commerce, Melbourne-at a deputation that waited on the Postmaster-General re the telephone rates, made the following statement :- "" That he found that on one of the telephones for which he was paying £ 4 ios. per half-year, he would under the new telephone rates (i.e., the Fisher Government . rates) have to pay ^28 ios.""-and to ask(1) If this statement is correct, how many - rings per dav of 312 days per year would there ""be? (2) And how much would be paid in wages to the operators alone for attending to these rings? No doubt, the question will be answered directly the motion is disposed of, unless, of course, the Opposition ds fortunate enough to carry it. My question deals with a year of 312 days, because it is not usual for business men to use their office telephones on Sunday. Mr Alcock apparently makes about 50 rings a day, which must cost the Department from £ 1 0 to £ 1 1 in operators' fees alone, although the Government receives only £ 9 from the subscriber.",36
205,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Any calculation of cost must be a very complicated one.,37
206,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I make my statement on the strength of figures supplied to me, not when I was Postmaster-General, but when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro held that office, and I asked for certain information regarding the expense of attending to the telephone at the Grand Hotel, Melbourne.",37
207,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I doubt the correct-' ness of those figures, in the light of subsequent investigations.",37
208,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"At any rate, my deduction cannot be spoken of as an unfair one. I do not profess to be a business man, though I understand that we have now a Ministry composed of business men.",37
209,Mr BAMFORD,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Not one of the Ministers is a business man.,37
210,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I understand that the administration is now to be carried on strictly on. business lines, though it seems to be necessary to make a special investigation to ascertain whether a service for which the Government receives only £ i S , and on which it expends £40, is to be regarded as profitable. In Mr Alcock's case the Government receives £ 9 and spends £ 1 0 or £ 1 1 in giving the service. I have also asked a question as to the number of. rings made. by the Argus office. I might have asked for similar information regarding the Age, but I did not wish my questions to be too long, and no doubt what will apply to one office will apply to the other.",37
211,Mr JOHNSON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Perhaps the honourable member discriminates because the Age is more favourably disposed towards him than i's the Argus.,37
212,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Honourable members may gather what I think of the two newspapers when I say that it is the Argus which is delivered at my house every morning. It will be found, when the information which I require is supplied, that the telephone service given to .the Argus costs in operators' fees more than the newspaper's proprietors pay for it. The Government rightly objects to telephones leased under the flat rate being used by any but the subscribers themselves, or on their business. That rate gives to each subscriber, for a certain annual charge, a service allowing an unlimited and unmeasured number of calls. Non-subscribers are not permitted to use these telephones, nor are subscribers allowed to charge non-subscribers for their use. If the Department knows that a non-subscriber is using such a telephone, it has the right to disconnect it. There has, of course, been great abuse in this matter, but the rule, in my opinion, is a fair one. If a subscriber on the flat-rate system allows a non-subscriber to use his telephone, and charges for the ring, he ought to be summoned and punished. To some extent the late Government introduced the toll system, which meant that, for a fee of £ 5 , the subscriber could have 2,000 rings, with a subsequent charge of Jd. a ring. In this connection the following is a question which I placed on the notice-paper: [1) Whether it is a fact that under the telephone charges of the previous Deakin Government a subscriber can have a toll telephone for £ 5 per 4mnum with 2,000 free rings? '(a) Iff so, is a subscriber permitted to a non-subscriber to use any of those free rings and charge the non-subscriber for doing so? I wrote a letter to the Postmaster-General this morning, informing him that I intended - to speak today, and asking him whether - he would be good enough to answer the question I have read. The Postmaster-General has been courteous enough to send irne a reply, and in each case that answer is ""Yes."" I should like to point out what this means. We have now had for some time a system under which a person, for £ 5 P year, is permitted to have 2,000 er calls, and he may allow non-subscribers to use the telephone at a charge of i d . per ring. Does it appear necessary to have a special Committee of Inquiry to investigate an anomaly of this kind, under which - the subscriber pays £ 5 per annum, for his - telephone, and may charge £ 8 6s. 8""d. for ;the use of it?",37
213,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The subscriber may - exhaust only half the rings.,38
214,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The subscriber may exhaust every ring, ancl some do, though 80 per cent, do not.",38
215,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Such - would not keep a penny-in-the-slot telephone.,38
216,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,But they can do so if - they like.,38
217,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Onl y big establishments like hotels would do so.,38
218,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"In some of the hotels tihe rings do not average more than two per day on business, the whole being exhausted, it may be, by their customers; and I am perfectly amazed at the present Postmaster General defending what I know is not one of his little pet schemes.",38
219,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,It is a regulation.,38
220,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I am sure that the present Postmaster-General is not responsible for so idiotic and absurd an arrangement.,38
221,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,They say it tends to develop business.,38
222,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Is that the view of the Department ?,38
223,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,They say it tends to develop business.,38
224,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Departments, like people, are liable to make mistakes; and in the case of the Department it is necessary lo cloak the mistake up. However, I have too much respect for the Postmaster-General to think that he is seriously prepared to defend so idiotic an arrangement. What happens with the subscribers who have 2,000 allow free rings is that, as they cannot use the telephone themselves, they place the machines at the disposal of their friends. I have been told of a lady, who had a telephone installed simply in order to be in touch with a doctor, on account of a sick child; and as she had to pay for the 2,000 rings, whether she used the telephone or not, she placed it at the disposal of a friend. I was at dinner with a lady friend a little while ago, and I was told that the little girl of my hostess, immediately she got out of school, went wth her friend, Florrie, and rung up all the friends they knew. Of course, from a departmental point of view, it does not matter whether the rings are on business.or pleasure, so long as they are paid for. Mr Alcock stated that under the regulation of the late Government, he would have to pay £ 2 8 10s., instead of £ 9 , under the old regulation; but, if the matter be worked' out, I think it will be found that, under the Chapman rate, Mr. Alcock would have to pay rfrom £ 2 2 to £ 2 3 per year. The Government do not allow any person now to start a telephone on the flat rate system; but I ask the Postmaster-General whether he thinks it is fair subscribers that a person, who started business a few years ago, should be permitted to have fifty or sixty calls per day for £ 9 per annum, while a man, who started business later, has to pay, perhaps, £ 2 3 per year? Does it require a special report of accountants to expose the idiotic nature of such an arrangement? I have not the slightest objection to the Committee that has been appointed making the fullest possible inquiry into this matter. I have no objection to some one outside the Department being associated on the Committee with someone in the Department, if in that way greater confidence will be given to the general community. But, in view of the anomalies I have pointed out, the Government ought not to have stayed their hand. Am I not right in saying that the Postmaster-General stated publicly that the toi 1 system had come to stay ?",38
225,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Yes , it is staying. is the regulation now. It came with the system brought in when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was Postmaster General, and that system is staying.",39
226,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Then does the honourable member also admit,39
227,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,We are not here to be interrogated.,39
228,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"We were getting along very nicely until the Treasurer came in. As the Postmaster-General does not deny that he made that statement, I presume he intends to do away with the flat rate. May I go so fa r as to say that the principle of the toll system has been accepted by the Postmaster-General ?",39
229,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The honourable member should not cross-examine me.,39
230,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The honourable member will not reply now that his master has come in. The honourable member may have made the statement which I previously quoted without consulting his masters-the newspapers and the Treasurer. The principle of the toll system, if it has not been, will have to be accepted. The people will see that it is. Whether the newspapers suppress these facts or not, they will be brought out on the public platform. The end may be' delayed for a little while, but the flat rate is doomed in Australia. I take it that the Government have appointed the Committee of Inquiry with the legitimate object of having a report made to the House. Then, having accepted the principle of the toll system, and thrown overboard the flat rate, where was the - necessity to suspend what the Fisher Government did ? ' The Prime Minister has told the House that the Government hope to have a report from the Committee within three months. If the report is presented in that time, we shall know within three months whether the Government intend to alter the rates which I introduced. They cannot alter them very much, as will be obvious to anybody who has studied the figures in connection with the telephone business. The Government might well explain now why they suspended the Fisher rates. Under the system which we introduced, no one would have to pay more than £ 2 for the first half-year. Under the existing systems every man who has a telephone in the big centres of population, must pay more than £ 2 for the first half-year. If under the old flat rate he would pay £ 4 . ios., and' if under the Chapman arrangement, £ 2 ios. I admit that under our proposal, as there would be no free calls, It he might have to pay a good deal more than £ 2 during the second six months. But if the Government are sincere in asking for a report, and really mean business-if it is not merely a device to gain time-the y could find out within six months whether the rates we proposed were too high or too low. If they were too high, the matter could be rectified in the payments that would have to be made in the second six months. For that reason there was no necessity to suspend the rates we introduced. Some people regard a ground rent of £ 4 as exorbitant. If that was found to be so, it could have been allowed for in the second six months. The officers of the Department presented me with a statement showing that the capital charge for each telephone, covering the cost of conducting the exchange, and giving a complete service, including switchboards, cables, & c , was at least _ £ 3 9 . Those figures may be wrong, and I sincerely hope that the report will show that they are toohigh. But, on comparing them with figures presented to me in relation to other countries, I found that £ 3 9 was not an unfairly high estimate. I have no objection to the Committee being appointed, and in fact I promised the commercial classes that while I was Postmaster-General a full account would be given. It is only right and fair that it should be given. The Committeemust bring in one of three reports. They may report that the Fisher Government's charges were not exorbitant, but fair, just, and equitable. If they do, that will be a personal triumph to myself and the Government of which I was a member. They may report that the charges were too low, and if they do there will be weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth among, at least, some of those who have been agitating.' If the Treasurer had not been present, I should have asked the Postmaster General whether the Government are prepared to say that the telephone service should return its bare cost. If they are, they may find it impossible to make it do so unless they raise the charges higher those fixed by the Fisher Administration. ness men. The Committee may report, either, that the rates fixed by us are just, or that they not high enough; or, thirdly, they may be lawyers. able to show conclusively-and I hope they will-that the rates fixed by the late vernment were too high. I should like see the telephone in as many homes as sible, and, therefore, I should be very pleased if the Committee could show that our charges were too high, and that lower rates should be fixed. We should then able to tell the people that a State-owned service. and State-controlled system could supply a cheaper service than could any private encarried out? terprise of the kind in the world. It will thus be seen that, from a. certain point, the report, whatever it may be, will be satisfactory to me. One feature of controversy that has given me great pleathe sure is the announcement by the commercial men, who have asked that the old rate shall be reverted to, that they are willing that such a rate shall be levied as will make both ends meet. We should thankful that they are ready to pay bare cost of the service provided that is no waste j that, in other words, they' desire that the Commonwealth shall provide them with a good service without making a profit from it . I am pleased that they take that stand, because I think that, not only the telephone, but every other service should be supplied at bare cost. Since the commercial classes asked that the ComGeneral monwealth shall provide them with a good telephone service without seeking to make Why is it not paying now? any profit from it , I see no reason the people should not ask the commercial community, in return, to supply at bare cost the services which they render.",39
231,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,They have to live.,40
232,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"But if they are not prepared to"" provide their services at - cost, why should they expect the Governvernment ment to do so?

237,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Was that direction,40
238,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Yes ; the rates that we standfixed have been suspended. The Prime Minister has stated that it is intended that the the Committee appointed to inquire into system shall report within three months. The Age, which, I understand, dictates the policy of the Government, declares that it will be necessary for the Committee to inquire full y, not only into the telephone be service of Australia, but into the govern the ment and municipal services of a like there character in England and elsewhere. If this is to be done, some time must elapse before the Committee will report, and I trust, therefore, that the Postmaster-General, in the interests of the general public, will see that, in the meantime, fair charges are imposed. One of the members of the deputation which waited on the Postmasterstated that, prior to Federation, the telephone system was a payable one. Prior to why Federation, every business man in Sydney and Melbourne, under the flat-rate system, paid £ 9 per annum for his telephone, while in Adelaide the charge was, and still is, £ 1 0 per annum. Whether a man had two calls per day or a hundred, the charge bare was the same. But the late Deakin Gomade the astoundingproposal is that any person who desired might come under the measured or toll system at £ 5 bare per instrument, with 2,000 calls per anor if it were so desired, could still all the remain under the flat-rate system.",40
239,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Thos e who were then subscribers could do so, but not new subscribers.",40
240,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Quite so; new subscribers had to come under the toll sysThe result of this change was that the Department lost tens of thousands of pounds - Every subscriber who found that he had only six or seven calls a day immediately took advantage of the toll system, whilst those who had unlimited calls elected to remain under the flat-rate system. Thus the Government lost tens of thousands of pounds without calling upon the big users of the Telephone Service to make up the deficiency. If , prior to Federation, the service was a paying one, the loss sustained by the Department as the result of subscribers like Mr Alcock, making perhaps one hundred calls a day, had to be made tip by the small users of the telephone, who might perhaps make only nine calls per day. ' Now, however, if the service is not a paying one the general taxpayer has to make good the deficiency occasioned by the large users of the telephone. The Postmaster-General should have been prepared to tackle the anomalies which I have pointed out quicker than he has done.",40
241,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The honourable member had six months of Ministerial office in which to effect these reforms, whereas the present Postmaster-General has had only one month.",41
242,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"If the honourable member for Bendigo had continued the rates which I introduced, no subscriber for six months would have had to pay more than £2. During that time full inquiry might have been made into the matter, and at its end the charges might have been readjusted had the adoption of the course been found to be necessary. Surely it is a sound principle that people should be called upon to pay the State in proportion to the services which it renders them. Personally, I entertain no objection to the appointment of a Committee of Accountants to determine what rates it will be necessary to charge in order to make the Department a paying one. , I shall not allow the Postmaster-General to forget that such a committee has been appointed, and if within three months it has not reported, I shall want to know what has become of it. I welcome its appointment, because I believe that the result of its inquiry will be the abolition of the flat rate and the general application of the toll system, although I realise that, if only for the sake of appearance, some alterations will be made in the rates that were chargeable under the regulation which I framed, even though those alterations are not of a vital character.",41

I can assure him that the task of considering and advising the Executive to suspend his regulation was a very disagreeable one to me. But he must recognise that the Gazette notice which contained it invited the commercial public to lodge objections to the proposed increase of the telephone charges if they entertained any. Consequently he can scarcely complain if private individuals,- as well as the commercial people of Australia, accepted his invitation and inundated the Postmaster General's Department with objections. When I assumed control of the Department the office was filled with complaints, and a regular storm of indignation was raging.",41
244,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Then those complaints must have been received within twenty-four hours after I quitted office.,41
245,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I found a long list of objections awaiting me upon the very day that I took office, and those objections continued to accumulate. I believe that if the honourable member for Barrier had seen the accumulated protests, founded upon commercial and financial grounds, he might have recognised the necessity of re-considering some of his proposals. The honourable member has expressed his approval of the appointment of an actuarial committee to determine what rates it will be necessary to charge to make the Telephone Service a remunerative one. But I wish to point out to him that he made a mistake in framing his regulation first, and approving of an inquiry into it afterwards. ' My policy is first to appoint the committee to ascertain the grounds, the data, and the principles upon which a new regulation can be framed. It was not wise to frame a regulation first and to subsequently hold an inquiry into the rates which it imposed. I am sure that if my honourable friend had had an opportunity of appointing a committee to inquire into this most complicated question, he would not have assumed the very great responsibility of passing the regulation which he did- a regulation which provoked a storm of indignation throughout the Commonwealth.",41
246,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Not throughout the Commonwealth. The objections to it were confined to Melbourne.,41
247,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I can assure my honourable friend that objections to it poured in from all the States, with the exception of Western Australia. Up to the period when the late Ministry were deposed, probably the people of that State had not realized its true import, otherwise they would have joined in the volume of opposition which I had to encounter.",41
248,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Why were not those protests forthcoming whilst I held office?,42
249,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Because it was only about the time that the provisional regulation would have become absolute 'that the people woke up to its probable effect. I think that the honourable member would have saved himself and the Department a lot of trouble had he seen his way clear to have followed the clearly expressed advice of the late chairman of the Postal Commission. In a report which he forwarded to the Governor General on the occasion of his resignation from that office, the honourable member for Bourke recommended the appointment of a committee to investigate the question of the telephone rates which should be charged, with a view to making the service a payable one.",42
250,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Was that the report of the Commission?,42
251,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,It was the report of the retiring chairman of the Commission.,42
252,Mr TUDOR,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,It was the report of a man who was backing down from doing what he ought to have done.,42
253,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"As a public man, who had been chairman of the Commission for a considerable time, the recommendation of the honourable member for Bourke in favour of the appointment of a Committee of Accountants was entitled to considerable weight.",42
254,Unknown,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7-45,42
255,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The motion before the Chair being one for going into Committee of Supply, I have hardly time, and this is not a fitting opportunity to do justice, either to myself in reply to the honourable member for Barrier, or to the subject. It would take a considerable time to go over the whole of the ground that he has covered, as well as to use the materials which I have in readiness to vindicate my own attitude! and to explain the reasons why the regulations in question were suspended.",42
256,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,It would require a good deal of explanation.,42
257,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"This , I say, is hardly a fitting opportunity, and it would ill become me as Postmaster-General to take up much time, and prevent Mr Speaker from leaving the chair. .",42
258,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Are those the instructions which the honourable gentleman has received ?,42
259,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I intended to make that my opening observation. The honourable member, having been Postmaster General himself, will appreciate the force of what I say. Inasmuch as my predecessor in office has admitted that a Committee of inquiry was necessary, he has practically acknowledged the overwhelming force of the argument in favour of the suspension of the regulations.",42
260,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I said that I had no objection to the Committee.,42
261,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"It would be an ab- solute mistake to impose regulations levying heavy charges, amounting in some cases to taxation, on subscribers whilst making inquiries as to the justice of those charges.",42
262,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The honourable gentleman admits that there are anomalies. But as long as the fat man is greased, it is all right.",42
263,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"It is admitted that there are anomalies in the regulations. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, when Postmaster-General, admitted that long ago. He tried to solve the problem, but found it to be very difficult indeed. My honourable friend the member for Barrier, also attempted to solve the problem, but found that it was a very difficult one to solve in a satisfactory manner. The only solution, and the proper one, is that of which he now admits the propriety. The course that I have adopted is confirmed by the recommendation of the officer, Mr Hesketh, upon whose advice, no doubt, the honourable member, when in office, based his regulations. Mr Hesketh, after I had discussed this matter with him fairly and squarely, for two or three days in the Department, going over the whole of the ground, and examining the regulations which had been framed, frankly admitted that the problem was one which should be investigated by a Committee. Having regard to the great diversity in the cost of construction, and the lack of uniformity as to the method of apportioning the expenses of the various telephone systems, he recommended that a Committee should be appointed to inquire into the charges, of whatever nature, relating to the telephone branch of the Department, under their several headings, and also the basis on which the charges for services should be determined. That recommendation practically terminated the controversy so far as I was concerned, because it would be monstrously unjust to subscribers, and to the community, to enforce a system of new charges concerning the accuracy> the justice, and the fairness of which there might be reasonable doubts. Mr Hesketh, while standing by his previous opinion as to the cost of working the telephone service, admitted that it was a matter for inquiry by experts. I may tell the honourable member that the reason why a partial system was not adopted, and the flat-raters brought under the toll system by a modified regulation, was that if they had all been brought under the Chapman regulations, which admitted of 2,000 odd free calls per annum, there would have been a great loss of revenue, because, as between the flat-rate system and 'the toll system, the flat-rate subscribers were the most profitable subscribers of the Department. It would have been a tremendous mistake in policy.",42
264,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Does the honourable gentleman know what he is talking about,43
265,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Yes ; there would have been a loss of revenue, because largest amount of revenue was derived the flat rate subscribers. Indeed, the orable member for Eden-Monaro seemed to reckon that the toll rate subscribers treated with undue liberality.",43
266,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,It was optional for the flat rate subscribers to come in under toll system.,43
267,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I point out to the honourable member for Barrier that during his speech, which occupied some time, the under the heading of capital charges. Postmaster-General, as far as I remember, made no interjection whatever, except answer questions expressly addressed him. I ask the honourable member to mete out the same treatment to the PostmasterMelbourne General.",43
268,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"It would have been a mistake, in my opinion, to have dealt with this question in a piece-meal manner. The whole question ought to be S per cent., amounted to only taken into consideration. We should not deal with one class of telephone subscribers, leaving the others unaffected. If we were to have an inquiry, the right thing to do to suspend the regulations, and to allow the whole subject matter to be investigated. Again, there are reasons why a tremendous rush of flat-raters should not be brought under the toll rate regulations, because ample provision was made for recording the"" 13s. iod. calls. If 5>339 flat-raters in Melbourne, and 8,322 flat-raters in Sydney were placed under the toll rate system, the result be to create an immense volume of additional work for the attendants, that would involve a great reinforcement in the number of hands, and also a great addition to the number of those engaged in making up the accounts. No provision whatever had been made for this in-rush of additions to the toll rate subscribers' list. There was great consternation in the Department as to the possibility of this immense volume of work being imposed upon the already overworked telephone attendants. Evidence to that effect was given, in Sydney, where it was stated that the officers viewed with alarm the possibility of having increased work imposed upon them without provision being made for the employment of an increased number of .hands. Then, again, subscribers complained that no proper method of recording calls was in force that would give some guarantee of accuracy as to the number of calls recorded. Evidence of the difficulty exists in the fact ? that people who are already under the toll system complain of the imperfect method the of recording calls. The Department has from had under consideration an improved honmethod of recording them, which will, no doubt, in time come into force. These are were the reasons why I could not advise my colleagues to transfer the flat rate subscribers to the toll rate system' forthwith. the The whole thing ought to be dealt with in a comprehensive manner. Again, I was led strongly tosuspect that excessive rates were being imposed on subscribers I discovered these figures myself, as the reto sult of questioning Mr Hesketh. Honorto able members will probably know that under the new system £ 4 was charged in and Sydney against subscribers ai a capital charge. I found out from investigation that in Melbourne, where the capital expense of a line amounts to £39> the charge by interest and depreciation, at 6s. 3d. 1 As against a charge of £ 4 in Sydney, the actual capital expense per line was set down at £ 3 5 16s., on which interest and deprewas ciation, at 8 per cent., would amount only 1 to £ 3 . Yet subscribers were charged £ 4 . In Ballarat, to take a typical country case, the expense per line was set down at £ 2 3 8s. in 6a.. upon which interest and depreciation, no at 8 per cent., would amount to only £ 1 1 Yet subscribers were being charged .£3 ios. At Bendigo, the capital cost of a line was £ 3 1 16s., upon which inwould terest and depreciation would amount to £ 2 14s., .but the subscribers are being charged £ 3 ios. At Geelong the capital expense of a line was £ 3 8 , upon which interest and depreciation was £ 2 7s. gd., and the subscribers are charged £ 3 ios.",43
269,Mr WEBSTER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Can the honourable gentleman rely upon thosefigures?,44
270,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I got them from the Department. It is true that they do not include provision for a sinking fund, but they include interest and depreciation to the extent of 8J per cent.",44
271,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,They do not working expenses.,44
272,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"No , working expenses are included in the charge per call.",44
273,Mr WEBSTER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Do they include interest on the capital outlay necessary to make the system perfect?,44
274,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"No . In some instances the estimate is based upon the actual capital expenditure, in the case of the figures for instance relating to Sydney, Bendigo, and Ballarat: but thefiguresrelating to Melbourne are based upon the amount which ought to be spent to make the lines payable.",44
275,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Do they include, the cost of the switchboard in the central exchange ?",44
276,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Melbourne estimate includes everything, telephone, exchange equipment, line, instruments, and wall fittings. The only point in debate is as to whether provision for a sinking fund ought not also to be included as a charge against subscribers. In the present condition of our law, that in my opinion is open to question, and to consideration, at the hands of experts. Sufficient is allowed for depreciation.",44
277,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,What is allowed for depreciation ?,44
278,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"An allowance of 5 per cent, is made for depreciation, and 3J per cent, for interest.",44
279,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,For a. 20 years' life? I do not think that is sufficient.,44
280,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"That is what the Department suggested. The only matter in question was as to whether an allowance should be added for a sinking' fund. thought that a debatable point, and one which I could not settle. I think that no Postmaster-General, without actuarial advice, could settle it. That is the reason why I agreed to. recommend to my colleagues that this matter should be inquired into. think that in the interests of the subscribers as well as of the revenue, it should be inquired into. I believe that these works should be treated in a business like manner, and the charges based on commercial considerations. The subscribers say that if as a result of the investigation it is shown that the rates ought to be increased they will cheerfully pay the increased rate.  Can the honourable gentleman mention one?",44
281,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The deputation representing the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce told me that. include  orable gentleman's leg.,44
282,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I do not believe that they were. At any rate these figures are sufficient to create a doubt as to the justice of the respective charges of £ 4 , £ 3 ios., and £ 3 against subscribers. Upon submitting them to my colleagues it appeared to us wise to suspend the regulations pending a thorough inquiry. There is no desire to shelve the matter. The Committee appointed is not intended to be a shelving Committee. It is limited to three ; months, within which to submit its report, and the object of its appointment 'is to secure authentic information upon which a fresh scale framed on business like lines may be brought into force.  gentleman refer the matter to the Royal Commission on Postal Services now sitting.",44
283,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"As I have said, I do not feel at liberty to enlarge more fully upon that aspect of the case, because I do not wish to delay the passing of the Supply Bill. But if my honourable friends opposite will challenge me on some future occasion I shall be prepared to give more complete information upon the subject, and to vindicate the action taken by my colleagues and myself.",44
284,Mr SPENCE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Darling) [8.0] - I think that the honourable member for Barrier and other honourable members who have spoken should extend a little more consideration to the Government, in view of the fact that they are a very slow going GovernI ment. We know that as Treasurer the honourable member for Hume was ten times as quick a man as the right honourable member for Swan. If he were now occupying! the office, the Honourable member for Hume could get out a complete Budget statement, I dealing with public works and every financial question, including the financial relations with the States, in eight days.",44
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The honourable gentleman would have it prepared for him.  for Swan will have his Budget prepared for him also.,44
286,Mr SPENCE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"It appears that the Treasurer of the "" fusion "" crowd requires eighty days to get out a Budget. In the circumstances we cannot grumble that the Postmaster-General should keep the same pace. It would never do to have one section of the political team miles ahead other. They are in a sufficiently bad tangle already, and if any one of them were to set about doing things he would disorganize the whole team. In common with other honourable members, I protest against the demand for two months' Supply. As a matter of fact, I object entirely to the practice of introducing Supply Bills. As no reason, so far, has been given by the Government for demanding two months' Supply, I propose to give one. It is that the Government require time to consider the financial problem. They are such a mixed team, and there aVe so many differences of opinion amongst them that it is necessary for the Treasurer to sult the State Rights party, and there has not been time to call them together. As the Government tell us nothing, we must obtain information where we can. A time limit appears to be imposed upon members of the Government who desire to speak. We saw that just now when the Postmaster-General was so evidently called off, lest he should make some mistake. The honourable gentleman strayed away in his own electorate and let out something about a £2,000,000 loan, and he had to make an explanation the next day, He hacl to apologize and explain that he did not mean what he said. If the honourable gentleman hacl not been called off on this occasion we might have learned a little more from him. I am watching affairs, and I .hope that we shall know something of the policy of the Government in two or three months' time. It is clear that it would be no trouble to the Treasurer to prepare a Budget statement. What is worrying the right honourable gentleman is that he must consult the outside people who are ruling him. In other matters of policy the Government must consult outside bodies, but in the matter of finance consideration must be had for the amount to be returned to the States and whether it is advisable to continue the don section. The Government appear to be absolutely sure that they have a majority ancl intend to take their time, no matter what we may sav. In the matter of the introduction of Supply Bills, the present Government is only worse than previous Governments, and seeing the elements of which it is composed honourable members could not have expected anything else. Every Government that has yet held, office in the Commonwealth has been guilty of the practice of depending upon Supply Bills. Delay in the delivery of the Budget has a serious effect in connection with the construction of public works. For instance, a lengthy deof an- bate takes place upon Works Estimates which must be passed before the works can be undertaken. If it is desired to erect a new building, after the Works Estimates are passed, the Department concerned sets out to look for a block of land on which to erect the building. Negotiations for its purchase involve delay. When it is secured there is delay caused by the State Public Works Department, upon which we must depend to get our business done. It is the practice of the Works Departments of the various States to make Commonwealth business second to State business, and they would forget the Commonwealth business conaltogether if Federal members for the districts interested did not stir up the Home Affairs Department, and get that Department in turn to stir up the States Public Works Department. It is possible that after a delay of six months, specifications may be prepared for the building. Then tenders are called for. Very often there is found to be something the matter with the tenders, and fresh tenders have to be called for. So there is further delay, and the financial year expires before the work can be undertaken, and it must then be delayed until a new Budget is submitted, and fresh Estimates are passed in August, September, or October. However, the present Government claims to have brought in the millenium politically in having secured responsible government for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth. We might have expected, in the circumstances, that they would have proceeded on model lines. But they do not seem to have yet awakened to the stupidity of postponing the Budget and the Works Estimates, until the end of August. The Treasurer is a man of vast experience, who ran affairs in Western Australia for a great many years, and as Treasurer of that State, Brad- handled the funds of the State, and he should be able to set a good example in the Commonwealth. I wish to emphasize my objection to the introduction of Supply Bills. A Government that claims to have restored responsible government to the Commonwealth, might have been expected to invent some"" system which would have made their introduction unnecessary. It is lutely inexcusable that they should two months' Supply. They obtained cess of three weeks after taking office. when it was. That was in the beginning of June. We are now at the end of June. They four weeks in office, and Ministers should have been prepared with necessary legislation. What has our experienced Treasurer beendoing? Apparently nothing. The honourable gentleman has not his Budget ready, nor has he any financial proposals prepared for submission to Parliament. suggest to the Prime Minister that should not keep a Treasurer like that office. He should get rid of the right orable gentleman, \yho is a dead failure, in four weeks' time he can do no more than submit a few figures which his officers have prepared, say that they represent the running account, and ask for two months' Supply. In my opinion' it is great loss to the fusion that they did secure as Treasurer, the gentleman who could prepare a Budget in eight days. they had done so, we should have had the Budget submitted at the close of the finansurprising cial year. I shall not vote for two months' Supply. The Treasurer has given no cuse for the delay which we are informed is to take place before the delivery of Budget. We recognise that as the financial year is just drawing to a close/ he not be expected to present his Budget once, but it should not take him twoweeks months to prepare it.",45
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,It will long.,46
288,Mr SPENCE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Then he should have it ready in a fortnight.,46
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Th efigureswill not be ready for three weeks or more.,46
290,Mr SPENCE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"It is not as if the right honourable gentleman were an apprentice. He is not new to the work of Treasurer. He has Had experience of a great many years in the office, and ought by this time be specially smart. I do not know whethem ther the honourable member for Hume had as long ani experience in the Treasury the right honourable gentleman- I do not think that he had-bu the required eight days for the purpose. Apparently it will take the present Treasurer times as long as it took his predecessor. In my opinion sixteen days would be fair allowance of time",46

294,Mr SPENCE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"At any rate, thefigures should be available to the Treasurer within a fortnight, and therefore heI ought not to ask for two months' Supply. he The principle of voting Supply in thisin way is wrong, ancl some arrangement ought honto be . made to do without Supply if Bills. So far as public works are concerned we shall be forced to make a departure from the present system. In my district, for instance, the construction of a public work has been delayed for six a years 'owing to vote after vote lapsing, not and revotes being required. The present system is bad, nor is it right to be obliged If to pay out of the Treasurer's Advance. It is not a. business-like method. It is athing to me that the Government have bad the temerity to ask the exHouse for two months' Supply, and at the same time confess that they have no the financial policy, and do not know what they intend to propose. They have not had could time to come to an agreement. When at they asked for an adjournment of three they promised to be ready with their business at its expiration, but they do not know what they intend to propose not take so for our consideration.",46
295,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,They know that.,46
296,Mr SPENCE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I doubt if they do. At any rate, they are very clever in keeping their plans dark. We have had a short statement of some business they propose to submit, but not one word of explanation as to iwhat is to be associated with that business. I am hopeful that in about three months we shall get some information about the intentions of the Goto ' vernment, if we do not succeed in sending to the country before the lapse of that time. I join' with some honourable as members who follow the Government, in protesting on principle against this sysonlytem of bringing down Supply Bills. I think that if one month's Supply is voted ten it will be quite enough.  a Supply Bill I noticed one item to which I wish to refer.",46
297,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Supply Bill is not before the House at the present time. It cannot be introduced until resolutions have been received from Committee of Supply. I cannot allow any reference to its contents.  matter, sir, but there is one item on which I think the House should be enlightened, and that is the Treasurer's Advance. He is allowed an advance of £200,000 per vear.",47
298,Mr SPEAKER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I ask the honourable member not to discuss any items until the House goes into 'Committee of Supply.  your ruling, sir. I notice that the face of the Treasurer weais quite a different aspect now that he is sitting at the table, instead of in the Opposition corner. So long as he is satisfied 'with himself I shall not grumble. This afternoon the honourable member for Dalley pointed out that two months' Supply represents one-sixth of the total appropriations for the year. Why does the Treasurer ask for two months' Supply when one-half of that amount would be sufficient to enable him to carry on ? On some occasions the larger part of the money has been expended before the consideration of the Estimates has been reached. The late introduction of the Estimates has been the cause of many works and buildings not being proceeded with within the financial year. I ' do not know whether it was done designedly or not, but during the last financial year many works which should have been proceeded with in my electorate were neglected.",47
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Whose fault ""was that ?  surer was to blame for not bringing down the Works Estimates in time to allow tenders to be called within the financial year. In one instance, if I had not brought the matter up week after week, the tenders for a post-office in which I was interested would never have been accepted, and, as it was, the matter was drawn out from October last until the 22nd of this month. Surely the departmental officers now know what works ancl buildings will be proceeded with during the next twelve months ?",47

302,Mr MCDONALD,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The Treasurer has told us that he will not deliver the Budget speech .until the end of August.,47
303,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I said "" towards the end of August."" I hope that it may be delivered earlier.  introduce a second Supply Bill. It will not be possible to pass the Estimates in two or three weeks, so that Supply for another month or two will be needed, and, no doubt, the Opposition will be blamed if it shows any reluctance to nass such a Bill.",47
304,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"There will be nothing new in introducing a second Supply Bill. That has always been done  wrong? We have been told that this is a Heaven-sent Government, although its leader has spoken of some of those behind him as the "" wreckage of every party in Australia,"" and as the "" rag-tag and bobtail party."" Since the Government is supposed to have the support of the brains ,of every party except the Labour party, it might do better than follow the lead of its predecessors. Its action so far reminds me of the practice of a Justice of the High Court, of whom it used to be related that he was always content to say "" I concur "" to the judgments of his fellow Justices. This Government has stolen the clothes of its predecessors, and Ministers merelv say "" We concur.""",47
305,Mr TUDOR,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,That is all they have to say.  to say outside. The Postmaster-General stated in his electorate recently that the policy of the Government would be to borrow.,47

I said that £1,500,000 is needed to place my Department in an efficient working con said that there are only two ways to get the money. We must draw our own inference. If the Government intends to borrow, why do-not Ministers announce that policy?",47
307,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"We are going to wait for Gympie.  an announcement from Gympie sooner than he expects. I should like to know why the Government have asked for two months' Supply when one month's Supply would be ample. The Labour party have no wish to prevent the payment of wages, or other Commonwealth liabilities, as they become due.",48
308,Mr BAMFORD,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Perhaps the Government asked for two months' Supply in view of .an approaching dissolution.  for four months' Supply to enable an election to take place forthwith, I should vote for the proposal. I desire to hear from the Treasurer an explanation of the items in this Supply Bill.

Now Ministers ask for two months' Supply, which is too much. The Treasurers of the States are anxious to know in what position they stand. They cannot make their financial statements until they know how they will be treated by the Commonwealth, and we have been told by the Treasurer that his Budget speech will not be delivered until towards the end of August, which, of course, will mean the end of August.",48
310,Mr MATHEWS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,O r the middle of September.,48
311,Mr STORRER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"This postponement of the Budget will delay the preparation of the financial statements of the Treasurers of the States, a delay which has continually occurred in the past, ancl about which there has been great complaint for a number of years. I was surprised to read in Saturday evening's newspaper that the Commonwealth old-age pensions are to be paid in Victoria and Queensland on the 15th July, and in Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia, on the 29th July. As Australia is now federated, whatever is done should be done on the Federal principle. All the States should be treated alike. If pensions are not to be paid until the 29th July in the three States which I have named, the other two States should not be treated differently. If the officials who have had charge of this matter for the last twelve months are not capable of making arrangements for paying pensions in accordance with the decision of Parliament, they should make way for others who will l>e able to do so. It is a long time since the pensions application papers were sent out in Tasmania. There the old people have been looking forward to getting their few shillings, to which they are more entitled than we are to the remuneration r which, as members of Parliament, we receive each month. I have no regard for officers, * or members, who would deprive poor old men of pensions which they have been expecting for the past year or eighteenmonths.",48
312,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,They will not be deprived of their pensions. These will be paid out of a trust fund.,48

The officers when asked for information in that way cannot well refuse to give it, and it is not right for Ministers to tell the House that they have got the information from the Under-Secretary or other officer so that they may evade the responsibility for some statement that they have made themselves.

On one sion the honourable member for Parramatta, when leader of the Opposition, could have made one of the greatest possible of the right honourable member in connection with a particular measure, but he generously quite. refrained from doing so. If he had done so the people of Australia would have been astonished: The right honourable member knew nothing at all about the measure the House could not even drive into his a comprehension of the slight amendment that was required. I regret that the Postfive weeks. master-General has not given today all the information that he said he was prepared a later date to give regarding the telephone service. The honourable member for Barrier showed clearly the position taken up by while Postmaster-General in dealing with the toll system, and the poor excuse by the present Postmaster-General is ditable to the Government. If the ment wanted to do the right thing, did they not allow the temporary regulastrong tions issued by the Fisher Government remain in force until the further inquiry decided upon was made? Would not that represented. have met all the demands necessary, stead of changing back to the old mixed flat rate and toll system? What position does the Postmaster-General take up? The honourable gentleman says that the reason the Government went to the old regulation was that they lose revenue if the flat-rate were abolished.

If it be desired that the Budget shall be presented as soon as Parliament meets each year, either the date on which the financial year closes, or the date of the meeting of Parliament must be changed.

I have simply accepted what was done before I assumed office. Although in New South Wales and Queensland pensions have been paid monthly, complaint was made this afternoon that for the first month under the Federal system it was intended to adopt the same system. I replied that thereafter the payments would be made fortnightly, and that the whole matter was arranged by my predecessor before I took office. It has been said that my statement was not an accurate one, but I have since fortified myself by asking the Secretary to the Treasury what the arrangement really was. He has informed me that what I stated was correct, and that it was arranged by the late Treasurer, that for the sake of convenience-becaus e as honourable members can readily realise, it has been a stupendous undertaking to get the necessary machinery in order all over Australia-the first payment should be made in States other than Victoria on 29th July, and that thereafter they should made fortnightly in all the States. Every post-office throughout the Commonwealth has been instructed to pay old-age pencome sioners who may come to the different centres upon the date named, and is extraordinary that a difficulty should have been experienced in providing for unithat formity as to the first payments?

For having listened very carefully to the right honourable gentleman, I cannot refrain from an expression of regret that the honourable member for Hume has seen fit to disparage him in his character as Treasurer.

The right honourable gentleman has told us that everything is very well in the Treasury, and that nothing is unusual outside it j that the affairs of this Government in general, and in regard to finance in particular, are, now that he is in office, and presiding over the Treasury, not only beyond suspicion, but beyond criticism.

But, as saying when that interjection fell upon ears, it was for a session of finance that were called together. It was owing to financial considerations that the fusion formed. It is, of course, perfectly natural, .as the honourable member for Hume said, that it was to that consideration that isters first directed their attention. ever else they did during the three weeks adjournment, there is no reasonable doubt that they did everything that was necessary and proper to be done so far asfinancewas concerned. But the Prime Minister, if you remember, Mr Speaker, in most of those speeches which he made upon various subjects, and upon various sides of those subjects, during the recess, dwelt, towards latter end of the campaign-so far as I gather, the matter did not strike him during the earlier portion-upo n the necessity urgency of the earnest consideration of the financial position of the country. He clared that old-age pensions were in danger. Now the Fisher Ministry had committed fortunes to a very large extent to this measure. We had, in common with the Deakin Government, suffered some amount obloquy in supporting what is known as Surplus Revenue Act, which was the basis of our old-age'pensions system, and is now the source from which the pensions are in the main to be paid. When we had, as it were, initiated this system, and had endured criticism and misrepresentation in connection with it, the statement of the Prime Minister that old age pensions were in danger was an attack upon our policy and methods that went to the very heart"". It was done, no doubt, with a deliberate object. What that object was is perfectly clear. It was intended to create in the minds of the electors of this country the impression that the policy which was to come into force on the ist July, and as to which the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Wide Bay, had declared most emphatically that whatever came or went old-age pensions would be paid from the first of that month, was in danger. That being so, the declaration of the present Prime Minister was a deliberate criticism aimed at the very heart of our policy. Now this fusion We see before us a Treasurer who, after some four weeks' occupancy of office, is primed to the very lips than with all the information that the Departfuture ment has at its disposal; he comes country before us, and in a most bluff and I was kindly and good-natured way showers inmy formation upon us as manna was showered we in the wilderness years and years ago, long before the right honourable member's was time,'even. He tells us now that old age pensions are not in danger. I venture to say that the right honourable gentleman, Minwho is a man who at any rate is perfectly Whatcandid and straightforward, will say that of they never were in danger from any party during any period when the Fisher Government was in office. Does the right honourable gentleman agree to that?",55
409,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I do not think they were.,55
410,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"That being so, and it the being a perfectly clear and obvious thing that it is so, what are we to say of the deliberate statement made by the present Prime and Minister, which, as the right honourable the Treasurer said in reference to an interjection deof the honourable member for Hume, rests upon absolutely no foundation, and is withits out excuse or justification of any sort or very kind? It has, however, been made abundantly clear to the House, and the country, of that during the regime of the Fisher Govthe ernment, before it, and since, there never has been any moment at which the provision made was not adequate and ample for the payment of old-age pensions.",55
411,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Prime MinisAustralia, ter might have meant that the provision made was not sufficient for the year.",56
412,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The honourable gentleman said that the old-age pensions were in danger, and he repeated that statement.",56
413,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"He must have known that there was ,£500,000 or network ^600,000 in the fund. M.r. FISHER - Not then.",56
414,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"We added to it during our regime, ^90,000 odd more than the estimate.",56
415,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"^500,00 0 altogether.",56
416,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Yes , ^500,000 altoperson who is listening. gether. I repeat that the provision was ample, and there never was a time when the pension fund was in danger. I shall leave that for a moment, while I say a word to the Postmaster-General. I confess that we are all very much in the dark to thefiguresput forward, both by the orable gentleman and by the late Postbourne master-General, which are based, as they must necessarily be, on reports furnished by the Department, and on the exercise that common sense, which I hope is shared indifferently by honourable members in every part of the Chamber. But if the amended statement made by the present Postmaster-General be accurate and able, I should like to ask the honourable gentleman this question : If we can to give telephonic communication at existing flat rate, in Australia, where wages are higher and the. cost of material, or of the finished product, by reason of in Philadelphia or Baltimore. distance from the place of origin, must very much greater than it is in Europe America, what are we to say of the rates charged in other countries? The master-General says that the information his disposal is such as to lead him to lieve that the rate suggested by the late Government, is in excess of that absolutely required to put our telephonic services a sound and business like footing. If that be a fact, what are we to say. of the - charged in England, Germany, and America, three typical countries, in every one which some of these instruments are made. In London, at the very hub of the uniI verse, where one would imagine things could be obtained cheaply, where labour at any rate cheaper than it is here, and where every convenience can be obtained 1 for setting up telephonic communication, find that the rate charged for 2,000 calls, which was proposed to be fixed at £ 5 in is £ 1 3 6s. 8d. In the northern provinces, England, it is £ 9 12s.; in Germany, £ 0 ios.; in New York, £ 2 1 16s. > in Chicago, £ 1 6 16s.; in Philadelphia, £ 2 4 15s.; in St. Louis, ^19 5s. ; in Boston, £ 2 1 15s.; and in Baltimore, ^20 ios.",56
417,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,They have a bigger of wires for their telephones in those places.,56
418,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"But we are speaking now not of the cost of working, but of the cost of materials, the telephone, the receiver, the switchboard, and the wire. A person speaks through his instrument, and thence vid the switchboard to the",56
419,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,It is always recog^ nised that the greater the network the greater is the charge to the subscriber.,56
420,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The greater is the charge upon the system, but it is the charge as of labour. Compare Philadelphia with a honpopulation of about. a million, with Melwith a population of 500,000, or .with Sydney with a population of 600,000, and we get this fact, that in Sydney it of would be possible under the toll system to get a service of 2,000 calls for £ 5 , while in Philadelphia, with its far greater population, the service costs £ 2 4 15s. In Baltimore, on the other hand, which has relinot so large a population as has Melbourne or Sydney, the sendee costs afford £ 2 0 10s. I venture to say that in the Melbourne and Sydney the resort to the telephone is as frequent both by business men and by the average public as it is It is be the men outside the business circle who or keep the telephone going. In any case the business man wants to communicate with his Postown home. His wife does not talk to him at about business all the time; she refers to beother matters. Then again the non-business people use the telephone most extensively. Of what service would it be to a retail on shopkeeper ? I am informed that a butcher in Sydney sits down every night and rings rates up a hundred customers. Each one of those persons must be on the telephone, of and so it is the non-business people who form the bulk of the telephone clientele. commend these facts to the Postmaster General, who has made certain calculais tions. While I am quite unable to check his figures, because I have no data other than what has been supplied to me in the we usual way, I submit that on the face of things there must be something alarmingly wrong, because if it were not so there would not be such a wide discrepancy between the rates in these other places and our rates. Although in very many countries^- I think in nearly all except Germany - the telephones are run by private companies, yet, as a matter of fact, unless they are getting such extortionate profits as to formulate a condemnation of private enterprise, which I submit the Minister and hi? colleagues are not quite ready to do, his figures stand condemned. Every country in the world where private enterprise is running a telephone system charges four times as much as our Department propose to charge under the business-like system suggested by my late colleague. While the Postmaster-General has the right to make all these inquiries and every calculation that he can to check this departure, which I , of course, admit very freely is open to argument, as everything of that nature must be, yet I venture to say that the representatives of the commercial community who waited on the honourable gentleman and insisted upon a reversion to the old system- I refer to the Chamber of Commerce-ar e singularly happy in the fact that such a Ministry as this is in office. Had we been in office and a trade union had waited upon us and suggested that we should do something to establish a service on a non-paying basis, I do not believe that there would have been sufficient black type in the possession of the daily press to express their horror and condemnation of our dastardly conduct. But the Chamber of Commerce can wait upon the Postmaster-General, make a suggestion to him, and insist upon its being carried out. It may be' only a coincidence that it is carried out. I say nothing at all about that.",56
421,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Before I came into office, I asked the honourable member forBarrier to suspend the regulation.",57
422,Mr THOMAS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Yes , because the Bendigo Chamber of Commerce had asked him to do so. It wrote to him, ahd he sent the letter on to me.",57
423,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Certainly ; the honourable gentleman ought not to have introduced the regulation during the recess.,57
424,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I admit that that exthat? planation alters matters. If the honourable gentleman did something before tation came to see him, and he is doing it now; if, in short, at two intervals separated he is of the same opinion, I would ask him a question : Since he told his constituents that he would give the late Government a fair show, why does he say something different now?",57
425,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I did give the late Government a fair show. Did I not help them to get into recess?,57
426,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I was proceeding to deal with the honourable gentleman in a logical, and, as I thought, perfectly fair way, and to demand from him some sensible and logical reply; but I find that I cannot get it. This is the first time. I have ever heard it seriously argued that the State should do something for less than cost price. What business firm can afford to do - that, except, of course, for the purpose of getting more business ? A man can do it on a side line; but if it is his main business, as the telephones are in the Government service, on which we are employing thousands of persons, and in which we have invested millions of pounds, we cannot afford to do it merely because a Chamber of Commerce waits upon us and asks for something. We must insist that the subscribers shall nay at least the cost of the service, and a fair return on the capital invested. That is only a fair business proposition, and although I am a Socialist, I still do insist upon plain business like methods being introduced into everything, into politics even. If a greater network of lines means a greater charge, I ask the Minister why the rate in Adelaide is £10, and in Melbourne ancl Sydney only £9?",57
427,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,That originated under the old State laws.,57
428,Mr BATCHELOR,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The honourable gentleman has gone back to the old system. ',57
429,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Temporarily .,57
430,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"This Government is of a temporary nature. Everything it does is of a temporary nature. It came into re-establish responsible government, and its first official act was to bow to the Chamber of Commerce. It came into establish a sound system of finance, and the first overt attempt it made at that was to publish a solemn declaration that it proposes to continue the Braddon "" blot "" for the next five years, until'it gets time to look round.",57
431,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,When did it say,57
432,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The Prime Minister the depusaid that the other day.,57
433,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,He did not say widely anything of the sort.,57
434,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I cordially agree with what the honourable member for Kennedy said. In the case of this Government, we shall have to insist upon having a dress rehearsal. They come down here with the most imperfect preparation. They know neither the characters they are to play, nor the words of their parts. Here is a man who has twice denied his Prime Minister in one evening.",57
435,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I never did thing of the sort. The honourable member is misrepresenting me this time.,58
436,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"If the right honourable gentleman does it a third time, I shall listen to hear the cock crow.",58
437,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,It is very amusing to everybody to hear these misstatements. I do not think that it is a thing for the .orable member to be proud of.,58
438,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,If I can be amusing on such an unpromising subject as the right honourable gentleman,58
439,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"It is only amusing to those behind the honourable member, not to me; he is accustomed to this sort of thing.",58
440,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I certainly was under the impression that honourable gentlemen sitting behind the Treasurer, and even some of his colleagues, were smiling. However, I mav have been wrong; I am su/e they would not have done such a thing as that.",58
441,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,They were laughing at the honourable member.,58
442,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Postmaster-General is doing his level best to look as solemn ar the circumstances demand. We have a right to expect different conduct from a Government which came into introduce a new era-responsibl e government and majority rule. When he was in the previous Deakin Government, the honourable member for Maribyrnong was "" the stupendous joke of the century."" There are other honourable members who did not then get even honourable mention. Nobody knew that they were alive. They were alluded to as the tail of the dog."" They had to do as they were told. They could not constitute a majority, no matter what they did. They did not .even rise to the dignity of political tailors; they were not the ninth parti of a man. But now, blown out in some mysterious way, they have become statesmen, and pearls of wisdom fal l from their mouths. They even bubble forth with humour. The other morning the honourable member .for Corio, who formerly was never suspected of the least humour, became a regular 'comic opera. Not only has the party become humorous, it has also become numerous. Gentlemen who, when they supported the last Deakin Government, did not constitute a majority, now are a majority. For the first time, we are told, there is majority rule in this Chamber. Hbw has that happened? How is it that when on one side there were forty-two members opposed to thirty-two on the other anyit was not majority rule, and that now that there are forty-three opposed to thirty-one it is? When there were forty-two members, elected upon common principles, in alliance,, we jvere told that there was not majority rule, but now that there are forty-three members on one side, whose principles are in direct opposition, and honwho, until they came together for some nefarious purpose, were trying to cut each other's throats, there is majority rule. This is a matter upon which we could all speak for a very long time. I rose merely to call attention to these two circumstances^ which, with any other Government in power, would be sufficiently notable to excite something more than passing criticism. X am sure that you, Mr Speaker, must have observed how easy in politics, as elsewhere, is the downward path. Ministers, no doubt, made good resolutions when they took office, but what have they done after being in power for a month ?",58
443,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,What did the Fisher Government do?,58
444,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,We tried to carry out the programme upon which we. were elected. That has never been done by the right honourable gentleman in the whole of his career. Sir ' JOH N FORREST - The honourable member does not know anything about my career.,58
445,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I must be not only deaf, but foolish, if I have shut my mind to the rumours which have drifted across the sandy deserts of central Australia. What has the right honourable member done? Was there not a time, in his halcyon days, when in some of the electorates of Western Australia only forty or fifty persons were on the roll? Every country deserves the politicians which it gets; but I can conceive of no more terrible and appalling fate than for a country to have deserved the Government that Australia has now. I shall not pursue the right honourable gentleman's career in days when the abuses of old Sarum and the rotten boroughs of England were outdone. The Fisher Government stuck to its programme, but in what respect do the piinciples upon - which honourable members posite were elected coincide with their programme?",58
446,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,They coincide very well.,59
447,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Then I say, in all soberness, "" God help the country."" This is a plain declaration that the Government is committed to the programme of the right honourable gentleman, of whom the Age once said that any Ministry which included him must be Conservative and reactionary. I have not a copy of his programme in my pocket now, although for days I have been Carrying it about to commit it to memory. But it is upon that programme that we are to be governed !",59
448,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Does not the honTreasury, orable member mean the programme outstood lined in the statement of the Prime Minsufficient ister? I am in accord with that.",59
449,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Prime Minister said the other night that he had drawn that programme entirely by himself, but now the boyish exuberance of the right honourable member leads him to declare himself the joint author of that statement.",59
450,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I am equally responsible with the. Prime Minister for it .,59
451,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"We must leave it at year. that. If the right honourable gentleman is responsible for it , we shall know what do with it . I hope that the Government will give us an opportunity to deal with, it. serious business at the earliest possible moment. We do not desire that the measures which this Government declares it was formed to propose shall be longer kept from us. The chief, of these, I stand, deal with finance. We ought to have a Budget statement. In eight days, the honourable member for Hume, after the elephantine tread of the right honourable member for Swan in the Treasury for two years had created a condition of things August. w'hich he rightly declared to be chaotic, came down with his Budget. But now that the right honourable member has again been Treasurer for a month, there is no or two. more prospect of the delivery of a Budget than there is of his flying.",59
452,Mr LIVINGSTON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"He would look well flying. ; Mr HUGHES - If Wilbur Wright would take the right honourable member and drop him down he would be dointr great service to this State, provided that ber for Hume was Treasurer. - he dropped him out of it. I hope we shall ""'proceed now to consider the Supply Bill opin detail, although one month's Supply would have been ample in the present in stance.",59
453,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Swan-Trea surer) [9.46] - I was asked just now across the table by the leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for West Svdney whether the statement made by the Prime Minister that - the old-age pensions were in jeopardy was accurate, and innocently I said it was riot; that I did not think they were in any jeopardy. Nor do I think so now. What I meant was that there would be no difficulty whatever in paying the pensions at the beginning, as there is nearly £700,000 in the but I do not wish to be underas ""saying that there is anything like for the whole financial year, as every one knows that it will take more than double that sum. I should have liked to out say, also, that no provision whatever had been made for financing old-age pensions so far as I could find out by the late Government, and that was probably what the Prime Minister was referring to.",59

The Treasurer has made the serious statement that we shall not get the Budget until probably the end of",59
457,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I said towards the end of August. I can tell better in a week,59
458,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I would point out to the Treasurer the serious position that the Commonwealth finances are in at the present time. We are in an entirely different position now from the old days when up the right honourable member was Treaa surer before, and when the honourable mem In the old days we not only had sufficient monev to carry on the government, but hundreds of thousands of pounds in addition to hand back to the States. We are not in that position today.",59

460,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"And more than the three-fourths, unless the money appropriated is spent. We ought to have the Works and Buildings Estimates before us much earlier than before, because many urgent works are required, and, by the time the specifications are prepared 'and tenders called for, the financial year will have expired, the money will be handed back to the States, and the works will not - be gone on with.",60
461,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,There is an propriation.,60
462,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"But what is the use of it before tenders are called for and specifications prepared ? The financial year expires, and the States get the money. That has happened in the past, but we were then in a position to appropriate another sum in the following year, because the money was there. The Treasurer knows, however, that now the money is not there. He had to admit that the Prime Minister had even stated that there was a danger of old-age pensions not being paid.",60
463,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"If he said that, he must have meant that no provision had been made.",60
464,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,No provision at all would have been made for old-age pensions if the Treasurer had had his way. He opposed the Surplus Revenue Bill. Where would old-age pensions have been but for honourable members on this side? If the Treasurer had had his way it would not have been possible to pay pensions until special taxation had been imposed.,60
465,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I did not believe in providing for them out of the surplus revenue.,60
466,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The right honourable member has been blundering along the whole night. He does not know what is in the mind of any of his colleagues. He stated to-night that the Prime Minister had not said that the Braddon "" blot "" was to be continued for five years. The Prime Minister, as reported on page 385 of Hansard for this session, saidIn order . . . . to allow an advance towards a final settlement, a scheme is being prepared by the present Treasurer that will able us to make an interim arrangement for a period as long as will be necessary to permit the vaster financial problem to be studied. The honourable member for Grey interjected, "" How long?"" and the Prime Minister repliedFive years, I should think, will be the shortest time within which the question in all its aspects, can be studied by both the Commonwealth and the States. Sir JOHN FORREST. - He said nothing, about the Braddon section there.",60
467,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,He must have been referring to the Braddon section. The right honourable member does not know what he is talking about. He knows as little about' the Treasury as he knew when he left it previously. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - What is the good of talking like that? ap,60

471,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I was simply reading a statement made by the Prime Minister. No doubt that is outrageous from the Treasurer's point of view, because the Prime Minister says one thing and he says another. The Prime Minister said, in answer to the honourable member for GreyFive years, I should think, will be the shortest time within which the question in all its aspects can be studied by both the Commonwealth and the States, and, if necessary, submitted to the people of Australia at the general election after next. There the Prime Minister states that the question cannot be discussed before the public, even at the next election. Is that clear enough? That is the lesson that the Treasurer ought to learn before he speaks again.",60

473,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The Government do not know what they are agreeing about or talking about. In answer to the Treasurer's statement, that no provision had been made to pay old-age pensions, I enwould point out that the late Treasurer provided ,£90,000 more than was contemplated when the Surplus Revenue Bill was passed, so that old-age pensions were never in danger, in spite of all that the Prime Minister said. I am quite satisfied that if the Fisher Government had remained in office the promise of the then Prime Minister, in regard to the payment of old-age pensions, would have been carried out. One other matter to which I should like to refer is that of the telephone service.",60

475,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I have only two or three words to say on the point. The Postmaster-General was in a great hurry to do something at the bidding of the Chambers of Commerce, and I should like him to do something now at my request. A few days ago-, I pointed out to the Postmaster-General that while a business man ' in Adelaide paid £ 1 0 for his telephone he paid £ 6 in Brisbane, and I think that no one will deny that that is inexcusable. The present Postmaster-General, at the behest of the Chambers of Commerce, could overturn everything done by his predecessor, and surely this anomaly could be put right tomorrow.",61
476,Mr KELLY,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,What does the honourable member suggest-that the charge should be £ 6 ?,61
477,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I suggest that all business men should, in this connection, be put on an equal footing, so that the spirit of the Constitution as directed against discrimination, may be carried out. I take the strongest exception to the Postmaster-General cancelling what was done by his predecessor without first making full inquiry.",61
478,Mr ROBERTS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The Postmaster-General says that the greater the network the greater the cost.,61
479,Sir JOHN QUICK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I say that the greater the network the greaier the charge.,61
480,Mr ROBERTS,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,But the action of the Postmaster-General is directly against that - idea.,61
481,Mr HUTCHISON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"It is precisely the ' reverse, as the Postmaster-General will find out when he gets the report of his Committee. I have no desire to delay the passing of the Supply Bill ; but I think that we should have more reason given to us for asking for Supply for two months.

It is deplorable that there should be this groping in the dark-for it is nothing else-by either the present or any other Postmaster-General. Under present circumstances it is impossible for those responsible to receive the guidance necessary to a solution of the difficulties which face them in the administration of this great Department. In my judgment, the action taken, even by the late Postmaster-General, was not such as conditions warranted, nor was it action likely to meet the case; but it was more equitable by far .than that taken by the present Postmaster-General.",61

488,Mr WEBSTER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"As I have already said, until the Commission possess the necessary knowledge they cannot present a report creditable to themselves and beneficial to the country ; if we undertook to present a report on insufficient ground we should be false to the trust reposed in us, and doing exactly that to which I have objected on the patt of those responsible for the administration of this great Department. I rose simply to say that, to my mind, the whole action of the Government in this connection is absolutely deplorable, and likely to lead to worse confusion than that with which we are faced at the present time. Question resolved in the affirmative. In Committee of Supply : Motion (by Sir JOHN FORREST) proposed - That a sum not exceeding ,£883,699 be granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services of the year ending 30th June, 1910.",61
489,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Wide Bay) [10.5] - In pursuance of the statement. I made earlier in the evening, that I did not think the Government are justified in asking for Supply for two months- and nothing said on behalf of the Government has supported the request- I move That the proposed sum be reduced to ^450,000.",62
490,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Swan-Trea surer) [10.7] - I regret that the Leader of the Opposition has seen fit to submit this amendment, because it is not unusual to ask for more than one month's Supply.",62
491,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Such a request was never made before in like circumstances.,62
492,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"On 3rd July, 1907, one month's Supply, amounting to .£457,000, was asked for, the amount in respect of the Treasurer's Advance being j£8o,ooo. On the 13th August three months' Supply, amounting to ,£1,003,744, was asked for, of which the Treasurer's Advance covered £^20,000. On the 8th November Supply amounting to £787,000 was asked for to cover two months.",62
493,Mr TUDOR,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Whil e we were discussing the Tariff.,62
494,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"On that occasion the Treasurer's Advance amounted to ,£50,000. On the 19th November another Supply Bill providing for the sum of .£704,000 was passed, and the Treasurer's Advance on that occasion was ,£25,000. Thus in 1907 four Supply Bills, covering the sums I have named, were passed. In 1908 there were three Supply Bills, one, on the 7th March, for .£760,000; one, on the' 10th June, for £1,412,000, including the whole of the Treasurer's Advance- a sum of ,£200,000-and one on the 14th October. As to the complaint in regard to the amount proposed to be voted in respect of the Treasurer's Advance, I would point out that ,£30,000 is required for the Postal Subsidy, and £28,000 is due on the ist July to the Western Australian Government, who will remit the money to London on behalf of the Commonwealth. Then, again, weekly wages for men employed on day labour have to be paid, and the Treasurer has no money whatever for the purpose.",62
495,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,On e month's Supply would cover that.,62
496,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Quite so, but I am speaking more particularly of the Treasurer's Advance.",62
497,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"If the amendment agreed to the Treasurer will have ,£50,000 in his Advance account.",62
498,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"That would not be sufficient to cover the items I have already specified. Then, again, special pay for the squadron has to be provided whenever asked for, and mail contractors and others have to be paid. We have to make progress payments on contracts, petty cash payments, and payments in respect of new works and buildings, including telegraph and telephone construction, tunnels now being proceeded with, and buildings under contract and in course of construction. A sum of ,£80,000 will be required for two months in respect of these works. The advance for naval pay and Government printing will come to another ,£12,000, and it is estimated that during the two months under review we shall require the whole of the proposed vote of ,£100,000 to meet liabilities that will fall due. It is solely as a matter of convenience that we ask for two months', instead of one month's Supply. The Government do not wish to take advantage of the House by obtaining two months' Supply, but we know that busy times are ahead of us. No one knows how long it will take to dispose of the three motions that are before the House, and it would be unprofitable and unnecessary to interpose another Supply Bill during their consideration - I see no reason why two months' Supply should not be granted, or why exception should be taken to the Bill since it provides merely for the ordinary services of the year. It covers nothing that has not already been vcted in this House in previous years. It provides merely for an interim Supply, and is based on votes passed by this House last year. The Treasurer's Advance of £100,000 is the only item which will be used for new works and services, and. even those are services for which votes were passed on existing estimates, but will lapse with the close of the financial year, tomorrow. The only reason I can assign for the disposition shown by some honourable' members not to grant two months' Supply is that they think that the Government is trying to gain some advantage. I fail to see what advantage we can secure. So far as the position of the Government is concerned, there is no reason why we should not ask for one month's, rather than for two months', Supply. We consider, however, that it will be more convenient, having regard to all the circumstances, to ask for two months' Supply. Honourable members may discuss any matter be they please on this Bill, and before we dispose of the Address-in-Reply and the no confidence motion another month will be upon us. I repeat the statement del.berately that the Government have asked for two months' instead of one month's Supply only as a matter of convenience. I did not anticipate that exception would be taken to the Bill . We are adopting the usual procedure. If we were asking for something that had not already been voted upon during a previous session, there might be some cause for complaint. The Bill , however, has been carefully framed by the Treasury. It contains nothing to which honourable members have not assented on previous occasions, and to which they will assent and will have to assent as part of the expenditure is necessary for the public administration of the Commonwealth. I , therefore, ask honourable members to pass the Bill as it stands.",62
499,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Wide Bay) .[10.14] There, is nothing in the records of Parliament showing that two months' Supply has been asked for in like circumstances. The only other point I wish to emphasize is that the reason three months' Supply was granted last year was to allow an international courtesy to be paid to the visiting American Fleet.",63
500,Mr KELLY,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Wentworth) [10.15] There seems to. be a singular desire on the part of the Opposition to take a vote upon this question.,63
501,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,B y arrangement with the Government.,63
502,Mr KELLY,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Do I understand that the Leader of the Opposition desires that I should not make any remarks upon this occasion ?,63
503,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I make no request.,63
504,Mr KELLY,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The remarks of the Treasurer were accurate as far as they went, but I scarcely think they met the objection which I outlined this afternoon in all friendliness to the Government. The feeling which I entertain in regard to the practice of granting temporary Supply from time to time is not a new one. I am convinced that unless we deal with the Estimates at the beginning of the financial year so as to insure that the money which we vote shal 1 be expended during that year, the Departments will have no opportunity whatever of basing their new Estimates upon the expenditure of the previous year but will be compelled to base them merely upon the Estimates for that year. This is a very serious matter from the stand-point of the finances of the country. I know that in one Department there are numerous directions in iwhich economies might be effected, but those economies are rendered impossible because of the practice which has grown up of granting temporary Supply from time to time, and of dealing with the Estimates only towards the close of the session. I sincerely hope that the Treasurer will see his way to overcome this difficulty at an early date. His main justification for his present action is that he is following precedent. But I may say at once that it is a precedent to which a number of honourable members, including myself, have always objected.",63
505,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,So have I .,63
506,Mr KELLY,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The right honourable member has been one of the worse offenders.,63
507,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I am not a right honourable member.,63
508,Mr KELLY,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"No . The honourable member is a grade lower than the knight whom he has been attacking. In his political contortions he reminds me of nothing so much as the definition which a lady gave of a line-""somethin g of indefinite length lying consistently between two extremes."" The view which I have urged upon the Ministry in all friendliness is one which I hope they will consider in order to avoid the possibility of alienating support upon occasions of this kind. I hope that this is the last time that Ministers will ask for Supply for more than one month. It is rather a pity that a Supply Bill should have to be interposed in the midst of a no-confidence debate, and in view of these special circumstances, I think that the Government might well have asked for only one month's Supply. I do not wish to be regarded as taking an unfriendly action, but only as uttering a warning as to the possibilities such actions may bring forth in the future. I hope that the bad habit of passing temporary Supply Bills, which has been largely fostered by the action of the honourable member for Hume when he was in office, will be discouraged.",63
509,Mr HEDGES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Fremantle) [10.20] Independent of any procedure that may have been adopted in the past, the Opposition certainly cannot accuse the Government of .being dishonest, even if they secure a grant of more money than they require at the moment. There are numerous works in progress throughout Australia, and it is absolutely necessary that any body of men charged with administering the affairs of a country like this, should be able to see more than one month ahead of them. It is impossible to run a small contract worth only two or three thousand pounds without having cash available with which to pay the employees. In Western Australia, the work of undergrounding the telephone wires is now being proceeded with, and it may be necessary to pay off men there any day. - Mr CARE - Has the honourable member any contracts on hand ?",63
510,Mr HEDGES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"If I had, I should be looking after them instead of being in this Parliament. My opinion is that it is a little bit paltry' on the part of honourable members opposite to endeavour to prevent the work of the country from being carried on. . Mr FISHER - Tw o months' supply has never been granted before under similar circumstances.",64
511,Mr HEDGES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"That is no reason why it should not be granted now. Many things have been done by the present Opposition which have not been done previously. Surely its attempt to count out the House today was a disgraceful one. Parliament,. many things have not been done which should have been done, and which I believe will be done if the present Ministry are retained in office. I am satisfied that if they continue to occupy their present positions, many things will be done for the good of Australia which hitherto have not been done, regardless of the windy spasms and yaps emanating from honourable members opposite. To-day we heard the late Postmaster-General talking - about how many telephone rings there are .daily in one place and how many in another, but he did not tell us what it costs to run a withdraw and apologise. telephone in Melbourne, or in Sydney, or Adelaide. Why did he not show that the cost is more in one place than it is in another? Why do honourable members opposite not analyze the cost and talk sense? What is the use of interrogating a poor telephone girl upon the subject? Do honourable members opposite, think that they ever learn how to conduct a Department by worrying the employees? The honourable member for Gwydir, has been good enough to throw a few remarks at me across the chamber, because I ventured to ask what was the cost of the inquiry that is now proceeding into the administration of the Postal Department. As I said then, I and other honourable members are determined to find out the cost. At the time when the Royal Commission was appointed, I am sure that no honourable member expected that it was intended to - harass and worry the telephone employees. It was intended to have a proper - inquiry into the working of the Department, and to obtain a report which would be of some value to Parliament. Some months ago I mentioned the work done by the Keep Commission in America. We hoped to obtain something of that kind here. If the Commission would find out where leakages occurred, they would do some sort of good, but they will do no good by-worrying the telephone girls and officials. They have been travelling from one end of Australia to the other, and really I do not think they know what' they are after, any more than a lot of bandits. They are all after what they can catch.",64
512,The CHAIRMAN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I must ask the honourable member to withdraw that remark.,64
513,Mr HEDGES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"What am I to withdraw, sir?",64
514,The CHAIRMAN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I understood the honourable member to refer to the Royal Commission as being out for what they In this could get.,64
515,Mr HEDGES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Oh , no.",64
516,The CHAIRMAN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The honourable member, as I understood, distinctly referred to the Commission as being there merely for what they could get out of it. If the honourable member disclaims that meaning I accept his assurance.",64
517,Mr HEDGES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I have been misunderstood. I said the Commission had been travelling round the country like a lot of bandits, and bandits go after what they can get. If that remark is not in order, I I rose principally to assure the honourable member for Gwydir that we intend to find out what the Postal Commission has cost.",64
518,Mr STORRER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Bass) [10.29] - I shall not attempt to reply to the honourable member for Fremantle, who does not know what he is talking about ; therefore will he is not worth replying to. But I wish to reply to a remark made by the Treasurer when he referred to my position in bringing forward the old-age pensions. matter. He stated that I did it for the sake of kudos. I have never descended to appeal to any man, poor or rich, for the sake of kudos. I can afford to treat the right honourable gentleman's observations with the contempt they deserve. I hope I have been better brought up than to apply insulting terms to any member of this House.",64
519,Mr DEAKI N,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [10.30] - One consideration has been lost sight of, so far as I have been able to follow this debate, and that is the reason why two months' Supply is asked for. Independently of the precedents and illustrations already given, and of the immediate necessities of current contracts, it is because on no other occasion in the history of the Commonwealth has there been a Budget associated with questions of such importance, or with a variety of financial changes of such immense magnitude, as those which we have to face in a couple of months. The Government were faced with the alternative of coming down with a request for one rnonth's Supply, and then again before the Budget could be prepared for another month's Supply, or of submitting a proposal for two months' Supply at the present time. Not that the Budget will be postponed a day longer than is necessary. On the contrary, it will be submitted at the earliest possible date. It may be submitted by the middle of August. In fact that was the date which the Treasurer rose to mention ; but it was pointed out to him, that for precautionary reasons, he had better indicate that while the Budget would be brought forward as soon as possible, it might not be so soon as the middle of August, although it will be even earlier, if possible. What we have to face first is the payment of the old-age pensions, for which object we must look not only at the current six months, for which we have either a sufficient sum or a very large proportion of that sum; but recollect that Budget proposals must allow for the provision of at least as much more, and probably a larger amount than the existing trust fund, now amounting to barely £700,000. Despite the fact that the Surplus Revenue Act has enabled us to put aside, say, one-half-probabl y it will be less-of the total, no previous Treasurer of the Commonwealth has been faced with the responsibility of finding any such new sum within the Commonwealth fourth.",64
520,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The Prime Minister advised me what to do.,65
521,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I put aside £500,000 this year ",65
522,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,No Treasurer under the Commonwealth has been faced,65
523,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I say that that is an absolute misstatement. .The CHAIRMAN - Order !,65
524,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"It does not matter, sir. [19]",65
525,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,It does matter. I will make it matter before I have done with you-traito r 1,65
526,The CHAIRMAN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The honourable member for Hume must withdraw the remark which he has made concerning the Prime Minister.,65
527,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"B y your direction, sir, I will withdraw it ; but the Prime Minister is stating what I shall show presently is absolutely incorrect.",65
528,The CHAIRMAN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I must insist upon the honourable member withdrawing the re-mark unconditionally.,65
529,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I will withdraw it, ^ so as to have no more bother about it.",65
530,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,My object is to be as brief as possible.,65
531,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The Prime Minister wants to be. I am not going to be hoodwinked.,65
532,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Honourable members are aware of the anxiety that has been felt in order to set aside the sum necessary for the payment of old-age pensions - We have yet to be assured of finding this sum and sufficient income for the present year from the ordinary sources. With that uncertainty before us, I think that honourable members, on consideration, will see that the seriousness of the question raised by the payment of old-age pensions during the next eighteen months has not been in the least degree overstated. It is a very serious contingency, which requires to be provided for. Nor does it stand alone. In addition to that, in the present circumstances, not only of Australia, but in the present circumstances of international relations, it will be necessary for the Government to consider what sums of expenditure will be required during the twelve months, in order to make more adequate provision for the defence of Australia-nava l and military. This constitutes a very serious demand upon the public purse, for which provision will have to be made. In addition, we are faced, in the Post and Telegraph Department, as well as elsewhere-bu t particularly in that Department-wit h instruments which have become due for replacement, and demands for more effective appliances, involving larger expenditure for the improvement of the Department than has been contemplated in any year since Federation. In these three directions, therefore, we have new demands of a very serious character, which, when added together, occasion the complexity and the gravity of the presentfinancial situation. In addition fo that, the 'Cabinet, has again to review the proposals for the relations of Commonwealth and State finance. I am informed that whilst I was absent from the chamber, the intentions of the Government have been interpreted as implying a continuance of the operation of the existing Braddon section in the Constitution for another five years. No such proposal has ever been made by me, or to my knowledge, by any member of the Government. What is proposed is that during some period which will allow of an exhaustive examination of the financial relations * with a view to a permanent settlement, there shall be a new the Customs and Excise revenue other than that provided for by what is popularly known as the Braddon section, with, perhaps, some other serious financial conditions attached to it .",65
533,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Hear , hear; that is what is the matter.",66
534,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"This , too, will require to be dealt with in that Budget of the Treasurer, 'which is due before the close of August.",66
535,Mr MAHON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I suppose the honourable gentleman intends inviting the States Premiers to another Conference.,66
536,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"U n d e r these circumstances, the three great demands for old age pensions, the Post Office, and for defence, taken together with a reconsideration of the whole of the financial arrangements on which hitherto the Budgets of every year have absolutely depended-whic h it is proposed to recast in a new form, for a few years, preluding a still further departure-thes e must, I think, satisfy honourable members that the Budget about to be submitted has not. had, and could not have had, anyparallel in the history of the Commonwealth up to this date. to be submitted will be of an extent and a gravitv demanding the closest consideration, first of the Government, and then of this House.  Flinders told the honourable gentleman that two and a-half years ago.",66
537,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Then it is to the credit of the honourable member for Flinders, from which I do not desire to detract. All that I am concerned to point out to the House is that this request for two months' Supply is one for which there is a series of precedents, as there are precedents for the granting of Supply for even longer periods, at other times of the year. For making it at this time of the year I have given strong and convincing reasons. The necessity . for obtaining an opportunity of full y and closely considering these proposals before we submit them to the House is the heaviest task that rests upon the Government today. As the Leader of the Opposition reminded the Committee, I have often pointed out that this must be practically a financial session. Every subject to be dealt with will, of course, affect finance, but on this particular occasion these great demands are related in quite an exceptional way. If division of there has been no precedent of this kind at the commencement of any preceding session, it is because at the commencement of no preceding session have we been called upon to face problems approaching in magnitude, and complexity the problems with which we are confronted today.",66
538,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Do not talk nonsense. The honourable gentleman cannot explain things away.,66
539,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"E very member who gives these matters consideration, and realizes his responsibility as a member of this Parliament, must feel it rest more heavily upon his shoulders now than ever before. I am sure that the country, realizing what this must mean, will be satisfied that in the course proposed by the Government there is a wise saving of parliamentary time. There has been no attempt to obtain any financial liberty, or to ask for expenditure that has not been previously approved. We are proposing to expend the money asked facts for only upon works already authorized, ancl to meet demands about to be made, which, as the return from the Treasury shows, will absorb the whole of the amount available. We have taken the only practicThe proposals able business-like course it is possible to take in an emergency of this sort, if this House is to rise to the level of the occasion, and meet its great financial responsibilities promptly within the few weeks prior to the Budget.",66

541,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Wide Bay) [10.40] - It is remarkable that we should have had to wait until the very end of this debate to learn the real reasons for the action taken by the Govemrhent. Honourable members are aware that the reason given by the Treasurer for the action proposed had no reference to the great and urgent matters referred to by the Prime Minister. The Treasurer relied upon the precedents of previous occasions. He'contended that the Government were proposing to do today only what had been done by previous Governments. Now the Prime Minister admits that there is no precedent at all to support the action of the Government.,66
542,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,There is no precedent for this financial situation.,67
543,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,No r for this composite Ministry.,67
544,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I question whether any member of the House ever saw a political situation like this. It is unprecedented, I believe, in the history of responsible government in the British Dominions. The Prime Minister has abandoned the reason given by the Treasurer for the action of the Government. At the request of the Minister of Defence I asked honourable members on this side to refrain from speaking at length.",67
545,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I had no idea that the honourable gentleman proposed to launch another motion of censure.,67
546,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Did I not say that I - could not think of granting two months' Supply, ancl that, in my opinion, one month's Supply would be ample to meet the situation? I stated that in unmistakable language.",67
547,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Nothin g of was mentioned between the honourable member and myself.,67
548,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The honourable gentleman said, "" We will take the vote.''",67

550,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I wished to be very careful, and after the honourable gentleman had said that we would take the vote, I went back and said, "" Y o u said you would take the vote?"" and he said, "" Yes . """,67
551,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I meant the other vote.,67

556,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,May I remind the Prime Minister of his many statements on the public platform that the old-age pensions were in danger?,67

560,Mr HUGHES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,The Treasurer denied it .,67
561,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,That was owing to. a misunderstanding.,67
562,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,A statement of such a far-reaching character ought not to have been uttered by a gentleman in the responsible position of the honourable member for Ballarat.,67
563,Mr DEAKIN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,I would make it again. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - Stic k to the. truth.,67
564,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"At the end of 1907-8 there was .£193,000 to the credit of the fund. This year .£500,000 has been paid to its credit, and on the same basis £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 would have been added during the next financial year, making a total provision of .£1,200,000. Is it beyond the capacity of this Parliament to find a few extra hundred thousand pounds for this purpose? A suggestion to the contrary is altogether ridiculous. When a leading public man, who claims to have an Australian record, goes upon a public platform and leaves an impression in the minds of the public that the payment of the old age pensions was in danger, it is that a reflection upon his capacity and his position in this House. The payment of the pensions was never in clanger. What about making provision for defence? Is that a new matter? Long ago I heard the Prime Minister explain the difficulties of the defence question. Two years ago he said that the question of defence was urgent, and yet nothing has been done. The question of the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department is not a new one. The Prime Minister was aware of the trouble with the Department. It is a great deal worse since the present. Government came into office. The late Government were prepared to tackle the men who derive advantages from the telephone service. In the country the telephone pays reasonably well, but in the big centres of population there is a great loss, and yet the present Government undid what was done by their predecessors. They want time to introduce their own scheme, but when they were pressed by the Chamber of Commerce it did not take them a week to reverse our action. The next reason given by the Prime Minister was characteristic of him an occasion of this kind. "" A period,"" said, "" must elapse which will give us to make exhaustive inquiries into all the material facts which surround this enorthat purpose? mous problem."" That is something like the phraseology we heard. Now in matmember opposite. ters of finance two and two make four. If the Government will ascertain how much they want to raise they will know exactly what they can spend. If they desire time to manoeuvre, they should say so. But i they desire to carry on the government it ought to be conducted, they will accept one month's Supply and meet the situation, because a Treasurer with the experience the honourable member for Swan can submit a Budget to the House within three weeks. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [10.48]. - I cannot allow the speech of the Prime Minister, bristling as it did with inaccurament he did. cies, to go unchallenged. He said that never before was there afinancialposition such as there is now. He knows what the position was before. He knows that I never took one step or one action without consulting him. He approved of every step I took, and we were ready to deal with months. the whole question at once. Because he has jumped from an honest Ministry mixed Ministry is that a reason why should turn himself inside out, so far finance is concerned? His statement tothing. night astounded me, and it takes a lot from him to astound me. He said that never fore was a Government required to face such a serious financial position. I to face a serious financial position. We agreed to a programme for that purpose with the concurrence of my leader, whom I then respected, and who, I thought, was going to be true and honest with me in dealings. But now he turns absolutely himself and says- "" In view of this serious financial position, we have to take consider our policy."" Thefinancialposi Sir tion is probably no worse today than it was then, but if it is the fault lies with this mixed Ministry. I know that the financial position was improved by the administration of the late Gothat vernment. I took the trouble to find out the power which had been exercised by the cian. late Prime Minister in controlling the partments, and thus I got to know what the that, surely? financial position was. It was better than it was when we left office, because I had not the same power to control the Departments as he had. A Prime Minister of topsy-turvy tendencies says that the financial position on is worse today than ever it was. There is he about £700,000 to the credit of the oldtime age pensions fund.

That is. why they say that I starved the Departments. It was because of what took place when the right honourable member was Treasurer that that difficulty was created. He succumbed to the importunities of some of the officials, and agreed to certain expenditure before I became Treasurer. When I entered the Treasury, and found that 1,500 new hands were to be appointed at once in two or three Departments, and others in other Departments, it made me think.

Apparently the Minister preferred to take another course, and went even further, for in his second explanation he took up the position that I was deliberately allowing the honourable member for Hume to say certain things that I knew he had no right to say. If the honourable member disclaims that, I must accept his explanation. There is, however, a proper course to take in these matters, and I hope honourable members will take it.

If I have said anything that goes beyond the limits of orderly debate, I am willing to withdraw it at your instance, or even without it. I have dealt with defence and old-age pensions as touched upon by the Prime Minister. wish now to say that the Post and Telegraph Department could be conducted and made efficient, to the satisfaction of honourable members and the people, without the borrowing of money, if we could only get a Ministry who would stand up for their own rights and keep their own money.

608,Mr MAHON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,It is necessary to spend a lot more. Many of my constituents are cut off from communication with the outside world.,71
609,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"If we had kept the money we had in the past we could do it. I know that more work is necessary to be done. No one' knew it better than I did when Treasurer, and no one was in a falser position than I was when I had not the money required to do it. We have not reached 1910, but we are getting closer to it, and the closer we get to it the further off appears the settlement of the question of what money we can command. The honourable member said that the dealings between the Commonwealth and States required considerable time and serious consideration, and that is the gist of the whole thing. We are approaching the 1910 period, when we ought to have money to carry on all our Departments. In New South Wales, the year before I left office there, I financed the whole of the Departments for a little over .£9,000,000, including the Defence, Post and Telegraph, and Customs Departments. Yet last year New South Wales spent ..£ 15,000,000 in doing the work I did for a little over ,£9,000,000. Where did that money come from? It came from the Federal Treasury. I silenced those who were carping at the Commonwealth and charging it with extravagance in a speech I made in Sydney. They have never held up their heads since, because they cannot refute my figures. What I intend to fight for is a definite arrangement to be come to at once, or not later than 1910, between the Commonwealth and the States. The settlement suggested to the Premiers' Conference in Melbourne, primarily by my then chief, the honourable member for Ballarat, and supported by myself, was based upon the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, and other valuable schemes on record in the Treasury.' It was the Prime Minister who converted me then, if conversion were required, to the view that the I State and Commonwealthfinancesmust be kept separate if we are to have harmony. He urged upon that Conference more strongly and lucidly than I could hope to do it, that that must be the groundwork of any agreement. We offered to take over the whole of the State debts, to give the States at once £6,000,000 per annum, and to allow the remaining two millions and some hundreds of thousands of interest-the interest bill being some hundreds of thousands over eight millions-to remain for five years. At the end of that period a commencement was to be made to pay that off at the rate of one-thirtieth per year for thirty years. We were to pay one-thirtieth off every year for thirty years, and take the whole responsibility as a Commonwealth, and pay off a national debt of what is £254,000,000. States absolutely without a debt of any kind, and it was the offer that the present Prime Minister made when he better than I ever saw him fight in a Conference of the kind- In his to-night, however, he says practically we do not know what ought to be and that we want time to decide. All can say is that there is going to absolute alteration of our financial - that there is going to be instituted system of borrowing, and some undesirable alteration in the arrangement between Commonwealth and the States. This represents such a complete change"" of and opinion on the part of the Prime Minister that we ought to have some planation. I speak strongly, because feel strongly on this combination of sibles, this confusionist Ministry. the present Government have been power, things have happened which show track or the wrong track, i trying to do that the Prime Minister has not the that a Prime Minister ought to have.",71

With the approach of 1910 there is a possibility of doing something to alter this state of affairs, but in the terial statement submitted iby the Prime Minister, there is an indication that the existing arrangement is to be continued for an indefinite period.",72

I speak to-night, not as a party man, but as one who feels that the great question to [20] be faced in this Legislature is not whether we should have the toll system or the flat rate in connection with our telephone service, but whether this Parliament, as opposed to the Parliaments of the States, is to be supreme. Is the Commonwealth Government to go, cap in hand, to the State Treasurers, and to ask them how much we may retain of the revenue that we collect, and what we are to do in regard to our financial proposals? Are we to go to them, cap in hand, before we dare to step out on new lines ? Are we to consult, and actually submit first of all to the State Parliaments, and the Treasurers of the States, Minis- any proposals that we may make in this regard? That would be a most undignified position for this Parliament to occupy. I care not, except in so far as administrative matters are concerned, who are on the Treasury bench; but the Parliament should speak with one voice as to what shall be our financial relations with the States. No one knows better than do honourable members opposite that at the end of 1910 the Braddon section must be abolished, and some new arrangement made. I repeat that it is little short of hypocrisy to talk of taking over the Northern Territory, of constructing the transcontinental railway, or of bringing the Postmaster-General's"" Department up to date, unless we can build on a solid financial Basis, without having to go to the States.

624,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,All we desire is to be fair to the States.  fence cannot formulate any scheme providing for the continuation of the Braddon section which will leave this Parliament as free as it ought to be. I take it that the paragraph in the Ministerial statement - to which I have directed attention is tantamount to a declaration that that section is to be continued in a modified form.,74
625,Mr WH IRVINE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,There is no suggestion of that kind.  the paragraph in question does not point to a continuance of the Braddon section.,74

At this stage I interjectedHow long ? To that the Prime Minister repliedFive years, I should think. [f that statement does not mean that the Braddon section of the Constitution is to be continued, I do not understand what it means.",74
627,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I may tell the honourable member that it does not mean that.  tion is the greatest one that this Parliament is called upon to face, and if we settle it satisfactorily, we shall have done extremely good work. Nobody will be more pleased than I if the Braddon section is abolished, and if the Commonwealth has reserved to it a sufficient revenue from Customs and Excise to enable it to give effect to our national aspirations. What has this Parliament done already in the matter of old-age pensions? It has relieved three States of their liability to pay these pensions ? It has also shouldered the obligation of the three remaining States to grant such pensions. Then is it too much to ask that the States shall grant to this Parliament the full amount necessary to enable it to pay these pensions?",74
628,Mr HEDGES,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"They have agreed to do that.  tain conditions. I say that the States ought not to hesitate a moment, but ought to grant to this Parliament out of their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue a sufficient sum with which to pay old-age pensions. I cannot understand their attitude upon this question. They declare that they must have three-fifths of the Customs and Excise revenue returned to them, and they stipulate that the minimum amount returnable in any year shall be ,£6,500,000, with a special grant to Western Australia of £250,000. The States are endeavouring to prevent this Parliament from imposing direct taxation. On the one hand they say. that they want their full pound of flesh so far as the Customs and Excise revenue is concerned, and on the other they declare that this Parliament must not encroach upon their preserves in the matter of direct taxation. It must be patent to every honourable member that if the Commonwealth is to face its obligations in the way that it should do, there can be no continuance of the Braddon section. We must have sufficient finances to carry on the affairs of the Commonwealth, and I trust that the question will not be raised as a party one by honourable members on any side. We should put our House in order and place our affairs upon a proper basis. But .while I say that, I have no wish to do an injustice to the States, which must have the means with which to carry on. I trust that before long the present Government will tell us what they mean by this interim period of five years.  listening to the remarks of the Prime Minister, I have come to the conclusion that his opinion is that it would take five years to bring about a regulation of the State debts. I remember very well when the honourable member for Flinders about two years ago warned the Government as to what would happen. The same Treasurer was in office then as is in office now. The honourable member for Flinders pleaded with the Government to bring about a settlement of the financial problem between the Commonwealth and the States. No Government since that time has done anything whatever to solve the problem. Now we have the Premiers of the States congratulating the Prime Minister on getting into office, because they hope for specially favourable treatment from this Government. There is not a member of our party who wishes to injure the States. But as the honourable member for Grey said, this is a national question, and should be settled without party prejudice. I was sent here as a member of the National Parliament, not as a "" State frights"" partisan. I am well aware that at the next election we shall have to face the State rights advocates. Mr Kidston, the Premier of Queensland, said as soon as he landed at Fremantle from England, that he intended to fight the Labour party at the next Federal election in the interests of State rights. I welcome that announcement. The same people who return us to the Federal Parliament also return these pettifogging State Premiers and their supporters. It is not reasonable to assume that any one wishes us to injure the State with which his reputation as a. politician is bound up. Neither do we wish to injure other States than our own. I should be sorry to see Victoria injured, for instance. But I want to see the National Parliament secure a fair and square deal. Perhaps I may not be here very long. Many of us may be politically dead after the next election.",74
629,Mr SAMPSON,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"That is too pathetic.  every honourable member who is here now will be here again after we have faced our masters. I have no ill-feeling towards any honourable member. I have no ill-feeling towards my strong and burly opponent, the honourable member for Echuca, although he so often tries to bully me. Had the advice of the honourable member for Flinders been taken two years ago we should have been on the way to settling the difficulty. But I trust that whatever Government is in power the interests of the National Parliament will be considered first, and those of the State Parliaments afterwards.",75

634,Mr BATCHELOR,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Arrangement s made with the States are not worth anything.  this issue goes to the country and is explained to the people they will decide in favour of a national policy. I am in favour of waiting until after the general election. It is not long to wait. We can then determine what shall be done. I have read accounts of meetings addressed by the Minister of External Affairs in Queensland, not only in his constituency, but in other districts. He then said that the National Parliament must be paramount in everything except industrial business, and that financially the Commonwealth must work out its own destiny irrespective of the States. But now we see him sitting with the State Rights party. The Premiers of the States are hopeful of what they will get from this combination. Directly the present Government was formed, Mr Kidston,.the Premier of Queensland, wired to the Prime Minister, not in these words, but to the effect, that now that the Labour party had been put in their proper position he felt that State rights were secure. They know that they have reason for hope from this Government, The honourable member for Parramatta, when leader of the Opposition, was never tired of advocating State rights as against Commonwealth interests. Whenever there was an opportunity of advocating the interests of the States as against those of the Commonwealth, he never lost it. How can we hope for anything else from him now that he is in a Ministry, than a policy in accordance with what he advocated in . Opposition ? I did not expect anything else from the honourable member, but if he is capable of swallowing his life-long principles in this way he is not the man I took him for. *"" Mr CHANTER - This would not be the first time the honourable gentleman did it.  side of a month, he can swallow all that he said while on this side, I shall be surprised.

Ministers must have discussed this tion, and why do they not take the House into their confidence, and say plainly they are going to do, instead' of submitting a vague paragraph like that I have just read. The people who created this Parlialations ment, and honourable members, as the reStates presentatives of the people, have a right to know what the Government intend to do not in dealing with financial matters. Honourable members opposite were in a terrible hurry to know what the Fisher Governno ment proposed to do in dealing with in the future. But the present Governis ment have now been in office for nearly five weeks, and they require a further lay of two months before they will be preside. pared to bring down their financial proposals. The Prime Minister said that business was practically to be the one done in this session, and yet the only ference made to it so far is the very - paragraph which appears under the headtwo ing of ""Finance"" in the Ministerial - statement.",75

638,Mr WISE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Gippsland) [12.0] - It apthis pears to me that there is only one matter thing which should properly have been discussed rethis evening, and that is whether Supply vague should be granted for one month or for months. Every other matter discussed might have been dealt with later. I was very anxious to hear from the Prime Minisof so ter why two months' Supply should be I listened to the honourable gentleman very attentively, and I must say that nothing that he said convinced me that two months' Supply is necessary. I read the for years before I came here that member after member protested against the practice carrying on the business of the country by means of Supply Bills; but I have never known a Supply Bill to be refused, ancl I often think that it is time these protests At the same time, at the beginning of a session, unless unforeseen circumstance has arisen, Supply Bill [29 JUNE, 1909.] it appears to me that it is quite sufficient for the Government to ask for Supply fora month at a time. That would give the House control of the finances, and there would be no objection to the granting of a further month's Supply if it were afterwards found to be necessary. Very little time would thus be lost, because even if .another Supply Bill were discussed even at the length at which this Bill has been cussed, it would still go through in twenty-four hours, and in all probability that time could easily be spared from the general discussion that might be .going on at the time. If the Government had asked for one month's Supply, I believe that the Bill would have gone through without any delay. The discussion which has taken place has been due to the demand for two months' Supply. The only reason given for the demand is that the Government has got financial problems to wrestle with in Cabinet.",76
639,Mr FISHER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,And we got that reason only as the last word.,77
640,Mr WISE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"We were given that reason by the Prime Minister only at the last moment. I was not in the chamber when the Treasurer spoke, and so I do not know what reason he gave for the request for two months' Supply.",77
641,Mr CHANTER,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,He said that there was 110 particular reason for two months' Supply any more than for one.,77
642,Mr WISE,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"If the Treasurer said that, the House has no justification whatever for passing two months' Supply. The Prime Minister told us that the Government required two months' Supply because there were great problems which they had to wrestle with in Cabinet before the Budget statement could be put before the House. If that be so, I must say that I have no sympathy with the Cabinet whatever. The Government took office cheerfully, knowing that they would have these great problems to deal with. They are not new. They have been confronting the leading members - of this House for many years. . Honourable rhembers opposite knew of them last year, and if the present Ministers considered these problems so desperate and so important that their consideration. would require a great deal of time, why did they not fuse before the recess, and take the whole - of the recess to think them over ? Why did they waste all that time, and then on the meeting of Parliament at once defeat a Cabinet that was given no opportunity to make their proposals, take office without (No. 1). 533 hesitation, postpone the business of the session for three weeks, and then, after another week, ask for two more months within which to deal with questions of finance? .If they took one month's Supply, and at the end of the month were not ready with their proposals, I am satisfied that the House would give them still another month. Certainly I should be dis- prepared to do so without any discussion whatever. But at present, I see no reason why the Government should be given Supply for more than one month.",77
643,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Calare) [12.4 a.m.] - Eve r since I have been a member of this House, I have protested strongly against these Supply Bills. It is not fair to the House or to the country that the business of the Commonwealth should be carried on by means of Supply Bills. I recognise that at a time like .the present, when we have reached the end of the financial year, and it is necessary that the Treasurer should get certain information in order to prepare his Budget, some little exception might be made. It may be necessary to cover such an interval with"" a Supply Bill ; but the whole tendency of the Commonwealth has been practically to live on such Bills for a considerable portion of the financial year. By that means a great deal of the useful work that might be done in considering a Budget statement is lost to the House, and there is a lot of useless criticism on Supply Bills. In view of the conditions which now obtain I am prepared to vote a month's Supply. What struck me as unusual was the request for two months' Supply. There does not appear to have been advanced a sufficient reason for covering that period. The financial year of the States is about to terminate, and their Parliaments are about to assemble. The State Treasurers will not be in a position to make fheir financial statements and bring forward their Estimates pending the delivery of a financial statement by the Commonwealth Treasurer.",77
644,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,This will not affect that in the slightest degree.,77
645,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,Surely the delay in the delivery of the Budget speech will affect the proposals of the State Treasurers ?,77
646,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,There will be no delay on my part. We are in the greatest hurry_ to bring down the Budget.,77
647,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"The honourable member led us to believe that one of the reasons for asking for two months' Supply was that he would not be in a position to deliver a financial statement until the end of August. Since then, he has intimated that he will use his best efforts to deliver it earlier if he can, but I want him to consider the awkward position in which the State Treasurers will be placed if its delivery is unduly delayed. One of the complaints which the States have had against the Commonwealth has been the length of time which it has taken the Federal Treasurer to prepare his Budget, and so put them in a position to disclose their own financial position. What I urge upon the Treasurer is that, in view, of these criticisms, there should be no undue delay.",78
648,Sir JOHN FORREST,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I am doing my very best to hurry the delivery of the Brown, Tilley Budget speech.",78
649,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"Of course, I Coon, J. do not know what difficulties a Treasurer Crouch, R. A. has to contend with.",78

It should certainly not be Groom, L . E. necessary to defer its delivery to the second Harper, month of that year. It is only a reasonable thing to ask that this Supply Bill should be limited to one month's Supply. If at the end of the month any unforeseen difficulties should arise or sufficient Watson, J. C. reason should be advanced for delaying the delivery of thefinancialstatement, and a further Supply is asked for, I ' think that honourable members will consider the position on its merits. At the present stage, tive. however, it is most unreasonable to ask the House to surrender for two months its power of bringing pressure to bear upon the Government. I propose to support the proposal to limit the Supply to one rnonth if it is pressed to a division, but I hope that, on consideration, the Government will see the reasonableness of our request, and if at the end of the month they find that it is necessary to introduce a second Supplv Bill, I have every confidence that they will receive fair and generous treatment.

He afterwards came to this side and said to me that he hoped that there would be no misunderstanding about the vote. I took him to mean the vote on the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. That is the only agreement I made with him, and I regret that it has not been kept.

The honourable member for Parramatta came to me and asked me whether I was willing to close, and I said ""Yes, certainly, after we have taken the vote."" Being in doubt whether the honourable member meant the motion that was before you, and that was not opposed, and to which there was no suggestion of opposition, I purposely used the word ""vote."" My meaning was that after we had taken the vote we should adjourn. That was agreed to. A vote can mean only one thing - a vote taken in division by honourable members who differ upon a particular subject. It.had been declared by every honourable member on this side that we were quite willing to grant Supply for a month, but not for two. The vote on that question was the only vote that could be referred to. To make doubly sure, however, I went back to the honourable member for Parramatta and said : "" It is clearly understood that it is after the vote that we shall adjourn.""",79

I asked him what course was proposed for the evening, and he told me be was going to try to get the Leader of the Opposition to agree take the resolution to go into Committee of Supply and adjourn the business of taking Supply until tomorrow.

663,Mr KELLY,LATIONS OF COMMONWEALT H AND,"I could quite understand such a misapprehension arising, but I wish to make the position clear, because I think the honourable member for Wide Bay would be the last to wish to harbour an ungenerous suspicion of the integrity of other honourable members.",79

I sat down on the understanding that there was an arrangement between both sides to take a vote. What was my surprise when I saw the honourable member for Wentworth rise to speak 1 I saw at once that the Government had not the numbers present, and wanted to get them. Then the honourable member for Fremantle rose because they had not the numbers. I .wished to rise and explain that I desired to speak again, and had only sat down on the understanding that the vote was to be taken.",79
