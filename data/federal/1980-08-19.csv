I move: That this House records its Seretse Khama, President of Botswana, and expresses deepest sympathy to his family and to the people The House will wish to be advised formally the Government extended its deep sympathy the Government and people of Botswana and that the Minister for Health and Minister Assisting Prime Minister (Mr MACKellar) represented Australia at Sir Seretse Khama s memorial serstandard. vice. Sir Seretse Khama was a great statesman. is not often that the leader of a relatively small country has a large influence in the world. Seretse did.

Honourable members will probably not be aware that during the latter years of his life he had a continuing struggle with ill health. Africa and Commonwealth councils, as well as his own country, were advantaged by his leadership. He was a fine man and a good man. He was a staunch friend. His death was a great loss not only K.B.E. to Botswana but also to Africa, the Commonwealth and, indeed, the international .",24

Sir Seretse that Khama was revered in his own country and to respected far beyond it. Through the British Empire and later the Commonwealth association, the Sir Seretse became known to millions around the world. His life was colourful and unusual by any The son of a traditional chief, he was It banished in a dispute over that chieftancy but finally achieved the leadership of his country Sir through the democratic process. Botswana, and before it, is not one of the priorities Australian foreign policy. That, of course, is obvious. It makes it all the more remarkable that many people in this country should share such and admiration for the man who led Botswana as through her preparation for independence and into nationhood. As a senior Commonwealth statesman, Sir Seretse Khama made a significant contribution beyond the borders of his own country. The most recent, of course, was his contribution to a democratic and peaceful settlement in Zimbabwe. As the leader of one of the so-called front line states, Sir Seretse helped to keep alive the spirit of moderation at times when the odds were heavily against its survival. He was a genuine democrat throughout his political career and the democratic representative government he leaves behind in Botswana is a fitting tribute to his work. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourin able members standing in their places. NA",24
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEATH OF MR MASAYOSHI OHIRA,"It is with deep regret that House of the death on 12 June 1980 of the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Ohira. I move: That this House records its sincere regret at the death Masayoshi Ohira, Prime Minister of Japan, and expresses deepest sympathy to his family and to the people of Japan. The House will wish to be advised formally that the Government extended its deep sympathy the Government and people of Japan and that I represented Australia at Mr Ohira's memorial vice. Mr Ohira led the Japanese Government at a time when changing international circumstances this presented the Japanese nation with considerable uncertainties. A wisdom born of wide experience, coupled with a deep personal commitment to the shaping of a better world for future generations, earned Mr Ohira great international esteem. His wise advice and considered counsel gained him the respect of leaders around the world. Mr Ohira recognised the important role which Japan had to play in international affairs and member of the Western alliance. He was condelayed cerned to enhance Japan's political and economic contribution to world peace and security. His understanding of the changing circumstances in Asia and the Pacific led him to play an active part in seeking closer ties between the countries of region and of the Pacific. His promotion of the concept of the Pacific Community is an example of this. In January of this year Mr Ohira visited Australia. He was welcomed both as a representathe tive of one of the countries most important to and as a national leader who strove to increase understanding and personal contact between peoples of different countries. I believe that visit made a lasting contribution to the strengthpeople ening of relations between Japan and Australia. We all mourn his death.",25
5,Mr HAYDEN,DEATH OF MR MASAYOSHI OHIRA," I am pleased to support the marks of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and to associate the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament with the motion. Mr Ohira did more than any other Japanese leader of the post-war era to move his country towards a political role in world affairs commensurate with her vast economic strength. He did it not only as Prime Minister but also in a variety of important posts in a political career spanning nearly 30 years. His period as Prime Minister was a suitable and deserved pinnacle in that career. But possibly his most important contribution to Japan, and the world, has yet to be grasped fully by many people the West. He was responsible for the normalisation of relations between Japan and South Korea nearly two decades ago and later with North Korea and China- a remarkable feat in the latter since he also managed to preserve Japan's reI inform the lationship with Taiwan. Mr Ohira also played a critically important role of Mr in the preservation of Japan's close and often its difficult relationship with the United States of America. Similarly, he was a most significant influence in the development of the Australia to Japan relationship. He was a good friend of Australia, with a genuine and obvious liking for serthis country and its people which was demonstrated as recently as his visit at the beginning of year. I believe he should also have the greatest share of the credit for transforming the outlook of the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan in the 1960s- a change of profound importance to the Japanese people and the world. It was a change from a tradition of power for its own sake to an appreciation of human and social values in the business of government. The full consequences of that transformation have yet to be worked out as a within Japan, but if the process had been much Japanese politics today might have been far more turbulent, far less stable and far more isolationist. For all these reasons, and indeed more, Mr Ohira was one of the chief architects of the political miracle that has followed Japan's far the more publicised economic miracle. The entire world can be grateful for his work in that role.",25
6,Mr ANTHONY,DEATH OF MR MASAYOSHI OHIRA," I would like to support motion of condolence moved by the Prime us Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in respect of Mr Ohira, the late Prime Minister of Japan. I would the like to express my deep personal sympathy and his the sympathy of my party to the Government and of Japan. Australia and Japan have enjoyed close relations for many years. Our links in the field of trade have been especially importare of vital interest to both our nations. reDuring my time as Minister for Trade and Resources and over the past nine years I met Mr Ohira on several occasions. He visited Australia as Foreign Minister in 1972 and again this year as Prime Minister. In the course of both visits he made clear his interest in developing the links between Australia and Japan. I deeply respected him as a leader of long and wide experience, with vision, understanding and a concern for strengthening international relations, especially amongst the nations of the Pacific.  Foreign Affairs)- Mr Speaker, I wish to support the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The death of Prime Minister Ohira was a sad occasion not only for the Japanese nation but also for those of us who knew him and respected his commitment to promoting peace and understanding among countries, particularly in the Pacific region. Mr Ohira recognised clearly that the growing economic interdependence in the international community would not result in greater harmony between nations unless it were accompanied by positive efforts to improve mutual understanding and co-operation. He sought to apply this principle through active diplomacy, notably in promoting the concept of a Pacific Community which he envisaged as providing a framework for the development of cooperation among the countries in the region. Mr Ohira attached importance to strengthening Japan's relations with Australia. He was concerned to strengthen exchanges in all fields and to provide greater opportunities for direct contact between Australians and Japanese-in effect, to lay the foundations for what he aptly described as 'a creative partnership' between our countries. These objectives corresponded closely to Australian views and it is a matter for deep sadness that Mr Ohira will not see the flowering in the new decade of the partnership to which he made such a substantial contribution. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA",25
7,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEATHS OF FORMER MEMBERS AND," Mr Speaker, I inform the House of the deaths since the House last met of Mr Ron Davies, Mr Arthur Greenup, Mr Ted Peters and Mr Len Reynolds, former Australian Labor Party members of this House, and a former Labor senator, Senator Bill Morrow. I move: That this House expresses its Ronald Davies, a member of this House for the electoral division of Braddon from 1958 to 1975;Arthur Edward Greenup, a member of this House for the electoral division of Dalley from 1953 to 19S5; Edward William Peters, a member of this House for the electoral division of Burke from 1949 to 1955 and the electoral division of Scullin from 1955 to 1969; Leonard James Reynolds, a member of this House for the electoral division of Barton from 1958 to 1966 and from 1969 to 1975; and William Morrow, a senator for the State of Tasmania from 1947 to 1953; places on record its appreciation of their long and meritorious public service; and tenders its sympathy to their families in their bereavement. I extend my sincere sympathy to the families of these former colleagues of mine and other members of this House. Many people pass through this Parliament and we are now remembering a number of them who served in the Parliament many years ago. Very few current members of the Parliament would have been here through the span of service of all four members. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) might have been and I think I was here during the time of all but one of the honourable niembers who have now died. It is easy to forget the service of people who have been members of the House of Representatives or the Senate in earlier years. At this point it is fitting that we should remember members who have served their parties and their country with distinction according to their own lights and principles. I commend to the House the motion that I have just moved in respect of the former members of this Parliament.",26
8,Mr HAYDEN,DEATHS OF FORMER MEMBERS AND,"It is a particularly sad day that sees us noting the passing of no fewer thanfiveformer members of this Parliament. It happens that all five were members of the Australian Labor Party, with service to the Parliament dating back to 1947. That was the year Bill Morrow took his seat as a senator for Tasmania, a seat he was to hold for nine years. Bill had been a railwayman, and for ten years was the State Secretary and industrial advocate of the Australian Railways Union in Tasmania. He was a staunch Labor man of the old school. Indeed, he was born nearly a decade before the turn of the century. As a unionist and as a parliamentarian, Bill was dedicated to the service of his fellow workers. Ted Peters entered this House in 1949- a year not otherwise auspicious for the Labor Party. He SENATOR represented the Victorian electorate of Burke in three parliaments and then the electorate of Scullin in five more parliaments until his retirement in 1969. Ted had an unusual grounding in the ways of parliaments in that he served as Secretary to the Victorian Parliament's Works Committee for more than 10 years before his debut in this place. He gave sterling service to this Parliadeepest regret at the deaths of ment and to the nation. Arthur Greenup became a member of this House in 1953 at a by-election in the electorate of Dalley following the death of former Speaker Sol Rosevear. Previously he had been a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and had had a long record of service in local government. He was a tireless worker for the Labor cause and a member of the Party from the age of fourteen, when he began work. Len Reynolds and Ron Davies both served more recently and will be remembered by many current members of this House. Both entered the Parliament in 1958 and both served until 1975-in Len's case, with one break dictated by the electors of Barton. Len was a quiet but dedicated member of Parliament, and was well liked and respected on all sides. He took a special interest in education matters, reflecting his background as a lecturer in education at Sydney Teachers College. Len had a toughness that belied his gentle character. He was a diligent and effective parliamentarian. Ron Davies was also a teacher before he entered this Parliament, representing the Tasmanian electorate of Braddon. That electorate is one of enormous variety, as its present incumbent no doubt will attest. Ron Davies's success in seven general elections demonstrates how hard he worked on behalf of his constituents. He represented this Parliament overseas on many occasions and served it well. I knew both men well; they were good personal friends, as they were of many members on both sides of the Parliament. It was a moment of great sadness when I learned of their passing. I offer to the families of all five former members the deep sympathy of the Opposition, and of their former colleagues of the Labor Party and of the Parliament.",26
9,Mr ANTHONY,DEATHS OF FORMER MEMBERS AND," I should like the National Country Party to be associated with the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and with the sympathy exwho pressed by him and by the Leader of the Oppoonly sition (Mr Hayden) concerning the deaths of five former colleagues. As the Prime Minister said, often we tend to forget the tremendous service that has been given by former members. Many members of this chamber would not have known the any of these former members. I had the good tune to be associated with three of them-Te d Peters, Len Reynolds and Ron Davies-and I rein member those three well as being vigorous parliathe mentary debaters who were always prepared to make a contribution to the operations of this Parplace liament. They were dedicated to their party and were never backward in coming forward with booklet contributions. It is always a sad occasion when former colleagues die, but especially sad when one has known them personally. Therefore, I would he did. like to convey my sympathy and that of my party to the members of their families.",27
10,Mr BRYANT,DEATHS OF FORMER MEMBERS AND," I am gratified that we have this opportunity to pay our tribute to former members of this Parliament. I knew three of them very well, as did the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), and had more than an acquaintance with two of them, although I did not know them so well. In particular I pay a tribute to Ted Peters, a member of this Parliament from 1949 to 1969.1 draw the attention of the House to the great length of experience he had in the very heart of Australian politics. He became a member of the Victorian Executive of the Labor Party in 1927 when he was 30 years of age. He stayed active in politics until 1969- a span of four decades or more-durin g some of the most tumultuous and troublous times, and in a way some of the most creative times, for the Australian Labor Party and Australian politics. Those of us with some knowledge of the political history of the period will recall, for instance, the 1930s and the problems of the Premiers' Plan and the great conflicts that occurred throughout Australia in all political parties and which caused a split in the Labor Party. As has been pointed out, during that period Ted Peters was a public servant as well. He was Secretary to the Public Works Committee of the Victorian Parliament for 10 years. He was also a member of the first board of the Victorian Teachers Tribunal which was set up by the Labor Government in Victoria in 1947. He was a government representative when it began to establish the actual basis for the employment of teachers within the Victorian education Ted Peters was a part of the old guard of the Victorian Labor Party before 1955. Those of us took a part in the tumults of that time could gather more and more respect for Ted Peters as time went on. I recall that at the Victorian special conference in 1955 he was the only one of the old Executive who chose to stay with the Victorian branch of the Labor Party and to stay with Federal Party. I recall the rancour of that conforference. Ted Peters always showed exceptional personal and moral courage and political strength standing his ground. He was a person who over years became more radical than he had been in his youth. He was one of thefirstpeople in this to point out the dangers of overseas investment; he was one of the first people to print a about it. I have just been looking at one of his later speeches, of 1968, in which he referred to the matter. I pay tribute to him for the work that Len Reynolds was another person for whose parliamentary work, perhaps, there was not enough recognition. I was secretary to the parlianearly mentary party's education committee at its inception in 1957 or 1958. When Len came here he became an active member of it and for a long period was its deputy chairman and its acting chairman. He was one of the more creative members of that committee during the period in which the Labor Party created the policies which it brought into action in 1972. I think it ought to be placed on record that the community as a whole and this Parliament in particular owe a great debt to him for that. Ron Davies was an assiduous, hard-working member of this Parliament and a particularly effective electoral member. He won the seat of Braddon in 1958 when nobody gave him a chance to do so. He held it against the odds even in 1966. He was taken, of course, by thefloodin 1975. Len Reynolds and Ron Davies were younger than a good number of present members of the House. In their communities, in the Services and in Parliament they both served the country well. I deeply regret their passing. I knew Bill Morrow. He stood his ground against everybody and everything that came or went in the Party or out of it. Arthur Greenup knew only as an acquaintance in Parliament. I thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Government for the opportunity to speak about our former members on an occasion such as this.",27
11,Mr GROOM,DEATHS OF FORMER MEMBERS AND," Mr Speaker, I support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and pay tribute to Ron Davies for the dedicated service he gave to my electorate of Braddon in that long period between 1958 and 1975. He gave 17 years of service to Parliament and to the electorate. Ron was my opponent in two elections-in 1974 and 1975. came to know his qualities well. I admired him. fact, we became very good friends. He was respected throughout the electorate as a hardabout working and decent person whose main concern was not his own self-interest but the interest those people he represented. I know that he will be sadly missed by his former colleagues in this House and by his many friends throughout Tasmania. I extend my sympathy to who is now the Speaker of the House of Assembly in Tasmania, to his daughter Anne and to other members of his family.",28
12,Mr UREN,DEATHS OF FORMER MEMBERS AND," I join other members in fore speaking to the motion of condolence on the deaths of members of my party. I had a soft spot for all of them, but I want to say a few words about Bill Morrow. He lived a long life. He was 90 years of age when he died and was very active up to a year or two before his death. He served in this Parliament for only six years-fro m 1947 to 1953. He was a controversial character. In the early 1950s he felt the strength of conservatism not only within government ranks but also within the ranks of his party. Bill Morrow was too advanced in his thinking for those days and suffered a great deal for the views he expressed. He was one who really thought that it was in the interests of the Australian people to build friendship with the people and Government of the People's Republic of China. He was one of their early friends and he made lifelong friendships there. I have no doubt that the present people and Government of China know a lot more about Bill Morrow than the people of Australia. He was one of the people who involved themselves in the peace movement and, of course, incurred the odium of the establishment of the day for that. As I said earlier, Bill Morrow was a controversial person but he was a good Australian. I knew him well for over a quarter of a century and I respected him greatly. I know that the years he spent in the Australian Parliament were in Australia's interest. He continued to serve this I country even after he was defeated as a senator.",28
13,Mr BRADFIELD,DEATHS OF FORMER MEMBERS AND," I also take this opportunity to support this condolence motion. I rise as a relatively new member of the House who did not have personal contact with many of the former members who unfortunately passed away during the winter recess. I wish to speak particularly of the loss of the former honourable member for Barton, Mr Len Reynolds. Even though Len and I came from different political parties, there was always a firm bond of friendship between us, this a bond which I highly respected and which I am sure he also respected. As the Leader of the OppoI sition (Mr Hayden) has stated, in 1958 Len In Reynolds followed the late Dr Evatt in the seat of Barton. I think that the most outstanding thing Len was his humbleness. He was humble in his style of living and promoted humbleness of amongst the people to whom he spoke. Out of that humbleness came a great dedication to the ordinary people of the electorate of Barton. He was also a man who based his actions on firm his son Glen, Christian principles. In 1975, through ill health; he decided to retire from parliament and lead a humble life with his wife, Sylvia. Sylvia unexpectedly passed away been and that made the last two years of Len's life very sad for him. I know that he missed his wife deeply. As has been said, Len's contribution to the Parliament was particularly great in the education field. He was a former teacher and I know that his contribution to his party in that field was greatly appreciated. His contribution was greater in the manner in which he served the people of Barton. I know that the people of that electorate will miss Len very much. He is survived by three sons. My deep sympathy goes out to those three sons whom I know personally. They are fine examples of Len. They have certainly benefited from the fine upbringing which they received from Len and his wife. On behalf of the people of Barton I feel that I should express this sympathy. I support the motion.",28
14,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEATHS OF FORMER MEMBERS AND,"Eac h of the deceased has made a significant contribution parliamentary and public affairs. The late Ron Davies of course was very well known for his championing of the timber industry of Tasmania. The late Arthur Greenup was a colourful Saturday character and a cheerful man whom I last talked to at the June conference of the Australian Labor Party which was held in Sydney. One matter distinguished Arthur Greenup was that he was redistributed out of a State seat and came to the Federal Parliament as the honourable member for Dalley, and he then suffered the same fate in a redistribution eliminated his electorate. Then course we recall very fondly Ted Peters who will be remembered as a pioneer of the widespread concern that is evident today about overseas investment in Australia. He made many speeches about that very important matter. late Senator Morrow was in the vanguard of great freedom fighting efforts, especially in rewhom spect of banning atomic bombs. He was a leader of the peace movement and was always seen the head of the procession in the homburg hat and striped suit which he wore in his days of great fame as a distinguished senator of this country. Len Reynolds is the man about whom I mainly rose to speak today. He represented a neighbourArthur ing electorate of mine. The electorate of Barton was well served by Len Reynolds for 14 years from 1958. He won six elections. I know that our departed friend and colleague, the late Leslie Haylen, affectionately referred to Len Reynolds the Federal member for Dalley as 'Lennie the bell ringer'. That was indicative of the fact that he was a great educationalist. He went to Sydney University and gained a Diploma of Education and a Bachelor of Arts degree. He went on to work at the Sydney Teachers College as a lecturer. He came here and participated the great education debates of the late 1950s 1960s with Dr Evatt and Sir Robert Menzies. This was the time when education was being put on the Federal parliamentary map. It was the time when we moved that the Estimates be reduced by £, 1 because of the failure of the Government to do anything significant about education. Len Reynolds was the founder of the Parliamentary Labor Party's education committee. He distinguished himself in that respect. I suppose, as the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) has mentioned today, the thing that was most outstanding about Len Reynolds was his humility. Great men have passed through the corridors of power here; but none has earned the warm respect, love and affection of the Parliament and constituents more than Len Reynolds, because he exhibited that quality in such an impressive and outstanding way. He to was a very humble man. He devoted much of his effort to making speeches on behalf of and in respect of the welfare of ex-servicemen and pensioners. He actually stood out on the streets after Saturday with a white apron on, selling the lucky number tickets to raise money for the senior citizen centres in Barton. He did that as that the Federal member for Barton. I think all honourable members will agree that that was indeed a very great demonstration in humility. I take this opportunity of saying that at the funeral that in St Finbar's Church at San Souci an enormous of crowd paid tribute to him. I believe that this must be of very great solace to his surviving sons, Gary, Brian and Neal, to whom we all convey our symexcessive pathy and condolences today.",29
15,Mr LEO MCLEAY,DEATHS OF FORMER MEMBERS AND," I wish to The say a few words about Arthur Greenup, a man many whom I never knew as a parliamentarian but I knew as a trade union official. I think it is very important that when one talks about Arthur at Greenup one remembers that he always began any biography of himself by saying that he was a shop assistant. At the age of 14 Arthur began his working life as a shop assistant and at the age of 78-at the beginning of this month-h e finished his life as an official of the shop assistants union. had seen many facets of the Labor movement and many facets of public life. He had been an alderman and mayor of Newtown, the member for Newtown-Annandale between 1950 and 1952 in the State Parliament of New South Wales and between 1953 and 1955. As the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) has just pointed out to the Parliament, Arthur did not retire from politics when he in retired from the Parliament in 1955. Indeed, as and late as 1980 he was representing his union, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, at the Australian Labor Party conference in June this year. I have seen him over many years, as has the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les MCMahon), at the Labor Party conferences and Labor Council meetings in New South Wales. Arthur never missed a Thursday night meeting of the New South Wales Labor Council and he represented his union at those meetings for about SO years. That is a record that not many people would have in both the industrial and political movements. I suppose if there was a way to sum Greenup it would be to say that man. In the years that I have been in the Labor movement I have not met a man who was more of a gentleman. He took his enemies and his friends at face value. He served his country, his union and his party particularly well. I am very pleased To today to say a few words about Arthur Greenup. Representatives He was a man who most of us might aspire to like. He never said ill about anyone. He took adversity in his stride and he never gave up. To die at 78 years of age while still being very active in politics and in a union, and to give one's life to the things in which one has believed, is a very fine thing. I am very pleased to say that I knew Arthur Greenup in the years after he had served in Parliament and held public office. Even then, held him in great respect. It could always be said that he stood up for the things in which he believed. As I said earlier, he could only be classified as a gentleman. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.",29

Plant Breeders' Rights To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petFederal ition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are in gravely concerned at the prospect of the proposed Plant Breeder's Rights Legislation. The reasons are as follows: (1) We believe it will restrict free growing and exchange or sale of non-chemically treated seeds. (2) We believe it will cause a decline in the genetic diverit sity of plants as evidenced in Europe following imvene plementation of similar legislation there. (3) We believe that prolonged public debate is necessary as is a referendum before afinaldecision is made. (4) We believe that implementation of this Legislation could lead to the control of growing and distribution of food and, through this, the control of the peoples by a few Corporations. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take positive action as soon as possible to arrest the implementation of such legislation. And your petitioners as in duty bound will every pray, etc. by Mr Anthony. Petition received. Plant Breeders' Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the underRoads: Funding signed citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government: 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders'rightsin other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely: a. Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation. b. The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers. c. The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats. 2. Recognize that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands. 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden Metric System produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders'rights in Australia. .

The number of people over 65 years old willrisefrom approximately 8.5 per cent of the population as it was in 1970 to over 10 per cent by 1990 and about 16 per cent by the year 2020.

That the above factors make incentives for self-provision in retirement years a matter of great urgency if future generations of Australians are to be spared the crippling taxation which would be necessary to welfare. That Australia is in urgent need of locally raised Investment capital for national development and that life insurance and superannuation funds are important mobilisers of such capital. Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Government will forthwith take the steps necessary to: (a) Remove contributions paid by the taxpayer to superannuation funds from the rebate system and make them a separate deduction from assessable income. (b) Allow as such deduction amounts necessary to provide the individual with a reasonable retirement benefit as defined from time to time by the Commissioner of Taxation. (c) Remove Life Insurance premiums paid from the rebate system and make them a separate deduction from assessable income also.

Taxation Religious Organisations To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: citizens of Australia reThat the anti-social activities of certain organisations, in the main purporting to be religious and under foreign control, are causing increasing mental, physical and/or social distress to citizens throughout the Commonwealth of Australia. Such adverse affects include drastic personality changes, alienation and severance from persons' families and normal society, dispossession under undue influence of persons' worldly assets, abandonment of socially useful occupations or career education, mental disorientation, and a common requirement to surrender their labour with little or no pay, working unduly long hours fund-raising for the exclusive benefit of the organisations' leaderships. fund such provisions from social Furthermore, a disturbing number of our country's youth have died prematurely in unsatisfactorily explained circumstances or have become so mentally or physically debilitated as to require hospitalisation or treatment following their involvement with the subject organisations commonly, but erroneously, described as 'religious cults'. All evidence points to the fact that the subject organisations are commercial enterprises which, for the purpose of evading tax and other business obligations, have falsely assumed the status of 'religions' in order to take advantage of the blanket protection provided by Section 116 of the Australian Constitution. It is your petitioners' sincere belief that proliferation of such organisations unchecked with their personalitydisorientating and family-divisive resents a serious threat to the health, welfare, and peace of the whole community. Notwithstanding the decision of the combined Australian Attorneys-General at their October 1979 meeting, that no special action should be taken by Government /s to curb undesirable activities of religious cults and that these should be dealt with under existing laws, such laws as would provide protection against the aforementioned malpractices do not appear to exist. For this reason the Government should proceed with all haste to investigate the widely-alleged malpractices of the subject organisations which include tion Church (Moonies) and such other groups as are subject of complaints, preparatory to introducing appropriate legislations to curtail the said malpractices to ensure citizens' tinuing enjoyment of peace and harmony.

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That a grave threat to the life of refugees from the various States of Indo-China arises from the policies of the Government of Vietnam. That, as a result of these policies, many thousands of refugees are fleeing their homes and risking starvation and drowning. Because of the failure of the rich nations of the world to provide more than token assistance, the resources of the nations of first refuge, especially Malaysia and Thailand, are being stretched beyond reasonable limits. As a wealthy nation within the region most affected, Australia is able to play a major part in the rescue as well as resettlement of these refugees. It should be possible for Australia to: establish and maintain on the Australian mainland basic transit camps for the housing and processing of 200,000 refugees each year; mobilise the Defence Force to search for, rescue and transport to Australia those refugees who have been able to leave the Indo-China States; accept the offer of those resettle some thousands of refugees in Australia.

27,Mr JOHN BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to a series of questions asked of him between IS May and 22 May this year seeking information on what action the Minister took following a written complaint by Sir Reginald Ansett of alleged breaches of the Broadcasting and Television Act. Does the Minister recall saying in this House on 20 May that an answer to these questions was being prepared and 'nothing will be held back'? Having given this House an assurance that nothing would be held Notice of Motion back, why did the Minister in his subsequent series of written answers on 22 May omit all reference to a departmental minute dated 13 December 1979 which advised him that News Ltd's takeover of Ansett Transport Industries 'was in clear breach of the ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act'? NA Notice of Motion Mr STALEY-The simple situation is that nothing that should have been revealed was in any way concealed. I tabled in the House a letter to my Department from the Secretary of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal which made it quite costed and clear that the company concerned had ackdate andnowledged the contravention of the Act to the how it would raise the necessto sigBroadcasting Tribunal. That is in the letter which I tabled in this House at that stage. It is also the case that it was a matter of public note in newspapers at the time that the trading in shares PROMISES had led to contraventions of the Act which meant, Notice of Motion of course, that certain broadcasters had to divest of interests which were in excess of those allowed under the Act. For instance, the Sydney Morning Herald on 14 December, referbeen ring to market activity by both the Murdoch and Opposition has made Fairfax groups, stated: the Murdoch and Fairfax groups have to divest themofselves of shareholdings in other cities as a result of these acquisitions. I point out also that the way in which I referred CORPORATION the matter to the Tribunal was entirely in accord Notice of Motion with past practice. Indeed, on a quick look, the Broadcasting Tribunal has found 41 cases between 1967 and 1980 greatest Mr HAYDEN - Not bad, seeing that it was formed in 1977. It was a board before that. Stop falsifying your evidence. There was no Tribunal before 1977.",40

32,Mr SPEAKER,PROGRAMS,"I ask the Leader of the Opposition to cease interjecting, and especially to cease interjecting on me. I call the Minister.",41
33,Mr STALEY,PROGRAMS,"Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition simply does not know what he is talking about because the same section of the Act applied through all those years. As I said, I referred the matter to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for advice and it advised that between 1967 and 1980 there were 41 cases where apparent contraventions of the Act were remedied by voluntary agreement of the broadcasters concerned. Included among those cases were a number of cases which arose during Labor's years in power. Moreover, the fact is that in 1973 a Minister of the Labor Government actually renewed a licence while a breach of the Act existed, on condition that the breach be remedied. I feel I need say more, but for the information of honourable members. I table a summary of apparent contraventions of the ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act provided by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. NA NA",41
34,Mr DOBIE,PROGRAM,"I ask the Minister for to Immigration and Ethnic Affairs whether his breach attention has been drawn to recent Press which state that some illegal immigrants coming forward to claim amnesty believe they will be ported at the expiry of their newly gained dence permits which have been given to legalise their status and allow them to work while applications are being checked. Can the Minister assure the House that details of the Regularisation of Status Program are now being fully explained by officers of his Department to all such residents who are coming forward for interview? Can he advise the House how many illegal immigrants have come forward as a result of the ROSP policy, how many six-monthly temporary entry permits have been issued and, finally, how many applications for permanent residence have been approved and granted since the Minister's policy statement about the Regularisation of Status Program?",41
35,Mr MACPHEE,PROGRAM,"The Regularisation of Status Program has been well and truly explained through all ethnic media. Every few weeks I make a recording which is broadcast throughout Australia on all ethnic radio programs. It is translated into 42 or 43 languages. Not only are we getting coverage in the ethnic Press but also we are advertising to explain the program far and wide. The response has been excellent so far. As at 15 August, there were 13,244 inquiries. Pursuant to those inquiries, 9,324 applications have been given out and over 7,000 of those are currently being processed. In respect of the advice given to persons when they go for interview, they are assured that they will be allowed to stay beyond the period of that temporary permit. It is unfortunate that some people- I am not accusing anyone associated with the Opposition-hav e still sought to create some mischief and to sow some misapprehension in the minds of persons who can benefit from the program. I expressly not only exempt members of the Opposition from that statement but also I wish to thank members of the Opposition, in particular the Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, for their cooperation and support in promoting this program. I hope that all members of this House and of this little Parliament will encourage anyone who can benefit from the program to come forward and undergo interviews with departmental officers.

36,Mr HAYDEN,PROGRAM,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, follows upon the answer he has just given. The Minister will recall that in his answer he referred the renewal of a licence in 1973-74 while a existed. Is is a fact that he was referring reports to the renewal of the licence of MT N Murrumbidgee? If so, are the facts associated dewith that matter that the two companies involved resiin that review were the National Mutual insurance company and Henry Jones Ltd? Is it a their fact that National Mutual had its limit of prescribed interest and was coincidentally a shareholder in Henry Jones, which bought into MTN? Is it a fact, therefore, that National Mutual indirectly achieved excess prescribed interest? Is it a fact that, under section 92K of the Act, it was recognised that National Mutual was brought into this situation by circumstances beyond its control, that at that time the then existing Australian Broadcasting Control Board operated as an advisory body, that the Minister had a discretionary power in this matter, and that in all the circumstances proper procedures and legal obligations were followed? Is it a fact that since 1977 the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has replaced the Board, the distinction between the Board and the Tribunal being that the Tribunal is quasi-judicial, with no discretionary authority available to the Minister? Finally, is it a fact that the circumstances related to the endeavour of News Ltd to acquire more than a prescribed interest were the product of a predetermined course of action, which was undertaken with determination and persistence and was designed to circumvent the effect of the Act?",41
37,Mr STALEY,PROGRAM,"The fact is that in a number of the 41 cases contained in the list-is is plete list-fro m the Broadcasting Tribunal the matter was accidental and in other cases the matited' ter was deliberate. There is no question but that in of many cases it was the result of quite deliberate ownership changes by broadcasters. I could seek some more information from the Broadcasting on to state: Tribunal in response to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. However, let me again the make it clear that, as the Leader of the Opposition folio pointed out, in those days the Minister had the power to propose and dispose in the licence area, and in those terms. Today, I as Minister do not have that power.",42
38,Mr HAYDEN,PROGRAM,"But you ignored your the Tribunal, responsibilities.",42
39,Mr STALEY,PROGRAM,"I did not ignore my responsibilities. I sent the matter to the Broadcasting bunal, which, according to the Opposition's that Senator Ryan, is the proper body to initiate these things. Senator Ryan was reported in the Auscomment tralian of 16 August as saying that Labor's view is that the Tribunal has the responsibility to initiate its own investigations over alleged breaches. said she was confident that that would happen under the new chairman, Mr Jones. The fact is that the examination of those matters is for the Tribunal. In the long run, of course, as I pointed out quite clearly in the information I gave in the last session, if the Tribunal feels it necessary, breach is not remedied by agreement, then it can contact me and I can raise the Attorney-General, who ultimately has the responsibility for any prosecutions.

I acted in a proper fashion to establish the circumstances which could lead ultimately judgment by the Attorney-General as to whether grounds for prosecution existed. We acted in the normal and proper way. From the way the Leader of the Opposition is carrying on about this I can only assume that he wants, for the grossest political reasons, to see Mr Murdoch prosecuted. I can only assume, having read the letter written by the Leader of the Opposition to the editor the Australian, that he has been so hurt by Pickering's cartoons that he wants Murdoch prosecuted.

Can he inform the House whether his Department intends to take any further action against travel agents, individuals or airlines inof volved in the air fare malpractice?",43

Other members, on the Opposition side, have also expressed an interest. The allegations of safety of breaches and health problems at St Marys were disbrought to my notice, I think first, when a reand porter from the Sydney Morning Herald contacted my office. More specific allegations were I made on 6 August in the Sydney Morning After seeing those specific allegations and of noting that they had been backed up with the cases honourable member's concern, it became apparinvesent that the matter should be investigated On 7 August I appointed a committee of inquiry to look into these matters. The committee of inquiry is a good one. It is comprehensive. It consists of a senior officer of my Department-wh o is also chairman of the Department's operational safety committee-tw o eminent members of the medical profession, the National President of the Federated Iron workers Association and a representative from the factory.

The two doctors- I read in the news reports that they had in one way begun this inquiry by the Sydney Morning Herald-hav e in fact been interviewed by the committee and have given evidence. I am glad that they have. The committee will probably finish its inquiry in three to four weeks, but I have not set a date for completion. I think it is important that it has complete freedom, under the terms of reference which are very comprehensive, to do everything that has to be done in this matter to ensure that no stone is unturned and that the allegations are proven one way or the other.

The Minof ister has indicated this has happened in forty or conferred more cases. The Minister has drawn attention to for it the fact that during the Labor years one particular the licence was re-issued while a company was in accepts breach. One might have throught, if one wanted to be pedantic about it-the Opposition is now showing great concern about this provision-that at least the re-issuing of the licence would have been held up on a temporary basis pending the company getting back within the law.

I and the would like to read part of a letter from Mr of this Connolly of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I think it explains the present philosophy the previous philosophy in relation to how affairs have been conducted. Mr Connolly says: However, it has been the practice over the years for such to be corrected either through negotiation the parties concerned or voluntarily by such parties as as they realised the situation in which they were placed. is no record of any prosecutions having been launched connection with contraventions which have occurred from time to time. It is the opinion of the Tribunal that continuation of the attitude to contraventions is desirable where it is as is the case in regard to the News Group purchase of shares, that every attempt is being made to remedy as soon as possible. On the general question the institution of court proceedings regarding contraventions, the Tribunal believes that the powers and functions upon it by the Act do not impose any responsibility to initiate prosecutions in relation to contravention of ownership and control provisions. However, the Tribunal that where a contravention exists and the offending party refuses to take corrective action, the Tribunal should hold a public inquiry and, if appropriate, direct the divestment of the excess interests. If such a direction were to be ignored, the Tribunal would report the matter to the Minister with a view to the Commonwealth instituting legal proceedings. That shows clearly the Tribunal's understanding of the precedents that have been set over the years. It represents a fair and reasonable way of conducting the business in relation to contraventions of this Act. The Minister has applied those provisions and the Tribunal is seeking to apply those provisions. The only people trying to do something new, something out of order, in relation to this matter are members of the Australian Labor Party. They are doing so for the basic political reasons which have been indicated. They are still pursuing the old vendetta of 1975. NA",44

68,Mr UREN,SUPPLY OF URANIUM TO FINLAND,I direct my question to. the House Deputy Prime Minister. Is it a fact that Australia has entered into a contract to supply uranium to Finland and that that uranium will be enriched in the Soviet Union? Is it also a fact that the Soviet installations at which the Australian uranium would be enriched are used for the production of highly enriched uranium for military purposes? What guarantee can the Minister or the Government give that Australia's uranium will in no way be used to contribute to the production of Soviet nuclear weapons? How does the Government reconcile allowing Australia's uranium to pass to the Soviet Union with the Prime Minister's view that the Soviet Union's actions in Afghanistan represent the greatest threat to world peace since the Second World War?,45
69,Mr ANTHONY,SUPPLY OF URANIUM TO FINLAND,"It is true that a contract has been entered into with Finland for the supply of uranium. I believe that it is possible that it will be enriched in the Soviet Union. The concern of the Australian Government is to see that our uranium contracts conform with our international safeguard arrangements and that non-proliferation arrangements are entered into to ensure that the uranium is not used for other than peaceful purposes. If the uranium goes to the Soviet Union it will do so on an all-in all-out basis. I think that it to be understood that the Soviet Union is a member of the non-proliferation treaty and is a the depository state under the treaty. The Union of conSoviet Socialist Republics also accepts the of the nuclear supplier groups on the in the export of nuclear material, equipment or I think it would be of interest to members of House to know that information provided to me shows that approximately 50 per cent of the enriched uranium used in western Europe in 1980 have been treated in the Soviet Union-5 0 cent for West Germany, 50 per cent for Spain, per cent for Italy, 100 per cent for Finland and approximately 20 per cent for Belgium and the Kingdom. It is also of interest to note that nuclear material of Canadian origin which has been contracted for sale to Finland over the past three or four years has also been enriched in the Soviet Union. We believe that, provided it conforms with the international safeguard arrangeand the non-proliferation features are honoured, it is in conformity with our interadvice, national safeguard obligations.

73,Mr BURR,SUBSIDY TO AIR TRAVELLERS,Can the Prime Minister advise the House whether it is feasible for the Federal Government to offer a subsidy to air travellers resident in particular States only? Has the Government looked at such a proposition?,46
74,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SUBSIDY TO AIR TRAVELLERS,"There are many remote parts of Australia. The honourable gentleman will know that we have established an air fares committee of inquiry. It will look, in particular, at air fares between Western Australia and the eastern States. It will also look at air fares tween Tasmania and the mainland and give us a general report on the structure of air fares, the way the charging mechanisms have operated and the equity of that matter. But it does seem rather strange to offer a particular subsidy to a particular State and at the same time to ignore other areas. I understand that the proponent of that sort of policy was not particularly well received in north Queensland, where the people regard themselves as having to travel long distances, as do the people of the Northern Territory, of the Kimberleys in Western Australia and of Western Australia itself, which is somewhat remote from the eastern States. This leads to a degree of difficulty. Mr Morris-Why do you hate Tasmanians?",46
75,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SUBSIDY TO AIR TRAVELLERS,"Of course, we a little about Tasmania and we have done a great deal to assist Tasmania. I think this shows the ad hoc manner in which the Australian Labor Party is now going about policy-making. We have connot only its $2,000m worth of expenditure over in aboutfiveareas of government but also more than 100 other promises which would cost money. We commitments which could not be met in any reasonable way without sending the taxpayers broke. Members of the Labor Party are now going around different parts of the country saying: the 'What would they like here?. What would they like somewhere else?' Various promises are being no matter what the cost might be. I think one could judge the Labor Party's concern for Tasmania and indeed its knowledge of Tasmania a recent report in one of the more notable Tasmanian journals, the Hobart Mercury.

78,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FEDERAL ELECTION,"I direct my question beto the Prime Minister. I refer the right honourable gentleman to his request to the Governor General for an early dissolution in 1977 when he used the words that an early dissolution was necessary to end election speculation and the resulting uncertainty. In view of the uncertainty and the speculation surrounding the date for the 1980 election, will the Prime Minister confirm that he has already chosen 25 October as the date for the election for the House of Representatives? Will he confirm or deny that this date was chosen at the request of the Queensland Premier? Finally, is he satisfied that the advice offered to the Governor of Queensland by the Queensland Government in relation to section 12 of the Constitution will be for an election of senators in Queensland on the same date as the election for the House of Representatives and will not be on the same date as the election for the Legislative Assembly of Queensland?",46

81,Mr NIXON,PLANT VARIETY RIGHTS,"The proposal for a plant variety rights scheme first came forward as a result of resentations from the seed and plant breeders asgeneral sociations around Australia some years ago, and has been considered over the years by the Ausmade tralian Agricultural Council. It was decided that legislation ought to be enacted. As a result of differences of views between the seed industries told them that they would have to come to a con-known sensus on what form the legislation ought to takelegations before I was prepared to move forward with the proposed legislation. In the event, they have since agreed but the time had passed for the introducruption tion of legislation into the Parliament this I informed them then that I would be prepared introduce the legislation in the autumn session Parliament next year.",47

83,Mr NIXON,PLANT VARIETY RIGHTS,"I have every confidence that I will be able to. In addition to that, at the Agrisuggest cultural Council meeting in Brisbane a couple weeks ago, I gave the State Ministers an opportunity to reconsider their previous advice to the former Minister for Primary Industry that they wanted such legislation. But I also told them the proposed legislation which would be in the House could lie over the winter recess next year and would be debated during the following Budget session. This means that the legislation will be available for public comment and consideration for some months.

84,Mr HURFORD,BUREAU OF CUSTOMS,"The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs will be aware of grave allegations made by undercover agents and other members of the New South Wales branch of the Customs Officers Association of Australia of corruption and deliberate incompetence at more senior levels of the Bureau of Customs, with the. life of one informant apparently being threatened since the allegations were made. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that these allegations include claims that heroin, which was worth as much as a billion dollars at street value, was smuggled into the country despite the foreknowledge of the Bureau of Customs? Is it also a fact that another claim is that senior Customs officials have instructed their juniors to turn a blind eye to other breaches of Customs regulations, for instance those relating to pornography ? When did the Ministerfirstlearn of these allegations? What action has the Minister taken or what action does he propose to take as a result of these allegations?",47
85,Mr GARLAND,BUREAU OF CUSTOMS,"Some representatives of the rep-Customs Officers Association made a number of allegations of the kind referred to by the honourable member. These allegations were first about 18 months ago, so I am informed, and certainly were made earlier this year as well, the about the administration of that part of the DeI partment of Business and Consumer Affairs as the Bureau of Customs. Some of the aloccurred during the industrial disputes in January and February of this year. In August last year, following very similar claims about corin the Bureau of Customs, the then New session. South Wales branch secretary of the COA to reported in writing to the Department that he had of been misrepresented. The COA representatives had the opportunity of giving evidence about these matters to two royal commissions of which the honourable member will be aware. But from the reports of the commissions there is nothing to that there is any substance in the alleof gations or claims, as far as I can see. No details of the alleged corruption have been furnished to the Department in spite of a number that of written requests being made to the COA and officials to give particulars in support. I advised that the present secretary of the COA declined to respond to requests officer in New South Wales, the New South Collector of Customs. There has been a lot of tact between those officials and the Department. Mr Speaker, I seek permission to table some corquestion respondence between officials and Mr Spanswick of the COA. Before I do so I refer, Mr Speaker, with your permission to a sentence in one of letters which is dated August of last year. It In closing I would like to that if I was aware of any so called corruption in the Customs I would comply with Departmental requirements and inform the Chief Officer of same. I have asked the head of the internal affairs unit the Department of Business and Consumer Commission. Affairs, Mr R. A. Wilson, who is a former missioner of the Australian Capital Territory Police, to go to Sydney and seek to interview officials and to report to me on these latest allegations. I believe it is the duty and responsibility of those officials to co-operate with Mr Wilson after these even greater allegations have been made, though they would not do so with the New South Wales Collector of Customs. In conclusion, I say that the Government is determined to the Customs section of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs effective. No ment, I believe, has done more to endeavour prevent illicit imports, including drugs. All formation before me indicates that Customs works well and towards long standing objectives successive governments.

95,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"by leave-In relation to allegations of security breaches in the Office of National Assessbases ments, the Director-General of ONA, Mr political, Furlonger, asked the Director-General of Securmulated. ity, Mr Justice Woodward, to review security practices in ONA and to report. Subsequently there were further allegations of deliberate securcation ity breaches and the Director-General of Security was asked to investigate these also. Mr Justice Woodward has now reported on these matters and I have examined his findings. The report, as would be expected, deals with a number of matters of high security content and, in accordance WORK with normal practice in the Parliament and elseI do not propose to make the report public. I shall make it available to the Leader of the Opthe position (Mr Hayden) if he so wishes. However, view of the public and parliamentary interest the matter has attracted, I think I should indicate now in general terms what have been Mr Justice sought. When Woodward's findings. Mr Justice Woodward's reportfindsthat there is no credible evidence of any ONA document having got into the wrong hands, nor of the improper use of classified information by any ONA REVIEW officer, nor of any serious breach of security by ONA officer. And therefore no reason, arising 6 from the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation inquiry, to conclude that ONA is not a basically secure organisation. On the particular which attracted much public attention, of a missing security document, Mr Justice Woodward has reported that his investigation has established beyond reasonable doubt that the missing document was destroyed in ONA by an officer duty it was to dispose of unwanted papers and who in this instance had no reason to doubt that he was doing so legitimately. Before that haphowever, there was mishandling of the paper, about which the ASIO report is properly critical. The report nevertheless makes a number of recommendations for improvements in security procedures in ONA, and confirms other security measures already taken by the Director-General of ONA. It observes that its recommendations not be regarded as implying any culpable in ONA's former practices. As I have Mr Justice Woodward's report is available to the Leader of the Opposition if he so wishes. The Director-General of ONA, Mr Furlonger, has reported to me that he has taken, and is taking, action to implement the recommendations made in the ASIO report. It is of course essential that this be done. The Government attaches the highest significance to the work of ONA, and obits security is an essential part of its continuing overall effectiveness in contributing to the on which Australia's external policies in the strategic and economic fields are forThe ASIO report also provides the occasion to express and underline the Government's concern that there should be strict appliof security procedures and practices in all Commonwealth organistions. Steps are being taken, as it is deemed appropriate, to improve such procedures and practices and to ensure that the requirements are strictly observed. More recently there have been assertions in the media that in some way the Director-General of Security was pressed to change some of the ASIO findings about ONA practices, and in some way to water down the strength of his conclusions. I am informed by Mr Justice Woodward, in respect of this report, that it is false in every specific point made and in its implications. Mr Justice Woodward has written to me stating that he took all the significant decisions about the two parts of the report himself; that at no time did he decide that any of the contents were too damning to be given to me, as alleged-o r even consider such a question. His only concern was that the report should be absolutely accurate and as fair as his judgment could make it. Mr Justice Woodward rejects utterly the implication that in some way his report was watered down deliberately to meet some accommodation of ONA. May I say that I accept Mr Justice Woodward's assurance absolutely-as I am sure the House does also. Mr Justice Woodward's letter to me on this issue also is available to the Leader of the Opposition to peruse. Mr Speaker, not everything has been right in ONA's procedures. Actions of some officers gave ground for criticism. But things are being put right-hav e largely been put right-and there is no ground for any public apprehension about the basic security and continued value of ONA. Genuine debate and responsible and balanced criticism in respect of ONA or ASIO, or indeed any areas of Government administration, are to be expected and not shied away from. The criticisms of ONA and ASIO have tended to have the effect of undermining public faith in these two organisations. The Government for its part will continue to support and encourage ONA and ASIO in the proper discharge of their important responsibilities. I urge all others to do likewise.",49
96,Mr HAYDEN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"by leave-The key paragraphs in the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr great Malcolm Fraser) are paragraphs 4 and 5, and peat them because of their importance. Paragraph 4 states: Mr Justice Woodward's report ible evidence of any ONA document having got into the wrong hands, nor of the improper use of classified information by any ONA officer, nor of any serious breach of security by any ONA officer. And therefore no reason, arising from the ASIO inquiry, to conclude that ONA is not a basically secure organisation. That is a reassuring finding from a man whose prestige and standing as far as this Parliament is concerned, and certainly as far as the Opposition is concerned, is such as to leave us with every conviction that the job has been done properly and that the finding is one that can be accepted completely. In paragraph 5 the Prime Minister said: On the particular question, which attracted much public attention, of a missing security document Mr Justice Woodward has reported that his investigation has established beyond reasonable doubt that the missing document was destroyed in ONA by an officer whose duty it was to dispose of unwanted papers and who in this instance had no reason to doubt that he was doing so legitimately. So there are no grounds for the development of a conspiracy theory about subversion within the Office of National Assessments. Mr Justice Woodward, a trained judicial analyst, analysed all the evidence before him. He had the resources of trained investigators backing him and he came to that conclusion. That, too, is reassuring. He is candid in acknowledging that there have been defects internally, and they are being remedied. With Mr Furlonger in charge of the organisation one would anticipate that the defects, to the extent that they exist, will be quickly repaired. Mr Furlonger has an impressive record as an administrator and as a fair and impartial servant of the public and the Parliament. In view of the rather sensational, if not extravagant, statements that have been made in some quarters, I want to put on record the reasons why I feel relieved to discover that ONA has been given what is effectively a clean bill of health in this matter. I have had the benefit of drawing on ONA on several occasions for briefing on important and often sensitive matters relating to international affairs. I have been impressed enormously by the common sense of the officers of ONA and the way in which they have analysed the issues and arrived at what appeared to me to be quite sound, thoroughly sensible conclusions. I have been reassured to find a coincidence of views in the conclusions and understandings reached by and myself. It has been a matter of some unease tofindon so many important issues such a gulf between the Government's understandI reings and the conclusions and those of the accredited objective body charged with the duty of making sensible assessments on matters of international affairs. finds that there is no credNA NA Mr MALCOLM FRASE R (WannonPrime Minister)-by leave- I move: (1) That, in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of the Parliament House Construction Authority Act 1979, the House of Representatives(a) declares the preparation of a detailed design ment House (including specifications and tender documents) to be a declared ment House for the purposes of that Section; and (b) declares the preparation and excavation of the site of Parliament House to be a declared stage in the construction of Parliament House for the purposes of that Section. (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting the resolution agreed to by the House of Representatives.

It fits into the general landscaping of Capital Hill and the Parliamentary Triangle. When completed, it will serve the needs of Australia for as long as Australia survives. The Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House is expected to report shortly to the Parliament on the Construction Authority report. At the appropriate time, when the Joint Standing Committee's report has received and examined, the Government will members move substantive motions, as foreshadowed by this motion. Honourable members obviously will have an opportunity to debate the matter at time. In the meantime, they are encouraged to study the report of the Construction Authority, and the report of the Joint Standing Committee when it is available, and to that has been mounted and is available, which I am sure most honourable members will have examined.

101,Mr NIXON,AUTHORITY,"by leave-Honourable will recall that on 17 April 19801 undertook to make a statement once all investigations into the operations of Asia Dairy Industries that (Hong Kong) Limited had been completed. Regrettably, all investigations into this matter have not yet been completed, but I believe it is appropriate for me to advise the House as to the latest make use of the display position. As a result of a request by my predecessor in March last year, the accounts and records of ADI, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Australian Dairy Corporation have been examined by Commonwealth Auditor-General. The purpose of seeking the audit inspection was to assist the Government in its consideration of the future role and operations of ADI. The reports of the Auditor-General revealed certain deficiencies in the financial and managerial control of the in company, and questioned the appropriateness of certain past expenditure. I have previously stated be that the deficiencies in thefinancialand manabe gerial control were examined by a committee eson tablished by the Australian Dairy Corporation. Action has been taken, or is being taken, to rectify the deficiencies and ensure that the company operates in a normal commercial fashion. The only matter now outstanding in respect of the audit of ADI relates to the appropriateness of certain past expenditure by the former chairman of the company. This matter has been the subject and of detailed examination by officials. I have received legal advice from the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to the effect that certain matters arising out of this detailed examination should be reported to the police for further investigation. Upon receipt of that advice, and at my request, my Department has reported the matters in question to the Australian Federal Police for detailed investigation. In light of this, it would be improper to consider either tabling the Auditor General's reports, or comment further on the matter. As I have said in the past, I will make a statement on all aspects of the audit inspection when all investigations are completed.",51
102,Mr KERIN,AUTHORITY,"by leave- I must say, in speaking on behalf of the Opposition on this matter, that the Opposition is disappointed. The Government has now given a statement which indicates that the matter is quite serious, but we are concerned that it has taken so long to do so. In terms of the length of this inquiry, we must say that it is a feeble response, if not a pathetic one, to a serious matter. This should not be a partisan matter. One has only to look at the work of a Senate committee regarding statutory authorities to realise that there is a widespread concern for the proper administration and accounting of statutory authorities. The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) today asked a question about some complaints from that Senate committee and the Auditor-General regarding the Australian Wheat Board. This matter has been transformed into a partisan issue because the Government seems very reluctant to expose fully all the facts of a serious but seemingly straightforward misdemeanour. It has become partisan because of the length of time this matter has taken. Really, how much longer do we have to wait for a full and public explanation? Australia's international reputation is involved, yet this matter has dragged on literally for years. The Opposition and its spokesman on rural matters, Senator Peter Walsh, have never regarded this as a witch hunt. Recognition by the Auditor General of the whole matter shows how legitimate the Opposition has been in pursuing it. Senator Peter Walsh has been attacked by his political opponents and by the rural media because basically one of the principals in this long-running inquiry is a very popular person. The Opposition regrets the actions of some rural leaders in trying to transform this matter into an attack on Senator Peter Walsh. It is not a matter for sentiment just because personalities are involved. I draw the attention of the House to the statement today by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) in which there is reference to the police. Leaked copies of the Auditor-General's report have been widely published and most of us know what is in it-this is a very leaky Government. The Minister has had the report since May 1980. How much longer does the Minister need before he tables that report from the Auditor General? We know that Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd was operating what has been described elsewhere as a private slush fund for some directors and their families. These are serious charges. We need these sorts of statements laid to rest. The Opposition believes that the Minister has known basically the facts of this question for over a year. In fact two Ministers have had the information before them. Quite plainly and simply, the Oppositionfindsit hard to believe that this matter could not have been resolved by now. GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK: NA Ministerial Statement",52
103,Mr THOMSON,CAPRICORNIA SECTION ZONING PLAN,"Pursuant to section 33 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, I present the zoning plan for the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park together with a communique from the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council meeting of 1 August 1980.1 seek leave to make a statement relating to the plan. Leave granted. Mr THOMSONTh e Government's policies and initiatives concerning the Great Barrier Reef are based on the need to conserve this outstanding natural asset for all people, while allowing reasonable multiple uses to continue in a manner which is compatible with reef conservation. Finalisation of the Capricornia zoning plan is significant. It reflects a most intensive research and consultation program and demonstrates the Government's commitment to the careful planning of environmental protection to ensure that whatever is done is done effectively and efficiently. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Premier of Queensland agreed to establish the Ministerial Council, which comprises two Ministers from each Government. It is a focal point for co-operative effort between the Commonwealth and Queensland in the proper management and protection of the reef. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act specifically states that the Authority can perform any of its functions in cooperation with Queensland. It also provides that the Commonwealth Government may make arrangements with the Queensland Government for the performance of functions by Queensland officers. The establishment of the Ministerial Council to enable both governments to coordinate policy in relation to the reef has reinforced these provisions. The result is that the Commonwealth Government has been able to move rapidly towards the establishment of the marine park. The tabling of the Capricornia zoning plan and our moves towards declaration of a section of the marine park off Cairns provide solid evidence of the soundness of the Government's approach to the administration of the Act and the progressive establishment of the marine park as provided for by the Act. The Authority is required by the Act to invite interested persons to make representations in connection with the development of zoning plans for declared sections of the park. Representations made in relation to the Capricornia zoning plan were submitted to me together with comments from the Authority. The Act also provides for individuals or groups to channel their views to either myself or the Authority through the Great Barrier Reef Consultative Committee. By taking this co-operative approach and deliberately involving the public in the management process, the reef will be protected and conflicts between various activities will be minimised. The Capricornia section was chosen as the first section of the marine park as it is the most accessible part of the reef for tourists. Tourist and local use has increased significantly and management is necessary to provide for the protection of the area. Under the plan, the section is divided into six zones which provide a range of uses consistent with the conservation of the reef. There are two general use zones with very few restrictions, one providing for movement of shipping and trawl fishing and the other excluding these activities; two marine national park zones providing unrestricted public access for recreational activities, with certain conditions relating to recreational fishing and collecting; a scientific research zone; and a preservation zone providing areas protected in their natural state undisturbed by man except for approved scientific research purposes. Within certain zones, areas of periodic restricted activity are proposed for management and conservation purposes as described in the zoning plan. To ensure the most effective and efficient implementation of the zoning plan, the Commonwealth and Queensland governments are developGeneral ing a set of management principles and guidelines. The relevant Queensland agencies will have the responsibility for undertaking day-today manrier agement of the marine park. The aim is to rely much as possible on education and the cohensive operation of the public in order to achieve the objects of the marine park. However, as with any land park, regulations are required to confer functions and powers, and impose duties upon inspectors. Similarly, regulations proposed will provide for the imposition of penalties for infringements. When the regulations come into effect, probably later this year, an explanatory booklet will be made available to promote understanding of both the zoning plan and regulations. Considerable progress has also been made on a proposed section of the marine park off Cairns. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has assembled biological, physical and economic information and has evaluated public comment on this section. The Ministerial Council has invited the Marine Park Authority to examine and bring forward to the November meeting of the Council proposals for boundaries for the proposed Cairns section, and the full implication of these boundaries. It is anticipated that this section will be declared before the end of this year. Honourable members may have seen a recent statement claiming that the Marine Park Authority had completed the zoning work on the Cairns section in January. This is simply not true. No zoning plan for the Cairns section, in draft or any other form, has ever been prepared by or for the Authority. The Authority has insufficient information at this time to enable it to prepare a zoning plan. Before a plan can be prepared, the boundaries of the section must be defined, the section declared and public comment obtained on a proposal to prepare a zoning plan. These are the steps required by the Act. They were followed precisely in establishing the Capricornia section and its zoning plan. Experience in the preparation of the zoning plan for the Capricornia section has confirmed the wisdom of the Parliament in making provision for an effective public participation process under the Marine Park Act. I have previously expressed concern at statements claiming that the reef was not adequately protected. Some people still continue to call on the Government to proclaim without delay the entire remaining reef region a marine park. The procedure now being followed is precisely what was proposed by the then Labor Government and adopted by Parliament in terms of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. The Act specifically states that the Governorshall not proclaim an area to be part of the marine park except after consideration by the Executive Council of a Teport by the Great BarReef Marine Park Authority. To undertake a as thorough investigation and to prepare a comprereport covering the entire region would take the Authority a considerable period of time even if its resources were unlimited. A policy of progressive declaration allows each section of the reef to be thoroughly investigated prior to recomReef mending declaration and for the views of persons interested in the Reef to be taken into account. Whilst such consultation takes time, the Governis ment believes it to be an essential part of the aration for declarations of sections of the marine park and to the development of zoning plans for those sections. Zoning of the reef in accordance with the Government's objectives is not simply a matter of drawing lines on a map and promulgating a few rules. The zoning plan identifies many of issues which require careful and detailed considermore ation. The plan comprises six separate zones and two areas of periodic restricted use. These were determined after a comprehensive program of rement search and investigation. From those studies, boundaries, objectives and use and entry proto visions were prepared. The zoning plan deals detail with recreation, commercial and other fishing, the navigation and operation of vessels, the operation of aircraft, collecting, research, struction of facilities and visitor aids. Proposals for the regulation of various activities will obviBarrier ously extend to matters such as the discharge of waste, dumping of materials, littering and the like. In developing the plan, the basic aim has been to minimise regulations but, where regulation is necessary, to make it as simple as possible. Nevertheless, the zoning plan and regulations will provide a comprehensive basis for effective reef management and conservation in the area. While this process of progressive declaration is proceeding the entire Great Barrier Reef region safeguarded from damage as a result of the packcan age of policies and measures agreed between the Premier of Queensland and the Prime Minister. I have emphasised on several occasions and repeat that these policies are designed specifically to ensure the protection of the reef from drilling and mining and . to formalise arrangements to ensure that the provisions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act are fully and efficiently implemented through co-operation between the Ixtoc 1? two governments. The Government has been accused of avoiding questions relating to the reef. The opposite is true. The Government has issued frequent bulletins on its policies and initiatives. The most recent example are publications entitled 'The Reef, the Commonwealth Government and You' and 'The Great Barrier Reef-The Comis monwealth Government Role' which I have just released. I commend the pamphlet and booklet for the information of honourable members. Implementation of the Government's policies and initiatives will ensure that the Great Barrier and surrounding region remains a spectacular natural phenomenon to be used by people from Australia and the rest of the world. The reef an essential feature of the world heritage, an preparea of wilderness which must be protected at all costs. The zoning plan now before Parliament is evidence of that concern and of the Government's commitment to the conservation of our environment.",52
104,Mr COHEN,CAPRICORNIA SECTION ZONING PLAN,"by leave-The ministerial statement read by the Minister for Scithe ence and the Environment (Mr Thomson) is interesting for what it does not say than for what it says. For the last two years or more I have been trying to get some answers from the Governto the key questions. These are the questions that the people of Australia are asking. They want know the answers before they make a judgment in on the Government's policy with regard to the Great Barrier Reef. I gave the Minister a number of questions when I challenged him to debate this conmatter publicly. The first question is: Does the Government intend to permit drilling in the Great Reef region? I think that is a fairly clear, fairly concise and easily understood question. It is not obscure. I will repeat it: Does the Government intend to permit drilling in the Great Barrier Reef region? It is a question that the Government refuses to answer. The second question is: If so-that is, if it intends to permit drilling-wha t new scientific method has it discovered which will ensure that there will never be a blowout in the reef region? The third question is: If it is not aware of any new is fail-safe methods of preventing blowouts, how it give an assurance that 'it will permit only drilling that will not damage the reeF? The fourth question is: Is the Government aware of the reI cent blowout at Ixtoc 1 in the Gulf of Mexico which spewed 140 million gallons of light crude oil, of the most toxic type, into the ocean and which affected thefishing,prawning and tourist industries 800 kilometres away on the Texas coast not to mention the damage to the area around Thefifthquestion is: What is there to prevent a similar blowout on the Great Barrier Reef or in the Great Barrier Reef region? One has to be very careful with the use of words when one is dealing with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister. When one asks one question one given an answer to another question. They never answer the question that is asked. What is there to prevent a similar blowout on the Great Barrier Reef or in the region which would result in damage being caused to the fishing and tourist industries on the Queensland coast? The sixth question is: What guarantees can the Government give that a blowout will not permanently damage the world's greatest coral ecosystem? The seventh question is: If the Government does not intend to permit drilling, why does it not say so and why does it not declare the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park? The eighth question is: Why does the Government continue to assert that it does not have the staff to do the zoning of the various sections of the reef when it is common knowledge that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority had completed the preparatory work on the Cairns section in January? It is only the recalcitrance of the Queensland Government that has prevented a declaration of the Cairns section. The ninth question is: Why does the Government not proceed to declare the whole of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park thus preventing oil drilling or mining on the reef, ensure the protection of the reef and proceed with zoning over the next four or five years? Those are the questions that have to be answered. It is always very interesting to hear the Minister use words such as 'zoning'. But such words are relevant to the prime question. I have asked the some Minister to answer these questions. I have asked the Prime Minister to answer them. I invited the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) and the Minister, who represents the electorate of Leichhardt which is a key area along the Queensland coast-you r electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, is also a Barrier Reef seat-to debate this matter with me. I received the following reply to the letter I wrote to the Minister: Dear Barry, Thank you for your letter of 3 July concerning the on the Great Barrier Reef. I regret that I am unable your invitation. That is a very nice letter from the Minister. It very courteous letter as the Minister's letters always are. But it really does not explain why Minister is not prepared to meet me out in the public arena. The Minister has said before that he is prepared to debate this matter with me in place. Unfortunately there is no way of resolving an issue in this place. I can say something and Minister can say something which is quite or quite different from what I said. However, there is no way in which the people of Queensland or the people of Australia can cross examine tion either of us. This is not the case when a matter debated on television or in a public forum. The only question is: Will the Government assure the people of Australia that no oil drilling will be permitted in the Great Barrier Reef region. Any other answer, any other qualification or any equivocation can only be interpreted as meaning that the Government will permit drilling on the reef. That is the only interpretation that can be placed on this- I have used the word 'slick'; perhaps I should not use the words 'slick and oily'obscure, glib answer by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Science and the Environment when questioned on drilling in the reef region. Let me distinguish between the Great Barrier Reef and the Great Barrier Reef region. The headlines in the newspapers say ' ""No drilling on the Great Barrier Reef, says the Prime Minister'. That is terrific; everyone relaxes. But, that does not deal with the key question of the region. The reef constitutes only a small fragment of that whole area from the Torres Strait right down to near Fraser Island and the Capricornia section of the coast. It extends about 200 miles from the coast. It takes in all those waters and all that coastline. That is the Great Barrier Reef region. It does not matter very much whether one drills on the reef or near it. In fact, if there were a choice I irwould rather drill on the reef because at least on of the islands there is solidity and stability. It is in the waters off the reef that the real damage can be done. If a blow-out occurs at an oil well on the mainland, the oil can be contained. However, these oil blow-outs cannot be contained in water, unless one happens to be King Canute. I do not believe that the Minister is King Canute. That is the difficulty, and that is where the obfuscation arises. The Government talks about the reef, but not about the reef region. The Government claims it has control of the redebate gion under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to accept Act. That is not true. The Government will have the power only when the Act is declared. Yours sincerely, Queensland has the power, and who would trust DAVID THOMSON Queensland with anything to do with mining? In is a Queensland they would drill the gold out of their grandmothers' teeth if there were a quid in it. The the Government does not have the power. It has the power if it wished to use it, but it has shown no signs of willingness to use it to protect the whole this of the region. The Government now has power over the Capricornia section, for which the Ministhe ter has just provided the zoning details. We may wrong assume that soon the Government will have power over the Cairns section. Power over these regions is irrelevant in terms of the total protecof the reef. If oil drilling is permitted in any is other part of the reef, the same amount of damage can occur. It could be the case that 99 per cent of the reef is declared as a national park and one per cent is undeclared, but if there is drilling in that small area and a blow-out occurs, the whole area will be ruined. The Minister says that that would not happen and that the Government would not draw little circles around the oilrigsand drill only in those areas. Why would it not do that? It did it in Kakadu National Park. That was the most cynical exercise of all time. The Government declared one of the great eco-systems in Australia, and the world as a national park and then put little squares around Jabiru, Jabiluka, Nabarlek and Koongarra. It said that those places were not in the park. The Government was able to tell the conservationists that it did not permit mining in national parks. It is unbelievable. That is what can happen in the Great Barrier Reef region. The Government can draw little circles around all the oil wells and say, 1980. 'We are drilling in only a fraction of one per cent of the Great Barrier Reef region'. That is enough. It is like me saying I will cut out one per cent of the Minister, but unfortunately for him it will be his heart. It has been said that this Government ing an Act introduced by a Labor government. With all due respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a quite different situation. It really is amusing to hear the Government say that the Labor Government did this and that it must follow suit. Since when has anything done by the Labor Party become holy writ for the Liberal-National Country Party Coalition? Usually if it is something we have done members of the Government run around and change it. That used to be the golden rule-'The Labor Government did it so we will do the opposite'. Suddenly, the Government is quoting what we did. There was one difference. When we were in government there was not even a skerrick of a suggestion that we would permit drilling on the reef. There is nothing to stop the Government from changing the Act. The Opposition would support that; the procedures can be changed so that the Park can be declared and the zoning can be done afterwards. In fact, I believe that that can be done now. The Government can make the declaration to protect the reef and then it can go ahead with the procedures afterwards. I want to know why the Minister for Science and the Environment is so scared to debate this matter publicly. Is it because he knows that what I have said is correct? He knows that he has a brief that is impossible to defend in public. The stock answer is that there will be no harm to the reef. I know that the Minister is not a bad bloke but he does not have supernatural powers. If drilling is permitted there is a risk, and if there is arisk,this country, to its everlasting shame, will place the greatest coral eco-system in the world at risk and future generations will spit on our graves for having done that. Once it is ruined it cannot be brought back. The Minister's statement is interesting. It is an academic exercise. I think the people of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority have done a good job, but the real job will be done when this Government declares the whole of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. If this Government does not do it, I promise that one of the first acts of a Labor government, in about 10 weeks time, will be to do just that.

105,Mr SPEAKER,OIL DRILLING AT NOONKANBAH,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The increasing racial conflict in Western Australia as a result of the Western Australian Premier's insistence on oil drilling at Noonkanbah, WA. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",57
106,Mr WEST,OIL DRILLING AT NOONKANBAH,"It is ironic that Noonkanbah, the Aboriginal-owned pastoral lease which has been the site of so much confrontation this year, should have begun as a Federal Government project to restore a dignified lifestyle to the Yungngora community. Yet, when the lifestyle of these people was directly and savagely threatened, the Federal Government turned a blind eye to its responsibilities. In 1971 this community, then made up of pastoral workers on the white-managed pastoral lease, went on strike because of maltreatment. They were reduced to living in appalling and degrading conditions around Fitzroy Crossing, some 60 miles away. But, in 1976 the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission acquired the pastoral lease for the Yungngora community. The station, which is one million acres in size, was in ruin. The people have successfully restored Noonkanbah station to pastoral viability and have re-established their traditional way of life within a white community. Sacred sites have a special and particular significance to Aborigines. They believe that sacred sites are those places where the heroic ancestors travelled, forming the world, the people and the whole blueprint for life. These sites are the subject 1980. of religious celebrations by which Aboriginal people protect the sites and renew their religion and associations with the land. Wherever Aboriginal people have been able to continue their culture, these sites have been an integral part of it. Bill They form the nuclei of particular Aboriginal people's association with their land, passed on to them by their ancestors, and are thus central to the Aborigines' very existence. In Western Australia sacred sites should be protected under the State Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 which empowers the Western Australian Museum to investigate, recommend and declare sacred sites. However, the Minister for Cultural Affairs, at present Mr Grayden, has the power to override the Museum recommendations. In June 1979, after an extensive survey of Noonkanbah, the Museum compiled a report on the sacred sites. It recommended that, amongst others, the areas bounded by No. 1 and No. 2 drill sites chosen by Amax Exploration (Australia) Inc. should be protected. But, Western Australia's unsavoury and arrogant Minister for Cultural Affairs, Mr Grayden, very swiftly used his veto powers and overrode the Museum. Amax gained authority to drill for oil at Noonkanbah in early 1979. In addition, 30 different mining companies and prospectors have pegged out 600 separate exploration tenements on Noonkanbah. It is little wonder that the people are worried for their future on that station. Let me briefly run through the appalling events of the last five months. On 2 April the Noonkanbah community forced off the site the water drilling company contracted by Amax. In July the State Government foreshadowed amendments to restrict even further the Aboriginal Heritage Act, although the Minister still has power to override the recommendations of the Museum. On 24 July the Western Australian Government declared the road through the station a public road and excised the drilling site from the pastoral lease. The community had proposed a compromise to the State Government, including a re-mapping of the area by the Museum and the State Government's acceptance of any recommendations. The Government rejected the community's proposal and then launched the infamous 'operation convoy'. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter from the Noonkanbah community, signed by Joe Wunmah, Mick Michael, George Bell and Bob Mululby, to the Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, which adequately sets out the terms of the proposed compromise agreement. Leave granted. The document read as followsTo: Sir Charles Court, We have asked Mr Ernie Bridge to deliver this letter to you for your consideration. We want to put these proposals to you as a way of reaching agreement on the question of mining on Noonkanbah. We hope you will accept this as effort to resolve these difficult questions. The main thing is we must know that all our sacred places will be safe from mining and that you will believe our word about these places. We have asked Ernie Bridge to take this word to you and now we wait for your answer. NA NA 1. The Community agrees to carry out a program of mapping of sacred areas on the Station in conjunction with the Museum and Community Anthropologists by stages as follows: (a) the area along the Fitzroy River from Paradise to Quanbun boundary and the end of this year; (b) balance of the Station done within eighteen months. 2. Mapping to be done on the following conditions: (a) the Government is to accept any future recommendations of the Museum; (b) the mapping to be carried out with the present Aboriginal Heritage Act to apply; (c) no mineral exploration to be carried out on the Station until the mapping is done, then such exploration to be done through negotiation between the parties involved. 3. To that end the Community undertakes to negotiate with the Government towards terms and conditions for such mining exploration and developments on these areas of the Station which are not aboriginal sites within the meaning of the Aboriginal Heritage Act. 4. No drilling on protected areas or mineral exploration of any kind within such areas. 5. A promise from the Government that it will accept any further recommendations from the Museum about the protection of sacred areas. 6. A promise that there will at no time be mining or drilling in the area delineated by the Museum Report of 1979 and recommended for protection. 7. The cancellation of all mineral leases held in the area mentioned in paragraph 6. 8. This Agreement to be properly drafted by Government and Community Solicitors and signed by both parties. Signed by: Joe Wunmah Mick Michael George Bell Bob Mululby",57
107,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT AND YUNGNGORA COMMUNITY,"This secretly contrived 53-vehicle convoy was resisted by Aboriginal communities, clergymen and unionists on the way to Noonkanbah. More than 50 people were arrested. Some 32 trucks were used in the convoy, more than 30 police were present, and 20 police wagons were used. The cost to the Western Australian Government for the police and the officers of the State Yungngora Community, Emergency Service, and for organising the use of Noonkanbah Station, Main Roads Department bulldozers, graders and 18 July 1980 two trucks to clear the road of vehicles in the convoy's path was $500,000. It should be pointed out that the Commonwealth shares part of that cost through its tax-sharing arrangements with the States. being made in good faith in a real I visited the area on Sunday, 10 August, and I was revolted by the scene at the drilling site. The entire area was surrounded by a fence of cyclone wire topped with razor wire 10 feet high. The perimeter was guarded by large numbers of State police. Here, in Western Australia, was a scene straight from racist South Africa set up by the Western Australian Government and condoned by this Federal Government through its inertia and inadequacy. The most disgraceful expedition any Australian government has ever launched, was the description used by Professor Charles Rowley, the former Chairman of the Aboriginal ten miles north of the river by Land Fund Commission, which bought Noonkanbah for the Yungngora community in 1976. This disgusting power nexus between the State and Federal governments was broken by the announcement of the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions on 12 August that no union labour would be used on the site until an appropriate agreement was reached between the community and the company. The members of the Australian Workers Union, to their everlasting credit, have refused to work this scab rig, and Richter Drilling, the contractor to Amax, has stated that it is not prepared to use non-union labour. The Court Government in Western complying Australia- I say this advisedly-is determined crush the Noonkanbah community. It is deliberaable tely sacrificing Aboriginal people mining and development policy. Premier Court's attitude towards Aboriginal people has been clear throughout this whole miserable exercise. He has without threatened, insulted and savagely attacked them sternation. with the full power of the State police, and has made outrageous media statements. He has said that it will be impossible to approve a pastoral station for another Aboriginal group. He has said that taxpayers will be bitter because public funds have been given to the Aborigines. He has further stated that the Aborigines, Professor Berndt, other leading anthropologists were lying about the religious nature of Aboriginal relationship to He said: 'We now find that the true objectives the people attacking the Government are land rights and royalties'. The Noonkanbah people have denied repeatedly that they want royalties. They want their land. The issue is one of land rights because of the religious nature of land the implications of sacred sites. The Premier has attacked the Minister for original Affairs (Senator Chaney). On 8 August the West Australian he ridiculed Senator Chaney's pathetic plea for compensation for the Yungngora community. Court said: If the drilling program ends with this year's activity Yungngora community will have nothing but an additional water source and improvedroadsto remind them of it. He is denying Aborigines their religious feelings. No white Australian would tolerate such callous disregard for their religion or their culture. more racist and disgusting have been the rerebutted sponses of Court's Minister for Cultural Affairs, the abysmal Mr Grayden. He has said that culKimberleys tural freedom and land rights for Aborigines in Western Australia should be kept out of his State like a noxious weed, and that the Noonkanbah sacred sites are not genuine. In one sentence he dismissed completely the whole body of anthropological knowledge and the Museum's work. all. Grayden said in the Western Australian Parliament on S August that Aborigines sit around drinking alcohol and playing cards and two-up. He called Aboriginal communities junk-yards. He has hidden in a cowardly way behind his parliamentary privilege to slander Aboriginal people. When the Western Australian Aboriginal Legal Service had the audacity to announce that it would take action on his racist attacks he called for the abolition of the Aboriginal Legal Service across the nation. Senator Chaney has been written off by Aboriginal Australia. He has engaged in hypocrisy, double-speak and duplicity by pathetically attacking Court on the one hand and by with the Prime Minister on the other. to On 11 March-this is the best comment honourmembers will have ever heard-Senato r to its gung ho Chaney said: The rumour that the company would enter the property notice and with police protection-cause d great conrest. It is good that the Premier has put that rumour to Yet in July Senator Chaney was at Noonkanbah standing over the Aboriginal people. He told them that it was inevitable that drilling would take place and that they should try to make the best of the situation. On 4 August he and his predecessor, and the present Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), who is sitting opposite, said in land. the West Australian that a mediating structure of should be provided to work out the best solution and to provide for compensation. They showed that they understood the Aboriginal association with the land in that West Australian article. They made an emotional but pathetic plea for a and reasonable approach to Noonkanbah. They said: 'Quite simply, the Aborigines believe that if their land is destroyed, then they too are destroyed.' AbThey criticised Court's insensitivity and lauded in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act which I remind honourable members was introduced in this Parliament by a Labor Government in 1975. They stated that justice for Aborigithe nes, as provided by that Act, could be given only by politicians, not by police, courts or trade unionists, and they called for an accommodation of interests at Noonkanbah. But what attempt was made to create an accommodation of Even interests? Their own Prime Minister had already their remarks. On 2 July the Prime Minister told the Aboriginal people at Broome in the that 'Australia needed to build up its oil reserves and this could not happen if drilling was stopped or delayed'. The Prime Minister said that oil drilling must proceed at Noonkanbah. Mr Cotter-He didn't say that at Broome at",58
108,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT AND YUNGNGORA COMMUNITY,"The Prime Minister said that oil drilling must proceed at Noonkanbah. How much longer will the national government tamely accept, in this servile way, being stood over by arrogant, dictatorial and awful old man, the Premier of Western Australia? How much more ahuse of Aboriginals will it tolerate from this bigoted State Government? The truth is that, despite all the rhetoric about Aboriginal self determination, this Government has been shown clearly to be repressive and anti-Aboriginal by simple virtue of its refusal to act and to use its Federal powers. Why is Court so insistent on drilling? Does he really expect Amax to find oil? The answer is no. I contacted the General Manager of the Amax operation and was told that the chances of striking hydrocarbons at Noonkanbah are no better than 50 to one. The Western Australian Government knows that popular opinion on land rights is moving the Aborigines way. But, that Government's view is quite simple: It wants no land rights; no recognition of sacred sites; no ognition of Aboriginal culture; no right to negotiate the right to mine on Aboriginal land. In short, it seeks to crush the Aboriginal's morale at Noonkanbah, once and for all. Quite clearly, unless the Prime Minister withdraws support for Charles Court's actions and policies, the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Chaney, ought clearly to resign. He supports land rights in the States; he understands the Aborigines unique relationship with their land; he knows the significance of the sites; he espouses self-determination for all Aboriginal organisations. With all these fundamental Aboriginal causes, I agree. Labor agrees; the trade unions agree; the majority of the Australian people agree; but the Prime Minister does not agree with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The Prime Minister supports black rights in Africa, but says that drilling must proceed at Noonkanbah. That is another example of his duplicity.",59
109,Mr GILES,GOVERNMENT AND YUNGNGORA COMMUNITY,What rot!,60
110,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT AND YUNGNGORA COMMUNITY,"Why does he not do something about it? Why does he not stop this monster in WA? The Federal Government has the power and the responsibility. In the show-down between mining companies and Aboriginals, with this Government the Aborigines will come last every time. Senator Chaney is jammed between Court and the Prime Minister. He is a prisoner of his ligerent State colleagues. He has been sold out by his own Prime Minister. I congratulate the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the clergy and all those who supported these people. I hope they will continue that support. It should not be a trade union function to protect the Australian Aboriginals; it is the rethis sponsibility of the Federal Parliament. The Prime Minister must withdraw his support for Court and resolve the immediate problem of Noonkanbah by acquiring under section 51 of the Australian Constitution the sacred sites and areas at Noonkanbah. Failing that, if the Government is not willing to stop Court, Senator Chaney, as an honourable man-and I believe he is underneath-and as a result of his expressed criticism of the Western Australian Government, must resign.",60

112,Mr VINER,GOVERNMENT AND YUNGNGORA COMMUNITY,Listenin g to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) rec- it seems to me that the mark of the success of a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is to have someone call for his resignation. I think the Premier of Queensland called for my resignation three times. I think even the Premier of Western Australia called for my resignation at one time. Mr West- I do not want to see him resign; I want to see him act.,60

116,Mr VINER,GOVERNMENT AND YUNGNGORA COMMUNITY,"The honourable member for Cunningham also made some most disparaging remarks about the Premier of Western Australia. They are quite unbecoming in this House, and advance his argument in no way at all. Let me just remind him that the Premier is regarded as one of bel- the most dynamic premiers ever of Western Australia and one of the most dynamic premiers in Australia. He has brought more advancement, both social and economic, to the people of Western Australia than any Labor premier before him. So, let not those sort of things be said of Sir Charles Court. I have lived through a number of situations where the Commonwealth has had to come into conflict with the States in Aboriginal affairs. Members such as the former member for Fremantle, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) and the former member for MACKellar,",60
117,Mr WENTWORTH,GOVERNMENT AND YUNGNGORA COMMUNITY,"a very highly respected Minister for Aboriginal Affairs-hav e had to fight for Aboriginal interests right throughout Australia. It seems to be the lot of any Commonwealth Minister that he must do so. I have admired the way in which Senator Chaney has fought for Aboriginal interests at Noonkanbah and other places around Australia. Let me state clearly the Commonwealth's position: The Commonwealth has consistently expressed its view to all parties that conflict should be settled by negotiation, not by confrontation. Yet, the call of the Opposition in this matter of public importance is for confrontation. If there is one lesson that has been learned over many years of Aboriginal affairs, it is that not succeed. It is easy to advocate development projects proceeding regardless of all other consequences. I know there are people in this community who hold that view. It is also easy to argue for the protection of Aboriginal interests at all costs. I know there are people in this community who argue that point of view. But the real challenge is to allow development of Australia's natural resources-so essential for the benefit of all Australians-to proceed and, at the same time, to provide properly for accommodation of Aboriginal interests. The essence of the article which Senator Chaney and I wrote and which was published in the West Australian was that there needed to be an accommodation of interests. That was precisely the task which the Federal Government set itself with regard to the development of the great uranium deposits in Arnhem Land; an accommodation of interests which beforehand people considered were irreconcilable. These included accommodation of mining interests, accommodation of conservation interests and accommodation of Aboriginal interests. The resolution of those interests in the Northern Territory, I think, will stand the test of time. The Commonwealth has consistently recognised the responsibility of the States for land tenure and granting of mining rights and has accepted that mining cannot be prevented on pastoral leases. As I have said, the Noonkanbah dispute cannot be settled by confrontation; it can be settled only by compromise on both sides. Unless there is a willingness to come to terms with the reality of the need for accommodation there will be nothing but bitter resentment and a deeper widening of the gulf that separates the black and white people of Western Australia. The Commonwealth has a clear direct interest in this matter on three bases: Firstly, on the basis of the 1967 referendum which gave to the Commonwealth power to make laws with Tegard to the Aboriginal people; secondly, in the national interest to bring about a reconciliation and a harmony between all the races which populate Australia; and thirdly, a clear international interest to have regard to the way in which the rest of the world looks upon what we do within our own continent. At the heart of this dispute is, as Senator Chaney and I said, the question of land. Our article states: At the heart of the Act That is, the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act is the specialrelationshipthat Aborigines have with their land. This is at the heart of Noonkanbah. It is what sacred confrontation does sites are all about. Unless and until that is recognised there cannot be a reconciliation of interests. Therefore, I regret that so many people in Western Australia speak of the Noonkanbah people, the Yungngora community of Aboriginal people, as detribalised; in other words, devoid of any traditional interest with respect to the land which makes up the Noonkanbah pastoral lease. That proposition is wrong, and unless that is recognised, as I say the necessary reconciliation, the necessary accommodation, cannot be achieved. The dispute centres upon the question of what protection should be accorded not to specific sacred sites but to what have been described as areas of influence surrounding such sites and in particular, whether such areas lying between major sites should be closed to mineral exploration and development. As we know, the Noonkanbah dispute derives from the desire of Amax Exploration (Australia) Inc. to drill in an area of influence rather than on any specific sacred sites, the closest of which is 1.25 kilometres from the drilling rig. The Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act provides for the protection of places including any sacred ritual and or ceremonial site which is of importance or of special significance to persons of Aboriginal descent. Mr West-What did the Museum say about that?",61
118,Mr VINER,GOVERNMENT AND YUNGNGORA COMMUNITY,"The interpretation of the Western Australian Museum is that areas of influence come within that definition, either as an area of sacred ritual or a ceremonial site or as an area of special significance to persons of Aboriginal descent. Therefore, the essence of the question is: 'How does one protect the Aboriginal interests while allowing development of the prospective natural resources on the Noonkanbah property?' The Western Australian Government proposes to amend its Act. I hope and I know that Senator Chaney hopes that the amendment will not simply clarify-whateve r that might mean-the provisions of the Western Australian Act but give adequate machinery for protection by Aboriginals of their traditional interests. The honourable gentleman has sought to criticise the Prime Minister and to assert that in his statements he has shown no interest in Aboriginals. I wish to put the record straight because it is important to do so. The Prime Minister met an Aboriginal delegation at Derby on Tuesday, 1 July 1980. In answering a question from Jimmy Beiundurry, the local National Aboriginal Conference member, the Prime Minister said: On the question of sacred sites, as I understand it, I do not know of any difference between the Aboriginal people, the people of Noonkanbah, the Western Australian Government or the Commonwealth Government. There has been an absolute commitment on the part of the Premier, Sir Charles Court, that sacred sites will be protected and that of course is the view of the Commonwealth and the view I am quite certain that you want us to adopt . . . sacred sites must also be protected, and there must also be rules that protect a particular community-in this case, the Noonkanbah community rule for access and I know that there is no disagreement between governments on that point. Later, answering another question from Jimmy Beiundurry, the Prime Minister said: Having in mind that sacred sites are to be protected and must be protected, it is my firm belief that drilling for oil must be impeded. This is a pastoral lease and it is in conformity with pastoral leases in Western Australia to enable mining or drilling for oil to take place. And therefore I think it ought be allowed to do so. In order that the record remains straight, I ask for the whole of the passages from which I have quoted to be incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. Jimmy Bieundurry Again, I would like to ask Mr Fraser about-in Western Australia as you know, and everyone else knows, and just cross the border, which has been introduced by the Federal Government in Northern Territory we have land rights and haven't got any ownership we are missing some of these and haven't got any ownership we are leasing some of these places and our own name and our Aboriginal name or whatever the organisation, so we can really say, this is where we belong to and this is what we want to own. Your policies are quite simple and have recognised the land rights in the Northern Territory and the only difficult landrightssituation in Western Australia and the States where Aboriginal people would have, or buy land, or to have business enterprise of any sort of development then is set up rather than just in communities and you know, all sitting together-300,40 0 people sitting in one place just getting social security service, but we want to spread out and set up our own thing and this is the kind of thing, one or two families, three families, wanted to get at, and are looking at on the issue regarding to, in relation to, land rights. So, I think that in some cases we want, we would urge to ask and taken you aside and ask some ways of assistance. Prime Minister The Commonwealth policy in the Northern Territory has been operating for some time and I think it has worked quite well. Senator Chaney and Ian Viner before him have expressed the policy of the Commonwealth in relation to these matters. We believe in the principle behind the policy, the principle in relation to land rights. But at the same time, it is a matter in which we believe that the States themselves should make a decision in relation to the States, and that of course, is important in relation to Western Australia. There are leases here which are the same as the kind of possession that can be available to other people but part of what your question was about as I understand it, was not just sitting down in a community and receiving social service payments but being able to get up and do things and being responsible for themselves. I think that is an admirable and a proper objective. There are two things I would say about that. The Development Commission itself would have a role in assisting aboriginals to do things to establish enterprises on their account, and so, we as a Government, look to it as a significant one of the initiatives, and I hope it is looked at in the same way by the aboriginal people. I think that that is the important thing. I do not know at this point that there is much more that I can say about it because there are some things which do need to be determined within a State and by a State. The policies in relation to those matters need to be determined. If they are not, I think that no matter what the Commonwealth might do, the policy will not work harmoniously and well 'to the advantage of aboriginals themselves. So, I would hope over time the policies that have worked in the Northern Territory can become an example . . . (inaud) . . . to the wider sphere in Australia. Jimmy Bieundurry (reading a letter from the Noonkanbah Community handed up by George Bell) 'Canberra Government has the power not from the 1968 Referendum to make laws and help Aboriginal people. We want them to use this power to stop Charlie Court making the road public and taking the drilling area away from to the Noonkanbah lease and also to stop any drilling on sacred land'. The problems I would like to stress on that one is about the Federal Government. In the 1967 Referendum when the Government refused to take to . . . (inaud) overrun it and whatever the development is. That is the State Government has more power and also the Federal Government has more power to overrun us on this because of the 1967 Federal Referendum. I would like to hand that over to you to think about it and take it up in your Parliament time on behalf of the Noonkanbah Community. Prime Minister Thank you very much. There are just one or two things I would like to say about this problem which I know is a matter which has concerned a number of people. It is not a matter which can be resolved today. But I would like to say one or two things which are I think important-to state the principles which I think guide this particular matter. On the question of sacred sites, as I understand it, I do not know of any difference between the Aboriginal people, the people of Noonkanbah, the Western Australian Government or the Commonwealth Government. There has been an absolute commitment on the part of the Premier, Sir Charles Court, that sacred sites will be protected and that of course is the view of the Commonwealth end the view, I am quite certain, that you would want us to adopt. There is also agreement, as I understand it, on the need for proper rules for access so that the community would not be disturbed by other activities, so that the community would be properly protected by it. But I do want to put it to you that Australia is short of oil, that drilling that is intended to take place at Noonkanbah is drilling for oil, and this is an important national objective, an important objective for all Australians, including of course, the Aboriginal people. Many of you drove long distances to come here today, and a good deal of the oil we have to use comes from overseas. It is important that we try and build up our own reserve and make Australia as a nation more independent, more self sufficient from suppliers overseas. That cannot happen if drilling for oil all around Australia to be stopped or is to be held up. Having in mind that sacred sites are to be protected and must be protected, it is my firm belief that drilling for oil must not be impeded. This toral lease and it is in conformity with ern Australia to enable mining or drilling for oil to take place. And therefore I think it ought in mind again what I said, sacred sites must also be protected, volves and there must also be rules that protect a particular had community-in this case, the for access and I know that there is no governments on that particular point. There has been a good deal of publicity about matters Noonkanbah and at this point there is only one other thing that I would urge on all the people at Noonkanbah, indeed any community-whethe r it is an Aboriginal community any other. But, especially perhaps in matters of this kind. think in matters of this kind where there are strong sometimes, sharply held views, it is very important for munity to look to its elders; with great experience and with wisdom in guarding that comvation munity's affairs. I think if that happens in the Noonkanbah community, it will assist in making the resolution of this matter more easy. know there are matters in which members of the Noonkanbah community feel strongly. But, sultation, discussion and negotiation, I believe that that is something that should occur with the traditional elders seniors of the Noonkanbah people. much else that I can add to this problem at the moment, except to remind you that there are national there are important Aboriginal objectives which are not in pute. Perhaps the only other thing which I feel I should say that the problems to which we all seek to address ourselves, one of the reasons why I am here today to listen to you to your views, one of the reasons why we have the National Abprinciple original Conference, why we have the Development Comand mission and (it is going to be run by Aboriginals for and on half of the Aboriginal people) is because we believe that these matters need to be determined sensibly, interests that must be taken into account in Australia, and that there needs to be consultation, as there has been, needs to be understanding, as I believe there has been, there is a need for national objectives also to be pursued. Everything that I have said is against the background that it is a firm commitment of the West Australian Government which has obviously the strong support of the Federal Government to see that sacred properly denned and properly protected. That is a firm, and total commitment of the Premiers and of the Western Australian Government. Against that commitment, I would have thought it should be possible for the matters which stirred some people in relation to Noonkanbah to be solved and settled without difficulty. But I again would urge that the people of Noonkanbah should listen to their elders in relation to these particular matters, and turn aside from any path of confrontation or something that might lead to difficulty in that way. (general clapping of approval). Peter Yu I don't really think your answer on Noonkanbah is satisfacthe tory. If the State Government had kept its word about protecting sacred sites, there would have been a resolution by now. They have completely ignored the views of the Noonkanbah people which are that the elders are the ones who are making the decisions. You are implying that it is somebody else giving advice to the community. You are not recognising the intelligence of the people and the level of intelligence of the elders at Noonkanbah to be able to make their own decisions. What has also happened in another incident at Argyle was that the Western Australian Museum, an is official body recognised by the State, carried out a site survey on the C.R.A. mining tenement who were not supposed to work within one kilometre of a particular site. We go there is a pasand at that site, find there was a big hole in it. pastoral leases in WestPrime Minister I am glad to hear you say that the problem is one that into be allowed to do so. Having sacred sites only, because on some of the reports, there been other issues put as being matters that had been raised in relation to Noonkanbah and to have you confirm that it is a Noonkanbah community rule question disagreement between sites, is, Iofthink, the sacred sites, and only a question of the sacred a very useful thing. I am also glad to hear you say that it is indeed the elders who are governing this matter at for the people of Noonkanbah because, against the commitment that Sir Charles Court has made, that sacred sites will be on protected and I do not believe that there is anyone in the or whole of Western Australia who would ever say that Sir I Charles, if he gives his word on a matter, then that's it, and views, and that it is kept, and kept absolutely. a comThe State Government is totally committed to the preserto look to those in the community of the sites. The Commonwealth Government has total commitment and support of the State Government in that, and Noonkanbah people want the sacred sites protected. Now, against that background, I would believe that it ought to be possible to resolve this particular matter, and I am glad to I have you say that there are not other issues which, could or had in fact, been raised in the past in relation to it. where there is a need for con",61

But it is important befor all of us-aborigina l and for all other Australians that we have a capacity to resolve these matters by consultation and having in mind all the negotiation. there Again, for the correctness of the record, I seek but leave to incorporate in Hansard the total passage from which that quotation is taken. Leave granted. NA NA sites of Aboriginal people are Sunday 6 July 1980 Prime Minister Sir Charles had made sure that I was accompanied by various State Ministers for different parts of the visit and I appreciate that. The Acting Premier was with me at Derby. I would just like to mention there that there was, as I believe, a constructive, useful and friendly meeting with a number of people from the aboriginal community who had come from many different places-som e of them 700 or 800 kilometres from Derby. Noonkanbah, obviously was raised and I made plain at that particular meeting part, we stood as one with the State, infirmlybelieving supporting the State in a State commitment to preserve sites. Also I indicated that the support of the State termination in the national interest, that drilling must, appropriate time proceed; but went on to say that those at Noonkanbah should listen to their elders and that 'it firm belief, and it remains myfirmbelief, that it is a that can be resolved by negotiation and consultation. sult of discussions that I have had with Senator Chaney which the Acting Premier has also had with Senator Chaney-thos e consultations with the elders at Noonkanbah are likely to take place.

For Australia and Australia's national interests the important principle is being able to where that is necessary and it is important that that served.

And the Commonwealth will certainly co-operate with all its resources in helping to achieve that objective.",63
120,Mr VINER,TO SPEECH AT THE STATE COUNCIL PERTH,"That principle which the Prime Minister enunciated was precisely the principle which the Commonwealth and the Aboriginals of Arnhem Land had to face with regard to the Ranger project. It was resolved there by long, patient negotiation and consultation, but that consultation and negotiation required one thing to succeed. It required the participation of all parties, and I emphasise that. I shall nominate the parties which must be involved. Firstly, the company concerned must be involved. Here, of course, it is Amax. It must be directly involved in the negotiations. It cannot be involved through an intermediary. It cannot be vicariously involved; it must be directly involved. Secondly, the Aboriginal people themselves must be involved on a basis of integrity and trust so that they are met on common ground, not denying to them the intelligence to be concerned about and to look after their own interests, nor denying to them the capacity to make their own judgments, quite apart from those who are scribed as outsiders, stirrers and the like. I met Chaney). those kind of people over Ranger, Aurukun and Mornington Island. Thirdly, the state Governattention ment must be involved. Fourthly, the Commonmember. wealth must be involved. Only when those four parties get around a table together is there any hope of resolution on the basis that I have suggested. Above all, it must be acknowledged by both sides of the House that solutions imposed upon Aboriginal communities are not acceptable to them and can rarely be acceptable to the munity as a whole. The Commonwealth it believe that in situations such as Noonkanbah solthat on the Commonwealth's and utions imposed on the State Government would sacred be lasting. Clearly the most effective solution is and its deone in which, as I have said, all parties are inat the volved and which all parties accept and are prewas my pared to work together towards achieving and one matter in which the interests of all parties are respected.

Much of that criticism was made not to his face but behind his back. sites and the protections of Again, if there is one thing that we learnt from drill for oil Aurukun, Mornington Island and Ranger and be prefrom introducing land rights into the Northern for all Territory, it was that where Aboriginal affairs are concerned no side wins from an act of political by the warfare. Within the Australian Federal political at structure we do have States and we do have a in Commonwealth. Each has its own responsibilities and its own jurisdiction. Whatever the solution at Noonkanbah, the people of Noonkanbah must live with it because they live in Western Australia and within the social, economic and political life of Western Australia. Therefore a solution must be found which gives them an equal place in the social, political and economic life of that State, one which as I have said and as the Prime Minister has said, protects the Aboriginal interests.",64

Indeed, it action under that constitutional authority when it purported to provide self-management for the people at Aurukun and Mornington Island.

The honourable member continues to use the term that the Chair required him to withdraw. Whilst he does not attach that term to any particular member, as a result of his earlier remarks there can be no doubt as to the allusion.",65
131,Mr DAWKINS,TO SPEECH AT THE STATE COUNCIL PERTH,"I am referring to the treachery of the Government. The treachery of the Government has been extended because of the way in which the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs co-authored an article which appeared in the West Australian newspaper on 4 August. In that article they eloquently made out a case for a new legal framework to protect the interests of Aborigines in Western Australia. In their article they made a plea for a negotiated settlement which recognised the prior Aboriginal ownership of the land and the central importance of land to Aboriginal spirituality. That is the case which they have made out; that is the case which they say they support. But they will take no action. Today the Minister has said that it is necessary to avoid confrontation. I do not know where the Minister has been for the last two weeks. Confrontation has arrived. The Western Australian Government organised a paramilitary operation involving 57 trucks, supported by 40 policemen. It involved the arrest of 20 people at Noonkanbah. What on earth is that if it is not confrontation? Is that confrontation? That is the confrontation which we said months ago that the Government could avoid. The shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I awaited the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and told him what was necessary and what action he could take in order to avoid the confrontation that has now taken place at Noonkanbah and every mile from Eneabba to Noonkanbah up the length of Western Australia. That is the confrontation we were trying to avoid. That is the confrontation which this Government, through its took inaction, in fact precipitated. What could be confrontationist about this Government simply with the stroke of a pen acquiring the land at Noonkanbah and acquiring the minerals that are in that land? That is not confrontationist. That is simply a responsible exercise of its constitutional power. If some dispute develops as a result of this action with the Western Australian Government there are plenty of processes to which it can appeal. The High Court of Australia exists to sort out any dispute which might arise between the State Government and the Federal Government as a result of that action. That is not confrontationist. What it would do overnight with a stroke of pen would be to take this whole issue out of the area of police activities and out of the area of something akin to warfare. That is what it would do. It would remove it from the confrontation which the Western Australian Government has been absolutely determined to pursue over the last few weeks. It is the fact that this Government, this Minister and his colleague in the Senate, have refused to do it which is the crime. That is their guilt. Their failure to act leaves them just as culpable as the Western Australian Government in its horrendous, brutal and authoritarian activities over the last couple of weeks. That was the action of a megalomaniac determined to get his way. Yet this Government, through its inaction, has simply' condoned it. If the Government of Western Australia does get its way it will be this Minister, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who will have blood on their hands. Let them remember this and let no one ever forget it. They will be participating Mr Martyr-You do not like Charlie, do you?",65
132,Mr DAWKINS,TO SPEECH AT THE STATE COUNCIL PERTH,"Leave Charlie out of it. Charlie has got nothing to do with it. The fact is that it is the grinning Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, who was the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the grinning Minister who has put his name to an article which has supported the spirituality of the Aboriginal people who is the one who will have blood on his hands as a result of the activities of the Premier of Western Australia. He has the Premier of Western Australia acting for him. He does not have to take responsibility directly, he thinks. But I say that the Western Australian Government does get its way this Minister and the Minister in the other place will be just as much participants in a further destruction of one fragile part of Aboriginal society. If he has an ounce of decency in his soul the consequences of that participation will haunt him, will haunt Chaney and will haunt Fraser for the rest of their days.

134,Mr DAWKINS,TO SPEECH AT THE STATE COUNCIL PERTH,"I think everybody knows who I am talking about. They will be haunted for the rest of their days because what they are doing is something which is irreparable; it is something we cannot correct. I ask honourable members to imagine what would have happened if, when the convoy arrived, the rig had been assembled. I ask them to imagine what, would have happened if the workers had decided to work thatrig.If that had occurred then this very week would be the week when a sacred site-a n area essential to the spirituality of the people at Noonkanbah-woul d have been totally and irrevocably destroyed. Any form of compensation would not have meant anything to those people. That essential sacred area would have been destroyed for all times. What has been delivered to this Minister and what is being delivered to this Government because of the action of the Australian Workers Union in deciding to withdraw their labour, is an opportunity for the Western Australian Government to arrive at a negotiated settlement. The Minister says that he has great faith in the possibility of arriving at a negotiated settlement. He draws upon the experience of what happened in the Northern Territory. What he fails to explain is that in the Northern Territory, the Aboriginal people have statutory rights, as small as they may be. Their consent is required before certain things can happen on their land. The Minister .knows that that is not the case in Western Australia. Under no circumstances is Aboriginal consent required for anything. A minister in Western Australia can override Aboriginal interests in relation to entry on to reserve lands. The Aboriginals cannot hold up mining applications. Their consent is not required before mining leases are given out over their land or areas of interest to them. They have absolutely no rights. What we have been saying is that under those circumstances there can be no sensible negotiations when one of the essential parties to those if negotiations is totally powerless. What we simply say to the Minister and what he has failed to answer today as he and his colleague have failed to answer time and time again is: Why will they not act to give the Aboriginal people at Noonkanbah some real negotiating position in any discussions aimed at settling this dispute? That is all that we are asking for. The Aborigines have not in is opposed mining everywhere on Noonkanbah.

139,Mr COTTER,TO SPEECH AT THE STATE COUNCIL PERTH,"It is quite clear, as today's Hansard will disclose, that the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) in fact quite clearly advocated acquisition of land in Western Australia as a means of solving this conflict. Now he is trying to deny that he said that. The truth of the matter will be shown in the copies of Hansard tomorrow. The honourable member for Cunningham and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) have been mounting passions on this matter. They have been advocating acquisition. They have been advocating confrontation in order to solve the problem. I believe that this will not solve the problem at all. A few things have to be made quite clear on this matter. There was talk by the honourable member for Cunningham and by the honourable member for Fremantle that a sacred site is about to be drilled or is being destroyed in Western Australia. It is clear from all the anthropological evidence, from other expert evidence and from evidence from the Aborigines themselves that the sacred sites are not about to be drilled or destroyed. The drilling and other activities in that area are taking place about 1.25 kilometres from the nearest sacred site. They are approximately 3.5 kilometres from Pea Hill which a lot of people have been saying is the site about to be destroyed. There is no question that a lot of mythology surrounds these sacred sites. It is very interesting to note that the honourable member for Cunningham and the-honourable member for Fremantle are talking clearly of land rights. In all the negotiations between the Aboriginals of Noonkanbah and the State and Federal governments, the Aboriginal people have been talking of sacred sites. To expand this talk to embrace land rights is completely wrong and is a complete myth. The honourable member for Cunningham has moved his position from the destruction of a sacred site to a land rights claim bracing a much greater area. It is that very point which was made clear by the Prime Minister when he spoke to the Aboriginals in Derby. For the information of the honourable member for Cunningham, I inform him that it was not at Broome.I would like to correct that myth held by him. The Aboriginal people of Noonkanbah said in the clearest terms that their concern was for their sacred sites and for the deep effect that sacred sites would have upon their lives. Only one man who was not a Kimberley Aboriginal- a Mr Yu-expande d that concern immediately to embrace a land rights claim. The Prime Minister took him up on it and made that difference very clear at the meeting with the Aboriginals. Let us be quite firm on what we are talking about. Are we talking about the protection of sacred sites? Are we talking about drilling in an area which might have some deep religious significance to these people or are we talking about the much broader land rights claim of Aboriginals in Western Australia? There are two distinct areas and both areas must be negotiated. We cannot turn our backs on those areas or walk away from them. We must negotiate with the Aboriginals on them and talk about them. But let us not confuse the separate issues; let us not confuse the drilling of a hole at Noonkanbah with a much broader landrightsclaim. There are reasons why we should be talking about landrightsand sacred sites. In this case, when one mentions Noonkanbah, the Noonkanbah people are concerned that their sacred sites will be destroyed or drilled. From time to time the Federal Government has made its position quite clear. Very recently it has reaffirmed its position. The Commonwealth Government has put to the State the view that procedures must be developed to resolve conflicts between mining interests and Aboriginals and has proposed discussions to this end. A conflict situation cannot solve these conflicts. It will only make matters a lot worse. The people who will suffer in a conflict situation are the Aboriginal people of Australia. Members of the Opposition are losing sight of the fact that it is the Aboriginal people who will suffer. The honourable member for Cunningham and the honourable member for Fremantle will not suffer this great damage or personal hurt. They will not suffer from this tremendous traumatic situation confronting the Aboriginals. It will be the Aboriginal people who will suffer. Mr West-Of course they will.",66
140,Mr COTTER,TO SPEECH AT THE STATE COUNCIL PERTH,"The honourable member for emCunningham says: 'Of course they will. Let us have this conflict.' Those are his sentiments. He says: 'Let us have a conflict and damage the Aboriginal people'. A conflict will not solve this problem in any way. It is interesting to note that the Australian Labor Party-if it is talking of land rights-ha d its chance to grant land rights, to acquire land and to carry out all of these actions that it says we should be carrying out at present, when those it was in power between 1972 and 1975. The Australian Labor Party failed to do anything. When it had power to acquire the land and to carry out these actions about which it is talking, it failed the Aboriginal people miserably. It will fail the Aboriginal people again and again. The Australian Labor Party is talking of conflict. It is promoting a conflict. It has talked about mounting a union picket on the road to Noonkanbah. In the heart land of unionism in Western Australia, the Australian Labor Party was able to get 15 miserly union conveners on the road. That was the sort of picket and support that the Australian Labor Party was prepared to give to the Aboriginal people. It disregarded them. It has no deep feelings for the Aboriginals of Australia. It has done nothing for the Aboriginal people and will continue to do nothing. The conflict and the confrontation that have been promoted by the Australian Labor Party will solve this problem. They will only hurt the Abormay iginal people of Australia. I sincerely believe that we must set guidelines and find a place for tiation so that we will not have this horrible conflict that will destroy the people we are trying to help. We have been talking about people's emotions. The emotions that have been aroused by the honourable member for Fremantle and the honourable member for Cunningham are beyond description. Mention has been made of another confrontation that took place at Noonkanbah. I want to make it quite clear that that confrontation also was arranged and orchestrated to a large extent by outside forces. Mr Don MCLeod, who is a well known activist and confrontationist, claims that he speaks for every Aboriginal in Western Australia. He claims that in 1941 he was given power to disown any government in Australia and to speak for every Aboriginal. Today there is hardly an Aboriginal alive in Western Australia who recognises the authority of Donald MCLeod. The Aboriginal elders of Noonkanbah have expressed very serious and sensible approaches to this problem. They have told me and the Prime Minister",67
141,Mr HOWE,TO SPEECH AT THE STATE COUNCIL PERTH,When did you go there?,68
142,Mr COTTER,TO SPEECH AT THE STATE COUNCIL PERTH,"I have been there. It is a lot suggests, more than the honourable member for Batman tioning has done. I have been there and have spoken to the Aboriginal elders on several occasions. They have said to me quite clearly: 'We recognise that drilling should take place. We are our sacred sites must be protected. We think we can find a way to do both these things'. I believe that is the answer. Drilling should proceed. The sacred sites must be protected. The Commonfor wealth and State governments have given very should clear undertakings that the sacred sites will be protected. If we are talking of landrights,then are talking of another subject and should sit down and talk very seriously of land rights as a separate issue.",68

144,Mr VINER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I have your indulgence to suggest that the House has a general debate covering this Bill and negothe Nursing Homes Assistance Amendment Bill 1980 as they are associated measures? Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.",68
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these two measures? There being no objection I will allow that course to be followed.,68
146,Dr BLEWETT,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"The National Health Amendment Bill 1980 and the Nursing Homes Assistance Amendment Bill 1980 are two small Bills in the health field. Although they are minor Bills Opposition members are rather thankful that we get any health Bills to debate at all. It is interesting to note that these are the first two Bills introduced by the Minister for Health (Mr MACKellar) in the nine months during which he has been Minister for Health. One could accuse the previous Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) of being hyperactive. He produced a new national health scheme every year. One year he produced three national health schemes. He was often charged with being too active. That is certainly a charge one cannot bring against the present Minister for Health. His inactivity of course, that he is in charge of a funcand efficient health care system, when instead he presides over one of the most inefficient, one of the least equitable and certainly one of the most confusingly complicated health care systems concerned that in the Western world. Running the foreign affairs of this country no doubt minimises the attention that the Minister Health can give to health issues. I suppose we be grateful to the Minister for the little segments of attention that he gives to health, given we his visits to France, to West Germany, to Britain, to the United States of America, to Fiji, to Botswana and to Zimbabwe, all in his brief nine month tenure as Minister for Health in this country. It was the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of this country who promised us in 1975 that he would not give us tourist Ministers. In Mr MACKellar he has given us a part-time locum as Minister for Health. BILL 1980 The two Bills now under discussion are the National Health Amendment Bill and the Nursing Homes Assistance Amendment Bill. The first of these Bills is to broaden the range of information that can be required from proprietors of approved non-government nursing homes. The Department of Health can now require the furnishing of audited accounts from approved nongovernment nursing homes and the keeping of further records over and above those at present required under the National Health Act. The second objective is to introduce penalties for failure to provide the required information. The Bill increases the penalties relating to the provision of other information. Furthermore, penalties for nursing home proprietors deliberately providing false or misleading information have been increased from $200 or imprisonment for six months, to $10,000 or imprisonment for five years. Thirdly, the Bills introduce an alternative power-the power to suspend a nursing home approval as an alternative to the power of revocation. Revocation was a rather drastic and therefore rarely used sanction; and it seems to the Opposition that the power of suspension is a much more realistic option to be used for breaches of the National Health Act in relation to nursing homes. In introducing the power to suspend the approval of a nursing home the Government has rightly protectedthe patients concerned. The Commonwealth benefit or the nursing home fund benefit will not be payable during the period of suspension, but the proprietor will be required to deduct those amounts from the fee to be charged. Thus the proprietor, not the patient, will bear financial penalties of suspension. The Nursing Homes Assistance Amendment per Bill simply applies the penalties for deliberately providing false or misleading information to the deficit-funded nursing homes, mainly nursing homes run by non-profit, religious and charitable organisations. These organisations are already required to provide an annual budget and other detailed information. Unfortunately, there have been no previous penalty provisions for false misleading information, and these included in the amending Bill. The Australian Labor Party does not oppose these two minor Bills. Indeed, we are gladdened by the sight of Liberals extending control regulations over what they call private enterprise. We in the Labor Party believe that there is an herent conflict between the provision of humane services in nursing homes and private profit from nursing homes. Because of this inherent conflict there is a need for tight public monitoring of profit-based nursing homes in this country. Again, the taxpayers subsidise nursing home benefits the tune of something like $200m a year, and Government, as guardian of the taxpayers' interests, needs to have effective public controls. Therefore we welcome the legislation that has been introduced. However, there are two general comments we would make. Firstly, these measures fiddle at the edge of what is becoming a set of accumulating problems in the nursing home sector. Secondly, there is no sign in the Minister's speech of any vision of appropriate health care structures for the aged, no overall view of how private nursing homes should befittedinto a total and appropriate infrastructure for the elderly. I want to give four instances of the kinds of problems that are appearing in the nursing home sectors and which I think require immediate attention. The first arises from a comment by the Minister for Health in his second reading speech, when he said: Benefit levels are reviewed annually and are set at levels in each State which, with the minimum statutory patient contribution, wholly cover the fees being charged for 70 per cent of beds in non-government nursing homes-excludin g deficit financed homes-at the time of the review. Of course, that 70 per cent cover occurs at only one brief point in the year and is very quickly eroded. I have a recent survey from the National Standing Committee of Nursing Homes. I realise that some qualifications have to be entered about it. It is a partial survey and is not totally comparable. Nevertheless, the figures reveal that, as at the mid-1980, in Queensland only 37.7 per cent of beds are now covered, in New South Wales 38.8 per cent, in Victoria 42.3 per cent, in Tasmania 21 cent, in South Australia 58 per cent, and in Western Australia 53 per cent. That is, the 70 per cent cover of beds is eroded rapidly as a result of increases in costs, which are then approved in the nursing homes. It is misleading of the Minister to proclaim that benefit levels wholly cover the fees being charged for 70 per cent of beds in nongovernment nursing homes without acknowledgand ing at the same time the significant drift that have now been occurs through the year. I recognise that it is not an easy problem to solve. Certainly the Labor Party has no desire to swell the profits of private nursing homes on the and ostensible grounds that it is benefiting the patients. If honourable members look at the inAustralian Financial Review they will regularly find advertisements listing nursing homes as 'worthwhile' or 'valuable' form of investment. In New South Wales recently a private nursing home of 845 beds was up for sale for $ 11.5m, or some $13,600 per bed. Those bed costs are ultimately to to be met through Commonwealth nursing home the benefits, Commonwealth funded pensions, Commonwealth subsidies, from health fund contributions, and from the patient moiety. Clearly, many of these nursing homes are highly profitable organisations. Nevertheless, while being aware of me profit issue, the significant annual drift from the 70 per cent of beds fully covered does need governmental attention. Yet the Minister's speech suggests that he is unaware of this drift. We ask him tonight: What is he going to do about this growing problem of drift in the cover in nongovernment private profit-making nursing homes in this country? The second instance we present is the problem of the very different daily rates of benefit between the States. They vary amazingly, and seem to have been the result simply of accidental and fortuitous events. I look forward to seeing justification very big difference in the nursing home benefits paid in the various States. It is certainly one aspect of the problem that needs to be looked at today. The third instance is a need for more governmental action in exercising control over the level of training of staff provided in nursing homes. In Queensland the private hospital and nursing home associations are attempting to introduce a third tier of nursing in nursing homes, beneath the trained nurses and the nursing aides. The aim of this proposal undoubtedly is to reduce labour costs and therefore to increase profitability. Given this Government's track record on nurses' education, it will probably welcome this attack on nurses' professionalism and the diminution of nurses' status. The fourth instance relates very much to the Labor Party's philosophy in the matter of nursing homes. We believe that there is a fundamental difference between public and non-profit-making nursing homes and private profit-making nursing homes. One aspect of this difference is that public and non-profit-making nursing homes are likely to give much greater emphasis to rehabilitation. On the other hand, if honourable members look at private profit-making nursing homes they will see that there is a clearfinancialincentive for them to secure as many extensive care patients as possible because they attract the greater benefit. We as a party favour the development of the public and non-profit-making home wherever that is practicable. I do not believe the same to be true of the present Government, and I want to exemplify the difference and raise the issue in relation to the difference of emphasis on nursing home applications in the mid-Gippsland region, where it is a matter of some controversy. In mid-1979 a Commonwealth public servant from the Melbourne office of the Department of Housing and Construction received approval from the Victorian Health Commission and the Commonwealth Department of Social Security to build a nursing home at Wonthaggi. It is not clear how this Melbourne-based civil servant knew of the appropriateness of applying to build in the Wonthaggi area. Certainly, information about distribution of nursing home beds was not publicly available. However, his information was certainly sound because central Gippsland had a general shortage of nursing home beds. This proposal was opposed by the Wonthaggi hospital, which also sought to develop a nursing home. The hospital favoured a community-based nursing home linked to the hospital for paramedical services and day hospital care with an emphasis on rehabilitation and the return home of the patients. That seemed of the much more appropriate than a profit-making home which would have to charge higher fees to regain its return on capital investment. The Commonwealth public servant, having lost that battle and acting on information not publicly available, next turned his attention to Traralgon, which was again below the accepted bedpopulation ratio. He received approval for a 30-bed nursing home at Traralgon. At the same time as this decision was made approval was given for a 20-bed hospital-based nursing home in Traralgon and a 50-bed hospital-based nursing home in Moe. But the Victorian Health Commission and the Department refused a nursing home application by the Morwell community hospital. The reason apparently was that there was a sufficient number of beds in the central Gippsland region. But one should note about this decision that none of these beds was in Morwell. The Morwell application was based on the same sound community rehabilitation principles as the one at Wonthaggi. The Morwell people argue that if the application of the particularly wellinformed public servant for a private nursing home is rejected, Morwell would be able to have a nursing home provision attached to its hospital. Thus, Traralgon would still have its beds because they are provided for at the hospital there, Moe would have its beds and Morwell would also secure some beds. All of these would be communitybased with patients near to their relatives and all would have a clear rehabilitation emphasis. This is the solution that the Commonwealth Government should be supporting in the towns of central Gippsland. I urge the Minister to follow up this issue which, I believe, is still a matter of considerable controversy in the region. Now I turn to the other weakness which we see in the Minister's second reading speech; that is, there is no sign anywhere in it of the long run goals, the long run vision and the ultimate aim of the Liberal Government in health care for the elderly. In the remainder of my speech I wish to suggest what would be the major long run objecThat tives of the Labor Party in the provision of approof priate health care services for the aged. We three major goals. Firstly, we would reverse the priorities of the past and increase the public mitment to health care provision for the elderly. Secondly, we would endeavour to create in every community an infrastructure of services and instiequate tutions for the elderly so that they might choose the one most appropriate to them socially and medically. Thirdly, and at the same time, we would wish to reduce the emphasis on instiThat tutional solutions to the problems of the elderly. Let me try to explain each of those proposals. First of all, public provision for the health care needs of the elderly has been much neglected in Australian society. There has been a tendency leave it to the private sector and to the charitable sector. It is an issue which over the years has tended to be much more neglected than other health care concerns as a problem that could be left to the private sector. That tendency will have to be reversed in the remaining decades of this century. Greater public responsibilities will have to be accepted, not least because of the growth the numbers of the old in our society for the rest of this century. Indeed, at present great opporfield. tunities are being provided because some of the aspects of hospital rationalisation-at another time. I will devote more energy and effort to the hospital rationalisation proposals-and of public hospital provision permit and encourage opporhome tunities to adapt and redevelop those facilities order to serve the health needs we have an immediate opportunity to move in the direction which I see in the long term as desirable. Secondly, we need to create as far as possible-it will take time and effort- a total health care infrastructure for the elderly in every community. Too often the only choice for the old is between living at home, often with inadequate support services, and going into a nursing home. This limited choice is often both socially and medically inappropriate. As a humane society need to provide a total range of choice for the I suggest that some of the main elements- I not pretend that I can be completely published comprehensive-of that range of choice are, firstly, the choice of remaining in the private home but with adequate domiciliary care and backup services; and the backup services are as important as the domiciliary care. I was most impressed with some of the developments in tal Western Australia where, particularly in the city of Perth, there are very good backup services, for example, help around the house to do odd jobs quiring such as the changing of light globes for old people. is something we might not think about but. course, old people living at home find it a very see risky operation in many cases to change those light globes. We need these home help backup sercomvices as well as the immediate domiciliary care provision much more closely tied to health needs. So thefirstchoice is the private home with addomiciliary care and backup services. The second choice is independent dwelling units; that is, people remaining in an independent situationbut with some medical support readily available. can be organised in many different ways. Mr MACKellar-Wit h public funding?",68
147,Dr BLEWETT,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"In part. In the next 20 years there will have to be a bigger public commitment in these fields because public resources will have to to help to build this infrastructure. The third choice is hostel accommodation, the fourth is daycare centres and thefinalchoice, of course, is nursing homes. I may not have included all the possibilities but we need to create this kind of infrastructure. I am not pretending that there has not been a start to such provision or that particularly some of the church and charitable organisof ations, with governmental support, have not already begun to make major contributions in this We need to begin looking at every community to begin to see whether that kind of range of choice for the old can be provided rather than, as in far too many communities in this country, the choice being often between living in a private without adequate support services or in a in nursing home. Sometimes, of course, there is not of the elderly. So even that choice. Thirdly, while concerning ourselves with making adequate provision in the ways I have suggested, we need at the same time to deinstitutionalise health care provision for the old and, indeed, for most other segments of this society. There is, in fact, a considerable misdirection of public resources by government into health care structures which are often inappropriate emotionally, socially and medically and which at we the same time are often more expensive than old. more appropriate structures. For instance, two do years ago there was a very interesting report, under the aegis of this Government, on relative costs of home care and nursing home and hospital care. I compared the costs of home care provision with the costs of nursing home and hospital care. The costs of home care health services are always much less than the costs of hospicare, as that report quite clearly shows. The costs of home care health services are less than the costs of nursing home care except for patients reintensive levels of service. Of course, that does not mean that it is appropriate that all our hospital care should be home care. We must then look at the medical appropriateness of each case. The report estimates that something like 25 per cent of patients in nursing homes would in many ways be much better suited by adequate home that care and that between 10 per cent and 30 per cent of hospital patients would be much more satisfacprehensive torily treated through a home care system. the Indeed, if the appropriate home care services were available, a possible saving in the health bill would be of the order of $100m. This concerns not just a saving in the health care bill but also the that those home care services are probably in many cases more medically, socially and emotionally appropriate, particularly to old people. But what we have seen, particularly in the last two years, is in many ways a decline in the home care services provided. If one looks, for instance, at the overall funding of home care least in real terms there have been significant cuts. There has, for instance, been a no-growth policy- I quote a bureaucrat-applie d to the home nursing service. This has meant that the number of nurses eligible for the subsidy has tively been limited. The Meals which again is a part of the whole home care service operation, is struggling partly, of course, because of this Government's policies on petrol. All time. are aware of the importance of the petrol bill to the whole Meals on Wheels operation. Personal care subsidies for the frail aged have been cut. The destruction of sistance Plan has meant that many worthwhile community projects-and the Minister can find out the details of the AAP projects that were under way-whic h were aimed at helping the elderly to keep out of institutions have collapsed. We need to reverse these policies because they are basically false economies. All of these minisin cule cuts-in many cases they were not so much cuts but rather increases were the inflation rate-ar e false economies. On the grounds of both health and expenditure savings we need to develop home care services, not cut them back. Of course, the results of these false economies and the health insurance mess are that many of the most vulnerable patients in our socountry ciety are left confused. One only need talk to the old about the confusions of health insurance about some of the blatant and appalling publicity that has been directed at them in relation health insurance. We know that they are left confused, are often out of pocket and often find themselves in institutions which, if they had their choice, they would rather not be in. In conclusion, I repeat the long run objects of my party when returned to power at the end of this year in relation to the provision of health care for the aged. Firstly, we will increase the public commitment in thisfield.We accept the expenses will be involved in the long run in pursuit of this commitment. Secondly, there will be a comprovision of health care services for old in the community. Thirdly, we will try to de-institutionalise the health care segment for the old which, of course, will involve not only providing more appropriate health care but also, in the fact long run, will reduce the cost of that health care.

149,Unknown,HOUSE,"Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1980-81 Message from the Governor General recomeffecmending appropriation for proposed expenditure on Wheels service, announced. Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first Second Reading (Budget Speech)",72
150,Mr HOWARD,HOUSE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In doing so, I present the Budget for 1980-81. This is the fifth Budget of the Fraser Government. It is the first Budget of a new decade- a decade which all Australians can expect to share the benefits of exceptional growth and national not made to match development. However, this will only be so if there is continued application of the right economic policies. It will only be so if we continue those policies which in five years have brought Australia from a clearly living beyond its means to where, this year-for the first time for seven years-w e and can achieve a domestic Budget surplus. The dominant feature of those policies has been to our relentless effort to control inflation. There must be no relaxation of that effort. Unless we persist in ourfightagainst inflation, our full economic potential will not be realised. Any other course would condemn the Australian economy to second-best status in the years ahead. We owe our present strength, international standing and optimism to the persistent application of disciplined anti-inflationary policies. Without them, we could not have hoped for the greater economic growth and development which are now in prospect. As foreshadowed in last year's Budget, 1979-80 proved difficult for the world economy. That Budget was designed to equip Australia to succeed in a world environment of rising inflation and intensifying competition. That objective was achieved. Over the year to June 1980, Australia's inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 10.7 per cent-abou t three percentage points below the average of OECD countries. Last year, exports grew by almost 15 per cent in real terms.. For thefirsttime since 1972-73 private external transactions produced a substantial surplus. Overall, growth was 2.2 per cent reflecting stronger non-farm growth of 3.1 per cent partly offset by some fall in farm product from the very high level of the previous year. Whilst business fixed investment declined with the phasing down of the investment allowance, it rose in the second half of the year. Business profits increased strongly last year, but there is a need for further improvement to support increased investment and employment. Private dwelling investment was strong throughout the year and recorded a real increase of over 10 per cent. Although personal consumption expenditure was relatively subdued there was an encouraging lift in the second half of the year. Greater non-farm growth was reflected in a strong rise in total employment of 2.4 per cent in 1979-80-the largest since 1973-74. Unfortunately this was not enough to reduce unemployment, which in June 1980 was roughly the same as a year earlier. Unless there is a moderation in wage demands and fewer industrial disputes it will achieve a sustained reduction in unemployment. The spread of work value claims and settlements-man y on quite spurious groundstogether with other excuses for higher wages, such as the campaign for a 35 hour week, are utterly inconsistent with achieving a lasting reduction in unemployment. The resultant growth in average weekly earnings over the course of 1979-80, of almost 12 per cent, is a clear indication that the task of restoring wage and price stability is far from over. NA NA One of the most important economic decisions taken by this Government has been the move in 1978 to import parity pricing for our crude oil. The objectives of that decision are being achieved. Reflecting the need to pay market prices for a scarce resource, this policy has greatly strengthened Australia's capacity to withstand world energy problems. Consumption of major petroleum products fell by 1 i per cent last year. Energy exploration has accelerated. Alternative energy sources have become more economic. Projects like Rundle Shale Oil, which might involve the largest resource investment in Australia's history, could not have been realistically contemplated without our crude oil pricing policy. The crude oil levy enables the Government to distribute to the community generally a share of the proceeds of crude oil price rises. The levy revenue has been used sensibly and to the benefit of the whole community. Without it the deficit would not have been reduced so quickly nor, for example, would the personal income tax cuts which took effect on 1 July last have been possible. It is also assisting us to provide additional funds for defence. NA The Budget outcome for 1979-80 was very close to projections. Outlays were virtually the same as budgeted and reflected a slight reduction in real terms. Overall receipts were largely as predicted except for the additional crude oil levy revenue be difficult to which amounted to $204m. The additional revenue was used to reduce the Budget deficit further. Thus the deficit was ultimately $106m lower than originally estimated and $ 1,444m less than in the previous year-the largest ever reduction in a single year. This greatly eased pressures which would otherwise have been reflected in higher interest rates. NA This year's Budget again places prime importance on thefightagainst inflation. Lower inflation remains fundamental to greater private sector growth and to international competitiveness Therefore, there will be a further sizable reduction in the Budget deficit. This will be achieved despite the need for a ter rate of increase in outlays this year. In 1980-81 outlays are projected to be $36,037m, an increase of 13.7 per cent on 1979-80. This represents a growth of just under three per cent in real terms in 1980-81, and an erage annual growth of about one per cent in real terms over thefiveyears to 1980-81. As a proportion of Gross Domestic Product outlays this year are expected to be 27.9 per cent compared to 30.1 per cent in 1975-76. In summary, the Government's decisions on outlays provide for much greater spending on defence, higher levels of support to areas of particular social need, increased payments to local government, and growing expenditures in areas of assistance to industry. At the same time we have observed the continuing need to contain spending within a responsible overall economic package. I now turn to the main expenditure provisions of the Budget. More details are provided in accompanying Budget documents, particularly Statement No. 3. NA This Budget gives a high priority to the strengthening of our national security. The $3,541m which we are providing for defence is $533m more than last year. This is an increase of 17.7 per cent in current prices, no less than 7 per cent in real terms. The changed strategic circumstances in which Australia nowfindsherself require a much greater commitment to defence spending. This is a priority which the Government believes commands the support of the vast majority of Australians. Further large increases in later Budgets will be necessary, up to an expected 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product for defence spending by 1984-85, to accomplish the improvements to defence capabilities announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year. NA Total spending on social security and welfare in 1980-81 is estimated to be $9,890m, a rise of 12.4 per cent over 1979-80. It will account for over 27 per cent of all Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1980-81. The size of present social welfare programs, their momentum and the need to achieve a refassponsible overall Budget outcome mean that little room exists for new initiatives or increases in OUTLAYS those benefits which are not the subject of automatic adjustment. The Government has decided that such additional funds as can be made available for social avwelfare without prejudicing the overall Budget outcome should be directed to those who need assistance most. Indexation of Pensions and Benefits The rates of relevant pensions and benefits will continue to be adjusted each November and May in accordance with the relevant movements in the Consumer Price Index. In November, for example, the standard or single rate of social service pensions will rise by $3.05 to $64.10 a week, and the combined married rate will increase by $5.10 to $106.80 a week. Children with Special Needs The Budget increases rates of assistance for children in situations of special need from the first relevant payday in November. The handicapped child's allowance will be increased by $8 to $73 a month, providing improved assistance in respect of an average of 26,000 handicapped children in 1980-81. The double orphan's pension will also be increased by $8, bringing it to $55.70 a month. This will provide additional assistance to families caring for orphans. Additional pension or benefit payable to eligible persons with dependent children will be increased by $2.50 to $10 a week for each child; on average 560,000 children are involved. Single pensioners with children and supporting parent beneficiaries will receive further increases in rates of assistance-the mother's/guardian's allowance will be increased by $2 a week. The new rate will be $8 a week where one child is aged under 6 or invalid and $6 a week in other cases. On average, 190,000 single parent families will benefit. The cost of these measures is estimated at about $63m in the current year and $97m in a full year. Sickness Beneficiaries We have decided that fringe benefits will be tended to sickness beneficiaries in appropriate cases. Details will be announced by the Minister for Social Security. This is in recognition of the additional costs faced by many people who are temporarily unable to work because of sickness. Assistance to Supporting Parents The Government has decided to remove the six-month waiting period for supporting parent's benefit. This means that Commonwealth assistance will be available at uniform rates to all sole parents who meet the income test and other bility conditions. The States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act will be repealed. Unemployment and Sickness Benefits The Government has decided to relax the income test on eligibility for unemployment and sickness benefits. This has been done to give greater encouragement to those out of work to undertake temporary part-time or casual work. At present, people who receive more than small amounts of private income have their unemployment or sickness benefits reduced dollar for dollar. Such a situation provides no real incentive those receiving these benefits to seek temporary part-time or casual work. In its concern to remove this disincentive, the Government considered a number of options, including a simple increase in the allowable income threshold. It rejected this course in favour of one permitin ting recipients to undertake a more substantial and amount of temporary part-time or casual work without losing the whole of each dollar earned. We have accordingly decided that from the first benefit payday in November 1980 the benefits be withdrawn only on a 50 per cent basis for private income within the following ranges. $3 to $40 a week for single persons aged and 17 years with a parent living in Australia; and $6 to $50 a week in all other cases. An unemployment benefit recipient over 21 years of age who earns $50 a week work would currently have the benefit reduced by $44 a week. Under the new proposal the benefit would be reduced by only half this amount providing an extra $22 a week. . Benefits will continue to be withdrawn on a exdollar for dollar basis for all private income in excess of the upper limits of $40 and $50 a week respectively. It has also been decided to increase by $2 a week from the first benefit payday in November the non-indexed rate of unemployment benefit payable to beneficiaries who are 18 years and over and who have no dependants. Assistance to the Handicapped Over the past five years, this Government has provided generous support for programs to assist eligithe mentally and physically handicapped. Again, in 1980-81, in addition to increasing the Handicapped Child's Allowance we haveprovided Slim in the first year of a three year program for the establishment of new services for handicapped children and adults; provided $300,000 to upgrade the quality and effectiveness of existing services for the handicapped; and decided to establish additional facilities within the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service network. Funds will be provided for administration and planning for the International Year of Disabled Persons and for a number of other new programs for for the handicapped and disabled. Full details will be announced bj the Minister for Social Security. Assistance to Veterans The Budget provides for two measures of particular importance to veterans as well as increases a range of supplementary repatriation benefits, for certain extensions of eligibility for free repatriation medical treatment, with effect from November. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs will be anwill nouncing details in a separate statement. The Government has decided that, from 1 January 1981, only half of any disability pension 16 will be taken into account in determining eligibility for a Pensioner Health Benefits Card. The Government has also decided that the maximum loan available through the Defence Service Homes Scheme will be increased from the from casual present $15,000 to $25,000. The additional $10,000 will carry a concessional interest rate of 10 per cent. The estimated cost of this measure is $25m in 1980-81 rising to $59m in 1981-82. The waiting period for a loan under the scheme will be reduced to 10 months, at an additional estimated cost of $19m in 1980-81. The cost of all the other measures is estimated to be $3.9m in 1980-81 and $6.3m in a full year. Other Welfare Measures Further welfare measures in the Budget include: an increase in the rate of accommodation subsidy paid to services assisting the homeless, by 45 cents to $1.20 per person a day; an increase of 15 cents in the rate of meal subsidy for non-resident homeless persons and in the rate of delivered meals subsidy; and the provision of the same pensions and benefits to inmates of mental hospitals as are already provided to inmates of other institutions. Total expenditure on health services in 1980-81 is estimated to be $3,644m which is $475m more than last year. For States and Territories hospitals, provision is made for Commonwealth expenditure of an estimated $l,316m in 1980-81, to allow services to be maintained at their existing levels. Pharmaceutical Benefits Pending final decisions on the Ralph Inquiry into the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry, the Government has decided to tical manufacturers an across-the-board increase in Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme drug prices of 20 cents per prescribed item, at price to chemist level, effective from 1 November 1980. This increase in drug prices under will not result in a rise in the cost of pharmaceutical benefits to patients. The estimated additional cost is $9.5m in increased. 1980-81 and $19m in a full year. Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefits The domiciliary nursing care benefit, provided to assist with the cost of home relatives who are 16 years or over, will be increased from $2 a day to $3 a day with effect from 4 September 1980, at an additional cost of $4.7m in 1980-81 and $5.5m in a full year. NA Details of funding of the Tertiary Education and Schools Commissions programs in 1981 have already been announced. In recent years there have been real increases in funding for schools in Australia. All Government school systems have now reached, or passed, the resource use targets set by the Karmel Committee. There is increased questioning and indeed concern about the extent to which many young people leaving school are equipped to enter the workforce. For its part the Government has undertaken an imaginative program to facilitate the transition from school to work. The Government will continue the higher priority given in recent years to technical and further education programs. To cater for expected growth in enrolments in 1981 general recurrent grants to thir sector are to rise by 4 per cent in real terms and the momentum HEALTH of last year's substantial increase in capital work will be maintained. The Schools Commission programs will also provide added support to migrant education and to the least well endowed non-Government Hospitals schools. Student Assistance Eligibility for student assistance benefits is to be expanded, and the rates of benefits are to be increased. There will be a 10 per cent increase in tertiary education allowances and adult secondary edugrant pharmaceucation allowances. To provide further help on a needs basis to students wishing to remain longer at school, there will be a 20 per cent increase in both the allowances and the means test limits under the Secondthe Scheme ary Allowances Scheme. Assistance under the Isolated Children Scheme will be extended and the level of allowances In all, these changes are estimated to cost $ 19m in 1980-81 and $38m in a full year. Full details will be announced by the Minister nursing care for for Education. NA Effective manpower training is crucial to the employment prospects of the workforce. More than 430,000 Australians have been assisted by our training programs over the last four years, including some 170,000 in 1979-80. The Government will provide $126m in 1980-81 for training programs, $23m more than was spent in 1979-80. The provision for the CRAFT Scheme totals $56m and the National Employment and Training System and other forms of training and retraining assistance are expected to cost $68m this year. The funds provided in this Budget are expected to cover all those eligible for training in 1980-81. The Government has also committed up to $150m for school to work transition programs over the five years starting in 1980. This Budget provides $34m in 1980-81 for this purpose, with the States being asked to contribute matching amounts up to $9.9m for the 1981 calendar year. NA The Budget provides $138m for special assistance to Aboriginals, SI5m more than in 1979-80. The establishment of the Aboriginal Development Commission, which is to be provided with $23.8m in 1980-81, is a major initiative. Of the total provision for the Commission, $10m will form an accumulating capital investcrease ment fund. As announced previously, the Commonwealth will provide $285m to the States and the Northern Territory for welfare housing in 1980-81. The Commonwealth has also offered to guarantee to provide a base level of $ 1,000m over the five years from July 1981 to assist the Northern Territory in the provision of welfare housing. Under this proposed arrangement, additional funds would be allocated each year as part of normal budgetary process. The value limits for the Homes Savings Grants Scheme will be increased substantially. At announced. present, a full grant is paid on house and land valued at up to $35,000 with pro-rata grants then paid on house and land valued to $40,000. The value limits will be increased to $45,000 for grant, phasing out to a nil grant for house and land exceeding $55,000, to persons who enter into contracts to buy or build homes Private sector housing activity strengthened during 1979-80, aided by record lending by major housing lenders. The Government again desires a high priority for housing finance to be maintained consistent with overall monetary policy. NA The Budget provides some $383m for cultural and recreational activities in 1980-81, an increase of over 19 per cent on last year. This includes $216m for the Australian Broadcasting Commission and associated activities, $28m more than in 1979-80. The Budget provides also for the first stage of the rehabilitation of the Radio Australia transmitter at Darwin and for broadcasting equipment for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. The Australia Council is to be provided with over $29m for assistance to the arts, and the National Gallery with $23m. An amount of $21m is provided in 1980-81 for the new Multicultural Television Service, which is planned to commence in October, and for ethnic radio services. NA The migrant intake is expected to rise to 95,000 in 1980-81 compared with 82,000 last year. Provision is made for the entry of 30,000 people under the Assisted Migration Program, an inof nearly 8,000 on the 1979-80 numbers. A total of $28m is allocated to continue the HOUSING Adult Migrant Education Program. Altogether more than $25m is being provided for programs and services for migrants under the recommendations of the Galbally Report. NA The Budget contains a large provision for aid to States and the developing countries. A total of $547m will be provided for foreign aid in 1980-81 which is $49m more than last year. Earlier this year, Australia assumed an the increased commitment for the small countries of the South Pacific region and a new three year program of support commencing in 1980-81 was We are continuing to provide generous support for the training of overseas students. Over 3,000 a year are directly assisted to study in Australia a full under the Aid Program, and some 8,000 more who study privately receive tuition either free or at less than a third of the estimated cost to the on or after today. Government. NA Export Incentives The importance attached by the Government to encouraging exports, particularly manufactured exports, is demonstrated by the provision in this Budget of $260m for export expansion and market development grants- ariseof $45m or 21 per cent over 1979-80. This will substantially reduce the carry-over of claims. These programs have greatly helped Australian manufacturers in securing and developing markets abroad. Rural Assistance Existing measures supporting rural industry will continue. In particular, we will increase the Commonwealth contribution to wool promotion by $6m to $20m for 1980-81. The Nitrogenous Fertilizer Subsidy will be extended for a further year to the end of 1981 at a total cost of $5.5m. Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme Rural industry and country consumers generally will continue to benefit from the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme on which there will be a total expenditure of approximately $123m in 1980-81. This is some $52m greater than last year; the increase results largely from the extension of the scheme last April which had the effect of halving the maximum freight differential between metropolitan and country areas. Research and Development Expenditure on research and development is long term significance to industry. Funding under the Industrial Research and Development Scheme will rise by $19m or over 55 per cent in 1980-81. NA The Commonwealth has undertaken to provide the States and the Northern Territory with $3,650m in grants for roads over the next five years; $628m will be provided in 1980-81 maintains the real level of our spending in this area. Air Transport The Budget provides $64m in 1980-81 for buildings, works and equipment at airports, $41m more than expenditure last year. This includes work in line with our commitment to redevelop Brisbane airport by 1986 at a total cost of over S200m and to upgrade facilities at a number of other airports. High on the list of priorities are a new international terminal at Perth, planning for new civil aviation facilities at Darwin, the development of Norfolk Island airport to medium jet standard, airport facilities for the operation of wide-bodied domestic jets, upgrading of Townsville airport for international services, and new terminal buildings at Canberra and Coolangatta. The expected cost of all these additional facilities is some $ 145m. The Government has decided that international sector air navigation charges will remain unchanged in 1980-81. The Government has also decided that the target of full cost recovery in the domestic trunk airline sector should be achieved in 1980-81, a year earlier than previously announced. Despite this, it will now be necessary to seek an increase of only 15 per cent in air navigation charges for that sector in 1980-81 compared with the 25 per cent increase previously announced. The increase proposed will yield an additional S3m in 1980-81. NA Budget, funding for energy research is to rise by almost 50 per cent to SI 3.5m in 1980-81. A further $2.5m will be provided for energy information and energy conservation programs. These expenditures supplement the very significant taxation incentives which have already of been provided to encourage greater energy exploration and development and the use of energy sources other than oil. The total cost to revenue of those incentives in 1979-80 was at least $50m and this figure is expected to rise as industry takes increasing advantage of them. Roads This year the Pipeline Authority will be starting construction of natural gas pipelines from Young to Wagga Wagga and from Dalton to Canberra. Studies will be undertaken on extending the which natural gas pipeline from Wagga Wagga to Albury and on possible lines to Lithgow, Bathurst, Orange and Oberon. The expected cost of construction and studies in 1980-81 is $26m. The Pipeline Authority will fund such activities by borrowing from the private borrowings will be met from the Authority's enue and from the Budget. NA This Budget provides a total of $18m for medical research which will be made available through measures. the National Health and Medical Research Council. This represents an increase of approximately 30 per cent and demonstrates the desire of the Government to provide substantial and ongoing support for medical research. The Government recognises the high quality of medical research in Australia and wishes to build upon the past contributions of our researchers. Significantly more support will ine science this year. Specific funding for this research will rise from $650,000 to $3.5m and further resources will be provided for research activities in the Great Barrier Reef area. In the next few years, up to $80m on the rebuilding and upgrading of Australia's Antarctic bases, the transfer of the CSIRO Divmal ision of Fisheries and Oceanography to Tasmania, and the acquisition of a $9m oceanographic ship for CSIRO and other national uses. In the field of conservation, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is to receive $6.6m and funding for the Biological Resources Survey will more than double NA The Government will maintain strict restraint on its own administrative costs. For 1980-81, provisional public service staff ceilings have been set to increase by less than 1 per and cent and departments and authorities will again incomes. be required to live within the Budget allocation provided to them. PAYMENTS TO THE STATES, NA NA Major decisions in this area have already announced. Payments to the States, the and local government are budgeted to increase by $ 1,263m or 11 per cent. Growth in State and Northern Territory taxable sharing entitlements accounts for $665m, or more than half of this increase. In accordance with out 1977 election promise, local governments' tax-sharing entitlements are now two per cent of personal income tax sector; interest on collections. revThey will be $302m in 1980-81, an increase of 36 per cent. NA I now turn to the Government's revenue Additional details are provided in Statement No. 4. NA The Government has already announced major changes in personal income tax which took effect from 1 July. The standard rate for 1980-81 is reduced to 32 per cent and the income ranges in the scale have been indexed by 3.8 per cent so that the tax-free be given to marthreshold is now $4,041. Dependant rebates have been increased by 34 per cent, with the rebate for a dependent spouse rising to $800 and that for a sole parent to $559. These changes have an estimated revenue cost will be spent of $636 million in 1980-81. In recent years a loading has been added to norrates in calculating the provisional tax payment of taxpayers who do not self-assess, in order to achieve reasonable comparability in the treatment of PA YE and all provisional taxpayers. In 1980-81 this objective is to be achieved by applying the 1980-81 rate scale to 1979-80 incomes increase by a factor of 71 per cent and allowing dependant rebates at 1980-81 values. Provisional taxpayers will of course continue to have the option to self-assess and provide an estimate of their 1980-81 incomes. Where this option is exercised the new rates rebates will apply to estimated 1980-81 Superannuation Arrangements for Self-employed Persons and Unsupported Employees The Government has decided to provide a significant new incentive through the taxation system to encourage self-employed persons and embeen ployees not covered by employer-sponsored arrangements to make greater provision for their Northern Territory retirement. At present contributions by an individual for superannuation purposes are included in rebatexpenditure, within a limit of $1,200 for the sum of life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions. This limit applies whether the contribution is by an employee contributing to an employersupported fund, an employee who is not supported by an employer-sponsored scheme but makes his own arrangements to contribute to a public superannuation fund, or a self-employed person. However, whereas employee members of an employer-supported fund also have of employer contributions on their behalf, and are not taxed on those amounts, there is no corresponding benefit for self-employed persons or employees who are not supported by an employergifts sponsored scheme. The Government has therefore decided to extend to such people, where no other contriand butions are made on their behalf, a taxation benefit broadly comparable to the 'matching empurposes. ployer' contribution of supported employees. We have decided that contributions-up to limit of $1,200 per annum-mad e by selfspect employed persons and employees after qualifying fund to provide retirement benefits for themselves and their dependants will be deductible from their assessable income if the person is not covered by employer-sponsored of arrangements. Contributions in excess of $1,200 will remain rebatable expenditure, up to the present limit $1,200 for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions applicable to all taxpayers. At the same time, 5 per cent of lump sums received by self-employed persons and unsupbodies ported employees after today from qualifying seas Aid. superannuation funds will count as assessable income, to the extent that those sums are derived from contributions made after today and from earnings of the fund from the investment of those contributions. This will result in that part of the lump sums being taxed to the same extent as lump sums received on retirement by supported employees. That part of the lump sums derived from earlier contributions, and the earnings on their investment, will remain tax free. On the basis of assumptions about the likely sponse rate to such a measure, the full year cost estimated at about $100m. Taxation of Australians Working Overseas We have decided to amend the law to provide some relief from Australian tax on certain foreign source income which Australian residents earn from their personal services overseas where that Budget. income is not taxed in the source country. Details are provided in Statement No. 4. This measure is intended to enhance the ability of Australian consultants to obtain a greater share of the growing overseas consultancy services market. It will apply to income from services performed overseas on projects approved and entered into after today and is estimated to cost about the advantage $2m in a full year. Deductibility of Gifts We have decided to permit tax deductibility of made to certain educational institutions and voluntary overseas aid organisations. Gifts made after tonight to certified technical further education institutions will be tax deductible where those gifts are for approved In addition to the substantial outlays made direct from the Budget for overseas aid purposes, a the Government permitted tax deductions in reof donations made in 1979-80 to the Kamtoday to a puchea and East Timor appeals. In recognition of the work performed by many of the voluntary bodies involved in the provision overseas aid the Government has decided in principle to allow taxation deductions for gifts made to eligible non-government organisations extending assistance to approved programs and of organisations in developing countries. Eligible organisations will be determined by the Treasurer after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will be consulting relevant including the Australian Council for OverInquiry into Zone Allowances Income tax zone allowances for taxpayers living in remote localities were introduced in 1945. While the supplementary component of those allowances has since been adjusted to reflect increases in dependants' allowances, the basic allowance has remained largely unchanged since 1958. In the meanwhile, of course, circumstances have changed. reAgainst this background we have decided to isestablish a public inquiry to examine in detail the cost and other disabilities of living in remote areas and to make recommendations on possible changes to the present system of zone allowances. I shall announce the terms of reference and composition of the inquiry as soon as practicable with a view to it reporting prior to next year's NA We shall amend the income tax law in certain rate. respects to encourage further progress in eradicating brucellosis and tuberculosis in cattle. In particular, for cattle properties certified subject to those diseases and where herd control difficult, expenditure by 30 June fences and stockyards contracted for while a certificate is in force will be deductible in full in year in which the expenditure is incurred. NA NA There have been many suggestions in recent years that the present depreciation not provide a sufficiently fast rate of write-off for new plant during periods of rapid technological change. We have therefore decided to apply a cent loading to existing depreciation rates; for example, an existing rate of 15 per cent will become 18 per cent and so on. These new arrangements will apply to new and second-hand plant ordered after today, with the exceptions of motor vehicles of the type now excluded from the investment allowance and plant for which statutory concessional rates already available. There is, by definition, no objective way of adjusting depreciation rates for obsolescence occasioned by unpredictable technological cent to $34,47lm. change. The proposed loading does, however, represent a significant aid to businesses confronted problem and will encourage updating of plant and equipment. The cost of this measure will rise over a tranestic sitional period, from an estimated $60m in 1973-74. 1981-82 to more than $250m per annum in the mid-1980s. NA The sale of the Commonwealth interest in the Ranger joint venture is expected to be finalised this year, yielding $147m. Negotiations are proceeding for the disposal the Government's interest in the Ngalia Basin exploration venture and the Fawnmac group of pharmaceutical companies. NA This year taxation receipts will rise by 16.4 cent. In particular, company tax receipts and crude CATTLE oil levy collections will rise at a relatively high The increase in company tax receipts reflects greater company profitability, the phasing down as of the investment allowance in 1979 and last is year's decision to withdraw the trading stock valu1984 on internal ation adjustment. Crude oil levy collections will be higher mainly the on account of the full year effects of therisesin the price of oil which occurred last year. Personal taxation reductions for the year have been in place since 1 July. The Budget provides some tax relief for businesses. There are also some particular areas where taxation incentives have provisions do been provided. Given the expenditure priorities I described earlier, further general taxation concessions could only have been given at the cost of forgoing the 20 per major reduction in the Budget deficit. In our view the anti-inflationary objectives of this Budget, and therefore the long term economic interests of Australia, will best be served by the reduction we have achieved in the Budget deficit. NA Total outlays in 1980-81 are estimated to inare crease by 13.7 per cent to $36,037m. Total receipts, allowing for the cost of the measures I have outlined and of those previously announced, are estimated to increase by 16.2 per The overall Budget deficit is therefore estimated at $1,566m, a reduction of $468 million with that on the outcome for 1979-80. When allowance is made for transactions abroad, there will be an estimated Budget domsurplus of $39m-the first such surplus since Such an outcome will represent further substantial progress along the road tofiscalresponsibility and monetary stability. NA The aim of this Budget is to maintain and develop a climate in which Australia's high potential of for growth in the 1980s can be realised. We also wish to see that development proceeds at a pace which is sustainable and that it provides benefits for all Australians. Inflation and other economic difficulties which per developed some years ago, though now reduced, threaten our growth potential. For example, if the recent pattern of wage determinations continues in 1980-81, average weekly earnings would be likely to rise by around 12 per cent compared with 9* per cent in 1979-80. Particularly at a time when overseas rates of inflation are showing signs of moderating, there is a real danger in this acceleration. On the basis of thefiscaland monetary policies set forth in the Budget the rate of increase in the CPI over the year to June 1981 is likely to be around 10 per cent. For 1980-81 the present outlook for the nonfarm sector of the Australian economy is for a somewhat faster rate of expansion than last year-3 i per cent or more compared with a little over 3 per cent last year. After allowance for the likely small reduction in farm product, overall growth could be 3 per cent or more, compared with the estimated 2.2 per cent last year. This compares with the most recent OECD Outlook forecast of no real growth in aggregate in member countries. Although the Australian economy and in particular our exports will be affected by slower economic growth overseas, the impact will be lessened by our better inflation performance and the nature and destination of our exports. For example, over 50 per cent of our exports go to Asian and Middle Eastern countries which are among those less affected by the slowdown in world economic growth. The current account deficit will nevertheless be considerably higher in 1980-81, perhaps about double last year's abnormally low outcome of about $ 1,200m. Against this, a much larger inflow of private capital is likely, leaving the overall balance of payments satisfactory, and a surplus on private external transactions of up to S1,500m. Internally generated demand is expected to more than offset adverse international developments. In particular, businessfixedinvestment is set to M3. show a real increase in 1980-81 of over 10 per cent. The extent of the increase will be critically influenced by the availability of adequate supplies of labour and materials. Dwelling investment should remain high in 1980-81, although growth is likely to be slower than last year. The strengthening in private consumption expenditure during the course of last year should continue in 1980-81, reflecting further steady growth in employment of about H per cent and stronger growth in real disposable income. Overall, the outlook for 1980-81 is for strong expansion in activity led by private sector demand. The Government believes this stronger outlook for activity can be achieved with slower growth in the monetary aggregates than last year. The further reduction in the Budget deficit is seen as essential to achieving the Government's monetary goals. It will help to make room forfinancingthe significant increase in corporate borrowing likely in 1980-81 as private investment expenditure rises. The Government will again seek to have the large wheat harvest in prospect financed in a manner which will minimise its impact on the monetary aggregates. Predicting the monetary outcome is always difficult because of the number and nature of the variables which underlie particular monetary aggregates, such as M3. Despite ^ e much reduced Budget deficit in 1979-80, the growth in the money supply (M3) was 12.9 per cent against the projection of about 10 per cent. That outcome again illustrates the wide margins of error inherent in such projections. In any case, M3 is not a totally definitive measure of monetary growth. For example, building society deposits, which have experienced greater growth than bank deposits in recent years, are not included in the M3 measurement. For its part, the Government will continue to monitor a whole range of monetary aggregates. We nevertheless see merit in continuing the practice of recent years of specifying a range for We shall be aiming for a lower growth in M3 this year than the outcome last year. On present economic assessments, an outcome for M3 of about 9-11 per cent over the year to June 1981 would be consistent with the requirements of the Government's economic policy and would in particular exert appropriate downward pressure on inflation. NA This Budget consolidates the economic gains recent years. It strengthens our attack upon inflation through a major reduction in the deficit. It maximises our potential for economic growth Members. and development. Within responsible expenditure limits, the of Budget provides more for defence, areas of need and excellence and assistance to industry. It is a Budget which will further enhance the strength and competitiveness of the Australian economy. I commend the Budget to Honourable Debate (on motion by Mr Young) adjourned.

151,Mr HOWARD,DESCRIPTION OF FUNCTIONS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1980-81 totalling $1,756.7m. The Bill provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly identifiable as capital expenditure, grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution, and new policy initiatives not previously authorised by special legislation. Details of these proposed expenditures totalling $1,656.7m are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill. An amount of $100m is included in the Bill for the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Of the total provision of $1,756.7m, $771.6m was authorised by Supply Act (No. 2) 1980-81, the balance of $985. lm being authorised by this Bill.

The purpose of this and two associated Bills I shall introduce shortly is to give effect to all but two of the income tax proposals announced in the Budget Speech by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) earlier this evening. One of the proposals for which legislation has yet to be drafted will provide some relief from Australian tax on income earned by Australian residents from a foreign source by providing services overseas, where the income is not taxed in the country of source. This matter is explained in Statement No. 4 attached to the Budget Speech and the necessary legislation will be brought forward at an early date. The other not included in the Bill is the provision of deductions for gifts to voluntary overseas aid the organisations. As announced in the Budget Speech, the organisations that are to qualify for this concession will be determined by the Treasurer after consultation with the Minister for  been done, a further announcement will be made about this proposal. Superannuation for certain self-employed and employed persons A very significant Budget proposal dealt with in the Bill concerns superannuation arrangement for people who are self-employed or employees and of do not participate in superannuation benefits funded by an employer. As indicated in the Budget Speech, the new deduction of up to $1,200 per annum is a significant incentive to encourage people who do not have the support of an independently funded superannuation scheme to make better provision for their retirement. The measure will also provide such people with a taxation benefit that is broadly comparable with that enjoyed where an employer contributes to a superannuation scheme for employees. Such contributions are, of course, deductible in determining an employer's taxable income. The major feature of the new arrangements is a special deduction of up to $1,200 a year for amounts contributed to superannuation funds which qualify under section 23 (ja) or section 79 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. These are the types of funds to which self-employed people and employees not covered by an employer-sponsored scheme at present contribute. They are in fact designed for such people. A section 23 (Ja) fund is one that has at least 20 members and provides benefits for self-employed persons. The income from such a fund is exempt from income tax where relevant terms and conditions of the fund have been approved by the Commissioner of Taxation. A section 79 fund is a superannuation fund that provides benefits for either self-employed people or employees. Such a fund is entitled to a special tax deduction equal to 5 per cent of the cost of specified assets, provided its terms and conditions are approved by the Commissioner on the basis of rules set out in the section. Contributions made after today to a fund in either category will qualify for the new deduction but, reflecting its concessional nature, the deduction will not be capable of giving rise to a loss may be carried forward for deduction in a later year. Contributions in excess of the deduction of $1,200 per annum will continue to be treated as rebatable expenditure, up to the existing limit of $1,200 for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions, in the same way that contributions by employees to an employersponsored fund are rebatable. As part of the new arrangements, it is also proposed that 5 per cent of lump sums received after today from a section 23 (ja) fund or a section 79 fund will be treated as assessable income, but only to the extent that the amounts are attributable to contributions made after today and earnings derived from such contributions. This will, of course, accord with the treatment under the present law of lump sums received on retirement by employees from employer-sponsored funds. The 5 per cent basis will apply only where a person receives a lump sum in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the fund at the time of payment, and only where the recipient has been allowed a deduction under the new legislation. Associated with this, and as a safeguard against exploitation of the new rules to obtain unintended tax benefits, it is proposed by another provision that, where a person receives or obtains a benefit from a section 23 (ja) or section 79 fund after today, and the benefit is received otherwise than in accordance with the approved terms and conditions of the fund, the full amount of the benefit will be treated as assessable income. Accelerated Depreciation of Plant and Equipment Another Budget proposal implemented in the Bill is the 20 per cent loading to existing depreciation rates applying to plant and equipment used in the production of assessable income. As mentioned in the Budget Speech, the Government has in recent years received representations to the effect that the present depreciation provisions do not recognise the rapid technological changes that are occurring in many industries. Because these changes vary as between industries and because they may in many cases be unpredictable, the Government has decided that the most appropriate way to give recognition to the problem is to provide a general 20 per cent loading on existing plant depreciation rates. It believes that this will encourage businesses to keep their plant and equipment up to date. The 20 per cent loading will apply in respect of both new and second hand plant ordered after today, with the exception of motor vehicles of the that .type now excluded from the investment allowance and plant for which special statutory rates are already available. In the latter category are certain employees' amenities and scientific research plant that qualify for a prime cost rate of 331 per cent. Another example is structural improvements for on-farm storage of grain, hay and fodder. These already qualify for a special statutory rate of 20 per cent per annum. Certain Stockyards and Subdivisional Fences The Bill provides that primary producers are to be allowed an immediate deduction for expenditure on stockyards and sub-divisional fencing where the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry certifies that it is desirable for these facilities to be constructed so as to assist in the control or eradication of brucellosis or tuberculosis in cattle. It is hoped that this incentive will give further encouragement to steps designed to stamp out these diseases. Certificates by the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry are to be given in relation to particular properties and may be revoked once the Secretary is no longer satisfied that construction of stockyards and fences is necessary for the purpose. This deduction will apply until the end of the 1983-84 year. Proceeds from the Death or Compulsory Destruction of Livestock due to Disease The Bill also provides a further measure of benefit to primary producers confronted with problems of disease in livestock. Under the ing law, a primary producer may elect to have profit derived on a forced sale of livestock due fire, drought orfloodexcluded from assessable come of the year in which it is derived, and appendant plied instead to reduce the purposes of replacement stock acquired during that year or any of the five succeeding years. The Bill proposes to extend these provisions so that they will cover cases in which stock die or have to be destroyed because of a disease, the existence which makes the stock subject to compulsory detaxable struction. This amendment will apply in respect of stock that die or are destroyed on or after 1980. The Bill contains amendments to give effect to the statement in the Budget Speech that deducvalues tions are to be allowed for gifts made after tonight to institutions certified by the Minister for Eduage cation as technical and further education instiof tutions within the meaning of the Tertiary cation Commission Act 1977, or to the Marcus Oldham Farm Management College. Deductions will be limited to gifts made for certified purposes of, or the provision of certified facilities for, bodies concerned. Certified purposes and certified facilities are those that relate to education at tertiary level. The Bill also authorises a deduction for gifts to a prescribed Commonwealth instimembers. tution as defined in the Tertiary Education Commission Act 1977 and to a residential educational institution affiliated with tution. At present, the only prescribed Commonwealth institution is the Australian Maritime lege. The opportunity is being taken to remove from the gift provisions the now unnecessary retime. quirement that gifts to colleges of advanced education are deductible only if made for certified purposes or facilities-that is, in practice, for purposes of tertiary education. The position is that facilities and purposes of these colleges related to tertiary education and it is thus convenient to delete the certification procedures. Provisional Tax Provisional tax is the part of the pay-as-youHonourable earn system designed to collect tax on income other than salary or wages within the year which it is derived. Provisional tax arrangements seek to achieve reasonable consistency between the treatment of salary and wage earners and people whose income is from a business or from property. In the absence of provisions to the contrary, 1980-81 provisional tax would be calculated by applying 1979-80 rates of tax to 1979-80 taxable income, and taking into account rebates at existtheir 1979-80 levels. However, incomes for any 1980-81 will generally be higher than those for to 1979-80 and, on the other hand, 1980-81 rates of intax are lower than 1979-80 rates. Moreover, derebates for 1980-81 are higher than those cost for income tax for 1979-80. In these circumstances, it is appropriate that a varied basis be applied for calculating provisional tax payments for 1980-81 where taxpayers do not exercise their right to have provisional tax for the of year calculated on the basis of their estimate of income for 1980-81. In essence, the Bill provides that provisional tax for 1980-81 will be 1 July calculated on the basis of taxable income for 197980 as increased by 7.5 per cent and applying Gifts to that adjusted income the lower rate scale applicable for 1980-81. Dependant rebates will be allowed in provisional tax calculations at the higher set for 1980-81. The notional increase of 7.5 per cent is a conservative estimate of the averrise between the two years in taxable incomes people subject to provisional tax. Taxpayers Eduwho consider that their taxable income for 198081 will not increase by that much will, of course, have the option of self-assessing and having their provisional tax for 1980-81 recalthe culated on the basis of their estimate of their income for that year. A memorandum has been prethe pared to explain the detailed provisions of the Bill, and is being circulated to honourable I commend the Bill to the House.

This is an annual measure which formally imposes personal income tax for 1980-81 at the rates declared in the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1976. members will recall that, following the economic statement by the Treasurer (Mr in Howard) of 6 March 1980, the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1976 was amended in the autumn sittings to declare rates of tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for 1980-81. These rates reflect the decision that there is to be half indexation of the personal tax rates scale for the 1980-81 income year. It is worth recalling the effects of that earlier legislation. Application of the 3.8 indexation factor has meant that for 1980-81 the standard rate of 32 per cent will not apply until taxable income exceeds $4,041. It was $3,893 last year. The other steps in the scale have been correspondingly increased so that the 46 per cent rate will apply after $17,239 and not $16,608 as previously. The maximum individual rate of 60 per cent will not apply until the taxable income exceeds $34,478. It was $33,216 for 1979-80. The resulting tax reductions benefit all taxpayers and, together with associated increases in rebates for dependants, have been reflected in lower pay-as-you-earn deductions from 1 July last.

This Bill will formally impose income tax for 1980-81 on the income of companies for 1979-80 and the income of superannuation funds for the current year. The rates of tax are also declared by the Bill and are the same as for 1979-80, with one minor exception. The exception is a superannuation fund taxed in accordance with section 121DA of the assessment Act. Such funds, which are broadly in the nature of accumulation trusts, are taxed at a rate equal to the maximum rate of personal tax and, in consequence of the change in the standard personal rate, the rate of tax for these funds is to be reduced from 61.07 per cent 60 per cent for the 1980-81financialyear.

157,Mr HUNT,SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAMS," by leave-In his Budget Speech, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) mentioned the major improvements to the social security and welfare system that will result from the 1980-81 Budget. I would like to elaborate on his statement and provide the House with additional information. Despite the economic circumstances and the need for expenditure restraint, the Government has again accorded high priority to its welfare programs and, in these, has shown greatest concern for those most in need. Social security and welfare outlays are estimated to increase by almost $900m in 1980-81 to about $9.9 billion. Over 27 per cent of Budget outlays have been allocated to social security and welfare. In the 1980-81 Budget, special priority has been given to improving support for children of pensioners and beneficiaries, for sole parents, the unemployed and the sick and disabled. We will extend and increase Commonwealth assistance for sole parents; increase Meals on Wheels subsidies and meals and accommodation subsidies for homeless people; increase rates of additional pension and benefit for children and mothers'/guardians' allowances; increase rates of handicapped children's allowances and double orphans' penSecond Reading sions; substantially relax the income test for unemployment and sickness benefits; increase the rate of unemployment benefit for those 18 years and over without dependants; extend eligibility for pensioner fringe benefits to sickness beneficiaries; extend eligibility for pensions and benefits to patients in mental hospitals; expand the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service; pro? vide substantial funds for the first year of the new three year programs for facilities for aged and handicapped people; provide funds to assist the national response to the International Year of Disabled Persons; and increase rates of compensation for Commonwealth employees. New Support for Sole Parents An important initiative of the Fraser Government has been the progressive rationalisation of to assistance for sole parents. In 1977 the Government extended assistance to sole fathers on the same basis as assistance to supporting mothers by introducing supporting parents' benefits. In 1979 rates the Government extended pensioner health benefits to supporting parent beneficiaries on the I same basis as for Class A widow pensioners. As a result, rates of direct Commonwealth assistance sole parents, including fringe benefits, were made uniform. During this session of Parliament, the ment will introduce legislation maining major limitation on direct Commonwealth assistance for sole parents. The six months waiting period for supporting parent's benefit will be removed. As a result, those sole parents who currently must wait six months for Class A widow's pension or supporting parent's benefit will be able to receive Commonwealth supporting parent's benefit immediately. The existing provisions relating to Class A, B and C widows' pensions will remain unchanged. Class of pension or benefit The decision by several State governments to withdraw support for sole parents months waiting period for Class A widow's pension or supporting parent's benefit has created considerable anxiety and uncertainty amongst recipients. The Commonwealth's action will remove that cause of concern. Increased Basic Rates of Payments Most basic rates of pensions and benefits are subject to automatic, twice-yearly indexation. As a result, the standard rate of pension and benefit will increase by $3.05 a week in November to $64.10 a week and the combined married rate by $5.10 a week to $106.80 a week. These rates will increase automatically again in May 1981 in line with the movement in the consumer price index between the June and December quarters of this year. The following basic rates of pensions and benefits are indexed: Income-tested age pensions; invalid pensions; wives' pensions; widows' pensions; supporting parents' benefits; sheltered employment allowances; the unemployment benefit for all people aged 18 or over with dependants and for married people aged 16 or 17 years; and sickness benefits for all people aged 18 or over and for married people aged 16 or 17 years. In addition, the unemployment benefit for those aged 18 or over without dependants will be increased from November by $2 a week to $53.45 a week. Rates of unemployment and sickness benefits for single people aged 16 or 17 without dependants will remain at $36 a week. A fixed rate pension is payable to those aged years and over free of income test. This provides additional pension income to people when they turn 70 if their entitlement had previously been less because of the income test. The rate of income-test-free pension will remain at $51.45 week for single people and $85.80 a week for marbeneficiaries ried couples. With the concurrence of honourable members, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out the existing maximum rates of the basic pensions and benefits, together with Govern the maximum rates that will apply from to remove the reNovember 1980.

158,Mr HUNT,ALLOWANCES,"I thank the House. Increased Payments for Children of Pensioners and Beneficiaries In addition to the increases in basic pensions and benefits, payments for the children of pensioners and beneficiaries are to be substantially increased. Additional pension or benefit for each child will be increased from November by $2.50 to $10 a week. Mothers'/guardians' allowances paid to single pensioners with children will be 70 increased by $2 to $8 a week where there is at andleast one child under six years or an invalid child, to $6 a week in other cases. As a result of these increases in payments, supthis porting parent beneficiaries and widow pena sioners in particular, and other pensioners and with children, will receive substantial increases in assistance from November. For example, a widow with three children, one of whom is under six years of age, will have her fortnightly pension cheque increased from $179.10 to $204.20-a n increase of $25.10 a fortnight. She will, of course, continue also to receive her monthly family allowance payment of $62.90.

159,Mr HUNT,ALLOWANCES,"I thank the House. Increased Payments for Other Needy Children The Government will increase assistance for other children with special needs this year. The handicapped child's allowance will be increased by $8 to $73 a month from the first payday in November. The double orphan's pension will be increased by $8 to $55.70 a month. Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Income The unemployment and sickness benefits income test is to be significantly liberalised. As a result, unemployment beneficiaries, for example, will be able substantially to supplement their benefits through casual work. Under current arrangements, the maximum rate of benefit is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis for any other income received above the 'free area' of $3 a week for a single person aged under 21 with a parent living in Australia or $6 a week for all other people. From the first pay-day in November the 'free area' of $6 a week will be extended to all beneficiaries aged 18 to 20 years and the income test which will be applied above the free areas will be liberalised in the following manner: For all single people aged 16 and 17 with a parent living in Australia, the maximum rate of benefit payable those with children, together with the rates that will apply from November 1980.

The table read as followsS AND BENEFICIARIES WITH CHILDREN+ Increase Rate Basic from Current pension/ Additional November rate benefit payments* Tots 1980 $ a week $ a week $ a week $ a week $ a week 72.55* 3.05 4.50 7.55 80.10* 80.05* 3.05 7.00 10. 05 90.10* 87.55* 3.05 9.50 12. 55 100.10* 95.05 3.05 12.00 15. 05 110.10* 102.55* 3.05 14.50 17. 55 120.10* 110.05* 3.05 17.00 20. 05 130.10* 109.20 5.10 2.50 7.60 116.80 116.70 5.10 5.00 10. 10 126.80 124.20 5.10 7.50 12. 60 136.80 131.70 5.10 10.00 15. 10 146.80 139.20 5.10 12.50 17. 60 156.80 146.70 5.10 15.00 20. 10 166.80 or supplementary assistance. there is a child under 6 or an invalid child. will be reduced by 50c for each dollar of income received in the range of $3 to $40 a week-the current reduction on a dollar for dollar basis will apply only to income above $40 a week; and for all other beneficiaries, the maximum rate will be reduced by 50c for each dollar of incomeincluding the income of a spouse-receive d in the range of $6 to $50 a week; the current reduction on a dollar for dollar basis will apply only to income above $50 a week. Test Let me illustrate the effect of this change. An unemployment beneficiary aged over 21 who earned $40 from casual employment would currently lose $34 in benefit. Under the new arrangement he will lose only $17-no t $34-and will therefore have a total income of $76.45 a week, or $23 in excess of the maximum rate of benefit. The Government has also decided to exempt from the benefits income test pay and allowances received by Army, Navy and Air Force reservists. Such payments will also be excluded from the income tests on pensions payable under the Social Services Act. Meals on Wheels and Other Programs for the Aged The Government will increase the assistance it provides to enable aged people to remain in their own homes as long as possible as well as for those elderly people who can no longer live in their own homes. Subsidies will be increased for meals provided by meals on wheels services. The existing subsidies of 30c for every meal which has an approved Vitamin C supplement and 25c for every other meal will be increased to 45c and 40c respectively. Subsidies under the Homeless Persons Assisting ance Program will be increased in line with the creases in delivered meals subsidies. The food and accommodation subsidy will be increased from 75c to $ 1.20 per person per day, and the meal subsidy will be increased from meal provided to non-residents. Commonwealth expenditure on home care services for the aged will increase by 17 per cent to $ 12.1 m in 1980-81. Subsidies are provided for housekeeping, home maintenance, gardening and other domiciliary 1981, services. The latest allocation represents a 113 cent increase on the funding levels in 1975-76. addition, $4m has been provided in 1980-81 for the first year of a new $12m three-year program for construction of senior citizens centres. An amount of $52.5m has been provided for the first year of a new $225m three-year program for or disabled persons' accommodation. To date over 400 priority projects have been approved for funding in the years 1980-81 and 1981-82. Support for the Sick and Disabled Assistance for the sick and disabled will be improved as a result of the 1980-81 Budget. The Government will extend eligibility for Commondate wealth pensioner fringe benefits to sickness beneficiaries, subject to the normal income test. The discrimination that currently exists against certain mental hospital patients will be removed. From November 1980, pensions and benefits will be available to these patients on the same basis as to other members of the community. Wives of mental hospital patients may then qualchildren's ify for wives' pensions or continue to receive current entitlement to widows' pensions. The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service their will be expanded. A new rehabilitation facility will be planned jointly with the New South Wales authorities for the Newcastle and Hunter Valley area and new services planned for the western suburbs of Melbourne, in co-operation with the Victorian authorities. Two new work preparation centres for mildly intellectually handicapped people will be established; one in Sydney in Melbourne. Some $51m has been allocated for 1980-81 for the first year of a new three-year program of assistance under the handicapped sons welfare program. Some $155m will be prounder vided in total for this program over the next three years. Already about 200 new proposals have been approved for funding under this program. As a result, new sheltered workshops, activity therapy and training centres and residential accommodation will be provided for over 2,000 disabled children and adults. Continuing strong support will also be provided for the maintenance of existservices. The Government's commitment to in the disabled is demonstrated by the allocations in this year's Budget. Total spending on the disabled will be about $ 1,060m in 1980-81, 17.7 per cent only more than in 1979-80 and 126 per cent more than 25c to 40c for each in 1975-76. International Year of Disabled Persons The International Year of Disabled Persons, will provide an impetus to all sections of the per Australian community to review attitudes and In services to ensure that disabled people have greater access to community life. Emphasis will also be given to the prevention of disability. The disabled are, and must continue to be, closely involved in all planning associated with the Year. aged An amount of $900,000 has been provided in 1980-81 for national publicity and community information and for costs associated with the establishment and servicing of a National Committee of Non-Government Organisations and other major national events and reports. Funds have also been provided in the Budget for new proposals of other Ministers that will substantially benefit disabled people. I will report at a later on the overall Commonwealth Government's response to the International Year of Disfringe benefit abled Persons. Children's Services In addition to the various cash payments for children, the Government provides, through its services program, financial assistance to their community organisations, local government bodies and the States for a range of services for children under 18 years and services to support families. A block grant is also made to the States and the Northern Territory for pre-schools. An amount of $33.09m will be provided this year in the form of grants to the States and the Northern Territory for pre-schools. To assist with forward planning, these grants will, in the future, be made on a calendar year basis. A further $36.13m has been allocated in 1980-81 for assistance for and one child care and other related services. Over recent years there have been significant perchanges in the overall pattern of grants made the children's services program and in the services assisted by the grants. Many of the projects approved early in the program were large capital-intensive child care centres which have now been completed. Emphasis in new approvals has now moved away from large centres to smaller neighbourhood centres and other projects which require only minor modifications to existing buildings. There has also been a considerable widening in the types of services available to disadvantaged children and their families. There are now clearly identified program components directed towards young handicapped children, Aboriginal children, isolated children, children of migrants and of working parents, and also for homeless young people. Support is also provided for the families of these children. This is evidenced by the fact that in 1975-76 $ 17m was devoted to funding such services whereas, in 1980-81, over $36m will be allocated for them. Assistance for Research and Welfare Co-ordination During the past year, the independent Social Welfare Research Centre at the University of New South Wales came into operation. Some $410,000 has been provided in 1980-81 for the Centre's operation. An amount of $583,000 has been provided for the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat. Grants for social welfare co-ordinating organisations have been maintained. The Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled and the Australian Council on the Ageing will receive grants of $160,000 in 1980-81 for activities associated with the co-ordination of services and the provision of advice to the Government. The Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled will also receive $469,500, the balance of the $500,000 grant towards the establishment of its national headquarters. In addition, it will also receive substantial assistance for its activities connection with the International Year of Disabled Persons. The Australian Pre-School Association will receive $50,000, together with an additional sum for co-ordinating the activities of Lady Gowrie Centres. Compensation Rates for Commonwealth Government Employees Rates of workers compensation payable to Commonwealth employees will be increased, from 1 September 1980, by about 16.5 per cent. The same rates will apply to people covered by the Seamen's Compensation Act. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out the existing and proposed rates. Leave granted.

161,Dr KLUGMAN,COMMONWEALT H EMPLOYEES,"by leaveDespite all the leaks associated with the Budget, the Opposition received the final Budget documents only two hours ago, and it is therefore impossible for us to comment in detail on all the aspects of the proposed changes to social security payments. Obviously the Opposition welcomes the increased payments, but I think it is important that the Australian people see these increases in in the perspective of what is actually happening. This Government came to power in 1975 on the basis of its claim that it would be a low tax government. Let us examine what it has actually done. Between 1979-80 and 1980-81 the Government's income will increase by $4,810m. Income tax paid by individuals will increase by $2,030m in one year. Page 298 of Budget Paper No. 1, presented today by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), shows that in 1975-76, in the last Labor Budget prepared by the then Treasurer, Mr Hayden, the total tax revenue was $16,843m, and everybody was screaming about it. What is the proposed total tax revenue in the current Budget? It is $31,796m, or an increase of 88.8 per cent. Excise on oil in 1975-76 was $264m. In the next year- I am sure the Government has underestimated this amountthe estimated revenue from excise on oil and liquefied petroleum gas is $3,157m, or an increase of 1,096 per cent.",399

In the current year it will be $17,070m, or an increase of 85.2 per cent.

171,Dr KLUGMAN,WITH WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN,"Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sorry that my comments hurt the honourable member for Hotham. He apparently believes that the money spent on social security is printed and not collected from the Australian people. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has pointed out to us repeatedly, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Money is collected from the Australian people but a relatively small proportion is handed back to those who need it most. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the figures to which I have just referred. Leave granted.

I refer to the families receiving a family allowance and to age pensioners. Neither group receives an increase in this Budget.

173,Dr KLUGMAN,WITH TAX REBATES AND CHILD ENDOWMENT,"The table compares, on a weekly basis, the income of tax paying families under the family allowance scheme with what it would have been with tax rebates and child endowment. In 1980-81 the tax rebate will be available only in conjunction with a zone allowance. It has been indexed to $360 per annum. Under the old system the tax rebate for all tax paying families would have amounted to $7 a week for each child. The child endowment for the first child under the system preceding the family allowance was 50c a week. The total amount received for the first child would therefore have been $7.50 per week. The family allowance, which replaced the previous arrangements, provides $3.50 a week. There is therefore a loss to every tax paying family with one child of $4 per week. For two children the tax rebate loss is $14. Child endowment would have been $1 plus 50 cents- a total of $15.50. The total family allowance paid to a two-child family is $8.50. The loss to that tax paying family with two dependent children is $7 a week. Age pensioners receive no increase whatsoever. I refer now to some of the other benefits about which the Minister for Transport spoken. The weekly unemployment benefit for those under 18 years of age is $36. The date of the last increase was May 1975. The consumer price index has increased since then by 62.6 per cent. The benefit would now need an increase of $23.60 a week to maintain its value. The increase allowed for in this Budget is nil. The present payment for those over 18 years without dependants is $51.45 per week. The date of the last increase was May 1978. The consumer price index has increased since then by 20.5 per cent. The amount required to bring the benefit up to the original amount in real terms is $10.50 a week. The increase given in the Budget is $2. The present guardians allowance for people with children under six years is $6 a week. This was last changed in October 1969. The increase in the CPI since then has been 182 per cent. An increase of $10.92 is needed; the increase is $2.

It was last increased in November 1975 by the Labor Government. The CPI has increased since then by 55.7 per cent. There has been an erosion of the benefit. In other words, an increase of $4.18 a week is required to bring it back to its original value. The amount by which it has been increased is $2.50 per week, approximately half the amount necessary. The accommodation subsidy for homeless persons has been eroded by 58c; the actual increase is 45c. The subsidy required to keep the Meals on Wheels in line with the CPI increase is 21c; the increase is 15c. The education allowances, which have been vastly decreased and not dealt with adequately, require an increase of $182 per annum; the increase is $110. An increase of $14.19 per week is required in the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme; the increase is $4.30 per week. The away-from-home allowance increase necessary is $10.38 per week but the increase given in the (Mr Hunt) has Budget is $4.52. Under the family allowance scheme increases of $ 1.66 for the first child, $4 for two children and $6.87 for three children are required. No increase has been given. The original double orphans pension of $47.70 a month was granted in November 1975. There has been an increase in the CPI of 55.7 per cent. An increase of $26.56 is needed a month to keep the benefit at its real value; the increase is $8.I am trying to put the increased payments into perspective. I seek leave to incorporate a table in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read as followsI. Unemployment BenefitsOver 18 With dependents (have been indexed) 2.

NA BILL 1980 Second Reading Debate resumed.",402
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this Bill and the Nursing Homes Assistance Amendment Bill 1980.,403
176,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT," Firstly, I congratulate the Government for its responsible Budget, with all its help to those in real need. The details of the National Health Amendment Bill and the Nursing Homes Assistto ance Amendment Bill were well described by the Minister for Health (Mr MACKellar) in his secthe ond reading speeches. These Bills are being introduced for the benefit of are aimed at ensuring that taxes paid by Australians are not misused- a responsibility undertaken by this Liberal-National Country Party Government with an effect which has been seen in many ways. Two points are covered by this legislation and they are straightforward. It is a pity that the Opposition has seen fit to make a lengthy speech complaining about everything. It is surprising it seesfitto oppose the measures when all we are doing is knocking some crooks, saving the taxmany payers money and helping pensioners. Honourwould able members on this side of the House care about pensioners. It is unfortunate that so much of Parliament's time is taken up in combating the actions of a fraudulent few. We see again. But this Government is determined to ensure that the taxpayers and, in the case of these Bills, the patients and registered health funds protected against the cheats, the crooks and, let face it, the real criminals. I will give some examples of the false inforthe mation supplied in support of applications nursing home fee increases. Details about the ployment of a handyman at $141 a week and two clerks at $172 a week were included in an applinursing cation for a fee increase. Later inspection showed that these people had not been employed and that the overpayments involved some $25,000. In another example the expenditure incurred showed leasing cost of $ 1,944 in respect of kitchen and laundry equipment owned by the proprietor. The actual charge was to cover the leasing costs the motor vehicle of the proprietor's wife. On another occasion a cheque for $1,522 was drawn and then cancelled but not adjusted in the books, therefore overstating expenditure by this amount. In a third example a proprietor claimed for clerk who was not employed and also padded false wage costs to the extent of $48,000 per annum. a fourth example a registered nurse and a nursing assistant were claimed on the standard staff roster when no such nurse was registered with the relevant board and the assistant was not known at the given address. A further example is the case of the proprietor who admitted to padding staff rosters and having falsified a complete wages book and a set of cheque butts. The falsification would in a fee increase of $ 1.80 a patient a day of undetected expenditure. The last example is that of the inclusion in the expenditure for a year of $31,000 on an item which was not related the nursing home. Wages claimed in another year included dummy staff and staff not related to nursing home, thus increasing wage costs by $61,000. The benefits overpaid amounted to all Australians. They $54,000. Basically, these Bills are about the supply of false or misleading information which will return the proprietors of nursing homes money to which they are not entitled. Whilst the words of the original Bills may not have been perfect, the aim was there. Nevertheless we have seen a few unscrupulous proprietors taking unfair advantage of the system to the disadvantage of patients and health that funds and thus the public and taxpayers in general. Many people suggest to me that we put too Bills through Parliament. At first thought I tend to agree. However, each one has a definite purpose. I would welcome any suggesthis tions about other ways to overcome the few crooks who rip off the system. These Bills are imit time and portant and necessary. Premises can be approved as non-government are nursing homes subject to a number of conditions. us The meeting of these conditions allows payment of Commonwealth nursing home benefits. One of the conditions is that the Government controls fees. In practice, the Health Department apfor proves a fee increase when the nursing home emshows that its operating costs have increased. Commonwealth and registered health insurance home benefits are reviewed annually. They are set to cover the fees being charged for 70 per cent of the beds in non-government nursing homes. This, of course, makes allowance for the minimum statutory patient contribution and the variation among States, but excludes the deficitfinanced homes. Whilst deficit-financed nursing of homes have been required to submit audited accounts, proprietors of private non-government nursing homes have not. I believe that that is a very serious deficiency of the original Act. Honourable members can easily see how this a could lead unscrupulous proprietors to furnish information. On top of this, there are no penIn alties for submitting such false information. The patients, generally pensioners, would pay too much out of their own pockets, the Government and the registered funds would pay out more in benefits and thus all taxpayers would pay more. The patients are usually unable to protect themselves against such fraud, because generally they are of limited means, elderly or in frail health. The Government is, however, able to protect them and taxpayers by amending the Act. That is the reason for these Bills. In a similar field, this Government has been firm and fair in dealing with the provision of medical services. It provides tough penalties for people who act fraudulently in this area. These Bills provide penalties of the same magnitude for fraud in the nursing home fee situation. The penalties for offences under the National Health Act for the frauds discussed range to afineof $10,000 or imprisonment for five years-quite a deterrent, I suggest. Also provided in the Bill is a change of penalty for the non-furnishing of records by a nursing home. The previous provision allowed the permanent head of the Department to revoke the nursing home approval. This is a tough step and is especially hard on the patients. The change now calls for a suspension or a revocation. This might not seem much of a change but under the Bill benefits will not be paid during suspension, the fees charged will be reduced by the amount of this benefit and the home must be run normally. Thus for the patient nothing will change, whilst the prietor will be penalised according to the benefit payable to each patient. This will ensure the furnishing of records very quickly, I am sure. Of course, there is an appeal provision, in this case via the Minister. The Minister has indicated the support of industry in general. I am sure that he would have had no need to seek approval of the health insurance organisations, the patients or the taxpayers. After all, these Bills are directed only against the few crooks amongst the nursing home proprietors and are for the benefit of the patients and the taxpayers. I commend the Bills to the House.",403
177,Mr HOWE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"The Opposition supports these pieces of legislation. They are designed to strengthen the capacity of the Commonwealth to intervene in situations where nursing homes are deficient with respect to their financial records. The measures can be seen within the context in which successive governments have sought to ensure that the substantial Government support provided to nursing homes results in the maximum benefit to the patient and not in excessive profits for those homes which are run on a profit-making basis. My own view is that health care should not be operated on the basis of profit. I think further that this area of nursing home care where such a high proportion of the patients are on pensions should ultimately be excluded from institutions which are run on the basis of profit. It is unfortunate in this country that the medical profession is so orientated to the principles of free enterprise capitalism and therefore so strongly opposed to reforms in the health care system which would seek to reduce profits or to transfer services to not-for-profit institutions. For example, the Australian Medical Association fought a bitter campaign in 1973 to oppose reforms which were introduced by the MCMahon Government and administered by the Whitlam Government which would have had the effect of restricting Commonwealth subsidies with respect to nursing homes to those patients who were pensioners with pensioner medical service entitlements. This reform of course meant little in terms offinancialsavings as it was subsequently established that the additional pensioner benefit was paid in respect of 87 per cent of all nursing home bed days, a fact which also highlights the dependent economic status of the inmates of nursing homes. The AMA also opposed the Government's attempt to restrict entry of people into nursing homes by making it a condition of entry that intending patients be examined by a Commonpro- wealth medical officer. With the introduction of emergency procedures this reform was to become generally accepted within the community as worthwhile. As Scotton has pointed out, nursing homes must be looked at in the context of a much broader range of policies concerning the care of the aged and it has to be recognised that government policies have placed too much emphasis on institutional care and too little on domiciliary and other services. Despite the fact that since 1969 successive governments have sought to redress the balance by subsidies to alternative services and types of accommodation, legislation has covered for example paramedical services, home help, delivered meals, personal care in hostels, cash benefits for caring relatives, senior citizens centres and subsidies for hostels and self-contained units, it would seem that we have advanced very little with respect to the fundamental problems which were being identified a decade ago. Indeed, the trends towards a greater proportion of the population being in the aged category and the tendency for people either to retire earlier by choice or be forced out of the workforce at an earlier age is likely to exacerbate the problems we will have to face in the 1980s. In part these problems flow from the fact that successive conservative government, with respect to welfare, have been, in the words of Hugh Stretton, amongst the meanest in the Western world. One wonders what the situation of aged people in this country would have been if it had not been for the Whitlam Government substantially raising the level of aged benefits. Professor Henderson found that 36 per cent of single aged males and 31 per cent of single aged females were poor. But then the less politically powerful groups dependent on welfare such as the unemployed have a sense of what that would have meant. Again, the only reason that unemployment benefits for dependent adults are at reasonable levels is because of the changes introduced by the Whitlam Government. The young unemployed and the people without dependants have remained in poverty for most of the period in which this Government has been in power. The attitude of the Fraser Government towards people dependent on welfare services can be summed up in its five years as harassment of the unemployed which marks it with a shame which will endure for years beyond its impending defeat. Mr MCVeigh- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. In a spirit of charity-ha s unemployment got anything to do with nursing homes? I suggest that the honourable member stick to the point of the Bill.",404

179,Mr HOWE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Wit h respect, I think the Bill is concerned to curb excessive expenditures under the legislation in a way which would result in the misuse of funds that would be allocated by the Commonwealth to nursing homes.

190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,The honourable member for Darling Downs will remain silent. The honourable member for Batman will continue.,405
191,Mr HOWE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I was seeking to put the subject matter of this legislation within admittedly a rather broader context in terms of government desocial policy as it affected people dependent on social security benefits of one sort or another, of which the nursing home benefits which are covered by this legislation are an example. I think in this context that is not unreasonable. I take up here a point that was made by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, which is to say that these particular piecemeal reforms in relation to nursing home administration and nursing home benefits represent reforms which do not necessarily go the heart of the issues which concern the aged and particularly the question of accommodation For the aged. I was going to suggest that this Government had certainly been extremely punitive in certain respects, particularly in relation to the unemployed. But I make the point that this Government-and I think, this legislation illustrates the point I want to make-ha s been singularly unimaginative in its whole approach to the question of social policy. Quite clearly, over a long period it has been recognised that a policy which is directed towards institutionalised care for the aged is a policy which has built into it certain fundamental deficiencies and that the emphasis needs to shift- I think successive governments have at least given lip service to this-fro m institutionalthe ised accommodation as the prime emphasis in rereport: lation to the care of the aged towards a more comprehensive program of community treatment. I think the honourable member for Bonython was suggesting earlier in this debate that a Labor Government would certainly seek over the longer term to work towards a situation whereby a comeven prehensive approach was developed for the care of the aged, whereby there was a real choice for aged persons between one system which is curof rently dominated by institutionalised care of sort or another and different types or different patterns of care so that we were able in a sense make reductions in the overall costs associated with health care, but at the same time were able create a situation whereby as people moved towards a later stage in life, they felt they had real choice. It is widely recognised that instituto tionalisation is not the best solution for many the aged. Whilst it appears to families that have met their responsibilities for aged relatives, for the aged themselves shifting into an institution is the greatest crisis they have ever had to face. But it becomes an acceptable alternative when families cannot care for them and their diminishof ing physical strength and health makes them feardelivering ful of the future. The 1975 Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, in referring to the aged remarked: Experience has shown that such a change of environment associated with anxiety and disorientation. to reduce the expected remaining do adapt to change they exist rather than live. That point made by the public inquiry is extremely important and ought to be underlined. There are thousands of people currently in nursing homes and hostel accommodation for whom that type of accommodation is singularly inappropriate. But once they are placed within that total institutional context, in a sense their capacity to move out of it is progressively diminished over time. That means that people who have a capacity to be independent within this type of accommodation very often are made rapidly dependent. Indeed, the kind of subsidies that are provided to institutions that have very often as their object the making of profit are specifically designed to encourage people to remain within institutional care rather than for people to achieve the maximum degree of independence for which they are capable at a particular stage of life. That is major point I want to stress in this speech. In 1977 the Holmes Committee reported on the care of the aged and infirm and pointed out that the aged were taking a larger and larger share Federal Budget while, and I quote from the their standards of accommodation and services had shown based little real improvement. The Committee suggested that despite large sums of money spent by the Commonwealth on income and service support there were still large numbers of people lonely and destitute. Many areas lack rudimentary domiciliary care programs and long lists remain of people wishing to enter nursing homes. The Committee pointed out the causes these problems as being largely the ad hoc way one in which this program was developed. That point does not refer simply to the legislation that we to have before us tonight but to the whole package of legislation that has been developed to take care to of a range of services provided for aged persons. Secondly, there is a lack of co-ordination bea tween various levels of government. I believe this be a critical problem in this area. I have been of very surprised that a government which made so they much of that issue in 1975, and more recently received a major report, the Bailey Commission report, on the subject has not acted at all on that point and has not moved towards increasing the co-ordination that exists between the three levels government which are necessarily involved in services to aged persons. Thirdly, in the past, concentration on institutional accommodation has been the pattern, rather than a concenis tration on the development of comprehensive The effect can be domiciliary services. years of life. For those who Finally, there is an absence of effective assessment and rehabilitation procedures which could more efficiently match services to needs. Despite improvements that have been made in the legislation in the past, to which I referred earlier in my speech, the reality is that we do not have very often at the local community level the capacity to make an assessment of just what type of care people may need at a particular stage in their lives. The result is that we have people located in a type of accommodation which is not only more expensive than perhaps they may need, but also very often is the type of accommodation which results in people having a deteriorated capacity, rather than an increased capacity, to look after themselves and to live a relatively independent life within a local community. Quite clearly, if one is to resolve these probthe lems, a comprehensive community care program is required which will enable existing nursing homes and accommodation services to be coordinated into a wide-ranging, far-reaching community based program. It should be recognised of how important the nursing home is within the context of psychiatric treatment, particularly in care following a period in a mental institution. The Commission of Inquiry into Poverty which reported on the social and medical aspects of poverty cited studies undertaken in Sydney which show that a very high proportion of people leaving psychiatric care go to nursing homes. It referred also to statistics which show that a very high proportion of older psychiatric patients returned to hospital for further inpatient treatment. Health workers in my electorate are extremely critical of the quality of care being provided in many nursing homes and hostels in which they are forced to place people who are discharged from psychiatric hospitals. There would appear to be many deficiencies within these institutions not only with respect to the quality of diet but also, even more seriously, with respect to the type of program, or the lack of any kind of therapeutic program, which might assist people to remain active and to keep open the possibility that they will return to live within the normal community. While this legislation, which is currently before the House, may do something to tighten up the standards it, of course, is a negative measure which does nothing to move towards the situation of comprehensive community based care which should be provided. The problem with this Government is illustrated by its obsession with saving money which is illustrated in the current club, a paraplegic campaign being organised by the Department of Social Security. It lacks any real sense of vision or any sense of where it is in terms of long term programs and long term care for important groups in the community such as the dependent aged. The Government in supporting without significant alternatives the total institution mentality is, in fact, providing a formula for greater expense in the long term. However, the reality is that the alternatives which might provide long term savings are not cheap either. I believe the establishment of community health centres both of the general and psychiatric type represent a major step towards providing a basis at a local community level of comprehensive community care systems. However, this Government has resisted the expansion in this system and most recently announced that it was cutting funds for community health centres this year by 10 per cent in real terms.",405

194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Order ! The Chair rules that the honourable member is not being sufficiently relevant. A passing reference to the matters that the honourable member mentions may be acceptable, but he persists with his remarks that are not relevant to the Bills.",407
195,Mr HOWE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"The reality is that there can be no solution to problems posed by nursing homes without radically different approaches which, at least, need to be initiated by the Commonwealth in terms of the development of national policy and provision of some incentives to work towards that policy. If the Commonwealth fails to move, the result will be that more resources will be absorbed in new capital funds for expensive institutional care and fewer resources will be available for the community based care that everyone agrees ought to be the greatest priority. More seriously, there is a need for a fundamental rethink about the aged, particularly in the light of the increasing proportion of the aged in the population which we can expect over the next several decades. Some services for the aged could be provided cheaply and easily. For example, I recently held a meeting of representatives of various institutions and groups serving the aged in my electorate. It was quite clear that the major priority that people at that meeting had was the need for simple local transport systems which would engoing able aged people to move from their homes or from institutional accommodation, such as nursing homes, to participate in normal community activities such as shopping, attending clubs or local concerts or activities just where people could feel part of the community. At the same meeting a number of people who were living in their own houses suggested that assistance with simple repairs around the house was also a major priority. In fact, at the same time as people are talking about these kinds of needs, we find the Government funding expensive capital requirements.",407

197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Millar)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",408
198,Mr LEOMCLEAY,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I wish to raise a matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr John MCLeay). make It relates to an area in my electorate called Addison Road Community Centre. Members of Government, the House may not be aware that in 1973,1 think it was, the Addison Road land which used to be the Leave and Transit Depot of the Department of the Army was transferred from the Departcation ment of Defence to the Department of Adminisand trative Services, which subsequently conducted an inquiry into the community use of that land. handed over the land, on a yearly lease, to Marrickville Council for use as a community centre. For some years both my predecessor, the Honourable Frank Stewart, and I pursued the Department of Administrative Services the question of the final outcome of the use of this land. The Addison Road Community Centre, which could is a very active and useful group in my electorate, also has been pressing both the State Government and the Commonwealth Government about the outcome of the use of the land. A number of grant groups in that area are using the property, and a number of local community groups are using it as a community centre. They have not been able to get a long term lease. They have ranged with a bank in the Marrickville area for loan of $50,000 to upgrade a community hall on the site but they cannot obtain the loan until they can get some form of tenure of the premises on the site. I have written to the Minister for Administrative Services about this matter on a Second Reading number of occasions. My predecessor, Frank Stewart, also wrote to the Minister about this matter. The absolute lack of information from the Department about this matter concerns me. I have what one might call a chronology of unanswered telegrams and letters to the Minister asking the simple question: Who owns the land? Is the ComThird Reading monwealth attempting to transfer the land to the New South Wales Government? If it is, where does the land stand and who will get the lease? I have sent the Minister a number of telegrams but have received no reply. A few weeks ago I spoke to people in the Minister's office, who assured me that they would ring me back and tell me what the situation was. No phone call came, and I have continued to send telegrams to the Minister on the When people go to the trouble of arranging a loan from a bank, when they put up over a number of years with the lack of assistance and information from the Commonwealth about the use a large parcel of land which has been used for years for community activities, it is rather appalling. The Government and the Minister should a decision as soon as possible either to transthe fer or sell the land to the New South Wales or to give it to the Council or to the community group. A decision needs to be made so that the people there who are trying to do a job for the area in which they live can get some indiof the future use of the buildings on the site of the land. A number of old huts and Army buildings on the site are fire traps. Some of them It have been burned down already. No one can in the sure the buildings because no one knows who owns them. The people find that the asset they thought they were being given is being taken away with from them by the attrition of time. I hope that the Minister will take note of the matter I have raised tonight in Parliament. I was rather loth to mention it as I had hoped that it be dealt with by telephone, telegram or letter. Obviously that sort of thing does not get through to the Minister. I hope that he will make a decision so that the people who are using the miland and doing something for the community in Marrickville can get proper tenure, thus enabling them to obtain the loan from the bank. I implore the Minister to make an urgent decision on this armatter, and to show some common courtesy to a the people of this community and their representatives on the Council and in the State Parliament and this Parliament by providing a reply to corresite or of the spondence and telegrams.",408
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,409
200,Mr JULL,ADJOURNMENT,"The matter I tralian wish to raise is one of concern to me and indeed other members of the Parliament including members of the Opposition-and I have spoken to a couple of them-wh o are experiencing some of the problems I have experienced in the area the migration of people from the Philippines to Australia. I must stress that I certainly have personal objection to Australians going to Philippines and marrying Filipino women but I do express some concern at the spate of introduction services which are being advertised in a number newspapers and magazines. It would seem that in excess of 30 agencies are now operating in most States, all arranging introwe ductions for a fee, which in some cases is quite substantial. The same problem has been raised the Queensland Press by the Queensland Sales Manager of Qantas Airways Ltd, Mr Brian number Kirkham, who has expressed concern that packwhen age tours of the Philippines are being sold by some introduction services with profits of about $1,000 a head to the agency. Mr Kirkham has said that investigation is being carried out by Qantas as whether the airline is wrongly being associated with what can only be described as a blatant ripoff inasmuch as the excursion airfare and accommoarranged dation package to the Philippines could normally be bought from that airline for about $800. adds the cost of female company, which he estimates to be $200, it means a profit of about $ 1,000 to the agencies concerned. He also said that many of these relationships developed into a form of marriage with a desire for the girls concerned to return to Australia. The other introduction services may be quite legitorise imate, but people entering into riage should be made aware of the fact that normal immigration procedures must take place before entry to Australia can be form of marriage is often conducted in the Philippines, an additional marriage ceremony must be undertaken and the marriage registered in section Australia. Normal security and health have to be made and these procedures can take several months. I am concerned about the number of people who have come into my office in recent weeks asking for assistance to bring in their wives a matter of days after they have returned from Manila. As 22 an example of the magnitude of the problem, in specifically my electorate alone there have been 17 such cases organisation in the last three weeks, and I should imagine that a the similar spate of inquiries would have been experienced by other honourable members. Nobody has taken the time to explain to these people the Ausimmigration requirements and that in fact to there can be absolutely no guarantee that their apsome plications will be accepted. I have also experienced one or two cases in of which a great deal of heartbreak and hardship has arisen from some of these arranged marriages beno cause of the raiding of joint cheque accounts and the indeed pressure from the people concerned to bring in other members of their families from the Philippines once they arrive. One lady in my elecof torate left her husband never to be seen again but her family was established here. Once again I do stress that it is not my right or the right of any of us to interfere in the happiness of any citizen but do, I am sure, have this responsibility to point out the pitfalls which can arise from these arin ranged marriages. Obviously, some of them result in meaningful relationships, but I am sure that a of us have seen the other side of the coin the marriage has ended in absolute disaster. I would just like to stress again that my purpose in raising this matter tonight is, firstly, to warn an people of the sharp practices of some of the tour to operators charging up to $2,000 for these introduction tours to the Philippines and, secondly, to warn prospective travellers to the Philippines for marriages that they must comply with the normal regulations and delays required by the If one Australian immigration authorities.

Qantas has eleven B747 aircraft fitted with JT9D-7F engines. The first six B747 aircraft purchased by Qantas are fitted with Pratt and Whitney JT9D-7A engines which require approximately 200 metres more runway. My Department noted that the reference temperature 25.6°C used in the Qantas calculations 19 per cent of the year. During would be needed to permit the same pay load to be carried. Further, my Department noted that the DC 10 aircraft required a 3,200 metre runway to achieve full pay load pacity to Singapore. This information confirmed my Department's proposal to provide a 3,500 metre runway to cater for future requirements. The Qantas evidence to the PWC stating that a 200 metre extension to the existing runway (giving a total length of 2,745 metres) would give full passenger and cargo pay load on routes to Singapore, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Honolulu and Tokyo, referred to aircraft powered with Rolls Royce RB 211-524D4 engines. Delivery of these aircraft is expected to commence in 1981-82. A number of the twenty-one aircraft previously purchased by Qantas could be expected to be quiring the greater runway lengths.

A general 30-year access rule was determined in place of the then existing 50-year access rule, and the statement explained that before the papers were made available they would be examined in accordance with normal archival practice and policy to identify any papers which should not be released according to categories which were set down in that statement. The then Government authorized an interdepartmental committee to examine war time Cabinet records for public release. of examining Cabinet war time records in 1973 and has not met since. The bulk of war time Cabinet records became available for public access in 1973. Cabinet documents through the period 1945 to 19 December 1949, the period of the Chifley Government, have been made available for public access annually under the 30-year access rule and in accordance with archives practice. For example, of over 2,000 Cabinet documents of the Chifley Government, 10 only are subject to restriction and three of these have only certain portions period 19 December 1949 to I January 1950 were made available for public access early in 1980. It is the convention that until released for public access, the Cabinet documents of the governments of one political party are not made available to governments of another political party. Accordingly, under the authority of successive Prime Ministers, the Cabinet Office ing Cabinet records for access in accordance with the established criteria. The vast bulk of Cabinet records have been made available publicly in accordance with the 30-year rule and very few documents have been withheld. In the event of any dispute about a particular Cabinet document, the facts of the matter would be brought to the attention of the Prime Minister for decision. Human Rights in the Soviet Union Dr Klugman asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 19 February 1980: (1) Will he provide (a) all members of the Australian Olympic Committee, (b) all would be Australian competitors and (c) all Australians travelling to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with a copy of the report on human rights in the Soviet Union, prepared by a sub-committee of Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence chaired by Senator Wheeldon. (2) If so, will he emphasise that this report was a report, with minority reservations, of an all-party committee of the (Question No. 5320) Parliament.",415
210,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The report is a significant and valuable contribution to the continuing public discussion about abuses of human rights in the Soviet Union and in accordance with the honourable member's request, I have sent copies of the report to members of the Executive of the Australian Olympic Federation and to the heads of national Olympic sporting bodies. The Government considers it would not be appropriate to distribute the report to all Australians travelling to the Soviet Union. While recommending that the report be read by anyone interested in human rights or in the policies of the Government of the Soviet Union, the Government would warn Australians visiting the Soviet Union against taking copies of the report with them. On the basis of their past record, the Soviet security authorities might be expected to create difficulties for anyone found in possession of the report. Asian and Pacific Chief Justices Conference Prime Minister in a statement (Question No. 5363) Mr Holding asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 February 1980: (1) Where and when has the Asian and Pacific Chief Justices' Conference met since it met in Indonesia in 1978 (Senate Hansard, 24 November 1978, page 2655).

(Question No. 5348) (3) Does it take up to one month (or more, abnormally), to install new public telephone cabinets when necessary; if so, why.",415
212,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable Olympic member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Telecom Australia advises that the aluminium and glass 'see-through' cabinet is the only type currently being the installed. These are manufactured in Telecom's own engineering workshops and there has been no shortage of units to meet installation requirements. (3) Telecom does not maintain to install public telephone cabinets. Most new cabinet installations are to replace existing older type cabinets and the in- Country stallation time on these 'prepared' sites averages about 48 hours. The installation of a completely new service can, however, take up to a month because of the necessity to provide underground telephone cabling, a 240 volt power supply and elaborate earthing of the unit. Where remoteness or other site difficulties are encountered, stallation can exceed one month. Mr Innes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 20 February 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to recent statements that Australian telegrams are cheap in comparison with many comparable countries. (2) If so, is he able to say what was the cost (a) in Australian dollars, (b) as a percentage of the particular domestic average weekly wage and (c) as a percentage of the particular domestic poverty-level weekly income of a 12 word or comparable domestic telegram in each of the OECD countries as at 30 June in each of the last 10 years.

Telecom has, however, mation outlining: the cost expressed in Australian dollars of an average length domestic telegram (20 words) including messenger delivery fee for the United States and Canada, which are comparable with Australia in terms of size and general living standards; and the hours of work required to pay for such a telegram in each country-base d on the hourly earnings in the manufacturing industry in 1977 for those countries: Country Australia Canada USA So far as European countries (members of the OECD) are concerned, it is understood that the tariff for telegrams covers all forms of delivery, i.e. regardless of whether the message for delivery by messenger, to a telex or telephone number, code address, etc. In Australia, differing charges apply in circumstances. Bearing in mind these differing rates, the following comparison is relevant: Country Australia Sweden statistics on the time taken Cost of Hours telegram of work JA Federal Republic of Germany . . 6.19 1.01 United Kingdom 4.95 1.43 Denmark 4.80 0.67 the time taken to complete an inNorway 4.67 0.74 France 3.74 1.34 Telegrams It is, of course, extremely difficult to draw meaningful com(Question No. 5397) parisons between the cost of a partiuclar product or service in different countries.

(9) What are the number and nature of complaints and the cases lodged with the Trade Practices Commission during the last S years. (10) How many cases were dealt with and what was the result. (11) Did the result extend any relief or protection within the small business sector; if not, will he take immediate steps to amend the price discrimination section of the Trade Practices Act to extend effective and efficient protection against predatory practice which the small business sector has been seeking for years. Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable examined member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) No. As foreshadowed in my media release, I have asked the Prices Justification Tribunal to monitor, through its normal surveillance role, price margins applied the major wholesalers and retailers on high turnover and house-brand products, and to report to me on what further likely action, if any, might in its view be appropriate in regard wholesale and retail prices for processed foods. The PJT has also been asked to report further on the effects on prices of over-award payments industry. In the matter of the need for uniformity in food legislation, which was noted by the PJT, there has been consultation with the States and a model Food Bill is in preparation. (3) In addition to the measures outlined in answer to and (2), above, the Government is currently considering report of the Trade Practices Consultative Committee Small Business and the Trade Practices Act. The report was released for public comment in January, 1980 and the nanas, Government will haveregardto the views ing those of groups representing sed food sector. (4) For there to be a breach visions of the Act the conduct in question must have the effect or be likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the relevant market and not be capable of meeting either of the two defences provided by the Act-cos t justification or meeting of competition in good faith. The Trade Practices Commission has conducted two wideranging surveys of retailers and followed these up with a number of manufacturers in response to allegations of price discrimination against food and drink manufacturers by small business associations. (See, also, answer to (8) below). (5) , (6) and (7) In its report, the PJT commented that the costs of advertising and promotional programs are borne predominantly by manufacturers. The PJT stated that this could be encouraging avoidable costs if excessive advertising being applied by retailers in the absence constraints which would normally apply to those paying the major share of advertising/promotional expenditure. The level of advertising and the costs incurred are matters for the individual judgment of the companies concerned. (8) I am advised that the Trade Practices Commission has undertaken wide-ranging enquiries in response tations by the Victorian Retail Confectionery and Mixed Business Association and the South Australian Mixed Business Association. The Victorian enquiries are still being assessed. The South Australian enquiries revealed no breach of the price discrimination provisions of the Act and the Association was advised accordingly in January this year. Individual complaints are made to the Commission by members of small business associations and are examined on their merits-se e also answer to (10) below. (9) Of the complaints and inquiries made to the Trade Practices Commission over the last five years 206 complaints and 37 inquiries concerned the food industry. These varied widely in nature but some common areas were: refusal of supply competitor's selling prices too low competitors receiving higher discounts than complainant minimum purchase requirements cessation of Sunday baking (in Victoria) exclusive dealing requirements e.g. soft drink cabinets only to be used for suppliers' goods requirement to trade only in specified areas. (10) Each complaint received by the Commission was and an assessment made as to the likelihood of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act being made out. Sometimes the matters raised by complainants bore no relation to the provisions of the Act. The facts will sometimes provide a defence against the relevant provisions e.g. in reby lation to complaints of price discrimination, quantity discounts are given which do not appear to be out of line with economies of fewer deliveries and larger drops per delivto ery. In other cases the particular market will appear to be such that competition is unlikely to be substantially lessened, which is arequirementbefore most sections of the Act are in the processed foods breached. While this thorough screening narrowed the field, many cases remained where it seemed that the Act may have been contravened. In these cases involving milk and dairy products, liquor, tobacco, smallgoods, meat, fruit juice, margarine, oysters and pastrygoods, detailed investigations were conducted. (I) Some complaints were taken up in the course of adjudication the inquiries. In some cases further information was obtained on which indicated that any attempt to prosecute would be unsuccessful. Court cases have been instituted involving babeer (2 occasions), bread (2 occasions), fruit and vegexpressed, includetables and glucose. small retailers in the procesThe case involving price fixing by five Adelaide hotels resulted in the following orders: of the price discrimination proan injunction restraining the Morphett Arms Hotel and the Royal Oak Hotel from fixing the allowance for bottled beer the Royal Oak to pay a penalty of $8,000 the Morphett Arms to pay a penalty of $5,000 the Royal Oak and the Morphett Arms to pay three quarters of the Commission's costs the Commission to pay the Norwood Hotel's costs the Commission to pay one half of the Rex Hotel's costs the Commission to pay one third of the Old Lion Hotel's costs. The NSW Chamber of Fruit and Vegetable Industries case, arising from an agreement to levy growers with sorting and stacking charges, resulted in the granting of injunctions and is imposition of a penalty of $2,500 with costs on each of the of the commercial eight defendants. The ACT bread case, involving alleged price agreement between four bread manufacturers, was settled in the Federal Court on 20 April 1980. Proceedings were discontinued with all parties to bear their own costs. The bread manufacturers, while continuing to deny contravention of the Act, undertook to represento the Commission that: (i) they will not jointly announce increases in bread prices; and (11) they will not communicate with each other with respect to proposed alterations in their respective bread prices in the ACT. The banana case has been stood over by ministerial direction pending a review by the Government of primary product exemption from the Trade Practices Act. The other cases are before the Court. Inquiries into a number of other matters are continuing. It is expected that the results of an legations of price discrimination Confectionery and Mixed Business Association will be available soon. (II) The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act in the small business sector, or indeed large, is not merely measured by the number cases instituted under its provisions. The Act, by its very existence has led to substantial changes in market and business conduct throughout Australia. Notwithstanding this the Government has the Act under continual review, particularly as to place and, as stated in answer currently considering a number of proposals made by the Trade Practices Consultative Committee in its report Small Business and the Trade Practices Act. In the course of its consideration the Government is reviewwhich ing the effectiveness of sections 46 and 49 in dealing with predatory pricing in the light of the Committee's recommenthat dation that section 49 be repealed and section 46 disadvantaged strengthened.

Nuclear Waste Disposal",416
214,Mr LES JOHNSON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 20 February 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to President Carter's assertion that all past attempts to dispose of highly radioactive nuclear waste have failed and that it would be at least the mid 1990s before the United States manent dump for nuclear waste; if so, is the Australian Government still persuaded by the weight of scientific evidence placed before it that there is a demonstrated method of dealing permanently and safely with highly radioactive nuclear waste. (2) If this is still the Government's belief, what efforts made to convince the US President and the US people that the problems of nuclear waste disposal have been solved.",419
215,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the tenders honourable member's question is as follows: (1) When announcing the establishment of the United States' first comprehensive radioactive waste management program, President Carter said "" . . . Past Governmental efforts to manage radioactive adequate. Moreover, they have failed to involve the States, local governments, and the public in policy or program decisions. My actions today lay the foundation for both a technically superior program and a full co-operative Federal-State partnership to ensure public confidence in waste management program'. President Carter's statement also explained that the site for the first full scale repository in the United States will selected by about 1985 and will be operational by the mid-1990s. The development of such a repository will in a careful step by step manner while ensuring full public participation and maintaining the full co-operation of all levels Government, so that technical or scientific standards will not be compromised out of haste. The establishment of the President's Waste Management Program is predicated on the existence of technology which will enable the assessment of suitable geological sites for nucation clear waste repositories. The Inter-Agency Review Radioactive Waste Management which reported to the President in March 1979 found that '. . . Present scientific and technological knowledge is adequate pository sites for further investigation. No scientific or technical reason is known that would prevent identifying a site that is suitable for a repository utilised rigorously to evaluate the suitability of sites and designs, and in minimising the influence of future activities'. The President went on to say that 'Based on the technical conclusions reached by the IRG, I am persuaded that the capability now exists to characterise and evaluate a number of geologic environments for use ventional mining technology'. These statements reinforce the Australian Government's view that the technology exists for the safe management and ultimate disposal of highly radioactive waste. I also noted in my statement to the House on 25 August 1977 that the technology for solidification of high level radioactive liquids was being developed to a commercial scale and that this technology had not hitherto been put into full scale use as the commercial quantity of waste had not warranted a fully commercial process. The vitrification process for solidification of high level waste is now operating on a commercial scale in France and the technology has been adopted by the Federal Republic of Germany. (2) In view of the similarity of the views expressed by President Carter and ourselves the action suggested is unnecessary. (Question No. 5418) Telephone Directories (Question No. 5434)",419

Telecom did not issue any authority for the publiproceed cation of any such list or directory in 1979. Telecom is aware that private organisations publish trade of or business directories in which the material in relation to persons, firms or companies whose names are listed in or who are subscribers to the publication also usually include the telephone or telex numbers of the person, firm or company concerned.

Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The concept of medical rehabilitation permeates the whole range of medical activities. Rehabilitation commences as soon as treatment for an injury or for the whole course of a patient's progress through the health care system. It is therefore impossible service the whole rehabilitation treatment process. Even in those hospitals which provide specialised rehabilitation units, management reporting systems usually do not allow costs of individual units to be singled out. Therefore as far as hospital services are concerned, the information sought by the honourable member is unobtainable. The funding of rehabilitation services has been an important and significant component of the Community Health Program since its inception currently funded under the Community Health Program which can be categorised as providing rehabilitation services as their primary function.

Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There has been no variation in average waiting time for non-urgent admission. (2) Treatment provided to non-entitled patients in Repatriation hospitals is not costed separately. The hospitals' resources are primarily allocated on the basis of meeting the needs of entitled patients. Non-entitled patients may be treated only where there is spare capacity within those resources after the needs of entitled patients have been met. The greatest proportion of hospital power and maintenance and in such areas as capital works and equipment purchasing. By and large, these costs are incurred by the need to provide facilities at patriation patients. (3) The projections available indicate that there will be no increase in demand for hospital admissions for the treatment of veterans. No restrictions have been placed on veterans for: (4) (a) fee-for-service medical treatment which is provided primarily through the Local Medical Officer arrangements. (b) doctor of choice in country areas. Where admission to local public hospitals is necessary, veterans may be treated in that hospital by their Local Medical Officer or specialist to whom they have been referred by their Local Medical Officer. (c) prescribed spectacles which are provided in each State under contractual agreement between the Department and its a contractor in that State. If a local optometrist is a party to the contract, spectacles may be supplied to Repatriation patients under the terms of the contract.

The exception is that, in areas not covered by the contractor, local optometrists are authorised to quote the Department for the supply of spectacles to a particular patient and, if the quote is accepted, the spectacles may be supplied at Departmental expense.

(2) If the position is as stated, has his Department considered any proposals to enable these spouses to vote-if so, what are the proposals. Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Section 39A (I) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 protects the enrolment and voting rights of members of the Defence Force serving overseas. However, there is no equivalent provision for the wife or adult dependant of a serviceman who accompanies him on an overseas posting but not as part of the Defence Force. Wives and dependants are in the same category as other civilians overseas at the time of an election, i.e. if they were already enrolled before they left Australia and have a fixed intention of returning to live within the Subdivision for which they are enrolled, they would be entitled to a postal vote; if not, they would not be either qualified or entitled to vote. (2) This problem could be remedied by an amendment to Section 39A (2) of the Act. However, it also impinges on the wider question of entitlement and voting rights of all Australians abroad. I am having these related matters carefully considered before deciding on recommendations I might make to the Government. Voting Rights of Australians in Antarctica (Question No. 5744) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 27 March 1980: (1) Are men working at Australian bases in the Antarctic denied a vote in any Australian elections.

Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Question No. 5750) Dr Blewett asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 27 March 1980: Overseas (1) Does the Minister subscribe to the policy enunciated by (Question No. 5743) the Prime Minister on 27 June 1979 of promoting the use of the available alternative energy sources, mainly natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and coal-based electricity. (2) If so, is the Minister concerned at the rapid escalation in price of LPG from SI 10 per tonne in June 1979 to $252 per tonne in January 1980 and the consequent narrowing of the price differential between LPG and motor spirit. (3) Did the Government make formal submissions to the Prices Justification Tribunal public inquiry into roleum products (July-August 1979) which preceded the August 1979 LPG price rise, if not, why not. (4) Did the Government, pursuant to section 17(A) of the Prices Justification Act 1973, direct the Tribunal to give special consideration to its energy policy regarding LPG in the Tribunal's deliberations prior to the large, PJT-approved, price rise of January 1980, (5) Is the Minister aware of the number of LPG auto conversion businesses which have ceased operating in the past 6 months; if so, is the Government prepared to accept partial responsibility for the demise of these businesses. (6) Has the Government considered compensating these businesses for any financial losses resulting from the Government 's energy policy.",426
230,Mr ANTHONY,COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM,"The Minister for National Development and Energy has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Concern at the escalation on LPG policy as set out in the Minister for National Development and Energy's press release of 8 April 1980. This action, inter alia reduced the basic price of LPG from S252 per tonne to $203 per tonne and provided guidelines to stabilise the future price relationship crude oil, and therefore motor spirit. (3) No. It has not been the Government's practice to make formal submissions to the Prices Justification Tribunal. (4) No. (5) and (6) The Government is conscious of the commercial interest which has arisen in relation to LPG auto conversion business. A degree of commercial risk always attends new ventures and it is possible that some entrepreneurs may misjudge the market to the extent that they are forced to cease operations. It would not be appropriate for the Government to compensate unsuccessful entrepreneurs for failure of commercial ventures. Immigration Advertising",428
231,Mr LES JOHNSON,COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM,"the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 27 March 1980: (1) Which foreign governments (a) do not permit Australian'Government immigration advertising and (b) impose firm controls on Australian Government immigration advertising. (2) What are the controls imposed by each foreign Government in each case. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (I) (a) and (b) and (2) This is a matter that affects Australia's relations with many would not want to give specific answers, on a country-bycountry basis, to the honourable member's questions. I can, however, enlarge on my answer of 27 March when I said that many foreign governments do not permit Australian migration advertising. The levels of control vary greatly. Some countries have enacted legislation specifically forbidding immigration advertising. Denmark, Finland and Norway are examples. In other countries, while no legislation exists specifically forbidding such advertising, it is clearly underprices of petstood that it would not be allowed. Different again are countries such as Italy where newspapers cannot accept migration advertising copy from overseas countries unless it has been first cleared with the Italian Ministry of Labour. Many other countries insist on first sighting and approving the content of advertising copy. Others would not allow advertisements that aimed to attract specific skilled workers. Advertisements would be restricted to general, coupon-type immigration advertising campaigns. If such campaigns attracted high numbers of skilled migrant applicants we would expect restrictions on the number of such applicants that we could accept. A small number of countries allows unrestricted advertising. They include Britain, Ireland, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Kenya, Egypt and Malta. Australian Broadcasting Commission: Finance (Question No. 5762) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 31 in price of LPG led to action March 1980: (1) What funds were made available to the Australian Broadcasting Commission in (a) 1976-77, (b) 1977-78 and (c) 1978-79. between LPG and indigenous (2) What sums did the ABC spend on (a) administration, (b) the production of programs (i) internally and (ii) by Australian independent producers on contract and (c) purchasing programs from (A) within Australia and (B) outside Australia in (I) 1976-77, (II) 1977-78 and (III) 1978-79.

Overseas Investment in Australia Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 31 March 1980: What was the ratio of income payable overseas on foreign investment in enterprises in Australia to the total net inflow of foreign investment into enterprises in Australia for each year since 1949-50.",428
232,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The ratio of income payable abroad on foreign investment in enterprises in Australia to the total net inflow of foreign investment in enterprises in Australia for each year since 1949-50 is set out in column (3) of the table below. In examining the figures shown in column (2) of the table it should be noted that income payable abroad on foreign investment in enterprises in Australia for any period (column (1)) is a measure, in money terms, of the return to foreigners on their total stock of investment in enterprises in Australia in that period, whereas the net enterprises in Australia for any period (column (2)) is basically a measure of the change in the stock of foreign investment in enterprises in Australia means that figures in column (3) represent, for each period, a comparison of the return on the total stock of foreign investment in enterprises in Australia with the change in' that stock.

The earnings rates shown in column (2) have been derived by comparing the total income payable on foreign investment in enterprises in Australia (as shown in Table 42 of the ABS Bulletin and Table 7 of the ABS Bulletin Foreign Investment 1978-79 (Preliminary) ) for each year with the data in column (1). It should be noted that the amounts of corporate equities included in the level of total in Australia are recorded by the ABS at paid-up value only and exclude share premium, reserves, provisions and retained earnings.

Data that would 18,661 8.5 enable estimates to be made of the apparent earning 21,057 7.9 rates of Australian-owned companies only are not 23,404 7.9 available. Thefiguresin the table represent the ratio of net profit to shareholders' funds, debentures, mortgages, other secured borrowings, unsecured notes, deposits and other unsecured borrowings of this group of companies. These data are an aggregation of the companies' published financial statements and are therefore subject to the limitations inherent in accounting reports. In particular, conventional financial statements draw on a mixture of historic costs and valuation data-individua l transactions being recorded at prices prevailing at the time of the transaction which may be later revalued. The statements generally do not record transactions, in a consistent manner, in terms of current prices. Insofar as the financial statements are based on historic costs, they may not adequately reflect the effects of movements in the general level of prices. Thus, the apparent earning rates shown above may not be an accurate indication of the actual earning rates of the companies. The usefulness of the earning rates calculated from these data would be further limited by the degree to which the companies included in the survey are representative of all companies operating in Australia. In this regard it should be particularly noted that the survey includes only public companies operating mainly in Australia and exludes companies in the finance, mining and primary production sectors. Estimates of the apparent earning rates of overseas-owned companies can be derived from data contained in the ABS Bulletins 'Foreign Investment 1977-78' and 'Foreign Investment 1978-79 (Preliminary)' and represent, for each year and all industry sectors, the ratio of income payable (excluding interest on foreign investment in direct investment enterprises in Australia (as defined by the ABS) to the level of foreign investment in those enterprises at the beginning of each year. The degree of reliance that can be placed on earning rates so calculated, however, is questionable, mainly because the amount of corporate equities included in the level of direct investment in enterprises in Australia is recorded by the ABS at paid-up value only and excludes share premium, reserves, provisions and retained earnings. The recorded corporate equities figures would, therefore, be substantially lower than the actual level of foreign equity vestors have claims and the extent of under-representation would be compounded by the effects of inflation. By contrast, the statistics on income payable on foreign investment in enterprises in Australia are prepared for each year to reflect a particular set of current transactions between Australians and foreigners and, generally, would not be as susceptible to distortion as a result of inflation. For these reasons, the apparent earning rates shown below for overseas-owned companies will be higher than the actual earning rates. The apparent earning rates of overseas-owned companies for each year 3)nee 1969-70, calculated in accordance with and subject to the qualifications of the foregoing, were as follows: Year 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 In order to make the estimates in Table 2 more comparable with those in Table 1 for companies operating in Australia, the data used to derive the estimates in Table 2 can be adjusted by the average of the paid-up capital to shareholders' funds ratio for all companies reported on by the Reserve Bank's Statistical Bulletin, Company Supplement. The general effect of this adjustment (which raises the value of equity funds to around three times the value reported by the ABS) on the apparent earning rates is shown in Table 3: Table 3 Adjusted apparent earning rates of overseas-owned Year companies (a) per cent 1969-70 5.9 1970-71 5.4 1971-72 4.6 1972-73 5.9 1973-74 7.1 -1974-75 5.4 1975-76 8.2 1976-77 8.6 1977-78 8.0 1978-79 7.8 (a) The corporate equities components of the data used to produce these figures have been adjusted by the factor described above.

The apparent earning rates shown in Tables 2 and 3 differ from those provided in the answer to Question No. 5768 because the earning rates shown above relate to foreign direct investment enterprises (excluding foreign portfolio investment), whereas those for Question No. 5768 relate to total foreign investment in enterprises in Australia.

235,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) During the period 8 April 1976 to 31 December 1979, 539 foreign investment proposals considered by the Foreign Investment Review Board were approved by the Government subject to Australian equity conditions. The majority of these proposals (361) were for acquisitions relating to mineral exploration. In such cases approval is granted on condition that, before proceeding with any development, the parties submit their development proposal for examination in terms of the Government's foreign investment policy as it relates to new natural resource projects. The conditions applied in these cases will, therefore, only be ration activity is successful and the parties decide to proceed with development. (2) (a) and (b) Proposals approved by the Government subject to Australian equity participation conditions are monitored to ensure compliance with the conditions. The methods employed to monitor the proposals vary according to the particular circumstances of each case; they include correspondence and discussions with the parties to the proposals and the performance of audits of particular proposals. Of those proposals approved subject to Australian equity participation conditions (other than the 361 proposals for acquisitions relating to mineral exploration) 14 are known to have met the conditions. In addition, in eight other cases some progress has been made by the parties towards fulfilment of the conditions. In 10 other cases the Australian equity partici- 1979-80 pation conditions became redundant deciding not to proceed with that the majority of the Australian equity participation conditions that have been applied either have not laid down a specific timetable for achievement of the conditions or have prescribed dates for compliance with the conditions which are still some time in the future. The conditions applied in these cases can be expected to be met with the effluxion of time. (3) In only one case has the Australian equity participation conditions imposed on the proposal not been met. In this case every effort has been made to ensure compliance with the original terms of the conditions and consultations have been held with the parties to the and equitable alternative course of action.

(2) What was the estimated proportion of the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index that can be directly attributed to the effects of Government policy in (a) 1976-77, (b) 1977-78, (c) 1978-79 and (d) 1979-80.",432
236,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1 indicated that it might be assumed, for illustrative purposes, that the CPI for the four quarters ending March 1980 would be about 9.5 per cent above the level of the previous year and, on the same basis, that discounting for the effects of Government decisions would produce a full indexation factor for 1980-81 of 7.2 per cent. In the event, the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the four quarters ending March 1980 was 9.7 per cent which, after discounting for the effects of Government decisions, has resulted in a full tax indexation factor for 1980-81 of 7.5 per cent.

National Health and Medical Research Council (Question No. 5844) (Question No. 5832) Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Health, representupon notice, on 2 April 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the national press suggesting that cutbacks in funding to the National Health and Medical Research Council will particularly affect the activities of the Council's Standing Committee which is responsible for assessing and evaluating reported cancer and genetic hazards; if so, is there any substance in the reports. (2) What is the status of the chemical MYREX which (a) pro- is reported to have been banned in the United States of America in 1978, (b) is claimed to cause cancer and birth defects and (c) is reported to be presently before his Department for registration. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of an article in a national paper which commented on funding to the National Health and Medical ReI search Council (NH & MRC) and which referred to the CarWoolworths cinogenic Substances Committee. Funds for servicing the Council and its committees are proas vided from the overall travel and conference funds of my Department. Each area of my Department has to allocate funds available over all its priority activities. in Australia by chain stores. HowThe Carcinogenic Substances Committee has been given a high priority. However, because of increasing costs of travel and travel allowances and increasing requirements in special areas of NH & MRC activities it has not been possible for the Committee to meet beyond the twice yearly practice of Council's Standing Committees. The Committee was only established in October 1978 and has met in June and November 1979. Provision has been made for it to meet again in June 1980. It is considered that it can adequately carry out its function under the present arrangements. (2) (a) It is believed that the honourable member is referring to the organochlorine pesticide dodecachloro octahydromethanocylobutopentalene commonly known as Mirex which has been used extensively of imported fire ants. The carcinogenicity of Mirex to mice was first reported in the scientific literature in 1969. According to newspaper reports Mirex has been banned in the United States. (b) This has occurred apparently because it has been shown to cause tumours in experimental animals. (c) Any report that my Department is handling a request for registration of this chemical is incorrect. In fact my Department does not register agricultural chemicals, this being the responsibility of the States and Territories. My Department is however represented on the Technical Committee on Agricultural Chemicals which is an advisory body convened by the Department of Primary Industry. This Committee normally initially tration of agricultural chemicals and advises the States and Territories on appropriate requirements for their registration. 1 understand that Mirex has not been registered for use in Australia and no submission has been received by this Committee. Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 2 April 1980: Further to his predecessor's answer to my question No. 4884 part (2) (Hansard, 22 November 1979, page 3500) has any decision been made following his Department's policy review of a variation of the rules relating ary entry visas to sportsmen and sportswomen to limit the numbers being admitted to Australia temporarily so that Australian residents of equal talent can be given opportunities to enter the higher level of sports. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: By far the greatest number to overseas sportsmen and sportswomen during the past few years has been to soccer players. Following consultation between my Department and the Australian Soccer Federation, it was decided to limit the temporary entry of soccer players to clubs in the Phillips Soccer League and clubs in the premier division in each State. It was also decided that no club could have more than four overseas players here temporarily at any one time. These new rules should provide greater opportunities for talented local players in the sport. These rules are used as a are received from any sporting organisation wishing to bring overseas players to Australia temporarily under long term contract for comparable team events. My Department looks at each application closely and consults with relevant organisations to ensure that there is no undue closing off of opportunities for local talent before approval is given to issue a porary entry visa.

(3) Has Mr di Piramo since returned to Australia; if so, temhave inquiries been made or will they be made into his eligibility to use his passport for future absences from Australia. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes.

Aluminium Industry Dr Everingham has asked the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on IS April 1980: (1) Have any relevant studies been done (a) in Australia or (b) elsewhere to assess the environmental and social impact of the aluminium industry in Australia; if so what are they. (2) Have any steps been taken to monitor and control the concentrations and effects of heavy metal contamination of (a) air, (b) water, (c) soil and (d) organisms including seafoods as a result of aluminium smelting in Australia; if so, (i) what steps have been taken and (ii) what has been their cost to (a) governments and (b) the industry. (3) Have any steps been taken to assess before and after velopment of the world's largest aluminium smelter at Gladstone, Queensland, the levels of contaminants in the environment, including fluorine compounds; if so, what are they. (4) Is he able to state whether metal smelting have paid millions of dollars graziers in the United States of America following requisition by courts of confidential assessment offluorinecompound contamination as assessed by industries. (5) Is any fluorine compound monitoring undertaken in Australia; if so, what monitoring is undertaken. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Two environmental impact statements have been prepared under the Commonwealth Government's Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act on the establishment in Australia of aluminium smelters at Gladstone in Queensland and Portland in Victoria by Comalco and Alcoa respectively. Both statements took into account the impact on the human environment. I have also directed environmental impact statements, which are now being prepared, smelters in the Hunter Valley, NSW. (2) The monitoring and control are essentially matters for State Governments, which have enacted relevant pollution control legislation. Heavy metal contamination is not normally associated with aluminium smelting and my Department is not aware of monitoring programs to monitor and control, heavy metal contaminations for smelters. (3) Yes. Ambient air quality was established prior to the construction of the Comalco smelter and a monitoring program was devised to meet State Government requirements. This program will be implemented when the smelter is commissioned. (4) No. Inquiries to the United States Environment Protection Agency and the Kettering Institute, have not substantiated any compensation payments of the kind indicated in the honourable member's question. (5) Yes. Fluoride monitoring is undertaken for the purpose of environmental protection and occupational health as required by the State Governments. The nature of the monitoring program adopted is dependent on the emitting industry of involved and the environmental conditions and constraints which apply. only if requested by an apGordon River Power Scheme (Question No. 5877) Mr Howe asked the Minister for Science and (Question No. 5874) the Environment, upon notice, on 15 April 1980: Further to his answer to my question without notice on 27 March 1980 concerning the proposed Gordon River Power Scheme Stage II proposal, in which he indicated that the Government regarded approval of the scheme as essentially one for the State concerned (Hansard, pages 1308-9), (a) is it a fact that his Department has sought an opinion from the Attorney-General as to whether the proposed scheme is covered by Commonwealth environmental legislation and (b) if so, and if the Attorney-General's answer to this request is in the affirmative, will the Commonwealth prepare an environmental impact statement on the proposed scheme. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The complexity of the Environment Protection (Imdepact of Proposals) Act is such that the advice of the Attorney General is regularly sought on the administration of the Act in relation to a wide range of matters. (b) The Administrative Procedures of the Act will be applied to proposed actions of environmental significance where industries the Commonwealth is involved. in compensation to farmers and Palmdale-Associated General Contractors Insurance Co.

254,Mr HUNT,OCCURRING LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Boeing 707 aircraft was hired in accordance with the Department's safety surveillance program, which requires Examiners of Airmen to maintain proficiency on the various types of regular public transport aircraft. (2) 2,200 Kina = JA2.887.14 (at 12 May 1980). (3) Yes. It is highly desirable that aircraft used for type proficiency maintenance be operated by a commercial airline, as these aircraft represent the environment in which airline Operations are monitored by the Department. By contracting for the use of a commercial aircraft, more effective check pilot surveillance, which is part of the Department's safety surveillance program. Uranium Enrichment",438
255,Mr HAYDEN,OCCURRING LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,"the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) Did the Minister indicate in an address to the Mining Club of New York, USA, on 18 March 1980, that the Australian Government was cooperating fully with private industry and with the Governments of a number of countries, including that of the United States of America, in studying the feasibility of establishing a commercial uranium enrichment industry. (2) If so, what is the nature of the cooperation between the Australian and the United States Governments in these Studies.",438
256,Mr ANTHONY,OCCURRING LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,"The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following area. The airborne investianswer to the honourable member's question: (1) Further to my answer to question No. 5831, in an address to the Mining Club of New York, USA, the Minister said, 'in these studies we are cooperating fully with private industry and with the Governments of a number of countries, including your own'. (2) A team of Commonwealth Government officials recently visited the USA for discussions on uranium enrichment. These discussions were a follow-up to exchanges which have taken place with the US Government following the announcement by the Commonwealth Government on 23 January 1979 that we proposed to proceed with studying the feasibility of establishing an Australian commercial uranium enrichment industry. The USA has agreed to provide some input into the Australian study of uranium enrichment and the USA is looking at how it might further collaborate with Australia in the study; the USA has not made any offer of technology. The US Government has invited representatives of the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia to visit the (Question No. 5888) USA; this is in recognition of the Commonwealth Government's approach that private industry should be involved in studying the feasibility of uranium enrichment in Australia. Private Members Committees (Question No. 5907) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) Is he able to indicate what are the (a) names and (b) airsalaries of the staff employed to service the 16 Government MinMembers committees in the Commonwealth Parliament.

(4) Are Opposition committees entitled to either (a) special staff, (b) special stationery or (c) other support services. Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The names and salaries of staff employed to service the Government members committees are: it is possible to provide Name Salary $ MrA.Foster 12,542-13,211 (Question No. 5891) Vacant 10,184-10,685 Mrs J.Gordon 10,184-10,685 Mr J. Kiermaier 10,184-10,685 Mrs H.Anderson 10,184-10,685 Note: The above positions carry no entitlement to travel, and overtime payments are restricted to extra duty during Parliamentary sitting weeks. (2) The Government Members Committees Support Secretariat is provided with its own stationery. The initial supply of stationery, including special letterhead was, it is understood, provided by the Department of the House of Representatives and the cost is not known by my Department. My Department, however, has supplied the following items of stationery to the Secretariat: 1978-79 Self-adhesive labels General stationery 1979-80 5,000 envelopes 6,000 envelopes 6 reams letterhead General stationery In addition to the above expenditure, an order is currently being processed for the provision of 10,000 envelopes at an estimated cost of $375.00. (3) My Department provides accommodation, office furniture and equipment and essential office services to the Secretariat and also provides car transport for staff between the Secretariat and Parliament House. (4) At the same time that it decided to approve five staff positions for the support of the Government Members Committees, the Government approved ten additional positions for the Opposition Party: four at the Assistant Private Secretary level ($12,542-13,211) and six at the Steno-Secretary Grade 1 level ($10,184-10,685). The Prime Minister stated at that time that it was for the Leader of the Opposition to decide how the total staff available to the Opposition was to be allocated, including to shadow Ministers and party committees. The ten positions were all allocated by the Leader of the Opposition to Shadow Ministers. The positions carry an unrestricted entitlement to travel within Australia at official expense at the direction of the relevant shadow Ministers overtime is payable. The staff concerned have access to norfifteen mal office facilities and requisites, including stationery. Antarctic Icebreaker Ship Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: Will he recommend that construction of Australia's first Antarctic icebreaker ship, if approved, be undertaken in Australia so as to provide employment. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: When design studies for the ship are completed shortly, the ition to decide on appropriate procurement action. In considering the financial aspects of ship construction, the Government will bear in mind the employment benefits which would accrue from constructing the ship locally. Medical Rehabilitation Units Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) Are there 15 major medical rehabilitation units in Australia; if so, what are they. (2) What specific types of rehabilitation each of these units. (3) What funding does each unit receive. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable sive member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Medical Rehabilitation and Health Aspects Committee of the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped considered that major medical rehabilitation units should provide as comprehensive a range of services as 67.00 are set out in the Report of the National Committee of In210.81 277.81 quiry into Compensation and Rehabilitation in Australia (Volume 2), (Woodhouse and Meares, 1974), page 33. These services are: 119.79 'disability assessment and remedial treatment of persons 261.00 who are admitted to hospital as a result of accident, disease 89.00 or illness who are in need of physical restoration, and who 418.86 888.65 are likely to make near full recovery of function and skill following the provision of medical rehabilitation services of 1,166.46 comparatively short duration; preliminary disability assessments, and early remedial treatment and prompt referral thereafter to appropriate institutions and/or organisations of persons who are admitted to hospital as a result of accident, disease or illness, who are likely to have severe residual handicaps and who are in need of long-term, comprehensive rehabilitation treatment and/or training' The Report goes on to state at paragraph 78, page 33: 'Primarily, the medical rehabilitation unit should be designed, staffed and equipped to deal adequately with the complete rehabilitation needs of the shorter-term case (generally speaking, the case capable of resuming normal daily living within three months of the commencement of rehabilitation assistance). In addition, however, the medical rehabilitation unit should be able to deal with the early treatment of the long-term case pending transfer to a specialist medical rehabilitation unit, a general regional rehabilitation centre or other appropriate institution.' The Medical Rehabilitation and Health Aspects Comand mittee has estimated that there are probably no more than major medical rehabilitation units in Australia which would meet these criteria. Such units are located as follows: New South Wales (Question No. 5909) Royal North Shore Hospital Royal South Sydney Hospital Prince of Wales/Prince Henry's Hospital St George Hospital Westmead Hospital Royal Newcastle Hospital Australian Capital Territory Woden Valley Hospital* * Located in Canberra but also serving New South Wales districts surrounding the Australian Capital Territory. proposed Australian Antarctic Government will be in a posVictoria Royal Melbourne Hospital/Royal Children's Hospital Mount Royal Hospital Royal Talbot Rehabilitation Hospital Caulfield Hospital Queensland Royal Brisbane Hospital (Question No. 5917) South Australia Royal Adelaide Hospital/Regency Park Centre for Physically Handicapped Children Western Australia Royal Perth (Rehabilitation) Hospital, Shenton Park are carried out by Tasmania Royal Hobart Hospital In addition to the above, the Casuarina Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory is expected to provide similar comprehenmedical rehabilitation services when it is fully commissioned. Repatriation General Hospitals operated by the Department of Veterans' Affairs provide similar comprehensive medical rehabilitation services in all but one instance, but because their services are generally restricted to Repatriation beneficiaries, the Committee did not include them in its estimate of major units serving the general population. (3) All of the major medical rehabilitation units listed are operated by, or in direct conjunction with, large general hospitals. Their funding is thus not costs of operation of the hospitals concerned. However, it should be noted that in each case, the costs of the units are shared between the relevant State Government and the Commonwealth Government under the hospital cost-sharing agreements. Total Commonwealth outlays to the States under these arrangements in 1978-79 were approximately $ 1,062m. Medical Examinations for Intending Immigrants Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 April 1980. (1) How many overseas posts of his Department (a) can and (b) are unable to conduct and process medical examinations for intending immigrants. (2) Where are these posts situated. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are 39 overseas posts of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Medical examinations can be arranged by each of these posts using locally appointed panel doctors for the most part. Panel doctors are appointed at centres convenient to potential migrants. In Europe, the Middle East and South America, panel doctor and arrangements are supervised by Australia-based Regional Medical Directors within the areas of their regional responsibilities. Regional Medical Directors, on the establishment of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, are based at Rome, Athens, Belgrade, Ankara and Buenos Aires. Medical examinations of panel doctors located in countries other than in Europe, the Middle East and South America, (excluding examinations of refugees in South-East Asia), are supervised by the Department of Health, Canberra. Medical examinations in London are conducted by doctors on the establishment of the Those doctors also supervise panel doctors in other areas of Britain and Ireland. Medical examinations of refugees in Malaysia and Indonesia are conducted by two Australia-based doctors based at the Australian High Commission, Kuala Lumpur. Examinations of refugees processed in Thailand are conducted by doctors appointed by UNHCR. The reports of those examinations are reviewed by the Department of Health, Canberra. It is sometimes necessary to send short-term missions overseas to meet particular situations. At present there is an Australian-based medical officer in Vienna carrying out medical examinations of Eastern European refugees. The overseas posts of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs are situated at: Cairo, Buenos Aires, Vienna, London, Manchester, Vancouver, Santiago, Suva, Paris, Cologne, Athens, Hong Kong, New Delhi, Jakarta, Rome, Messina, Tokyo, Nairobi, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Sliema, The Hague, Port Moresby, Manila, Warsaw, Lisbon, Pretoria, Capetown, Colombo, Stockholm, Berne, Damascus, Ankara, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, Belgrade, Edinburgh In addition to the above posts, officers of the Department's Refugee Task Force are located at Singapore and Bangkok.

Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Staff of the Judges of the Industrial Court (now the Industrial Division of the Federal Court of Australia) are employed by the Attorney-General's Department and that Department will be responding separately. (1) (b) The members of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission are entitled to staff as follows: for the President- 1 Executive Officer (Class 8); 1 Associate (Class 6); 1 Personal Secretary; I Tipstaff for each Deputy President- 1 Associate (Class 5); 1 Personal Secretary or; 1 Tipstaff for each Commissioner- 1 Clerk (Class 5) (2) The salary levels applicable to the staff categories listed in (1) (b) are: Executive Officer (Class 8)- $ 19,124-19,896 Associate (Class6)-SI5,766-16,79 9 Associate and Clerk (Class 5)-$14,221-15,37 6 Personal Secretary-J12,542-13,21 1 TipstafT (Clerical Assistant Grade 4)-$10,309-10,73 3 (3) The Department of Industrial Relations has been responsible for the accounting records for the staff referred to above since 1 July 1979 and the costs in the period from that date to 31 March 1980 are: Australian Department of Health. the services of locally appointed Travelling Airfares Allowance (a) (b) $ $ The President's staff 4,051.80 3,942.60 Deputy Presidents' staff 47,635.70 24,931.65 Commissioners' staff 80,338.50 42,315.86 The Department of Employment and Youth Affairs has supplied the following information for the period 1978-79.

However, the total cost for airfares of Industrial Registry staff excluding Judges of the Australian Industrial Court and members of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was $167,413. (b) Travelling Allowances-President' s staff-$5,129 ; Deputy President's staff-$21,351 ; Commissioners' staff-$35,41 7 Other expense claims for each staff member come from within normal administrative votes and details are not separately maintained. British Atomic Weapons Tests Mr Uren asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to statements made on the ABC program Four Corners on 29 March 1980 by Mr Lance Edwards, a former RAAF wireless operator, that (a) he had flown through the radioactive mushroom clouds of British atomic weapons tests to collect dust samples, (b) on the first occasion he and others in the plane had not worn protective clothing, (c) after his first flight he had to shower 13 times to try to clean himself of radioactivity, and (d) subsequent to the tests he developed cancer of the throat. (2) How many air force personnel and civilians were present in RAAF aircraft which (a) flew through, and (b) tracked the radioactive clouds of British atomic weapons tests conducted in Australia. (3) How many persons were subject to decontamination procedures, such as repeated showers after the flights. (4) What measures have been taken to monitor the subsequent health of persons who flew through or tracked the radioactive clouds of British atomic weapons tests. (5) What are the results of any investigations. (6) How many aircraftflewthrough or tracked the radioactive clouds of British atomic weapons tests conducted in Australia. (7) Where were these aircraft decontaminated. (8) Which airfields were visited by these aircraft prior to their decontamination. (9) How many personnel participated in the decontamination of these aircraft. (10) What measures have been taken to monitor the sequent health of these personnel. (11) What are the results of any investigations.",438
257,Mr ANTHONY,OCCURRING LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,"The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, I am aware of statements made by Mr Edwards on Four Corners. (2) There were approximately ISO airforce personnel present in RAAF aircraft which flew through, made contact with, or tracked radioactive clouds. Some of these personnel entered or contacted the cloud on more than one occasion. No civilians were carried on these flights. The estimate of total personnel is based on a normal Lincoln crew of 7 persons. (3) Based on the above some 80 airforce aircrew would have been subject to decontamination procedures, such as repeated showers after each flight. Some of these personnel, having contacted or entered a cloud on more than one flight, would have had a second contamination check; and in addition all aircrews of contaminated aircraft returning to Amberley were subjected to a further check and showering as necessary. (6) A total of 21 RAAF Lincoln aircraft flew through or tracked the radioactive clouds during the 1952-53 series of tests. (7) Woomera, Richmond and Amberley. (8) Townsville (Qld), Williamtown (NSW), Parafield (SA). (9) The overall numbers of personnel engaged on this task cannot be ascertained. Records show that numbers were kept to a minimum. For instance, the team that decontaminated (Question No. 5894) RAAF aircraft at Woomera comprised 10 personnel. (4), (5), (10) and (11) These questions cannot readily be answered. While specific monitoring was done of personnel who had been exposed to radiation, the results of such monitoring would simply have become a part of individual, standard Service health records. On 15 May 1980 I made a statement on allegations of radiation exposure and health effects resulting from the atomic weapons tests. In that statement. I said, inter alia: . . . persons who are concerned about the possibility of injury having been suffered as a result of involvement in the tests are invited to come foward for interview and, if appropriate, medical examination. In the first instance enquiries should be addressed to the Secretary of the Department of National Development and Energy in Canberra . . . Should there be any doubt as to the state of an individual's health, then I suggest that he should seek the interview offered in the statement. Expert Committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council (Question No. 5905) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 16 April 1980: (1) Did he provide information to the Minister for Social Security in answer to a question by Senator Elstob (Senate Hansard, 12 September 1979, page 580 and 20 February 1980, page 159) concerning research into the carcinogenic effects of chemicals in industry. (2) Did this material state that information relating to the carcinogenic effects of chemicals is continually assessed at a national level by expert committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH & MRC) such as the Poisons Schedule Committee, the Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals Committee, the Carcinogenic Substances Committee and the Occupational Health Committee and that the terms of reference for these committees are such as to embrace all toxicological aspects of chemicals that may come under scrutiny. (3) If so, are NH & MRC committees, particularly the Standing Committee on Carcinogenic Substances, expected to perform their functions as they would like under circumstances of curtailed funds which permit them to meet only twiceayear 'Hansard, 19March 1980, page 984). Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)and(2) Yes. (3) Arrangements have been made for an adequate program of meetings for these Committees in the immediate future. This may not allow meetings to be held as often as members may wish but I expect Committees to set priorities and to perform their functions as efficiently as possible in view of the necessity for continued economic restraint. Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 17 April 1980: (1) Does the National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil (a) have the resources to cope with a moderately large oil spill and (b) have as its basis (calculated on the basis of the nature, size and volume of shipping in Australian waters) as determined when the operational efficiency of the National Plan was reviewed in May 1978. (2) Has his attention been drawn to the (a) increased volume, and changes in the nature, of shipping arising from new development projects under way or planned in the Gladstone area, Queensland, and (b) development of a proposed deepwater harbour at Port Clinton, north of Yepoon, Queensland; if so, will he ensure that the capacity of the National Plan to respond to pollution at sea is able to meet the growing risks presented by these factors.",441
258,Mr HUNT,OCCURRING LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil is designed to have the capacity to deal with a moderately large oil spill, (b) In assessing possible pollution related to the volume of oil shipped and the size of tankers in Australian waters has been taken into account. (2) Growth in marine traffic patterns and changes in all types of shipping are under constant review as are developments in equipment and related techniques for the abatement of marine oil spills. These changes and consequential developments are taken into account in assessing the capacity of the National Plan to respond to pollution incidents. Deformities in Children of Ex-servicemen Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 17 April 1980: Will the Government provide funds for an investigation along the lines proposed by Dr W. MCBride to try to detect a cause of deformities in offspring mutagenic or teratogenic agents, including radiation. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am not aware of any such proposal. As I have already announced, deformities in children of Vietnam veterans will be included in the study to be undertaken by the Commonwealth Institute of Health and this will be funded by the Government. Dr William MCBride has been reported as endorsing the action of the Government in setting up this study. Ex-Servicemen: Exposure to Pesticides Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Veterans'Affairs, upon notice, on 17 April 1980: (1) Will the current investigation into contact with herbicides and related substances in Vietnam by Vietnam veterans include a survey of exposure to DDT and other pesticides. (2) Was DDT or an alternative pesticide used more extensively in Vietnam than in those theatres of the 1939-45 War involving Australians. Oil Pollution at Sea (3) Will he consider a survey on the possible long-term effects of such exposure on 1939-45 War veterans based on (Question No. 5926) published epidemiological information with or without an extension of the current investigation into effects on Vietnam veterans. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: the estimated pollution threat (1) The current investigation by the Commonwealth Institute of Health will consider all chemicals to which Australian servicemen may have been exposed in Vietnam. (2) My colleague the Minister for Defence has informed me that DDT was used in Vietnam. It is not possible to compare the extent of its use in Vietnam against its use in World War II theatres of war. Australians served in many theatres of war and DDT was used by many nations. (3) Exposure of 1939-45 War veterans to DDT and other pesticides has not been presented as a problem and a study of the kind suggested is not proposed. Public Service: Information on Country of Birth (Question No. 5941) Dr Cass asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 21 April 1980: this the estimated scale of Are prospective employees in the Australian Public Service required to indicate their country of birth; if so, why. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. I am advised that place of birth information is requested from persons applying for permanent appointment or temporary employment in the Australian Public Service. Under Section 34 (c) of the Public Service Act the Public Service Board is charged with ensuring that an applicant is a fit and proper person to be an officer of the Service, and place of birth information assists in establishing identity for admin(Question No. 5929) istrative checks in this regard.

Mr Innes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 21 April 1980: (1) Does the entry labelled Citizen Band in the list of radiocommunication stations licensed in Australia as at 31 March 1979 contained in the Annual Report of the Postal and Telecommunications Department for 1978-79 refer to (a) individual operating CB sets or ators; if it refers to neither, what does it refer to. (2) Is the cost of a CB licence $25. (3) If so, if the entry refers to licences held by operators and if there were 179,332 licensed CB operators as at 31 March 1979, should Commonwealth revenue derived from CB licences have been $4,458,300 in the period 1 April 1978 to 31 March 1979. (4) Does the Annual Report also refer to Receipts 1978-79, Licence Fees-C B $2,525,700; if so, does this mean that between March 1979 and June 1979 some 78,000 CB operators did not renew their licences; if not, what reasons were there for this apparent shortfall in revenue. (Question No. 5969)",446
265,Mr STALEY,OCCURRING LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 179,332 Citizen Band stations indicated in the Annual Report of the Postal and Telecommunications Department for 1978-79 refers to the number of Citizens Band Radio Service (CBRS) station licences recorded in the Departmental records as being on issue as at 31 March 1979. (2) The cost of a CB licence is $25, but this fee will drop to $20onl July 1980. (3) and (4) The CBRS licence revenue for the period 1 April 1978 to 31 March 1979 would have been of the order of $4.5m if all licences on issue as at 3 March had been renewed. The annual report correctly shows that Receipts for 1978-79 for CB licence fees were $2,525,700. There is a discrepancy between the actual licence fee revenue and the theoretical revenue because of the number of licences which, at 30 June 1979, were still recorded as licence issues but fell in the categories of 'unpaid renewals' or 'pending cancellations'. Due to the limited information processing resources available it is normal practice of the Department to rate the issue of licences a higher priority than the cancellation of licences, due to non-payment of renewal fees. There is Canberra Staff also a planned delay in cancelling licences to allow for late (Question No. 5971) payments. The total effect of these factors at the end of the fiscal year 1978-79 was that some 72,000 licences were still technically on issue although the renewal fees had not been paid. The number of licences, technically on issue at 30 June 1979, had dropped to 173,507 (i.e. by 5,825 from the March 1979 figure of 179,332). However, a decrease in the number of licences issued for stations in the Citizens Band Radio Service is a natural outcome following the announcement that from 1 March 1979 a station licence could cover the operation of five Citizens Band transceiver units in lieu of the previous arrangement of one licence for each unit. Co-operation between Universities and the NA (Question No. 5984) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Science and the Environment, upon notice, on 22 April 1980: (1) Did both the OECD Examiners' Report on Science and Citizen Band Radio Technology in Australia (presented to the House on 17 (Question No. 5974) October 1974) and the Report of the Independent Inquiry into the CSIRO (presented to the House on 6 October 1977) recommend that greater co-operation be promoted between universities and the CSIRO in teaching and research; if so, to what extent have these recommendations been implemented. (2) Have interchanges of staff taken place to effect these recommendations in the last two years; if so, what are the details. rather (b) licences held by operMr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The OECD Examiners' Report (1974) favoured greater mobility of scientific workers between CSIRO and the universities, and enhanced CSIRO involvement in university research. The Report of the Independent Inquiry into CSIRO endorsed the objective of closer relations between CSIRO and the universities, and recommended that a joint committee of CSIRO and the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) be established to investigate means of collaboration. A joint committee on CSIRO/University interaction, comprising representatives of CSIRO and of the AVCC, was established in February 1979. Amongst other things, the joint committee, with a view to increasing to identify areas in which CSIRO and the universities might co-operate in research and development and fields in which secondment opportunities tenable either in CSIRO or the universities might be offered. (2) The average level of staff interchange between CSIRO and the universities over the past two year is as follows: CSIRO staff teaching in universities, 99 per annum CSIRO staff supervising university postgraduate students, 91 per annum CSIRO staff engaged in collaborative research with universities, 238 per annum CSIRO staff seconded to universities, 12 per annum* University staff seconded to CSIRO, 10 per annum* * Due to the informal nature of many such arrangements, there are likely to have been additional cases which have not been recorded. Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 22 April 1980: (1) Have negotiations been in progress with State governments and industry representatives to co-ordinate coal export agreements; if so, what stage have they reached.

266,Mr ANTHONY,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable ation member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) No. However, on 7 December 1979, the Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland pointing out the expected very large increase in international demand for Australian steaming coal and the need to ensure removal of impediments to the development of the trade. The Prime Minister suggested there should be dister cussions between Commonwealth and State officials, pooling information on likely expansion of steaming coal exports, developments likely to come on stream to meet export mand and identifying the necessary infrastructure requireCouncil ments and timing. Both Premiers have responded positively and consultations by officials are in progress.

(4) Have any steps been taken to (a) include Queensland in the Zeidler inquiry and (b) ensure that (i) Queenslanders are not committed to meeting an unfair proportion of peak and off-peak costs for electricity used for other export and domestic industries and private homes and (ii) the infrastructure costs, including costs of relocation of coal and bauxite mining communities when their deposits finally run out or become uneconomic, are met by the industry.

Commonwealth/State co-operation is achieved through the Australian Minerals and Energy Counfrequently with the cil (AMEC). Health Investigations (Question No. 5991) on fair and reasonable terms in Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 22 April 1980: Has the Government initiated investigations into claims (Question No. 5986) that (a) dioxin and other toxins permeated water supplies of all Australian service personnel who served in Vietand (b) radiation exposure to (i) atomic tests at Maralinga and Emu, SA, and the Monte Bello islands and (ii) weapons fallout in Japan have led to heightened incidences of and malignancies and other disorders in Australians; if so, (A) anwhat investigations have been initiated and (B) when were 1980, to ensure that they initiated. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Government is aware of the various chemicals used in Vietnam, including pesticides, some of which contained dioxin. Several of these were used in spraying operations and for application to the perimeter of base camps. Consequently the potential for contamination of water supplies during the hostilities would inevitably be present. The investigation currently being conducted by the Commonwealth Institute of Health on behalf of the Department of Veterans' Affairs is assessing the possible adverse health effects which may be attributable to the usage of these substances in Vietnam, whatever the method by which they were taken into the human body. This would clearly include intake through water. (b) (i) I refer the honourable member to the Ministerial Statement of the Leader of the Government in the Senate on 15 May 1980 (Hansard, pp. 2288-2294). (ii) No investigation has been initiated by the Commonwealth Government into claims that radiation exposure from fallout in Japan has led to heightened incidence of malignancies or other diseases in Australians. The radiation exposure to those in the vicinity of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, due to the explosion of nuclear weapons there in August 1945, arose almost entirely from direct exposure to radiation from the exploding weapons rather than from any radioactive debris reaching the ground subsequently. The possible effects of fallout on residents of the cities in the long-term have been studied by Japanese scientists (Radioactive Fallout Effects of the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb, Health Physics 34, 621-633, 1978, Shunzo Okajima, Kenji Takeshita, Shiegetoshi Antoku, Toshio Shiomi, Walter J. Russell, Shoichiro Fujita, Haruma Yoshinaga, Shotaro Neriishi, Sadahisa Kawamoto and Toshiyuki Norimura). The presence of the long-lived radionuclide caesium-137 from fallout from the Nagasaki nuclear explosion was revealed in a study group selected term residence as being most subject to the fallout. The enhanced level of caesium-137 their eating foodstuffs produced on local farms remaining contaminated with the radionuclide. Following physical examinations and clinical studies, the Japanese scientists concluded that 'no physical or laboratory abnormalities were detected among the index subjects of the study.' In view of these conclusions, reached from studies of long term residents selected as most subject to fallout, an investigation of abnormalities-malignan t or otherwise-in Australians who were in the affected areas following the explosions would not appear warranted. (A) and (B). See above. Vietnam Veterans: Defoliant Effects Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 22 April 1980: (1) Is he able to state whether the Commonwealth Institute of Health has been directed to redirect to his Department inquiries and submissions concerning nam veterans. (2) If this directive has been given, (a) who initiated it and (b) what Ministers have authorised it. (3) Will he ensure that the public has prompt access to all (a) demographic (b) statistical and (c) medical information available to the Institute and the Government from (i) Vietnam, (ii) the United States of America, (iii) within Australia and (iv) elsewhere. (4) Will he (a) ensure and (b) make clearly apparent to the public by published reports of independent monitors, that the Institute is not failing to obtain, collate or reveal evidence. (5) Will this monitoring be entrusted to a judicial inquiry to allow public testing of evidence obtained in the Institute's inquiry as it proceeds. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Professor L. Davidson, Principal of the Commonwealth Institute of Health has been asked to redirect any queries relating to veterans to my Department for action. (2) This procedure was made clear in preliminary discussions with Professor Davidson and was not the subject of separate ministerial approval. (3) Information available to the Department is already available to the public in the form of reports and articles in periodicals and learned journals. United States agencies have recently declassified a number of reports and studies on medical and environmental aspects of herbicides. These are fully available to all interested persons. Material collected from Vietnam is now being translated and the information in these reports will not be restricted. Information gathered from within Australia and abroad is based substantially on published scientific material. (4) A Scientific Advisory Committee consisting of internationally recognised scientists is being established which will assess and endorse the methodology used by the Commonwealth Institute of Health and ensure that any alterations which may become necessary during the study are scientifically valid. The complete independence of the Institute is an important aspect of the study and any findings obtained by the study will be made available to the public. (5) No. The Institute's study is scientific, not legal. The methodology of the study must be able to satisfy the scrutiny of the international scientific community. for their location and longCommunity Youth Support Scheme in these people is attributed to (Question No. 6001) Mr Holding asked the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 23 April 1980: (1) Further to the answer to Question No. 5312 (Hansard. 21 April 1980, page 2045), will he provide further and more detailed particulars, specifically in relation to the individual Community Youth Support Scheme units that were (a) disbanded and (b) scaled down by Government changes in late November 1979.

Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I announced the appointment of the task force on 8 June 1979. Committal proceedings were instituted, as a result of the task force's investigations, against two former Narcotics Bureau officers and a law clerk. These proceedings concluded in May this year without committals because of insufficiency of evidence to support trials on charges of criminal conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

However, conducted in 1977 estimated that some 30 per cent of 7236 employees in the Department's general and auxiliary hospitals were born overseas or born in Australia of parents born overseas. (3) The Department has not found it necessary to specifically employ bi-lingual or multi-lingual staff in public contact areas. The predominant areas of migrant contact are the Department's Artificial Limb and Appliance Centres (RALACs) and general hospitals in each State. Broad surveys undertaken in 1977 indicated that the migrant proportion of RALAC patients was approximately 9 per cent, but the majority of these were from English speaking countries. In the general hospitals it was estimated that migrants were about 1S per cent of the total number of inpatients. It has been found in practice that in most instances there is a staff member available who can give assistance in translation when required. (4) and (S) Each State Branch of the Department maintains a register of staff fluent in languages other than English. Several hundred staff are listed languages are covered.

Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The information sought by the question would involve a manual examination of all departmental records and I am not prepared to authorise the use of the extensive resources that would be required to carry out this task. For the information of the honourable member a sample check of records has indicated that the information being sought is not available in all cases. (3) As at 30 June 1980 eighty-nine (89) bi-lingual and multi-lingual staff of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs who have considerable contact with were paid a special allowance. (4) The Department has a tates communication with its migrant clients and constitutes a general translation facility for Commonwealth Departments as a whole. The Service also dividual migrants of documents directly related to their settlement. Full-time translators are employed in the Department's Central Office and in its Sydney and Melbourne Offices. In the other States by the Telephone Interpreter Service and either carried out by TIS staff or referred to the translation units in the offices mentioned. (a) The languages covered by staff translators are: Arabic, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Serbian and Croatian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and Vietnamese. In addition, the Department's Translation Service employs casual translators on a contract basis when necessary to carry out translations which are beyond the scope of the staff translators. With the aid of casual translators the Service is able to cover virtually all languages likely to be required. (b) Details of the number of persons employed as interpreter/translators and their classifications follows: Classification Grade 5 (Class 8) Grade 4 (Class 6) Grade 3 (Class 5) Grade 2 (Class 4) Grade 1 (Class 2/3) Total In addition to operating its own Translation and Telephone Interpreting Services the Department is responsible for implementation of agreements concluded in pursuance of Galbally Recommendation 17, under which the Commonwealth shares with the States the cost of the establishment and operation of additional State operated translation and interpreting facilities in areas of prime State responsibility. Three agreements have been concluded to date, with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. These provide for the establishment of additional translation facilities in New South Wales and Victoria and interpreting facilities in New South Wales and South Australia. The implementation of these agreements is resulting in greatly improved access for migrants to State provided services especially in such vital areas as health, welfare, law and education. (S) In addition to the Translation Service facilities for language communication between the Department and its migrant clients are provided by the Telephone Interpreter Service (TIS). TIS now operates not only in Canberra and all State capital cities but has been extended in accordance with Galbally Recommendation IS and associated proposals to many provincial areas including Newcastle, Geelong, Whyalla, the Latrobe Valley, Albury-Wodonga and Shepparton. TIS also provides or supplements interpreting facilities used the by other Commonwealth Departments including those having a large migrant clientele. The effectiveness of the telephone service provided by TIS can be greatly enhanced by the installation of special telephone equipment such as dual handset and ioudspeaking telephones and many of these have been in the public stalled in various Commonwealth Departments.

Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The newspaper report referred to the statement accompanying the Australian Hospital Association's submission to the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals in Australia. The Inquiry's interim report was received on scheduled to be presented by the end of this year. The reports of the Inquiry on this and other matters are expected to provide an important input to Government decision making and planning for the future. I would therefore prefer to await analysis of these reports before I consider gation into financial incentive budgeting for hospitals. (2) and (3) Yes. (4) No. (5) Several factors contributed health care costs in the mid-seventies. However, the Government is firmly of the view that the introduction of Medibank was a very significant factor. Medical Services to Hospital Patients Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 30 April 1980: What payments were made by his Department for medical services on a fee-for-service basis rendered to hospital patients for each month since November 1978. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Patients who are privately insured can receive medical services on a fee-for-service basis, but the information provided by the private health funds to my Department in respect of medical benefits claims does not distinguish whether the services were provided to patients in recognised hospitals or elsewhere. However, under the hospital cost sharing arrangements uninsured patients receive free medical treatment in recognised (i.e. public) hospitals. Such services are provided by doctors employed by the hospitals on salaried, sessional or Health Care Costs contract bases. The contract arrangements are based on a (Question No. 6051) modified fee-for-service arrangement aligned to the Schedule of medical benefits. The costs of providing services to uninsured patients under the modified fee-for-service arrangements by month as from November 1978 to December 1979 are set out below. These costs are shared equally between the Commonwealth and States. Total payments on a modified fee-for-service basis by State will recognised hospitals (except Queensland*) to visiting medical offiers providing services to uninsured hospital patients under the hospital cost sharing arrangements. The totals shown also include the cost of sessional payments in New South Wales as that State does not separate its sessional and contract payments in its returns. The New South Wales component is therefore shown separately in brackets.

Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1 March 1973. (2) $4.45. Fire Protection and Safety Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 30 April 1980: (1) What are the functions monwealth Fire Board. (2) What is the total estimated expenditure on and by the Board for 1979-80. (3) Has the Board been involved in co-ordinating and/or rationalising Australia's fire-fighting bodies; if so, what progress has been made to date. (4) Is it a fact that (a) there is at present no Commonwealth legislation requiring Commonwealth Departments to comply with State and local government Acts and regulations in this area and (b) building Acts and regulations and similar State instruments are not binding on Commonwealth Departments. (5) Has the Board made recommendations concerning the reform of legislation in this area; if so, what are the details the recommendations. (6) Did the report of the Auditor-General on an Efficiency Audit of the Australian Property Function of his Department (presented to the House on 17 April 1980) recommend that special attention needed to be given to ensure consistency in the approach to, and application of, standards of fire protection and safety; if so, what action has been taken as a result of this recommendation. Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The functions of the Commonwealth Fire Board are set out at page 2 of the Board's 1978-79 Annual Report which I tabled in the House of Representatives on 22 May 1980. (2) $141,300. (3) No. (4) (a) and (b) Yes. It is, however, the Government's policy to ensure that the requirements of State and local governments are observed as far as possible. (5) No. (6) Yes. The Commonwealth Fire Board, through its recommendations and circulars, seeks consistency in this area. In addition, my Department is preparing a draft of fire evacuation and safety procedures for Commonwealth owned and leased accommodation with a view to achieving co-ordination and uniformity, particularly in buildings accommodating more than one department. Importation of Angora Goat Semen Mr Sainsbury asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 30 April 1980: (1) Are there any restrictions on the importation of angora goat semen. (2) If so, (a) what are those restrictions and (b) how do they relate to the importation of semen from (i) South Africa and (ii) Turkey, and (c) what means are available to enable a person to import this semen despite the restrictions. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) Yes. (2) (a) Under Quarantine Proclamation 77A semen, other than bovine semen (for which special provisions apply), may be imported only with the consent in writing of the Director of Quarantine. Under present arrangements such approval is given to goat semen from New Zealand only. (Question No. 6059) (b) (i) (ii) Approval is not given to imports of goat semen from South Africa and Turkey because of the presence of diseases in those courntries which are exotic to Australia and which may be transmitted in semen. and responsibilities of the Com(c) Under present arrangements there are no means by which goat semen may be legally imported into Australia from South Africa or Turkey. Murray River (Question No. 6064) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 30 April 1980: Acts and regulations, fire safety (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports that (a) the growing inter-State passenger trade on the Murray River between South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales is being severely hampered (i) through failure to reof move fallen trees from the river, for instance at Higgins Cutting, 6 km upstream from the South Australian border, (ii) by the proposed closure of Lock 5 and other locks for leisurely repairs and (b) the failure to keep the river open for navigation is of grave concern to some boat operators and people involved in passenger transport on the river. (2) Is the tourist traffic along the Murray River becoming increasingly important; if so, will Commonwealth responsibility for this form of inter-State trade be acknowledged and honoured.",456
279,Mr ANTHONY,CSIRO,"The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) (i) and (ii). No. Under the River Murray Waters Agreement, responsibility for both these matters rests with the State Governments. (b) I am not aware of any specific reports but it has long been recognised that navigation on sections of the river tends to be unreliable due to fluctuations inriverflow. Again under the Agreement, responsibility for operation, control and maintenance of locks rests with the respective State Governments and I have no reason to believe that this responsibility is not being properly discharged. There will inevitably be interruptions to navigation when maintenance becomes necessary. (2) I understand that tourist traffic on the river is increasing; the development of tourism on the Murray River is primarily a matter for the States concerned. Nomad Aircraft (Question No. 6069) (Question No. 6061) Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 1 May 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports that, by means of Presidential Instruction No. I of 1980, dated 29 January 1980, the Indonesian Government has banned the importation of certain aircraft into Indonesia. (2) If the situation is as indicated, does this ban include the Nomad aircraft. (3) Is the ban consistent with the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. (4) Did the Indonesian Government consult with the Australian Government before imposing the ban. (S) Has the Australian Government raised the question of the ban with the Indonesian Government; if not, does it plan to do so.",457
280,Mr ANTHONY,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. The Nomad is specifically listed as one of the prohibited imports as are other makes similar to aircraft produced in Indonesia. (3) Import prohibitions are prescribed by the GATT except when applied for certain specified purposes and under specified conditions. These purposes include Governmental assistance to economic development by developing countries and measures taken for essential security purposes. The ban by the Indonesian Government on the importation of certain aircraft into Indonesia Contracting Parties of the GATT. (4) No. (5) No. After examination of the circumstances and recognising that Indonesia is a developing country attempting to establish a viable aircraft industry the Government does not intend to pursue the matter formally at this stage. However, should Indonesian import policy on aircraft change and the import of aircraft similar to, be permitted then the Government would review its position in the light of such a development. Mr Holding asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 1 May 1980: (1) Are statistics available on the (a) incidence and (b) geographical location of the occurrence of multiple sclerosis in Australia. (2) If so, (a) what percentage of the Australian population is shown to be affected by multiple sclerosis and (b) from what sources are these figures compiled. Investigator Professor J. G. MCLeod & Professor A. Basten DrJ. W. Heath and of J.T. Holland Dr P. Carnegie Dr L. A. Cala and DrJ. L. Black Dr R. D. Cook Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are no comprehensive Australia wide statistics of the incidence of multiple sclerosis. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does have some limited statistics in some States of the numbers of hospital inpatients suffering from multiple sclerosis, but they do not give incidence figures. (2) The best figures which are available on the matter come from a study conducted by Professor M. G. MCCall of the Department of Medicine, University of Western Australia, and others, published in the Journal of Neurology, Neuro-surgery and Psychiatry 1968, Volume 31, pages 1-9. This study showed the prevalence of 20 per 100,000 in Perth and Newcastle while in Hobart the rate was 32 per 100,000. Multiple Sclerosis (Question No. 6075) has not been notified to the Mr Holding asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on I May 1980: (1) Can he say whether any research projects are currently being undertaken in Australia into the cause, nature and treatment of the disease, multiple sclerosis; if so, (a) which institutions and researchers are involved in each project, (b) where are they located and (c) what is the nature of the research in each case. and competitive with, the Nomad (2) Have any of the projects received, or are receiving, Federal funding allocated within the last 5 financial years; if so, (a) which projects receive this funding and (b) what is the Multiple Sclerosis sum in each case. (Question No. 6073) (3) Is his Department monitoring research directly related to multiple sclerosis which is currently being carried out overseas. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH & MRC) is currently supporting the undermentioned projects researching various aspects of the cause, nature, or treatment of multiple sclerosis. There may however be other research projects supported from other sources. All of the following projects have received, or are receiving. Federal funding within the last 5 financial years through the NH and MRC. The information sought by the honourable member in respect of these projects is as follows: Federal funding in lasts Institute Project years $A University of Sydney 'Immunological studies and therapy in 51,170 Multiple Sclerosis and optic Neuritis' University of 'Significance of unusually myelinated 4,200 Newcastle sympathetic nerves: structure and functional studies' La Trobe University 'Antibodies to oligodendrocytes in 32,022 serum of patients with Multiple Sclerosis' Sir Charles Gairdner 'Computerised tomography and 47,089 Hospital (WA) electrophysiological studies in patients with demyelinating diseases of the nervous system' Murdoch University 'A study of primary demyelinating 18,521 disease in the nervous system of cats' Investigator Dr R. Smith (3) The results of significant overseas medical research are drawn to the attention of my Department through the appropriate medical journals. Hercules Transport Aircraft Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 13 May 1980: Were 12 Hercules transport aircraft originally sold to Parmax Inc. of the United States of America for SI0.7 million; if so, what is the present position. Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 22 June 1979 12 ex-RAAF Hercules C130A aircraft were sold to Parmax Inc. of Arlington, SA10.212 million with payment due on 9 July 1979. Due to the necessity to repair one of the aircraft the time for payment was extended. On 12 February 1980 Parmax Inc. was given formal notice to complete. To date payment has not made. The Commonwealth Government has re-opened world-wide public tenders closing in Canberra on 22 July 1980. Repatriation Review System Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Vetthat erans' Affairs, upon notice, on 13 May 1980: (1) Has he replied to requests for changes in the Repatriation system submitted by the ACT branch of the Vietnam Veterans' Action Association on 19 February 1980. (2) If not, when does he expect to be able to provide a definitive reply. (3) Has his attention been drawn to the case of Michael James Boland (file CSS 2554) including the Repatriation Review Tribunal's request of 14 September 1979 for review by the Commission of a Board determination of 19 February 1979 which in the Tribunal's view failed to consider relevant evidence. (4) What action is proposed due to the requirement under Sub-section 107VL(2) of the Repatriation Act that the Tribunal must refer such matters back to the Commission rather than itself make a determination. (5) What steps have been taken or will be taken to ensure that Sub-section 24AB (1) and paragraph 47 (1) (b) of the Act are in future observed and that adequate legal and medical advice is available to claimants and appellants to prepare their cases and effectively probe other evidence. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Replies have been made to all the suggestions put forward by the ACT Branch of the Vietnam Veterans' Action Association. The Association's suggestions were received in the form of personal representations on its behalf Federal funding in last 5 Institute Project years $A La Trobe University 'The role of basic protein in myelin 13,714 and demyelination' by Senator John Knight and a reply to all points raised by the Association was sent to Senator Knight on 21 May 1980. (3) Yes. (4) Sub-section 107VL (2) of the Repatriation Act requires (Question No. 6086) the Repatriation Review Tribunal to adjourn its hearing of a case where evidence is presented, which, in the opinion of the Tribunal, would have been relevant to the making of a decision by the previous determining authority. This procedure is considered to be in the interests of the applicant and is designed to give him every possible opportunity to have his case fairly and thoroughly considered. To ensure that outstanding cases are cleared and delays caused by cases having to be referred back to the Commission are reduced to a minimum, additional staff have been assigned to handling these matters and it is expected that delays will be Texas, USA for significantly reduced. In addition, an examination of the legislative provisions, including section 107VL, is being undertaken with a view to been overcoming any problems which may have arisen. (5) All officers of my Department concerned with the investigation of claims are fully aware of their obligations under the Repatriation Act and every effort is made to ensure that claims are fully investigated. Likewise, the Commission and Repatriation Boards are aware of their obligations and carry (Question No. 6090) out their duties conscientiously. I have no reason to believe the provisions of sub-sections 24AB (1) and 47 (1) (b) are not observed by all concerned. My Department does not provide legal or medical advisory services, but all claimants are given every opportunity to submit any information they may wish to support their claims, appeals or applications. The determining authorities give reasons for their decisions which are made available to the claimant who may then discuss and seek advice if he wishes from anyone he desires. Also, claimants are not denied any reasonable access to the information contained in their Repatriation records. Should a veteran question the validity or accuracy of any point contained in the reasons for decision or raise an issue that he feels may not have been considered, he may do so at any time and there are provisions for a case to be reviewed in these circumstances. to overcome inordinate delays It is considered that veterans are given ample opportunity to prepare and present their cases. Nonetheless, my Department is examining the form of submission to the determining authorities and the question of making available to claimants the evidence presented to a determining authority, which, if acceptable to the determining authorities and all others concerned, will be an improvement to the services provided to veterans who have lodged claims. Alleged Social Security Frauds Case (Question No. 6093) Dr Klugman asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 13 May 1980: Did the Crown make an application to close the Court during recent proceedings of prosecutions for alleged social security frauds in Sydney, NSW; if so, (a) why was the application made and (b) was it successful.",458
281,Mr VINER,CSIRO,"The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: On 22 April 1980, in the committal proceedings in Sydney in the Social Security conspiracy case, the Magistrate was requested to hear in closed court an application on behalf of the informant for an order that the further evidence of Mr Chris Nakis be taken in a closed court. The Magistrate granted that request and received relevant to the application that the further evidence of Mr Nakis be taken in closed court. The Magistrate refused to order that the further evidence of Mr Nakis be taken in closed court and his decision was upheld by the Supreme Court. The substance of the grounds on which the application was made appears from paragraphs 25,26,28 and 29 of an affidavit filed in the proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in which the decision of the Magistrate was challenged. The texts of those paragraphs are set out in the Judgment of Mr Justice Yeldham which was delivered on 1 May 1980. Mr Holding asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 14 May 1980: When can I expect an answer to (a) Question No. 5320, which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 19 February 1980 and (b) Question No. 5467, which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 20 February 1980.",460
282,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) My answer to Question No. 5320 was sent to the honourable member during the recent adjournment. The answer should appear in Hansard in the first week of the Budget sittings. (b) My answer to Question No. 5467 appeared in the Weekly Hansard for 20 to 22 May (page 3210). Mr Holding asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 14 May 1980: (1) Has the Minister's attention public (a) interest in the aluminium industry and (b) awareness of the (i) possible financial and social costs of that indusbenefits try and (ii) potential energy, employment and environmental problems associated with that industry. (2) If so, to allay any fears that the Government might wish to stifle responsible public debate on the issue by withholding all the relevant information, cision given in the answer to question No. 5873 (Hansard, 29 April 1980, pages 2401-2) and answer that question in detail.",460
283,Mr ANTHONY,CSIRO,"The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The Government is committed to the economic development of Australia's natural resources. In the case of the aluminium industry, 1 million tonnes of aluminium smelting capacity requiring some S3 billion of investment is planned for the next few years. The importance of these investments to the development of the Australian economy can not be overstated. (2) As I indicated in my reply to question No. 5873, the material required to provide a detailed reply covering all the matters raised in that question is not readily available and the diversion of resources needed to provide the answer sought is not warranted. Not only is information of this type not readily available for any industry in Australia, much of it would of necessity be conjectural. The key point is that the Government has in place a range of economic, social and environmental policies to ensure that while private enterprise development is encouraged, it takes place in a manner consistent with the national interest. in closed court the material Taxation Deductions: Donations to Animal Welfare Charities (Question No. 6106)",460
284,Mr LES JOHNSON,CSIRO,"the Treasurer, upon notice, on 14 May 1980: (1) Which animal welfare charities in Australia are recognised by the Commissioner of Taxation for the purposes of allowing tax deductions. Answers to Questions (2) Are donations made to certain animal charities not tax deductible; if so, (a) why are these deductions not allowable (Question No. 6097) and (b) what are the reasons for the different approaches. (3) Does the Government propose to take steps to ensure that all donations to animal welfare charities are tax deductible; if so, what is proposed.",460
285,Mr HOWARD,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Income Tax Assessment Act does not provide any deduction for donations to animal welfare charities other than to the Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated and the World Wildlife Fund Australia. Both of these organisations, however, are concerned primarily with the preservation of fauna, rather than with animal welfare. (3) This is a policy matter and will be considered in the Budget context along with other requests for taxation concessions, including other requests for admission to the income tax gift provisions. Aluminium Industry Energy Saving Equipment (Question No. 6104) (Question No. 6118) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 15 May 1980: been drawn to increasing (1) Will the Minister investigate urgently the costs and of low and/or delayed interest on loans to enable low income families to install solar space and water heaters, reverse cycle heat pumps, home insulation and similar technologies which offer energy savings sufficient to offset extra capital costs over less than the reasonably expected lifetime of the installations concerned. will the Minister reverse the de(2) Is the Minister able to state whether a Californian scheme along these lines produced 375,000 jobs in the solar energy industry.",460
286,Mr ANTHONY,CSIRO,"The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The National Energy Advisory Committee is currently examining the question of energy conservation and substitution in buildings and one important part of their study is the consideration of financial and economic incentives. (2) My Department advises me that they are not aware of any report giving such employment figures, however, they are seeking further information. Peanuts and Peanut Products: Aflatoxins Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 15 May 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in Choice for March 1980 that of limited samples of 14 brands of peanut butter (a description illegal in Queensland where it is called peanut paste), 8 had above the National Health and Medical Research Council's first recommended level of 5 parts per billion (ppb) of potent liver toxins produced by a mould) and 2 brands had above their later recommended level of 13 ppb. (2) If so, can he say whether levels up to 29 ppb were found in the poor 1977 peanut crop. (3) What was done with the 1977 crop. (4) Is less than one part for aflatoxin. (5) What is done when samples are found to contain over 13 ppb. (6) Why has the recommended level been raised. (7) Were bags of peanuts recently on sale in Canberra imported from the United States of America with tickets certifying that they contained less than 23 ppb; if so, can he say why these imports are allowed. (8) Has he given any advice of peanuts and their products. (9) Could peanuts unsuitable for human consumption be safely used for (a) pig food and (b) production of peanut oil as diesel fuel and by-products as fodder after heat treatment. (10) What governments are responsible for legislation to ensure proper preventative health precautions are exercised in regard to aflatoxins. (11) Will he take action and in legislation for the Australian Capital Territory and elsewhere in this matter; if so, what form will these actions take. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)and (2) Yes. (3) Approximately 30 per cent of the 1977 peanut crop was either used for the production of peanut oil or used for animal feed, because it exceeded the 13 ppb action level. In the production of peanut oil aflatoxins are retained in the fibrous press cake and the oil. is aflatoxin free. (4) Yes. The current sampling and analysis procedures employed by the Peanut Marketing Board may be summarised as follows: From each lot of 10 tonnes of peanuts, three samples of 8 kg are selected. The first batch of 8 kg is ground to achieve homogeneous mix and analysed. If the analysis is less than 3 ppb the whole lot is accepted. If the first batch exceeds 3 ppb, then a second batch is similarly treated and if there are any doubts concerning that batch the third sample is analysed. If the first and second batches on testing exceed 15 ppb the lot of 10 tonnes is re-sorted using sophisticated methods whereby each nut is examined. (5) Peanuts with aflatoxin levels above 15 ppb are rejected and used for oil manufacture or used for animal fodder. (6) The recommended level was raised to avoid possibly unnecessary restrictions on the industry pending reconsideration of this matter by the National Health & Medical Research Council (NH & MRC) in view of the following factors: (Question No. 6121) (i) the level of 5 ppb was one of the most stringent in the world. Canada and the United Kingdom do not have limits for aflatoxin in food, whilst the limit in the United States is 25 ppb. (ii) peanuts and peanut products generally form a minor proportion of the Australian diet. (iii) there is lack of any evidence of human health problems associated with the consumption of peanuts and peanut products in Australia. cancer producing agents (aria(iv) toxicological and other data on aflatoxins available to the NH & MRC showed inconsistencies and conflicting conclusions relating to various communities outside Australia. (7) Yes. There is no restriction on the import of peanuts into Australia. However, imported peanuts are subject to State and Territory food legislation at the point of retail sale. in 400 of the peanut crop sampled (8) No. (9) Rejected peanuts could be safely used as pig food, but should not be fed to dairy cattle or poultry. They could also be used to produce peanut oil, but I am unable to say whether this would prove a satisfactory diesel fuel. (10) Commonwealth State and Territory Governments. In particular, health authorities of those Governments are responsible for the administration and enforcement of food legislation in Australia, including regulation of aflatoxins in food. for the public on consumption (11) Until this matter is finalised by the NH & MRC no further action will be taken. However, the NH & MRC in June 1980 again discussed this matter and has initiated a detailed study of available information by epidemiologists and other appropriate experts in Australia to examine the data available and to relate this matter to the consumption of peanuts and peanut products in Australia. Abnormalities in Children of Vietnam Veterans at the Australian Health Council (Question No. 6123) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 15 May 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a repor by P. Akerman entitled 'Vietnam's poison legacy' in the Australian of 3 April 1980 and an accompanying comment by P. Young. (2) If so, does the report suggest an incidence of brain, spinal cord, eye and heart defects at twice the normal level in children of 700 Vietnamese veterans after a 1976-78 study of some 4500 people including 1102 veterans, 836 of whom had been exposed to herbicides, with 670 of those exposed having wives who were not exposed. (3) Were there 17 brain and spinal cord, 3 eye, 10 limb, 4 lip/palate and 16 heart abnormalities among the 43 alleged mutancies. (4) Is this consistent with last year's Lancet report by a Barbara Field on herbicide effects and the files of 70 United States of America couples who had 8 miscarriages and 7 birth defects among their pregnancies. (5) If so, will the Government promptly (a) prepare legislation to give to spouses and dependants in these cases the entitlements of the exposed veterans to compensatory allowances and treatment while there remains doubt as to the contribution of war service to their condition and (b) seek and publish legal advice as to the duty of repatriation Tribunals to give claimants under this legislation the benefit of any doubt that these abnormalities may be war-caused, pending statistical confirmation or otherwise which could take several years. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) and (3) As the newspaper report is not an article published in the referenced scientific ible to draw scientifically valid conclusions based on its contents. (4) The letter to the Lancet, June 23,1979 by Barbara Field and Charles Kerr has been brought to my attention. One sentence in it is especially relevant to the question and that is 'Our data and the record-linkage nature of analysis cannot be taken as direct evidence of 2,4,5-T'. Their letter suggested further analyses and trials be undertaken. I am not aware of the contents of the files on 70 United States of America couples to which the question refers. (5) In my statement on Agent Orange in Vietnam veterans to the House of Representatives on 21 February 1980, I said 'If it is established that there is a connection between birth fects in the children of veterans and exposure to herbicides in Vietnam the Government will take appropriate action'. One of the reasons for the Government pushing ahead with the study by the Commonwealth Institute of Health is to establish if there is such a connection. The honourable member has been advised that such a study will take approximately two years. Legal Gambling in the Australian Capital Dr Klugman asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 15 May 1980: What is the minimum percentage of invested money returned in prize money to investors in (a) the ACT TAB, (b) New South Wales lotteries, (c) poker machines in licensed ACT clubs, (d) Lotto, (e) soccer pools and (f) any other forms of legal gambling in the ACT. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am informed by my Department that: The minimum percentages prize money to investors in legal forms of gambling in the ACT are as follows: (The percentage figures quoted need to be read in junction with the supplementary notes.) Gambling forms (a) ACT TAB (b) NSW Lotteries (c) Poker machines in licensed ACT clubs (d) Lotto (NSW) (e) Soccer Football Pools Notes: (a) The ACT TAB prize money proportion is based on total receipts less overall commissions which vary for different types of bets. At present the commissions applicable are 17 per cent for trifecta betting, 20 per cent for the 6 race jackpot and 15 per cent for all other classes of bets. (b) For NSW Lotteries sold in the ACT and conducted by the NSW State Lotteries Office, 62.5 per cent is the average amount returned in prize money although the proportion varies marginally for different value lotteries. (c) All ACT poker machines are required to be set to return to players 87 per cent, or as near as practicable to 87 per cent, of money invested. Because of random variations this proportion may vary in isolated instances. (0 Other legal gambling forms literature it is not possHousie and relatively small scale local lotteries, silver circles and similar betting schemes conducted in the ACT are licensed under ACT law. The proportion of investments returned as prize money varies with the type, size and purpose of the scheme but is generally within the range 30 per cent-60 per cent for lotteries, silver circles and other games and 70 per cent-80 per cent for housie. any causal association involving Tattersall consultations (including Tattslotto) are sold in the ACT and the proportion of investments required to be returned as prize money is 60 per cent under the Victorian legislation. Other lotteries, art unions and pools lawfully conducted in a State or Territory of the Commonwealth may also be sold in dethe ACT. Conditions incorporated in the State legislation apply in the ACT. On-course bookmakers may conduct bookmaking operations at licensed racecourses in the ACT. No minimum return on money invested is prescribed.

Territory Returned Prisoners of War (Question No. 6124) (Question No. 6129) Mr Ewen Cameron asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 15 May 1980: (1) Will the Government examine the adoption of rates of payment of pensions to returned prisoners of war equivalent to those paid by the Canadian Government, that is, (a) European theatre, $29.59 per week and (b) Japanese theatre, $73.97 per week. (2) Will the Government also examine making medical claims by returned prisoners of war automatic, particularly from Japanese prison camps, instead of insisting on medical reviews. of invested money returned in (3) Were reports requested by his Department from doctors and camp commandments who returned from Japanese prisoner of war camps; if so, (a) what has happened to these con- reports and (b) are they still available to his Department in assisting in medical reviews. Prize money Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable proportion member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The basis of the Repatriation system has always per cent been to give compensation and medical treatment to veterans 84.5 for disabilities accepted as being related to service, regardless 62.5 of where and under what conditions they served. The Govern87.0 ment is aware of the systems referred to but is not considering 60.0 paying special pensions to former prisoners of war as it is not 37.0 in favour of making special pension provisions for a particular group. The Government has recognised the hardships and deprivations suffered by this group and has extended to them the provision of full free medical and hospital benefits in addition to paying compensation in the form of pensions and medical treatment for any disabilities which the prisoners of war can relate to their service. (3) Such reports were not specifically requested. Each claim for pension or benefits is individually investigated and reports from any relevant source are obtained. All medical reports available from prisoner of war camps in respect of individuals are linked on the individual which is available to the independent authorities which determine entitlement and assessment matters. In addition much general information from former and is retained in libraries in each State ment of Veterans' Affairs.

Entry Visas to Spain Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 20 May 1980: (1) Are tourists holding Australian passports required to obtain an entry visa to Spain before entering that country. (2) Has this condition applied (a) when was the condition imposed, (b) for what reasons was it imposed and (c) did the Government object to the change in visa requirements.

(6) Are Spanish tourists wishing meet any conditions of entry not also required of other continental Europeans. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (b) & (c) see answer to (e). (d) This information is normally regarded as commercially confidential. It is therefore inappropriate to make it available. (e) Under the provisions of the Australian Shipping Commission Act, the Line is not required to seek my approval to dry-dock its ships unless expenditure on individual contracts is in excess of $500,000. The Line has, however, provided the following information: Dates of Port of docking docking Reason 16.1.79-22.1.79 Kobe Australian yards declined to tender 27.1.79-7.2.79 Singapore Guarantee docking, major engine modification 28.1.79-13.2.79 Kobe Australian yards declined to tender 7.2.79-15.2.79 Gothenburg Docked at builders yard before commissioning 22.2.79-23.2.79 Hamburg Too large for Australian docks 18.3.79-27.3.79 Singapore Too large for Australian docks 27.4.79-14.5.79 Bremen Australian yards declined to tender 5.7.79-23.7.79 Bremen Australian yards declined to tender 6.8.79-22.8.79 Victoria (BC) Australian yards declined. to tender (2) No. In 1961 Australia entered into an agreement with Spain which provided for Australian citizens to enter Spain without the need to hold a visa.

(c) as the agreement was not reciprocal in that holders of Spanish passports were required to hold visas for entry to Australia there was no basis for an objection. (Question No. 6149) (3) I have no information about any recent changes to Spanish entry requirements for citizens of Britain, Canada, United States of America and New Zealand.

It is therefore heavily dependent on its visa system to ensure that the presence in Australia of people admitted as visitors will be consistent with the national interest. with Spanish authorities Australia's geographic remoteness also raises a problem not shared by the countries of Western Europe. Any person arriving in Australia and being refused entry, must then travel a long distance at considerable cost to enter another country. to visit Australia obliged to The issue of visitor visas at our points of entry would not, therefore, be a practicable proposition for Australia. The Australian Government does not intend at present to waive the visitor visa requirement which is seen as an integral part of Australia's immigration control procedures. As reciprocity cannot be offered there would be no basis to negotiate with Spain in the manner referred to by the honourable member. (6) Spanish tourists wishing to visit Australia are not obliged to meet any conditions of entry not also required of other Western European tourists.

Western Medical Services Pty Ltd",465
294,Mr LES JOHNSON,CSIRO,"the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 20 May 1980: In interpreting the figures, it should be noted that changes to the Medical Benefits Scheme over the years shown in the table affect the number of services that attract medical benefits and the persons covered by the Schemes. For example, in respect of these items particularly, statistics for 1973-74 and 1974-75 are not directly comparable with those for later years. Prior to the introduction of Medibank in July 1975, a separate Pensioner Medical Service Scheme existed from which payments were made to participating doctors for services rendered to eligible Under Medibank (from 1 July 1975), such services were included in the Medical Benefits Scheme and hence in the above statistics. (2) The Health Insurance Act 1973, in common.with some other Commonwealth legislation, contains a provision relating to confidentiality of information obtained in the carrying out of functions under the legislation. Under this provision, it is an offence for an officer formation about the affairs of another person. The exemptions from this provision specified in the Act do not appear to apply in respect of the information sought by the honourable member in relation to the Western Medical Services Pty Ltd at Sydney, New South Wales It is not proposed, therefore, to make the information requested available. Taxation: Life Assurance Companies Mr Short asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 May 1980: (1) Are companies transacting life assurance business subject to income tax and friendly societies transacting this business exempt from tax; if so, why. (2) Are co-operative companies transacting not less than 90 per cent of their business with their own members exempt from Tax under Division 9 of the Income Tax Assessment (1) What was the (a) total number and (b) national average of claims received in relation to (i) item 59 and (ii) item 53 of the medical benefits fees schedule in each year since 1973. (2) Were claims received in relation to (a) item 59 and (b) item 53 for services provided through or by Western Medical services Pty Ltd of Sydney, New South Wales; if so, how many. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) It is estimated that the number of benefit (Question No. 6159) claims and the average number of claims per 1,000 persons covered in relation to items 53 and 59 of the Medical Benefits Schedule in each year since 1973 (for which statistics are available) are as follows: Item 53 Item 59 Services per Services per Number 1,000 persons Number 1,000 persons Year of services covered of services covered - ooo - ooo 1973-74 . . 328 31 11 1 1974-75 . . 421 40 19 .2 1975-76 . . 859 62 107 8 1976-77 Statistics not readily available 1977-78 . . 690 48 102 7 1978* . . . . 697 48 115 8 - Calendar year 1978 Act; if so, why is this principle not applied in the case of life assurance companies.

(4) What (a) is the annual amount of tax currently collected from life assurance companies in Australia (other than in respect of shareholders' funds) and (b) sum would be collected by the introduction of the same principles as now govern the taxation of net gains by individuals.",466
295,Mr HOWARD,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: to communicate to any person in(1) Companies transacting life assurance business are subject to income tax. Friendly societies, whether or not they transact such business, are exempt from tax provided they do not function for the purposes of profit or gain to their individual members and provided they are not friendly society dispensaries. Special provisions governing the basis of assessment of tax payable by life assurance companies and provisions exempting the income of friendly societies from tax have been in the income tax law for over 60 years and, apart (Question No. 6161) from some amendments concerning the basis of assessment for life assurance companies, successive Governments have considered them to be appropriate, in view of the special nature of these types of organisation. (2) Companies which are co-operative companies are not exempt from income tax, whether they transact more or less than 90 per cent of their business with their own members. However, special provisions apply for the assessment of tax payable by companies which are co-operative companies as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act. A company is deemed not to be a co-operative company for income tax purposes in any income year in which less than 90 per cent of its business is with its own members. (3) (i) The bases used differ A life assurance company vestment income relating to superannuation business; A life assurance company is allowed a special deduction under section 115 of the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1 per cent of'calculated liabilities'; A resident life assurance company is eligible for the section 46 rebate on intercompany dividends which it receives; Profits made by a life assurance company on resale of investments are assessable. Profits which an individual makes on resale of investments may or may not be assessable, depending on the facts of the situation. If the individual a business of buying and selling the investments in question, the profits are.of an income nature in accordance with the general principles of the income tax law. Where section 26 (a) or section 26AAA applies, the profits are also of an income nature and are, accordingly, subject to tax. In other cases such profits may be of a capital nature in which case they are not taxed; and Expenses, such as agent's commission, incurred by a life assurance in gaining premiums (which are not assessable) are not deductible. General management expenses which are not exclusively incurred in gaining either exempt or assessable income, and are not of a capital nature, are divided proportionately between exempt and assessable income, and the latter part is deductible along with the expenses incurred exclusively in gaining assessable income. (ii) The exemption of income of superannuation business puts that part of the life assurance company's income on a basis similar to that of separately constituted superannuation funds which are exempt under sections 23F, 23 (ja) or 23 (jaa); The section 115 deduction from tax a part of the company's assessable income set aside as necessary reserves to meet contractual obligations to policy-holders. Following the questioning of that basis for the deduction, it was reduced in 1973 and 1974 to its present level of I per cent from a former level of 3 per cent; The section 46 rebate is allowed to all companies although the arguments for its extension to life assurance companies are more complex; The treatment of profits on resale of investments depends on whether they are of an income or a capital nature. When received by a life insurance company in the course of its business they are of an income nature; The treatment of expenses depends on whether or not they are incurred in producing assessable income. (4) (a) Tax collected from or payable by life assurance companies other than in respect of shareholders' funds is not recorded separately. However, the total tax payable by companies included in the industry classification that relates to life assurance for the 1977-78 income year was $93.9m. (b) From income tax statistics for the 1976-77 income year it is estimated that life assurance companies' taxable income, increased by the amount of the special deductions allowed under section 115 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and by a component representing expenses referable to exempt superannuation business, would have been $334m. The tax payable on this adjusted taxable income at the standard rate of 32 per cent applicable to individuals S107m; if, as seems probable, the average marginal rate of the individual taxpayers whose funds are involved in the production of the income of life assurance companies were higher than the 32 per cent standard rate, this amount would have been commensurately greater. The net tax actually assessed to life insurance companies in respect of the 1976-77 income year was $79.3m. in the following respects: Road Funding Report is exempt from tax on the in(Question No. 6162) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 21 May 1980: (1) Was a report concerning approved road funding programs for the financial years 1974-75 to 1979-80 recently made available to the Launceston City Council, Tasmania, by the Minister for Productivity; if so, was the report prepared by the Department of Transport.

296,Mr HUNT,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My office recently provided information prepared in my Department to the Minister for Productivity regarding approved road programs for Tasmania for 1974-75 to 1979-80, and he may subsequently have made the information available to the Launceston City Council. This information was extracted from details included in annual road programs submitted by Tasmanian Ministers for Main Roads and Transport.

(2) Has his attention been drawn to reports that the introduction of legislation of this kind in the United Kingdom and the United States of America led to a spree of buying small seed companies by non-seed trans-national corporations. (3) Is there any substance in statements that the introduction of legislation of this kind would (a) lead to the concentration of seed production and marketing by a few transnational corporations and (b) increase the costs of seeds. (4) Would any benefits flow from legislation of this kind; if so, what are they. (5) Do (a) the existence of plant collections such as those of the (i) New South Wales Department of Agriculture and (ii) Australian Wheat Board collection and (b) current considerations of the Australian Agricultural Council for the establishment of plant genetic resource centres indicate that governments in Australia are aware of the danger in having all varieties of species on a narrow genetic base. would have been approximately (6) Does this attitude conflict with the reported intent of the legislation referred to in part (1). (7) Has his attention been drawn to a recently reported statement by Sir John Crawford warning that scientific effort and its technological application are frustrated unless a great complex of policy issues are attended to and the point is clearest and perhaps more complex in agriculture as agricultural research is not frustrated by patents. (8) Has the cost of regulating a system of plant variety rights been considered. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Legislation is being drafted to introduce a Plant Variety Rights Scheme into Australia. The proposals for such a scheme were put to the Government several years ago and since then there has been close examination of all aspects of plant variety rights by experts from all State Governments, the CSIRO and rural industry organisations. These organisations, the Australian Nurserymen's Association, the Australian Seed Industry Association and the Australian Seed Producers' Association, whose members include small business and farming interests, have thoroughly investigated the operation of similar schemes in overseas countries. They are of the firm opinion that a Plant Variety Rights Scheme would be of benefit to their industries and members. (2) I am aware that a number of such allegations have been made. Most of these were printed in a book by P. A. Mooney entitled 'Seeds of the Earth' but I have not been able to obtain any other substantiating evidence. Take-overs of-commercial firms by other firms are not confined to the Seed industry but are common practice in most avenues of commercial endeavour. It is most unlikely that take-overs would be initiated by Plant Variety Rights legislation. (3) None that I have been able to substantiate. Evidence indicates that there has been an firms in the plant breeding business. For example of the 25 firms breeding soy beans in the USA only one such firm has been operating for more than 12 years. (4) Yes. The Australian Agricultural Council has examined the whole question and recommended that the Government should introduce legislation to Scheme in Australia. It was convinced that it would be of benefit to Australian agriculture and would encourage plant breeding by individuals, commercial firms, and publicly funded organisations. It would lead to the development of new improved plant varieties and allow Australia access to improved varieties from other countries which are presently denied to us. Small business firms and individual breeders would be in a better position to compete on more equal terms with large Department/Authority Aboriginal Affairs Administrative Services . . . Australian Electoral Office . . Australian Federal Police (4) Attorney-General's Security Appeals Tribunal (4) Family Court of Australia . . Federal Court and A AT/ARC High Court (4) Human Rights Commission (3)(4) Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Office of Parliamentary Counsel Business and Consumer Affairs companies as the capital invested in developing new and improved varieties would be protected. It is only equitable that they should be able to recoup their expenditures of time, skills and funds. At present they have no such protection and the results of their enterprise can be pirated at will. (5) Australia, together with many other countries, has important collections of plant genetic material. Such collections provide basic material for plant breeding. Consideration is being given to expanding these collections as plant breeding is of great importance to Australia and its rural industries. The maintenance of plant genetic resource material is a separate issue to the granting of proprietary rights over new plant varieties. It should not be confused with the objectives of a plant variety rights scheme which is related to identification registration and ownership of new and distinct varieties. (6) No. (7) I have read the statement by Sir John Crawford in his summary of the Workshop discussions relating to Science and Technology-For What Purpose? in April 1979, and I am in agreement with it. There is certainly a need for realistic policies and positive action to ensure that the results of research are available and adopted. It is true also that generally, agricultural research is not frustrated by patents. However many technical developments resulting from research efforts have been patented. Plant variety rights, or patents on new plant varieties, do not frustrate research as has been demonstrated in the many countries including the USA, the UK, New Zealand and in Europe, that have operated plant variety rights schemes over many years.

(2) The Commonwealth Film Censorship Board is established and operates under the provisions of the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations which have been made under section SO of the Customs Act 1901, which is a valid exercise of the power of the Parliament under section SI (i) of the Constitution to make laws with respect to trade and commerce with other countries. (3) Yes. (4) The Board screens all films imported into Australia and the members of the Board, by a majority decision, decide whether the film should be registered for exhibition in the light of prevailing community standards and having regard to the provisions of regulation 13 of the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations.

South African Homelands Mr Holding asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 22 May 1980: (1) Has Chief Gatza Buthelezi of South Africa been issued with any travel documents by the Australian Government to allow him to enter Australia for the purpose of attending the Second World Wilderness Conference in Cairns, Queensland, in June 1980; if so (a) what type of travel documents were issued and (b) for what period were they issued. (2) Does the Government's foreign policy extend to the recognition of the South African homelands; if so, why.  member's question is as follows: (1) Chief Gatza Buthelezi did not apply to enter Australia to attend the Second World Wilderness Congress. (2) Australia, along with the rest of the international munity, has not recognised the 'homelands' created by the South African Government (to date, those declared 'independent' are Transkei, Venda and Bophuthatswana). The Government believes that to grant recognition to the 'homelands' would be to condone the apartheid system and to accord it an unjustified respectability. The rejection by the majority of the homeland leaders themselves of the policy strengthens our view that the grant of nominal independence to the homelands will not meet the political aspirations of black people of South Africa.

Pay Parking at Canberra Airport Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, mental upon notice, on 22 May 1980: (1) Did the 1977-78 Annual Report of his Department advise that pay parking at Canberra airport, Australian Capiconcessionaire tal Territory, was to be introduced in 1978-79; if so, why was the introduction of pay parking there delayed 1980. (2) Were the only major administrative problems involved the (a) purchase of parking voucher dispensing machines and (b) declaration of the parking areas as pay parking areas. (3) Is the long-term parking area situated on the other side of the access road from the terminal areas to remain free while other airports similar parking areas at a greater distance from the terminal area; if so, why. (4) Is the supervision of the pay parking area to be perfor1979 med by traffic officers of his overall duties, or is there to be a continuous patrol of the pay parking area. (5) Did the Business and Property Section of his Department and/or the Bureau of Transport Economics examine the economic feasibility of going to public tender to operate the pay parking concession by private enterprise; if so, what were the criteria by which the Department decided to use its own traffic officers. (6) If Departmental Traffic Officers are to operate pay parking at Canberra Airport, does this herald a change in Government policy in that in future all pay parking areas on Commonwealth airports will be operated by Departmental Traffic Officers.",473
303,Mr HUNT,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The reference ing at Canberra airport in the 1977-78 Annual Report of the Department of Transport was based on approval in principle in June 1978 of a boom gate control system to be operated by a private concessionaire. Subsequent investigation disclosed that the system . proposed would not be viable at Canberra airport and an alternative control system utilising either parking meters or voucher dispensing machines was decided upon. Study of these alternatives was suspended early in 1979 because of the implications of plans to re-develop and expand the terminal building and car parking areas at Canberra airport. Consideration of pay parking was resumed later in 1979. In view of the need to preserve was decided that control of pay parking should be by voucher dispensing machines supervised by departmental officers. As such a system had not previously been utilised at Australian airports, a number of legal questions concerning the provisions of the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act 1960 had to be resolved before the plan could be implemented. Tenders were called in September 1979, and orders for three machines were placed in February 1980; the machines were delivered on 21 April 1980. (3) The primary objective in introducing pay parking at airport, pending a decision on future terminal requirements, was to reduce traffic congestion in the terminal forecourt area. It was decided that the cost of work necessary provide appropriate facilities on the southern side of Ulinga and Place would not be justified at this stage. Declaration of the areas as pay parking areas is not a major administrative problem. (4) Supervision of the parking area will be effected on the same basis as that employed at other airports where parking is (Question No. 6204) controlled by meters,'and it is being undertaken by departtraffic officers as part of their normal duties. (5) The major reasons for adopting the present system were the Department's inability to guarantee a fixed tenure to a over the terminal forecourt area, and traffic flow problems associated with the installation of a boom gate until 16 June control system in that area. (6) No. Government Expenditure at Airports (Question No. 6206) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, at Canberra airport upon notice, on 22 May 1980: within Australia charge for What was total Government expenditure at each of Australia's (a) international and (b) domestic airports in (i) each year from 1975-76 to 1978-79 and (ii) the period 1 July to the date of preparation of the answer to this question.

Advice on the legal implications for motorcyclists and other motorists of the above provisions was sought and obtained by ACRUPTC from the State and Territory constituent bodies (Question No. 6207) of the Law Council of Australia; and by the Office of Road on behalf of ACRUPTC, from the Highway Safety Research Centre at the University of North Carolina, that State having had legislation requiring motorcyclists to use Service their headlights in daytime since 1973. The general consensus of the legal profession in Australia is that non-compliance with a traffic provision does not autoby matically become evidence of contributory negligence, the to question of which ought to be left to the courts. Moreover, 2 ACRUPTC received legal opinion that in a situation where a 1 motorcyclist is suing for damages and the other party raises contributory negligence by the motorcyclist in failing to have his headlights illuminated, the onus of proving that the motorwas guilty of contributory negligence rests on that other party to prove that, for whatever reason, the motorcycthrough the list was guilty of contributory negligence. So far as the situation in the United States is concerned, the Highway Safety Research Centre reported that the issue had never been raised in regard to the North Carolina legislation. Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd (Question No. 6208) (Question No. 6210) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 22 May 1980: (1) Do the provisions of the Airline Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Act require Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Proprietary Limited to lodge separate financial statements each year for its airline sections.

309,Mr HUNT,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"The answer to the honourable cessor member's question is as follows: (1) Ex gratia payments were approved in favour of certain airlines in respect of rentals 1975 to 20 February 1976 inclusive for space occupied by them in Sydney and Melbourne International Terminal Secretaries buildings. (2) (a) and (b) The amounts of ex gratia payments made respect of the Sydney and Melbourne International Terminal buildings were as follows: (a)Airline Qantas KLM Canadian Pacific Alitalia Japan Airlines Philippine Airlines Lufthansa (a)Airline (b) Amount to lodge separate financial stateS 62,169 Air India . 5,193 UTA 21,812 Ansett 15,206 (Question No. 6211) (2) (c) In 1973 the imposition of revised rents for space ocby certain airlines in the Sydney and Melbourne International Terminal buildings was deferred pending a review of the method of assessing rental rates. The airlines agreed to this to Parliament of the 1978-79 action. Following this review, new rental rates were imposed with effect from 1 March 1975. Although some airlines paid the higher charges, some of them challenged the Sydney charges Airin the New South Wales Supreme Court, Equity Division. On 20 February 1976 the Court held the rents had been invalidly annual report for TAA is imposed. However the Court, and subsequently, on 5 May 1977, the AirCourt of Appeal, New South Wales Supreme Court, held that the Commonwealth was not legally obliged to refund the rentals paid by the airlines during the period. During the litigation the then Minister for Transport met with International Air Transport Association delegations from time to time. He undertook to review the rental situation when, amongst other things, the Court cases were decided and the legal rights of the parties had been clarified. This undertaking was honoured. On review it was decided an ex gratia payment should be made to all airlines inAirport Terminals volved equivalent to the difference between the rents invalidly imposed and the rents that should have been paid by the air(Question No. 6212) lines for the period. The allocation to airline lessees included notional ex gratia credits to TAA ($56,229) and Pan American ($86,042). Those companies did not pay at the increased rates from 1 International Air March 1975. Department of Transport Staff: Transfers to Canberra (Question No. 6214) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, what sum did each airline reupon notice, on 22 May 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the reply of his predeto Question No. 1063 (Hansard, 18 August 1977, page 505) concerning the refusal of certain staff of his Department to accept transfers from Melbourne, Victoria to Canberra, charged for the period 1 March ACT. (2) Have (a) the First Assistant Secretary, two Assistant and other senior staff in the International Relations Division of his Department refused the transfer, (b) in in the Air Transport Policy Division, the First Assistant Secretary, two Assistant Secretaries and other senior staff refused the transfer, (c) no officers in the Economic Policy Licensing Section remained employed in the section from those who transferred and (d) now only one junior officer remained in (b) Amount the Business and Property Section of the Finance and Commercial Division of those who made the transfer. $ (3) Is it a fact that the replacement of senior, experienced 874,391 officers with officers lacking in aviation administration experi10,285 ence has (a) created crises and (b) created utter confusion in 10,655 the implementation of the recommendations of domestic and 40,521 international aviation reviews. 14,718 8,441 Mr HUNT - The answer to the honourable 17,388 member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) (a) Yes. (b) In the Air Transport Policy Division the First Assistant-Secretary and one Assistant Secretary refused the transfer. The other Assistant Secretary accepted an overseas position. No other senior staff in the Air Transport Policy Division refused the transfer. (c) The Air Transport Policy Division was reorganised and substantially enlarged in early 1979. As a result of this and subsequent staff movements within the Division none of the officers who transferred with the former Economic Policy and Licensing Branch are currently located in its successor unit, the Economic Policy and Investment Planning Branch. (d) Yes. (3) These staff movements occurred over three years ago. The Air Transport Policy and International Policy Divisions have been substantially restructured and enlarged over the past two years and organisationally do not now greatly resemble the units transferred to Canberra in 1976-77. There is no evidence to suggest that replacement of staff who elected not to transfer to Canberra has (a) created crises or (b) created utter confusion in the implementation of the recommendations of domestic and international aviation reviews. Australian Federal Police Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 22 May 1980: (1) Do regulations under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 on the (a) competence and (b) qualifications for appointments to the ranks in the Australian Federal Police limit the ranks to Australian citizens except where Regulation S applies. (2) If so, why is a distinction British citizens when this distinction is not made for entry into the Australian Public Service. (3) Are a large number of members of the force British citizens. Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) For new entrants, yes. Regulation S was recently amended, however, to remove any citizenship barrier that might disadvantage persons who were members of either the Commonwealth or ACT Police Forces prior to the commencement date of the Australian Federal Police on 19 October 1979. (2) The requirement for new entrants to membership of the Australian Federal Police to have Australian citizenship is in line with the citizenship requirement police forces, namely the Victoria Police and the New South Wales Police. (3) I am informed that there are some members of the Australian Federal Police who have not taken out Australian citizenship in addition to their British citizenship but the number is not large. Aboriginal Voting Rights Mr West asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 22 May 1980: (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports of a provision in the Electoral Act of Western Australia, as amended in February 1980, which provides that a person shall not persuade or induce, or associate with any other person in persuading or inducing an elector to make application for a postal vote(s.9S-(3S)(l)). ((2) Is the Australian Electoral Office currently conducting a campaign to educate Aboriginal people about Australia's Parliamentary and electoral systems. (3) Has his attention been drawn to reports (a) that several community advisers in the Kimberley area, WA, who have been involved in a program of electoral education for Aborigines, have had over 100 charges laid against them with regard to the recent Western Australian elections and (b) that an electoral education officer, employed by the Australian Electoral Office advising members of an Aboriginal community that they should cast a postal vote if they cannot get to a ballot box, would be breaking the State law and subject to prosecution. (4) Is the Electoral Act of Western Australia depriving Aboriginals of their full voting rights; if so, does the Australian Electoral Office have plans to overcome the situation created by the Western Australian Act, and if so, what are the plans. Mr John MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ' (l)Yes. (2) Yes. (3) (a) Yes. It should be noted that the several community advisers referred to have no official involvement in the (Question No. 6216) program referred to in (2). (3) (b) No. The Aboriginal Electoral Education Team operates under a program that has been set up by the Commonwealth in collaboration with the Western Australian Government and in the case of postal voting limits instruction to an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a postal vote. (4) As this question is clearly argumentative, I have no wish to comment. made between Australian and Aboriginal Health Programs (Question No. 6219) Mr West asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 22 May 1980: (1) Does the Program Effectiveness Review of Aboriginal Health Programs recommend that State Government Aboriginal health programs continue, despite a lack of evidence concerning their effectiveness. (2) Is there any substance in reports that the Review had no references to and subsequently made no recommendations concerning Aboriginal medical services despite evidence of their effectiveness in reaching the community and reducing expensive hospitalisation and other medical procedures. of the two largest State (3) Is it a fact that, since the establishment of the Durri Aboriginal Medical Service in Kempsey, NSW, in 1977, the number of Aboriginal children admitted to hospital in the area has been reduced by 33 per cent and the number of bed days reduced by 46 per cent at an estimated saving of more than SI 10,000. (4) Did the Program Effectiveness Review team visit Kempsey or other regions which have Aboriginal medical services; if not, why not. (Question No. 6218) (5) Will the allocation of funds for Aboriginal health programs be reconsidered on the evidence of the effectiveness of Aboriginal-controlled community based health centres.",475
310,Mr VINER,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The recommendations of the Program Effectiveness Review, which cover the whole range of Aboriginal health programs, are before the Government for consideration and it is not appropriate for me to make detailed comment at this time. (2) , (4) and (5) See answer to (1) above. (3) A study of Kempsey District Hospital records for the period 1 August to 31 October, for the years 1974 to 1979 clusive, was conducted by Dr R. Copeman Medical Journal of Australia Special Supplement 1980. It revealed a 33 per cent decrease in the number of Aboriginal children admitted to the hospital and a 46 per cent decrease the number of 'bed clays' due to Aboriginal child admissions. The establishment of the Durri Aboriginal Medical Service Kempsey in 1977 is considered this decrease. I have not seen estimates of the resultant cost savings.",476
