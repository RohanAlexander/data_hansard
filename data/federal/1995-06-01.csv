1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Jenkins) DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995  That the bill be now read a second time.,113
2,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown," Mr Amendment Bill could be described as an omnibus of pieces of legislation which affect the Australian Australian defence forces. It must be well primary interest in defence stems from the the federal electoral division of MCEwen. In fact, there are a number of people in during the conduct of the biannual exercise conjunction with the Royal Australian Air Force, and members of the Australian parliament the those who were not there may I suggest that again conducts El Alamein they make themselves by the Army to attend that particular activity. Whilst I support this legislation there One such matter is in the area of discipline and member of the police force and a former practising of the Defence Force have fewer rights in the people who are subjected to quasi or criminal I suppose that is common in defence forces historical reasons for it. Members of the always been subject to on-the-spot discipline allowed access to normal legal rights in terms in the community would have. However, it is an improvement in the nature of military discipline personnel are brought before senior officers, matters heard. One of the things I have a concern about allow a person to be charged for failing to sample-on the order of a senior officer. Obviously, to exercise a degree of drug control. It would is subject to the same problems as the rest use the product of the Cannabis sativa I am the first to agree that I would not like under the influence of any drug, be it alcohol understand that it would be appropriate and MAIN COMMITTEE MC 929 Thursday, 1 June 1995 took the chair at 10.00 a.m. Second Reading Deputy Speaker, the Defence Legislation bill in the sense that it amends a number Defence Force and the organisation of the known to many members in this House that my fact that the Puckapunyal army base lies within this House today who were recently at Puckapunyal known as El Alamein where the Army, in showed trainees and foreign representatives operation of particular types of weapons. For in two years time when the Australian Army aware of that fact and seek to be invited are some matters which do cause me some concern. it arises from the fact that I am both a former lawyer. I have often thought that members disciplinary area than ordinary civilians or other law or other disciplinary type proceedings. around the world and I suppose there are strong Defence Force-Navy, Army or Air Force-have by senior officers, yet they have not always been of these charges that you and I or other people true to say that over the years there has been and in the nature of how Defence Force boards of review and court martials to have in this legislation is the amendment which will provide a body specimen-most commonly a urine the main purpose of this amendment is surprise no-one to hear that the Defence Force of society in that many of the young people there plant, marijuana, and smoke it. to be out on a live firing range with a person or the Cannabis sativa THC component. I can proper for reasonable action to take place to NA MC 930 MAIN COMMITTEE prevent people from engaging in such activities particularly the sort we have today. However, legislation on when or where an officer can say, 'I want a urine specimen here and now.' next to me quite rightly has pointed out that and it was neglectful of me not to point that out. Nevertheless, the person might be in custody taking offence and it seems to me that that person on whom the order is made has been just simply in custody for another purpose. There and yet, once the person is in custody, the legislation to provide a urine sample which could lead to original custody. So I do express some concern defence force organisation would want to affect performance in the handling of ammunition disciplined or, hopefully, counselled in I must say that having seen, at the EI Alamein its lOS-millimetre cannon, impact shells, high and the machine-guns it also lets loose with, of those vehicles who had a view of the world fully concur with the need to do something about tighter control in the legislation to restrict sample to areas where there is an allegation, There are some other matters which also legislation does improve the discipline capacity of the more rigid procedures that have been appointment of what will be known as 'discipline be appointed to take on the role and the powers procedures against people allegedly in breach law. There seems to be nothing in the legislation has to have any particular qualification or any Army, when the cadets go through officer training defence law and to act as a disciplinary person, a tradition in the Army, certainly, for a number private myself, in the CMF days, discipline ",113

So I must be nice to think that a discipline officer has, Thursday, 1 June 1995 if they are involved with live ammunition, it seems to me that there is no limitation in the approach another person in the Defence Force and Frankly, that worries me, although the minister it does provide that the person must be in custody, for a matter which is not relevant to a drugpower should be limited to allegations that the involved with a drug-taking offence and is not could be, for example, an allegation of theft, appears to allow for an order to be made other charges not related to the reason for the on that, though fully understanding that any make sure that people who use drugs which can are properly protected and properly the use of such drugs in such circumstances. exercises, what a Leopard tank will do with explosives shells and the rest of its armaments, I would hate to think of any person sitting in one affected by alcohol or other drugs. So I can it. But I really think there should be a bit the capacity to seek an order to provide a urine at least, of drug involvement. give me some degree of concern. Whilst this of the Defence Force and loosens up some there in the past, there is a provision for the officers.' The discipline officer will basically of the commanding officer to hear disciplinary of defence or army law or other Defence Force which would say that the disciplinary officer particular training. I know that, certainly in the they are, in fact, trained in all aspects of particularly with other ranks. That has been of years. As I know from when I was a young was instant and by a senior officer. However, it is unarguable that this is a Army than what it was. Nevertheless, it seems officers--officers who are going to be called role in hearing summary matters, not court should at least have some degree of specialised add that that tends to worry me a bit. It would in fact, been given some specific training and, NA Thursday, 1 June 1995 when acting in the role of a discipline officer, respond accordingly at any hearing that takes place. The establishment of infringement notices taken a long while for the Defence Force Australia. But it is good to see that there is gives the person to whom the notice has been provided for in that notice-which, as civilians, example-or to seek a hearing I can tell those who do not know that the are certainly very assiduous in enforcing speed quite narrow: 20 or 40 kilometres per hour and particularly where the army personnel live. areas at Puckapunyal, for example, from memory kilometres per hour speed limit. I can say without assiduous in ensuring that people do not speed the capacity of the Australian Defence Force to deal with them. I think the minister would would be a good budgetary proposal. In my experience, since infringement notices seem to get issued at twice the rate that Certainly, the Victoria Police gains 20 per money it raises from infringement notices Victoria.

The speed restrictions are in most of the areas where the establishments are Where the married quarters are in the housing there is a 20 kilometres per hour and a 40 question that the military police there are past those areas.

Middle Head-the last unspoiled headlands terribly different today from what they were These headlands are, if you like, the sacred of the determination of modem Australia harmony with our environment. The idea that should sail down our harbour and, instead or less in its natural condition, should see Head and a Mirage on Balmoral is absolutely be contemplated by the minister's Finally, we come to the operational concern. configured in such a way as to maximise their that moving these bases away from North by better running of the defence forces as bottom line.

I tum now to the particular case of the school the announcement by the Minister for Defence that the school of artillery is to move from Notwithstanding the many goods works Puckapunyal is in fact the least favourite Mr Bevis-The North Shore is much more popular!",115
7,Mr ABBOTT,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"It is much better represented of the Army's magazine ranked various bases Puckapunyal was motherless last. It is, if you Siberia. The rationale for shifting the school range, and I accept the logic of that. The problem Puckapunyal will put it next to a firing range, fire! If a battery of guns were to be moved school of artillery there, that would effectively school of artillery would have gone from 100 personnel, if a battery were permanently Obviously, shifting the school of artillery business. It could be $10 million or $15 many millions will be involved, the problem has just been spent at North Head to refurbish army's maritime school, which is going to move which, I concede, seems to make more on it. So here we have bases that have just that are about to be closed down. This strikes Thursday, 1 June 1995 me a number of concerns. First, there is the million in wages every year into the economy of is inconceivable that any alternative source of We are talking about-in North Head and on Sydney Harbour. These headlands are not so when Captain Cook sailed past 225 years ago. sites of modem Australia and potentially a symbol to live, as best modem men and women can, in visitors coming to Sydney for the 2000 Olympics of seeing the bushland on those headlands more the glaring neon signs for a Club Med on North appalling. Yet that is exactly what seemed to answer to my question on notice. Obviously, the defence forces have got to be operational efficiency, but it seems quite clear Head and Middle Head is motivated not so much by the government's need to improve its budget that, if all of that land were sold on the of artillery on North Head. In the wake of that those bases were to move, he confirmed North Head to Puckapunyal within five years. of the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), destination of Australia's service personnel. in parliament, I suppose. But a recent issue in terms ,of their desirability as locations, and like, the defence equivalent of being sent to of artillery is that it needs to be next to a firing is that moving the school of artillery to but it is a firing range that lacks any guns to permanently to Puckapunyal to justify putting the double the size of the school of artillery. The or so personnel, as it is now, to 200 or so based at Puckapunyal to justify this shift. to Puckapunyal is going to be an expensive million: who knows how many millions? However is going to be compounded because $2 million the school of artillery. Not only that, but the be moved from Chowder Bay up to Townsville-a operational sense-has just had $6 million spent been refurbished at very considerable expense and me as a most serious logistical bungle, in the NA Thursday, 1 June 1995 great traditions of the Crimea. And, of course, the great tradition of the government's woodchip decision. Let me assure this House that the people the military there, if at all possible. And they further development on those headlands. In meetings-one of 300 people at Manly about Mosman about a week ago-have made it absolutely development on North Head and Middle Head military there. If the military goes, the government will pot of gold at the end of its budgetary rainbow because, to sell land, you have got to give potential is no way that any responsible government jewels that these headlands are would allow land to be sold for the sort of price that If the military moves, the reality will Australian taxpayer will needlessly spend tens effect, become military ghost towns. If the developers do try to put Club Meds or Skase ruckus that will make the Franklin Dam fight look tame. I appeal to the government to see sense on bases and, in particular, to rethink the decision South Wales Premier, Mr Bob Carr, has made government, I appeal to him to show that he wants and to show that his concern for the harbour Island. Lest anyone think this is a matter which the other day I received a petition which was in the Labor heartland are just as concerned the Liberal heartland. This issue unites people have had at public meetings in my electorate the Labor Party here in this place; Peter MACDonald, Doug Sutherland, the former Labor Lord Mayor of the National Trust of Australia.

The wool industry is one of the few industries difference in a relatively short period of time It is interesting to note that only one, so far that the improved performance of the wool industry from being even worse than it has been in recent and point out that what it says is quite true. We in this place need to remember that some still derived essentially from the efforts and regional Australia. In fact, despite the quite well-being, their efforts are often under-acknowledged, but in terms of the policy settings of this optimism about the future prospect for Australia's industry is not as important as it used to be-it of gross domestic product and about 25 per cent very important factors. For one thing, the reason that export earnings might otherwise be is that commodity prices are MC949 that information, or a copy of or an extract Wool Research and Promotion Organisation to meet outside Australia.

If there is a difference the amount actually spent on research, should following year-the carry over, if you like, on we express our satisfaction with that position. I want to make. We have seen-and it is a say to the previous minister for primary industry, and Training (Mr Crean)-the substantial This is an enormous relief to Australians, or they pay very little attention to Australia's I suspect that many of them would take the view, in a sense ride on the sheep's back, the fact of a major export industry with enormous capacity that has the capacity to make a significant to Australia's crippling export deficit problem. as I am aware, major media outlet has recorded has prevented the current account deficit months. I commend that media organisation two-thirds of Australia's export earnings are the production of those who live in rural and heroic contribution they make to the nation's not only in terms of public perceptions government. I want to place on record my basic rural industries. It is often said that primary contributes only about four or five per cent of our export earnings. That overlooks several in many ways are at lower levels than they at low levels. As I will indicate in a moment, NA MC 950 MAIN COMMITTEE that is about to change. I think you will find greater contribution to make to Another thing is one often not recognised manufacturing performance and the greater performance our manufacturing sector makes. That is usually understand that the major manufacturing sector In other words, the major manufacturing sector provide it with the raw materials that it thousands of Australians. There are some very different views emerging and for derived value added product. In brief, World Bank, which has recently put together become so flexible in its production of agricultural is unlikely that there will be any substantial commodities over the next few decades. The develop in one aspect of the world's grain supplies, substitutes found for that shortfall in such particular push on prices such as there normally a gloomy outlook for Australia's farmers and for upon export earnings. However, there is another view of world people like the economist Lester Brown, of the coming explosion in demand for agricultural particular and so forth, that the emerging that for agricultural products we will see prices generation emerging in the very near future. The widely respected principal of Orange Chudleigh, takes a middle view. He argues very the problem with tightening world supplies so forth, whilst we will not see the absolute dangerous-that the Lester Browns of this world in agricultural prices. That is for the very simple to the levels that demand will likely dictate world, particularly in this country, will simply in order to justify the increased investment That is very much the case, just as this country, of the oldest car fleets in the world, pumping exhausts. And when we ought to be encouraging government pushes up the sales tax on cars. encouraging investment in agriculture, and we and of agricultural implements across the nation, technology. So higher levels of investment will by higher prices received on farm for agriculture products. The real issue, then, becomes whether the of improving commodity prices. I would have Thursday, 1 June 1995 that primary industry will have a significantly export earnings in coming years. when we constantly hear of Australia's improved or contribution to export earnings that said by people who either forget or do not in this country is the food value adding sector. is dependent upon the primary industries to needs to do its job and to employ hundreds of on the future outlook for commodity prices they can be summarised by referring to the a publication which argues that the world has merchandise in its various forms that it increase in real terms in prices for agriculture essential position is that, should a shortfall for example, production will be lifted or a flexible and rapid fashion that there will be no is on response to a supply shortfall. That is the nation, which is still so heavily dependent commodity prices emerging. It is put forward by the Worldwatch Institute. He argues that such is product in Asia in general, in China in gap between supply and demand will be so great with which we are simply not familiar in our Agricultural College in New South Wales, John strongly, and I am sure he is right, that, given of grain, emerging increasing demand in Asia and explosion in prices-which could be quite talk of, we will see a significant improvement reason that, in order to increase production in the next few years, farmers in the Western have to receive a higher price for their product in their industries that will be needed. under current Labor Party policies, has one out all sorts of nasty emissions from their more people to get into new cars, the That is pretty typical of their approach to now have a frighteningly ancient fleet of tractors and it is reflected in the uptake of new be needed and that will only be made possible farm sector will be able to capture the benefits to say that the record of those in power at the NA Thursday, 1 June 1995 moment would not lead you to believe that this is a very serious issue indeed for economic, environment is very important in this regard. that Australia's major environmental problems different things-and the attendant water quality is to ensure that the nation's land-holders they want to do-that is, to look after their more sophisticated rotations, or the uptake farmers have to have adequate returns in agricultural lands and to move to So I come back to the question I posed earlier: to snare enough of this sort of money that hopefully, a breaking of the drought, in order environmental problems? The answer is that government cannot help itself-it will always another example from the budget.

We cannot highlight enough the importance going to be a matter of government policy, extent those CSOs go to. In recommendation 13 it says: Before the future of the airports currently operated and the government has budgeted to the Departments of Transport and Finance should: (a) identify and assess any 'implicit' community and (b) agree on appropriate methods for the future obligations.

(2) How many asylum seekers are in Australia. (3) What is the average time taken to process an application for refugee status lodged by an asylum seeker. (4) Will the Government seek compensation for Commonwealth expenditure incurred by asylum seekers from the governments of their countries of origin; if not, why not. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that: (1) Asylum seekers who are in hardship and who have waited for 6 months or more for a Protection Visa decision, may be eligible for assistance under the Asylum Seeker Assistance (ASA) Scheme. Payment under this Scheme follows a stringent needs analysis conducted by the Australian Red Cross, and eligibility for continued payment is reviewed on a regular basis. Maximum benefits under this Scheme average 89% of the Department of Social Security's package of benefits which includes Special Benefit, rental assistance and family payments. Application assistance is available to asylum seekers in the community in greatest need, and to Protection Visa applicants in detention to assist them in the preparation, lodgement and presentation of their claims for protection. Interpreting services are available to asylum seekers as they are for other departmental clients. Limited assistance is available to asylum seekers for the treatment of urgent or life threatening medical conditions. (2) At the end of April 1995, there were 11,135 protection visa cases (15,088 clients) awaiting primary decisions and 5,089 cases for review before the Refugee Review Tribunal. NA (3) During 1993/94 new applicants were processed, on average, within four months and people in detention, on average, within ten weeks of lodging an application. (4) No. There is no international precedent to seek compensation for Government expenditure incurred by asylum seekers from the governments of the country of origin. Amateur Radio Operator's Licence (Question No. 1924) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: (1) Has the Spectrum Management Agency increased the cost of an amateur radio operator's licence from $36 to approximately $70; if so, why. (2) How many amateur radio operators' licences are held in Australia. (3) What was or will be the cost of an amateur radio operator's licence in (a) 1993-94, (b) 1994-95 and (c) 1995-96. (4) Has the Government decided to repeal a licence fee of $18 for citizen's band radio operators; if so, (a) why and (b) what sum in revenue will be foregone as a result. (5) What is the cost of administering the amateur radio operators licence system. (6) How many public servants are employed in administering the system. (7) Has the Government evaluated the voluntary contribution made by amateur radio operators to the Australian community; if so, what is the monetary value of the contribution. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the apparatus licence fees structure introduced by the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) amateur licence fees are $51 as of 3 April 1995. Under the previous fees structure the fee was $37. The SMA is responsible for managing the radiofrequency spectrum, including setting licence fees for use of the spectrum. The new fee structure has been determined by the SMA following its inquiry into the apparatus licence system. The inquiry included an extensive process of public consultation. The inquiry concluded that as far as possible the apparatus licence fees structure should be equitable and transparent, with fees properly reflecting the value of spectrum used and SMA costs. This conclusion is consistent with the recommendations of the October 1991 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Communications Infrastructure (HORSCOTCI) Report on Management of the Radiofrequency Spectrum. HORSCOTCI concluded that the then existing approach to levying charges for access to spectrum had little if any effect in managing demand, did not promote efficient use of the spectrum and was not transparent to users. HORSCOTCI concluded that any changed structure should: (a) ensure that actual costs incurred by the Spectrum Manager on behalf of individual users are identified and recovered from the individual users; (b) enable costs not attributable to any specific user to be recovered using a flat charge, or based on some measure of amount or value of spectrum used; and (c) clearly identify the taxation component (2) The SMA has advised that there are approximately 18,000 amateur licences on issue in Australia. (3) As advised by the SMA, the annual cost of an amateur licence for (a) 1993-94 was $36; (b) 1994-95 was $36 for licences issued before December 1994, $37 for licences issued between December 1994 and 2 April 1995 and $51 for licences issued after 2 April 1995; (c) 1995-96 will be $51. (4) On 3 October 1994 the SMA introduced the ""Citizen Band Radio Stations Class Licence"" to replace the existing apparatus licensing arrangements for this service. A Citizen Band (CB) Class Licence is a standing authority which permits anyone to operate a CB transmitter providing they comply with the operating and technical conditions applicable to the Class Licence. There are no licence fees applicable to class licences. The fee applying to CB equipment under the previous apparatus licensing arrangements was $18 per set per annum. (a) A class licence was introduced for CB operators because it is a more effective and efficient way of managing spectrum where a large number of operators share use of a common limited set of frequencies and where all operators are subject to common licence conditions. There is no need for technical conditions to be set for every individual operator and thus no need for individual licensing. (b) Prior to the introduction of the CB class licence, the SMA has advised that there were approximately 354,124 CB licences on issue attracting licence revenue of about $6,374,000. The SMA has advised that considerable costs were incurred in the administration of this service through; for example, finding and prosecuting unlicensed operators, aside from the direct costs of processing such a volume of licences. These costs effectively negated the revenue. (5) The SMA has advised that the cost of licensing amateurs is estimated in excess of $800,000 per annum. (6) The SMA has advised that as at 8 March 1995 there were 266 public servants in the Customer Services Group and 38 public servants in the Business Directions Group of the Spectrum Management Agency involved to varying degrees in administering the apparatus licensing system including amateur radio licensing. (7) In determining amateur licence fees by the SMA recognition was given to the voluntary work of the amateurs through the charge of the minimum tax component in the licence fee. Nevertheless, it should be noted that amateur radio operation is a hobby which is pursued for individual interest and pleasure. Safety of life or emergency services provided by amateurs are incidental to the primary use of the equipment for hobby purposes. Brian Sweeney and Associates: Research Contract (Question No. 1955)",155
48,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 February 1995: Has his Department contracted Brian Sweeney and Associates of South Melbourne to conduct research; if so, (a) what briefs have been given to the company, (b) what has been the cost of the research and (c) what have been its results.",156
49,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of the Treasury has not had any dealings with Brian Sweeney and Associates. However, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has contracted Brian Sweeney and Associates to undertake research on its behalf. (a) Brian Sweeney and Associates were selected to conduct research to determine current awareness, attitudes and understanding of superannuation within the Australian community. Results of the research will provide input and strategic guidance for the ATO in developing the community education campaign on superannuation which I announced in my Superannuation Policy Statement of 28 June 1994. (b) The total cost of the research is $200,000. This includes a qualitative and quantitative research component and in:depth interviews.

Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Client Newsletter (Question No. 1961)",157
52,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 6 February 1995: Has a new client newsletter been proposed within his portfolio; if so, (a) who has proposed the newsletter, (b) what is its proposed (i) purpose, (ii) circulation and (iii) print run, (c) what sums have been spent on the proposal, (d) for what purposes have those sums been spent and (e) have any decisions been made about the newsletter; if so, (i) what decisions and (ii) what will be the cost of implementing those decisions. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: A client newsletter was under consideration by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE). (a) DPIE's Executive Board requested an investigation of mechanisms additional to the Annual Report which could improve the accessibility and currency of the Department's communications with its clients. A newsletter was recommended by the Department's Public Relations Section. (b) (i) The purpose of such a newsletter would have been to provide in one publication information about Departmental services and policies, current issues, and research results. (ii) The target croup for such a publication would have included the farm, mining, fishing, forestry and energy sectors, and other parties including academics and the media. (iii) The print run envisaged in the proposal was about 30,000 copies.

Electoral Division of Fisher: Mail Deliveries (Question No. 2024) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 7 February 1995: (1) How many mail boxes in the electoral division of Fisher receive only one mail delivery per week. (2) Will the Government act to provide at least two deliveries per week to those boxes; if not, why not. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Based on information provided by Australia Post: (1) Australia Post advises there are 4 properties in the electoral division of Fisher which receive one mail delivery per week. (2) The Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 was amended last year to aJlow for Regulations to be made to prescribe performance standards in relation to such things as the frequency of mail delivery services. As was indicated in the Second Reading Speech to the amendments, the need for Regulations will be considered after a review of Australia Post's community service obligations by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I have issued terms of reference to the Committee, which advertised the inquiry and called for submissions in national press on 8 April 1995. In addition, Australia Post is currently conducting a comprehensive review of its delivery services in rural and remote locations. Australia Post advises that the frequency of mail deliveries to these locations will be examined as part of the review which is expected to be completed in the second half of 1995. Commonwealth Employment Service (Question No. 2056)",158
53,Mr EVANS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 9 February 1995: (1) How many persons did the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) place in employment in 1993-94. (2) How many of these jobs referred to in part (1) were part-time. (3) Is he able to say how many job months or job years the employment referred to in part (1) comprises. (4) What was the total running cost of operating the CES in 1993-94. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 542,022 persons were placed in employment by the CES in 1993-94. (2) 114,690 of the jobs referred to in (1) were part-time vacancies. (3) Data detailing how many job months or job years the employment referred to in part (1) comprises are not collected by the Department. (4) The total running cost of operating the CES in 1993-94 was $483.1m which includes salaries, administration and property expenses. Wasted Imputation Credits (Question No. 2065) Mr Somlyay asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: (1) How many taxpayers wasted imputation credits because their credits were in excess of their tax rebates in (a) 1992-93 and (b) 1993-94. (2) What total sum did the wasted imputation credits comprise in (a) 1992-93 and (b) 1993-94. (3) What was the (a) total and (b) average assessable income of taxpayers whose imputation credits exceeded their tax rebates in (i) 1992-93 and (ii) 1993-94.",159
54,Mr GEAR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The total estimated number of taxpayers with partly or completely unused imputation credits is (l)(a) 170,000 in 1992-93*, and (1)(b) unavailable for 1993-94 as data for the full year has not yet been collected. (2) The total estimated sum of imputation credits that were not used is: (2)(a) $80 million in 1992-93* and (2)(b) unavailable for 1993-94. (3)(a) The ATO does not collect statistical information on total assessable income, however, the total estimated taxable income (that is assessable income less allowable deductions) of taxpayers with unused imputation credits was: (3)(a)(i) $1 330 million including total imputation credits or $1 010 million excluding total imputation credits in 1992-93*, and (3)(a)(ii) unavailable for 1993-94. (3)(b) The average taxable income of taxpayers with unused imputation credits is estimated to be: (3)(b)(i) around $7 800 including imputation credits or around $6 000 excluding imputation credits in 1992-93*, and (3)(b)(ii) unavailable for 1993-94. * For purposes of calculating the responses to all of Mr Sornlyay's questions, it is assumed that any other rebates and credits that reduce gross tax are applied before the imputation credits. Diesel Fuel Excise (Question No. 2111) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: (1) Will the Government continue the rebate of excise on diesel fuel, including blended fuel, purchased for use in (a) mining operations, (b) primary production, (c) residential premises, (d) hospitals and (e) nursing homes or similar institutions and houses for aged persons; if so, what principles and criteria does the Government follow in determining each case. . (2) Is it a fact that in the extreme temperatures encountered in the Australian snow fields, if fuel is not blended straight distillate waxes and ceases to flow. (3) Will the Government extend the coverage of the rebate to blended petroleum products used in the Australian snow fields; if not, why not. . (4) What would be the cost to the Commonwealth of extending the coverage of the rebate to equipment used in Australia's ski resorts. Mr Lee-The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The provisions of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme apply to blended fuel containing diesel which is dutiable at the diesel fuel rate when the fuel is used for an eligible purpose under the Scheme. The Government will continue the rebate of excise on diesel fuel, including blended fuel, purchased for use in (a) mining operations, (b) primary production, (c) hospitals, and (d) nursing homes or similar institutions and houses for aged persons. The Government announced in the 1995/96 Budget that the residential premises category is to be abolished, but with compensation arrangements to be put in place for indigenous communities. It was also announced in the Budget that there are to be changes to the eligibility criteria covering mining operations, and agriculture which falls within the category of primary production. The Government does not make individual determinations about eligibility for the diesel fuel rebate. The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is administered by the Australian Customs Service in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. (2) Advice received suggests the answer is yes. (3) No. The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is intended to apply in only a limited number of categories. Extending its coverage is, in broad terms, inconsistent with the Government's current fiscal objectives. (4) Unknown. (Question No. 2121) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: (1) Is it a fact that the principal of Uzu Air has been suspended twice from holding a pilot's licence for breaches of air navigation regulations and (b) was charged with cheating in an examination to upgrade his suspended private licence to a commercial licence. (2) Did Uzu Air employ as a pilot a person who had been convicted of cheating in similar circumstances to the case referred to in part (1). (3) Was Uzu Air's chief pilot dismissed by a previous employer for carelessly colliding with an obstacle at Hom Island Airport. (4) Did one of Uzu Air's aircraft, a BN2 Islander previously used in Papua New Guinea, need to be expensively rebuilt shortly after passing an airworthiness inspection in Cairns. (5) Did the Civil Aviation Authority grant Uzu Air a regular public transport licence for the Torres Strait and Far North Queensland; if so, (a) was it aware of the matters referred to in the preceding parts when it granted the licence and (b) did it fast tract approval; if so, why.",159
55,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Authority has provided the following information: (1)(a) The Civil Aviation Authority has advised that a Managing Director of Uzu Air had his Private Pilot Licence suspended by the Authority on the following occasions: (i) licence suspended 20n/90 to 24112/91 for breaching the Civil Aviation Regulations by the act of piloting an overloaded aircraft and for flying without an instrument rating in weather conditions that required instrument navigation. (ii) the licence suspension at item (a)(i) was reimposed for the period 10111/92 to 18/3/93 after it was alleged by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) that he imposed on the Authority by untrue representation with respect to a Commercial Pilot Licence Theory examination. (b) The person was charged by the AFP with two counts of imposition under the provisions of the Commonwealth Crimes Act (Part l(a)(ii) refers). The person was committed for trial on the charges laid by the AFP but the Director of Public Prosecutions did not pursue the matter to trial. The person elected to sit a Commercial Pilot Licence examination which was accepted by the Authority as a substitute examination for the Private Pilot, Air Legislation examination that was Uzu Air required for the lifting of the suspension placed on the Private Pilot Licence. (2) The Authority is aware that Uzu Air employed an individual who had been convicted of cheating in examinations. He was employed by the (a) airline to perform ground handling and office duties. The Authority has no information to suggest that he has worked for Uzu Air as a pilot engaged in commercial operations. (3) The Authority does not know if Uzu Air's current Chief Pilot, or any of his predecessors, was dismissed by a previous employer. (4) The Authority has advised that a BN2 Islander aircraft, registered VH-XFF, was acquired by Uzu Air in January 1994. This aircraft had had a Certificate of Airworthiness inspection performed on 18 December 1989 by a maintenance organisation located at Cairns. The Authority is satisfied that this aircraft has not been 'rebuilt' since the Certificate of Airworthiness inspection in Cairns in December 1989. However, the aircraft has had major repairs at various times since 1989. The need for these repairs has been attributed to the harsh environmental conditions of the Torres Straits. (5) The Authority advised that on 30 December 1993, it initially granted Uzu Air an Air Operators Certificate (AOC) limited to Charter and Aerial Work operations. Low Capacity Regular Public Transport operations were excluded from this certificate because the company's Operations Manual was incomplete, and there were some deficiencies in the standard of various Torres Straits aerodromes. On 9 February 1994, after all requirements had been satisfied, the AOC was varied to include Low Capacity Regular Public Transport operations for the Torres Strait aerodromes only. (a) The Authority advised that it was aware, prior to the issue of the AOC, of the matter referred to in Part (1) of the honourable member's question but was not aware of the other matters. (b) The Authority advised that it did not fast track the issue of an AOC to Uzu Air. Freedom of Information Act: 'Faulkner (Question No. 2122) Mr Abbott asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report prepared under the supervision of Professor Mark Cooray of Macquarie University which considers material relating to the Faulkner case obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. (2) Did the Commonwealth's counsel, Mr Jack Hiatt, QC, describe the Commonwealth's settlement offer in the Faulkner case as akin to blackmail and a monstrous travesty. (3) Did the Secretary of his Department at the time of the Faulkner case concede that the Solicitor-General's role in the case constituted a conflict of interest. November 1994 Jets Non Jets December 1994 Jets Non Jets January 1995 Jets Non Jets February 1995 Jets Non Jets (4) Has his attention been drawn to claims that documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act in relation to the case show that Commonwealth public servants were involved in buying evidence and in conduct that could amount to a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. (5) Is he taking steps to review the conduct of the case to ensure that the Commonwealth did not behave improperly in the case; if so, what steps.",160
56,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The issues raised by the honourable member's question have been addressed in depth in my letter dated 21 April 1995 to the honourable member and the honourable member for Bradfield, dealing with representations made by the honourable members Case on behalf of Mr and Mrs,Faulkner. There is nothing which I can usefully add to that letter. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 2135) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 6 March 1995: How many (a) arrivals and (b) departures by (i) pure jets and (ii) other types of aircraft occurred on the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in (A) November 1994, (B) December 1994, (C) January 1995 and (D) February 1995.",161
57,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has provided the following information on aircraft movements on the new parallel runway (16L134R). Aircraft Movements from November 1994 to February 1995 RUNWAY 16L RUNWAY 34R NA 0 1587 1487 0 35 960 1236 0 0 2170 1412 0 785 1288 1206 0 1 1142 1670 0 569 903 1290 0 0 1082 1150 0 1896 1156 983 0 Australian Taxation Office: Bankruptcy (Question No. 2164),161
58,Mr CAMERON,ARR DEP ARR DEP,"the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 8 March 1995: (1) In how many bankruptcy cases was the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) involved as a creditor in (a) 1991-92; (b) 1992-93; and (c) 199394. (2) What total sum (a) was the ATO owed and (b) did it receive in (i) 1991-92, (ii) 1992-93 and (iii) 1993-94 in the cases referred to in part (1). (3) Was all possible action taken to ensure the ATO did not lose what it was owed. (4) Is Mr Alan Bond in debt to the ATO; if so, (a) what sum does he owe, (b) what portion of that sum will it receive and (c) if it will not receive whole sum, why not.",162
59,Mr GEAR,ARR DEP ARR DEP,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) It is not possible to provide the specific information requested by the honourable member, as that information is not kept by the ATO. Legal action to recover a debt, which can result in the bankruptcy of a debtor, is commenced in quite a number of cases. However, that action may not always be pursued to its ultimate conclusion because the debtor may pay in full or may enter into an acceptable arrangement to pay a debt over time. There are also cases where other creditors of the ATO debtor may pursue a debt to bankruptcy. In those cases, the ATO will either lodge a proof of debt with the official receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy or ask the Court to be substituted as the petitioning creditor. The Commissioner has provided the following information in relation to cases subject to insolvency action (that is, corporate liquidation and ual bankruptcies) at 30 June for each of the three years in question: (a) at 30 June 1992, the ATO had 15,819 insolvency cases on hand; (b) at 30 June 1993, the ATO had 11,534 insolvency cases on hand; (c) at 30 June 1994, the ATO had 10,079 insolvency cases on hand. (2) (a) (i) The insolvency debt on hand at 30 June 1992 - as $771m. (2)(a)(ii) The insolvency debt on hand at 30 June 1993 was $637m. (2) (a) (iii) The insolvency debt on hand at 30 June 1994 was $577m. (Note: insolvency debt includes debt arising from corporate liquidations and individual bankruptcies) (2)(b) The ATO is not in a position to provide Creditor details of the actual amount of insolvency debt recovered. The ATO estimates that, on average, only 10% of insolvency debt is recovered by way of dividends. (3) The ATO takes all possible action to recover outstanding tax debts. The Commissioner expects taxpayers (including corporates) to arrange their affairs so that they can meet their liabilities when they fall due for payment. If a tax debt is not paid by the due date for payment and the debtor does not contact the ATO, the Commissioner can only make the assumption the debtor is not going to pay and put in place action to deal with that debt. That action may include personal, telephone or written contact, the issue of garnishee notices, the issue of orders preventing a debtor's departure from Australia until a debt is paid, legal action up to and the including the bankruptcy of an individual or the liquidation of a company, accepting payment of the debt over time, recovering from the personal assets of company directors, writing-off debts considered uneconomical to pursue and inviting applications for a release, which are determined by a Taxation Relief Board. Bankruptcy (or liquidation in the case of corporates) is the ultimate sanction for debtors who do not enter into arrangements with their creditors to pay outstanding debts. Once debtors are made bankrupt, their financial affairs are placed in the hands of the official receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy who has a responsibility to act for the benefit of all creditors. Generally, taxation debts are unsecured and the Commissioner is treated the same as any other unsecured creditor. The Bankruptcy Act provides the official receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy with the appropriate resources necessary to claw back assets that are held by bankrupts and to make those assets available to creditors. Amendments to the Act in 1991 gave trustees significant power to overtum distributions of property which were intended to defraud individcreditors or payments by the bankrupt which favoured one creditor over another. Remedies for creditors are restricted by bankruptcy. Generally, the right of creditors to enforce an individual remedy against a bankrupt personally or against the bankrupt's property is replaced with the right of claiming against the bankrupt's estate. A claim against a bankrupt's estate is made through the official receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy by lodging a proof of debt. (4)(a)-(c) The Commissioner cannot publicly disclose details of Mr Bond's, or any other taxpayer's, taxation affairs. Nevertheless, it is a matter of public record that Mr Bond was an undischarged bankrupt who owed an amount of tax when he sought to have his bankruptcy annulled by putting forward a scheme or composition to his creditors. In cases where a bankrupt has not put forward a scheme or composition, creditors will only receive whatever dividend is declared by the official receiver or trustee in bankruptcy. If a scheme or composition is accepted by a majority of creditors (in number and value-the vote of the majority binds all creditors), all any creditor can expect to receive by way of dividend is the dividend proposed in the scheme or composition. A creditor cannot expect to receive any more than the amount declared as a final dividend by the official receiver or trustee in bankruptcy in respect of a debt for which a proof of debt has been lodged. Similarly, no creditor can expect to receive any more than the proposed dividend under the scheme or composition accepted by a majority of creditors. In either case, the remaining balance of a debt is irrecoverable at law and would be writtenoff.

(2) On how many occasions since 1985 has the ATO applied (a) sales tax and (b) a sales tax exemption on the purchase of four wheel drive vehicles used by kangaroo shooters.",163
61,Mr GEAR,ARR DEP ARR DEP,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 provides two types of sales tax exemptions for motor vehicles. First, there is a restricted exemption for certain types of four wheel drive vehicles used mainly in carrying out activities in the agricultural industry. Secondly, there is a sales tax exemption available. to registered taxpayers for general purpose road vehicles (including two wheel drives) used exclusively within production premises (owned or leased by the taxpayer) or used between adjacent production premises, or both. Both types of exemptions are available to subcontractors in specific circumstances. The exemption covering four wheel drive vehicles used in the agricultural industry is restricted to persons carrying out activities that are agricultural in nature such as cultivation of the soil and harvesting, but not to activities of a general purpose nature, such as fencing, bore sinking, earth moving or kangaroo shooting. This exemption is unique to the agricultural industry and represents an acceptance of the special needs of agriculturalists. The exemption for general purpose passenger motor vehicles for subcontractors to goods producers, including primary producers, applies to a wider range of vehicles than the exemption for four wheel drive vehicles used in the agricultural industry. However, it is restricted to vehicles used exclusively within premises, owned or leased by the goods producer, or in going between adjacent premises of the goods producer. This exclusive use restriction would prevent kangaroo shooters subcontracting to primary producers from obtaining exemption. (2) Sales Tax is a self assessing tax. Taxpayers assess their liability according to the transactions that have occurred in a specific period and submit the tax to the Australian Taxation Office. Details are not available of specific transactions involving kangaroo shooters. Solar-Powered Hill Lights (Question No. 2240) Mr Sharp asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 27 March 1995: (1) Is it a fact that solar-powered hill lights are the only feasible option to allow night flying at the airports of remote communities. (2) Does the Civil Aviation Authority permit the operation of solar-powered hill lights on hills surrounding airports of remote communities; if not, why not.",164
62,Mr BRERETON,ARR DEP ARR DEP,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised that in general, terrain obstacles do not require marking or lights unless an aeronautical study determines that the obstacle requires a hazard beacon to ensure the safety of air navigation. Where marking of terrain obstacles at night is necessary, the CAA's practice is to require the terrain to be marked by a hazard beacon in the form of an occulting red light. These lights are used only at night and draw 600-700 watts of power. While solar power may be a viable and economical source of electricity for hazard beacons in some remote localities, it may also be feasible to use other power sources such as reticulated power from a grid supply or a small generator. (2) The Authority does not give approvals for hazard beacons on a general application basis. Any proposal to use solar-powered lights as hazard beacons can only be considered on a case by case basis, based on an aeronautical assessment of the location of the obstacle that the surrounding terrain and the aircraft operating procedures for the particular aerodrome. The CAA will only endorse hazard lights that have a suitable level of performance and reliability for a particular purpose and location. The Authority is not aware of any recent application or proposal from the industry for the use of solar-powered hazard beacons at a particular site. Olympic Games: Sporting Equipment (Question No. 2247) Mr Filing asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 28 March 1995: Is the Minister able to say whether sporting equipment to be used in the Year 2000 Olympic Games will be imported from the People's Republic of China; if so, (a) what equipment, (b) in what quantities, (c) at what total cost and (d) why will the .equipment not be ordered from Australian firms.",164
63,Mr BRERETON,ARR DEP ARR DEP,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 1. The Commonwealth is not involved in the purchase of equipment for the 2000 Olympic Games. This is a responsibility of the New South Wales Government through the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. 2. With the announcement of the decision to award the 2000 Olympic Games to Sydney, the Federal Government launched the Olympic Athlete Program (OAP) which will provide $135 million over the six years 1994/95-1999/2000 to prepare Australian athletes for the 1996 and 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games. A total of $1,000,000 has been made available to six Olympic sports (canoeing, cycling, diving, rowing, shooting and yachting) in 1994/95 for the purchase of equipment for use by OAP athletes. 3. Both Australian and international manufacturers have supplied equipment to date. To my knowledge, none of this equipment was purchased from the People's Republic of China. Australian Bureau of Statistics: Cooling Fans (Question No. 2251)",165
64,Mr CONNOLLY,ARR DEP ARR DEP,"the Treasurer, on is to be marked, notice, on 28 March 1995: Did the Australian Bureau of Statistics recently acquire fans or other cooling devices for its building at Belconnen, ACT; if so, (a) what was the (i) number (ii) type and (iii) cost of the equipment, (b) who supplied it, (c) why was the purchase necessary, (d) what is the (i) original cost, (ii) age and (iii) status of the existing air conditioning system and (e) will the air conditioning system be replaced or upgraded; if so, what (i) are the plans and (ii) what will it cost. Imports Mr WILLIS - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The size of the ABS computer room was reduced by 50%, thus making an area of around 750 square metres available as office space. An associated review of computer room air conditioning equipment (which was independent of the rest of the building's air conditioning system) was carried out by Assets Australia. That review found that the existing equipment, which was around 14 years old, had reached the end of its economic life and was no longer suitable for the more modem computing equipment operated by the ABS. As a result, rather than modify and move outdated air conditioning equipment, it was decided as part of the computer room shrinkage to install new, cheaper to operate units, tailored to the requirements of computers accommodated in the reduced computer room. The additional office space, meanwhile, was connected to the building's existing air conditioning. Details in response to specific questions are as follows: (a)(i) a total of nine cooler units were purchased; (ii) two Atlas PRC128RC units, three Atlas PEC248RC units, four Atlas PEC398FC units; (iii) total cost was $141,610. (b) The equipment was supplied by Atlas Air Australia Ltd. (c) To replace outdated air conditioning equipment. (d)(i) The cost of the original equipment (known as EDPAC Process Coolers) is not known. (ii) The equipment was 14 years old. (iii) The equipment was assessed by Assets Australia as being beyond economic repair. (e) (i) The new equipment, referred to above, has replaced obsolete equipment in the upgraded computer room. The new office area was connected to the existing building air conditioning. (ii) Purchase cost. of the new cooling equipment was $141,610. The cost of installation was included in the purchase price. The connection of the new office area to the existing building air conditioning cost $77,000 and included heating and chilling plant, connection fees and ducting.

In the 'Rome Statement on Forestry' adopted at the conclusion of the Meeting, Ministers re1993-94 $531.00 cup/saucer set 1984 and 1986 Not available 2 teapots 2 sugar bowls 2 milk jugs 12 cups 12 saucers 1986 Not available 4 cups 4 saucers 8 side plates affirmed the importance of applying a holistic Allowances approach to forest issues, according to the out(Question No. 2266) comes of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Agenda 21 and the non-binding Statement of Forest Principles), in order to pursue an integrated and balanced approach between the environmental and developmental functions of forests. The Ministerial Meeting considered that, in order to meet the expectations of the international community on forests, further efforts must be made to build upon the foundation laid by UNCED. In the Rome Statement, Ministers underlined areas for action they saw as essential to the achievement of this goal. In Australia's case, existing policies and programs at both the Federal and State level already address the areas for action identified by Ministers. Accordingly, the Commonwealth does not consider that further Federal or State legislative or administrative measures will be needed for Australia to meet the principles and objectives of the Rome Statement on Forestry. This comprehensive reMinisters sponse on forest issues is set out in Australia's (Question No. 2276) 1995 Report to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (pages 20-29). Australia is strongly committed to the conservation and use of its forest resources based on the principles of ecologically sustainable development. This commitment is encapsulated in Australia's National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) which was agreed in December 1992, and which is consistent with the sustainable development principles endorsed at UNCED. More recently, the Prime Minister has announced further policy measures, consistent with the NFPS, in relation to the sustainable management of Australia's forests.

Jobsearch and Newstart Allowances (Question No. 2301) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: (1) On what grounds have persons been transferred from Job Search and Newstart Allowances medical officer to the Special Benefit. (2) Under what circumstances will a person no longer be entitled to Job Search or Newstart Allowances so that they are transferred to the the details of Special Benefit. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Special Benefit is a discretionary payment and is only available to a person who is not able to qualify for any other income support payment. To be granted payment of Special benefit, the Secretary must be satisfied that the person is unable to a sufficient livelihood for the person and the person's dependants because of age, physical or mental disability, domestic circumstances, or for any other reason. Claims for payment of Special are subject to an additional available funds test. A more stringent income test also applies to Special Benefit than that which applies to Job Search or Newstart Allowance. People are transferred from Job Search or Newstart Allowance to Special Benefit because they no longer satisfy the basic qualifications for payment of Job Search or Newstart Allowance and are not entitled to any other payment. The reasons why such people no longer satisfy the basic qualifications for Job Search or Newstart Allowance vary according to individual circumstances. Some examples of the types of cases are as follows: persons who have reached age pension age but are not residentially qualified for pension; persons who are caring for a child or children where no other suitable care is available; persons who are caring for an incapacitated person or persons but are ineligible for Carer's Pension; persons who are awaiting determination of their claim for Sole Parent Pension; persons who are awaiting determination of their claim for Disability Support Pension; females who are in the last 12 weeks of their pregnancy and have a medical certificate stating that they are unable to look for work or who have a newly bom child; persons who are assessed as being 'socially marginalised' such as people with a psychiatric illness who because of their illness, will not claim Sickness Allowance or Disability Support Pension. In addition, where exceptional circumstances are present, Job Search and Newstart Allowees, who due to changes in their circumstances are no longer able to meet the activity test requirements for a period greater than 13 weeks, and who do not qualify for another payment, may be transferred to Special Benefit. For shorter periods they may have the activity test requirements suspended for up to 13 weeks. (2) As stated previously, people who no longer satisfy the qualifications for payment of Job Search or Newstart Allowance and who do not meet the basic qualifications for any other income support payment would be transferred to the Special Benefit.

This project, which commenced in November 1994, aims to assist the effective and proper urban planning and development control of Hanoi through the following components: preparation of a statutory development plan and planning ordinance for Hanoi preparation of a local structure plan for an important urban development area in Hanoi preparation of a strategy for the protection and proper development of a designated area in the ancient district of Hanoi increase the capacity of the Architect-inChiefs Office to undertake its planning and development control mandate. The project will work to ensure that Hanoi's rapid urban development complements the unique character of the city. Old Hanoi is important to the heritage of Vietnam and its preservation has potential for longer term economic returns in the form of tourism. Effective urban planning in Vietnam is an important ingredient in the overall modernisation of the country's economy and society. Australia's aid program is supporting this process of modernisation in a number of ways, and assistance with the Hanoi project is consistent with our broad aims of promoting economic and social advancement in Vietnam.
