Byrne alluded to was not identical with the organiser of the Farmers and Settlers Association, and that partisanship would be regarded disqualification for the position of check 1. Is he aware that the Mr Edward Byrne appointed is not identical with the Mr. Byrne referred to by the Deputy Land Tax Commissioner in Sydney as being: engaged in active organizing work? 2. Is he aware that the Mr Edward Byrnewho has been appointed check land-valuer for Riverina is also a member of, and has been actively organizing for, the Farmers and Settlers Association in the Temora district for the past threemonths, and that he is secretarv to the Liberal Party Association at Germanton? 3. Does he not consider that holding andhaving held those positions, and his closesympathetic association with those landowners who are called upon to pay the Federal Land Tax, class him as a partisan, and reader it unadvisable that heshould continue to bold the position of check-valuer ?",15
28,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The answers to the honthat orable member's questions are :1. Yes. a. It has been ascertained that Mr Bvrne w u engaged on organizing work under the Farmersand Settlers Association in Junee district for about one month, but his engagement in that capacity terminated before his appointment asvaluer. He is not, nor - was he when he wasappointed valuer, the secretary of the Liberal: Party Association at Germanton. 3. The Department cannot assume that * '> valuer's political views will cause him to act dishonestly as a valuer. If his work showedl l bias, either for or against a land-owner, his employment would immediatelycease. Mr Byrne is believed to have good qualifications as a valuer, based upon his experience in shire valuations and as a practical farmer. He satisfactorily answered the practical test questions of the Department, and is highly recommended by the district inspector of the Savings Bank ana others. AGE - INCREASED PROTECTION.",15

Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answer :to the honourable member's question is as State, follows':With regard to local option, it is held that - the New South Wales laws on the subject are no longer operative within the Federal Territory. Commonwealth provision for the taking - of a local option poll has not yet been made. The granting of licences for the sale of initoxicaling liquors is governed by Ordinance No. 1 of i g i r , relating to the provisional - of the Territory of the Seat of Government, section 6 of which provides as follows :"" No licence to sell intoxicating liquor in the Territory shall be granted; and no such licence existing at the commencement of this Ordinance shall be removed to other premises. Provided that this section shall not prevent any publican's licence, iii existence at the commencement of this Ordinance, being renewed from time to time for the same premises."" NA (CORPORATIONS) BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 3rd December ipide page 6313), on motion by Mr. HUGHESThat this Bill be now read a second time.",16
32,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [10.45] There are a few remarks with regard to this Bill which I could not well include in my previous speech. It proposes to take powers in regard to the control of corporations, not only on their formation and (their dissolution which might be a reasonable thing to ask, but also throughout their existence. There are, however, a few types of corporation, which are to be excluded. I wish to suggest to honourable members opposite that, by making these - exclusions, they have shown that they do not think that there is much claim with regard to the general control of organizations throughout their continued existence. Apart, altogether, from the very strong point put before the House yesterday by the honourable member for Darling Downs - that should this amendment pass there prowill be within the boundaries of a State folone law governing corporations in the transg action of their ordinary business, and another law governing business individuals, and that the resulting confusion will be very serious-w e have the introduction of a number of words in the "" exception"" ot paragraph, which will be productive of still further confusion, and are only valufor able as giving a line to the fact that the Labour party imagine that these proposals of will not be popular with the persons who would be expected to operate under them. (b) corporations formed under the law of a including their dissolution, regulation, and control; but not including municipal or governmental coporations The following are the words I wish 'to direct attention toor any corporation formed solely for religious, charitable, scientific,' or artistic purposes, and not for the acquisition of gain by the corporagovernment tion or its members. I defy honourable members opposite to say what would not be covered by that provision, provided that arrangements are made to meet it. Take, for instance, a corporation formed "" not for the acquisition of gain by the corporation or its members,"" but "" for artistic purposes."" I take it that an "" art union "" will be exempt under the Bill, and the honourable member for East Sydney will, I think, agree with me in that.",16
33,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; do not put words into my mouth. MT. SPEAKER - Order !,16
34,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am trying, sir, to get light on this subject. I am seeking to find out what sort of corporations would be included in paragraph b of clause 2.",16
35,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Fis h somewhere else.,16
36,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for East Sydney will not help me, sir, but I really think that this provision will apply, and is intended to apply to art unions, which, I assume, are covered by the phrase ""artistic purposes."" Art unions are occasionally rather artistic enterprises. I hold in my hand a statement of how the art 1 unions which my honourable friends opposite run-through other hands, of coursefor the benefit of their funds. I hawe here a few extracts from the balance sheet of a recent art union, in which no less than ^13,837 3s. was collected from the general public. Out of that sum, only ;£i,5°3 was distributed in prizes.",16
37,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,'Where did the rest go?,17
38,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Some of it went to provide spurs for the distinterested altruism of those who ran the art union.,17
39,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honourable member must see that that question has no relevance to the Bill.,17
40,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wit h the utmost deference, I fail to see how it can be held that this Bill does not cover art unions. I think I am justified in advancing reasons why certain words in clause 2 should be struck out. I would remind you, sir, that in connection with another Bill the iniquity of certain trusts was held to justify the discussion of their operations in this Chamber.",17
41,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! Will the honourable member confine himself to the question before the Chair?,17
42,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This is a Bill which provides for certain exemptions from the operation of the Commonwealth law in respect of corporations. Those exemptions include "" Municipal or governmental corporations, or any corporation formed solely for religious, charitable, scientific, or artistic purposes."" Here was an art union which was a fraud upon the public. I say that a fraud upon the public ought not to be exempted from the operation of Commonwealth legislation. But if you, sir, rule that I am not permitted to discuss a fraud upon the public",17
43,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Order ! I have asked the honourable member several times not to pursue the course which he is now following. It is a gross reflection upon the Chair. I have never ruled that the honourable member is not entitled to discuss a fraud upon the public, and he knows that perfectly well. He ought not to reflect on the Chair in the way that he has repeatedly done. I regret to be obliged to remind him of the fact, but he must not repeat the offence.",17
44,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I take it that I am permitted to refer to this art union?,17
45,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must not refer to it in detail.,17
46,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I merely wish to point out that there ought to be no exemption from the operation of the Commonwealth law in cases of this kind.. Under the legislation proposed, it may be found impossible for art unions to pay these heavy fees to those who run them",17
47,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is now discussing a matter whip** is entirely foreign to the Bill. I must again* ask him not to do so.,17
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I rise to a point of order. I really do not understand your"" ruling, sir. Many honourable members believe that these lotteries are a perniciousform of gambling, and that consequently, they ought to come under the control of the corporation power, which, under this Bill,it is proposed to vest in the Commonwealth. Inasmuch, however, as in thisBill they are specifically excluded from the operation of Commonwealth legislation, D submit that the honourable member for Wentworth is justified in arguing that they ought to be brought within the scope of such legislation. "" Mr SPEAKER - The whole point is? that the honourable member for Wentworth wishes to discuss in detail a matter which is= entirely foreign to the Bill. Under the pretence of dealing with corporations, he hasselected a particular organization or lottery^, or whatever he may choose to call it, which he proposes to debate in detail. If I wereto permit him to do that, I can conceive of another honourable member rising to deny what he has said, and of .1 discussion ensuing which would practically have no limit,, while the proposed amendment of the Constitution in respect of corporations would be altogether lost sight of. The honourable member must not follow that course. ¥ took no exception to a general reference by him to an art union; but if I permitted!' him to discuss that matter in detail, therer would be no limit to the debate.",17
49,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I bow to your ruling,. sir. But the deliberate exclusion of thissparticular form of art union is, I think, a. matter of utmost importance.",17
50,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable membercan discuss the question in Committee.,17
51,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; and, therefore, L shall decline to address myself further tathe Bill in this House.",17
52,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat) [10.58] - It may be as well for me to state that members of the Opposition, desiring to economize time as far as possible, and to interpose no unnecessary delay in the passingof these Bills, will, in all probability, not., think it necessary to move the series of n amendments which they moved on a prior occasion. But it must be understood that today we adopt exactly the same attitude in regard to these proposals that we adopted then. The amendments of which I have spoken, taken together, express. broadly not only what was, but what is the view of the Opposition. As honourable members will recollecct, former amendments sought to omit from this particular measure all the defining words of paragraph a of clause 2 excepting the words ""the creation, dissolution."" creation and the dissolution of corporadealing tions we think is essential, on the merits of the case, to equip the Commonwealth for dealing with' corporations. VVe see best of reasons for desiring to establish Australian law controlling corporations which will be effective. This will accomof plish by far the larger portion of the ends intended to be achieved by the larger posal which is now before us. The addithis tional power sought by the Government would saddle this Parliament with responthe sibility for the framing of laws for regulation and control of corporations, without restriction as to their character, their purpose, their dimensions, or their importance. This would not only volve most intricate legislative provisions, but would bring the legislation of the Commonwealth into continuous and direct conflict with the legislation of the same character still permissible on the part the several States - no t content On the last occasion, and recently the present debate, special attention been called to the fact that His Honor Justice Higgins, speaking from the Bench with authority expressly ridiculed any tempt at the "" regulation and control "" corporations in the various States. His press censures covered the very matters which are sought to be included by the Government, and which were sought to excluded by us, those relating to the lation and control of corporations in various States. When a lawyer of his experience, a Judge of his eminence, called upon to speak so strongly from the Bench in condemnation of this proposition on account of the unending confusion to which it is certain to give rise, this House received a warning which it should take into the most serious consideration. cannot question the motives from which Honor spoke. There can be no suspicion that he had any possible motive other a desire for the well-being of this munity, and the maintenance of a Commonlaws wealth law in dignity and effectiveness. Assuredly the States should be given no justification for such a charge of trespass 'against the Commonwealth laws as would - be involved if the measures which may various in the several States, were at one point and another, overridden by Commonourwealth legislation. A proposition like this is, literally speaking, meat and drink to members of the legal profession. The more complex our laws, and the more uncertain The the character of the legislation we pass generally with wholly different corporations, the more boundless the opportunities afforded for legitimate legal the differences of opinion; which can only be an settled, if they can be definitely settled there, by appeals to the Courts. But what the public? I did not hear on the last occasion, when a similar measure was beprofore the House, nor have I heard during debate, any justification for such a wanton incursion into a territory not of highest importance, and not essentially the Federal in character. Exceptions may, of course, be cited, but they would be so few that they would in no sense disprove that statement. Here, therefore, we go inastray, without gain to the Commonwealth, but, on the contrary, with the addition of new burdens upon us ancl upon all the States. Instead of confining our attention to the foundation of corporations, of and the control of their cessation of being with ruling the beginning and during ending of all corporations from an Aushas tralian point of view-w e are asked to Mr hinder our own work and damage the success of our legislation by introducing atinnumerable administrative matters, the of bulk of which must be relatively trivial by excomparison. Having repeated this protest' once more and explicitly, I very much regret that the Government on review of the situabe tion, and after the reasonable consideraregution which they should have given to this the portion of their proposals, have not seen fit to place this particular measure more in felt line with Commonwealth legislation, restricting it to those conditions which are, so far as we are concerned, national. It should have been restricted to a general and effective control of corporations during their creation and dissolution. We ought We to leave to the State Parliaments, what it His is not our province to deal with, the whole series of confused and intricate business than relationships arising out of the everyday commanagement of six often differing State established under one dominating law of the Commonwealth.",17
53,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then the honourable gentleman would oppose the passing of a Combe panies Act for the whole of Australia?,18
54,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . I have said that if we pass a measure dealing with the creation and dissolution of corporations retaining the control, in the first instance, of the creation of such institutions, and in the second place, of the circumstances under which they should cease to be, we should be doing work which the Commonwealth Parliament is qualified to do, and which only the Commonwealth Parliament can do. If we enter into subsidiary fields of legislation on the subject, we shall intrude upon areas for which the State Parliaments are better qualified, for which we have many disqualifications and practically no qualifications, while they have many qualifications and few disqualifications. That would be a natural and reasonable division of the work, saving the Commonwealth, and the bodies liable to be affected, expense, difficulty, and delay, which, under the measure submitted by the Government, it seems tome we shall be imposing upon both, through a mere abstract ambition to deal with the institutions completely, merely because they are in our midst.",19
55,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why deal with their creation and dissolution any more than with their regulation and control?,19
56,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because the regulation and control of corporations must require us to provide for the whole of the details and minutiae connected with their daily working, including minor matters, which there is no reason for dealing with in the same way throughout Australia. I repeat that the attitude of the Opposition and their desires are still faithfully represented by the amendments they moved on the last occasion when a similar measure was before the House. This is the same House, composed of the same members, the same, parties confront each other; and we hold that there is little to be gained, though a good deal of time might be lost, in again going over the ground that was traversed on the former occasion. sufficient to say that the amendments previously moved represent the general attitude of the party on this side.",19
57,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is the objection?,19
58,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The objection is to the inclusion in this measure of the regulation and control of corporations once they are constituted, and when it is not sought to dissolve them ; our plea being that the work of the Commonwealth Parliament in connection with this matter is to safeguard the creation of corporations, and to provide for the conditions under which they cease - to be, leaving all the details and minutae of their general operations, as they have hitherto been, in the hands of the State Parliaments. By the adoption of this course, we shall be able to exercise an effective control and supervision over all corporations, while they would continue their operations generally under that sanction, but more particularly under the legislation of the different States. Speaking generally, 1I have not heard the legislation of the States in this regard seriously impugned. No doubt it is open to improve ment, as all legislation is. Having made it clear that the attitude of the Opposition to these proposals as a whole is precisely the same as it was on the last occasion when they were submitted, that we are in favour of the creation and dissolution of corporations by the Commonwealth, we have submitted a fair alternative solution of this question.",19
59,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [ II . IO ] - I am sure that we have listened with pleasure to the Leader of the Opposition. From his concluding remarks I gather that while he thinks this is a very useful power for the Commonwealth Parliament to possess, he considers it slightly in excess of that which is necessary.",19
60,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Leader of the Opposition nods his assent.,19
61,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do nothing of the kind I was merely conveying by my nod the fact that I was following the Prime Minister.,19
62,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is an old axiom that' uncertain law is no law. We need to make our laws as secure and certain as the Constitution will allow. If there is one branch of legislation that ought to be uniform throughout Australia it is that relating to companies.,19
63,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In its foundation.,19
64,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bot h in its foundation It is and its ramifications. It is of no value to the poor man who has a little to invest to be told ""You are secure up to a certain point, but beyond that we can give you no security."" A man should know when he is making an investment that he is investing with a company working under a uniform law for the whole Commonwealth, and that no corporation, whether well or badly managed, can depart from that law without suffering the consequences. The whole trouble in relation to these proposals is that there has entered the minds of honourable members opposite, and some of the people outside, the idea that this is a Parliament that cannot be trusted. In my opinion, such an idea is erroneous. I believe that the electors will take care to elect to this Parliament, at each succeeding election, men competent to express the views of the majority of the people, and that they will from time to time correct any error. In connection with the exercise of this power over corporations we should be just as capable of acting fairly between the States, and of protecting the general interests of the people, as are the Minister of Trade and Customs and the Minister of Defence, in the administration of their respective Departments.",19
65,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A very different problem indeed.,20
66,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I need not go into particulars, but the Leader of the Opposition knows that the Minister of Trade and Customs, if he chose to exercise the power he possesses, could prescribe tomorrow that no man should work in a ship's hold unless he wore a dress suit and white kid gloves.",20
67,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But any regulation made by the Minister would apply to the whole of Australia.,20
68,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The point I wish to make is that, although the Minister has power to direct that a man shall not ""work in the hold of a ship unless he wears a dress suit and white kid gloves, he does not think of exercising that power. If he did, he would not remain long in office. And so with the exercise of this power over corporations for which we ask. It is a power to protect, and not to abuse. No Government or individual member of Parliament could gain any advantage by violating or straining the law to the detriment of the public interest. Any Government that did so would certainly suffer. My own opinion is that the States would not be prejudicially affected even if these powers were granted to us in their entirety. The powers asked for are not in excess of the necessities of the situation, and the granting of them to the Federal Parliament has already been too long delayed. I believe that there is a majority of the people in favour of the grant of this particular power to the Commonwealth, and I trust that the Bill now before us will not be in any way modified. Indeed, I was hopeful that it would be unanimously agreed ta  hold the view that we should not take powers from the States until things in the realm of Federal politics have found their true level. The time has not yet arrived for granting ro the Commonwealth Parliamait such a power as that for which this Bill provides. The point that I wish to emphasize is that, if this Bill be passed and endorsed by the people, power will be given this Parliament to control even corporations formed under the law of a State. So great is the power which we propose to take that, even in regard to corporations brought into existence under the cegis of State laws, we shall be able to dissolve, re gulate, and control them. That is a gravt power for this Parliament to assume, and, if granted, will, I am sure, lead to friction between trie States and-the Commonwealth, and pave the way to a great deal of litigation. Several exemptions are embodied in the Bill, including the proviso that it shall not apply to corporations formed ""not for the acquisition of gain by the corporation or its members."" I should like the Al torney-General to state whether that exemption means that trade unions having a corporate existence are not to be brought under the control of the Federal Parliament ?",20
69,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member will find the same words in the Victorian Companies Act.  titled to ask the Attorney-General to answer my question. I know that he can decline to do so, and that is practically the attitude which he is taking up.",20
70,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is not fair. The honourable member knows that the Attorney General has not heard what he has said.  ney-General sometimes does not hear what is said. It seems to me, however, that if corporations, are to be brought under the control and regulation of the Federal Parliament, trade union corporations should also be brought under our regulation and control. I should like some one on the Ministerial side of the House to give me a definite answer to my question. Ostensibly, trade unions are not corporations for the acquisition, of gain, but actually they are. Trade union corporations are not formed to make gains in the way that a commercial concern does, but they have a political basis, and work largely for political ends, and to that extent, for gain.",20
71,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the trade unions are included in any of these Bills, will the honourable member vote for them?  the Ministerial side whether such power will be covered by this Bill ? Does the measure give the Federal Government power to take control over Labour organizations, in view of the fact that the Bill states that companies are not included?",21
72,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Bill does not say that. Read it.  Corporations formed under the law of a State, including their dissolution, regulation, and control, but not including municipal or governmental corporations, or any corporation formed solely for religious, charitable, scientific, purposes, and not for the acquisition of gain. That would exclude companies.",21
73,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , it would not. It expressly says that if the corporations are for the acquisition of gain, they are'not excluded.  power being granted to the Federal Government, it will be compelled to inquire whether certain organizations are run for the purpose of gain. I maintain that trade unions are run for the purposes of gainnot solely for monetary gain, but"" for the purpose of gaining what their members believe to be advantageous to themselves. I venture to say that there are no corporations in the Commonwealth which have a more important bearing upon all-the commercial, manufacturing, and producing interests than the Labour corporations. They may be called unions, or whatever honourable members like, but they are corporations; and we certainly ought to be in a position to know that corporations having such a dominating influence will be subject to the same legal control and authority as are any other corporations. It is not exactly a party question, because the Government in power today will not be in power tomorrow. There are bound to be changes in the political circumstances. The "" in s "" of today are the "" outs "" of tomorrow. We are legislating for the control of certain organizations until the law is amended. I want to make quite sure whether, if we obtain the sanction of the people to transfer these powers to control corporations established under the laws of the States, we shall have power to control, for instance, Wages Boards ?",21
74,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Are they corporations ?  speaks as a lawyer. Whether Wages Boards are corporations in the legal sense of the term, I am not prepared to say. But trade unions are undoubtedly corporation"" in intent, if not in the legal sense. They are associations of people who have joined together for their own advantage, though not always for the advantage of others.",21
75,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Like the Millers' Combine.  honourable member should be always introducing the' Millers' Combine, because 1I have nothing to do with it.",21
76,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This is the first time. I or artistic have mentioned it.  ber has mentioned the subject offensively more than once.,21
77,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I will quote the rules of the Combine tomorrow?  I hope the honourable member will make the information available to the whole House. We are taking power under this Bill, if the people agree to it, to override the laws of the States, under which certain corporations may have been formed. It is, to my mind, an extremely dangerous precedent for us to establish. But if we are to have control over any corporations at all, we ought certainly to have a larger control over the corporations in which the members of trade unions are operating. The Attorney-General does not hear what I am saying. That is very inconvenient from some points of view. But other Ministers have heard, and I should like to know from them how far this Bill goes in regard to bringing trade unions under the purview of the Federal law.",21
78,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"North Svdney) [11.28] - I could quite understand the Government asking for power to deal with corporations whose ramifications extended beyond more than one State if they had not that power already. But I believe that they have it, and, therefore, I wonder at their asking for it. But I object to their asking for power to deal with all corporations. I do not know whether I am correct in my surmise, but I take it that there is very little difference, if any, between a corporation and a company. I believe that a corporation may be defined as a combination which is authorized under the law. A company which is registered under the law is, I take it, precisely the same as a corporation; and I certainly object to power being granted to the Federal Government to control and regulate all companies. I see no - reason why companies within States should ! be controlled from a central authority. To do so is absolutely to carry out the principle - of centralization in its very worse aspect. - In my opinion, decentralization in all these matters is the policy which should be pursued in the interests of the people geneTally. How can this Parliament expect to deal satisfactorily with companies carrydug on business in the smaller towns of the - different States? At all events, it must be more dimcult for the Federal Government to exercise properly such control ""than for the State Governments to do so. Control of small companies in country towns cannot be nearly so well exercised toy the Central Government as by the State - Governments, and that is the reason why - decentralization has been sought by the - creation of local-governing bodies, even - within States. The parliamentary representatives in the State Houses possess all the requisite local knowledge to enable them to attend to the interests of companies of the kind; and it is only right that those interests should be looked after in that way. It might be said, of course, that - there are local representatives in this Parliament ; but the two authorities are not on the same plane, members here not possessing that knowledge of local details which are always at the command of Slate members. All these proposals tend in the one direction of concentrating the control in this Government-in the direction of Unification-and I distinctly object to anything of the sort. It has been asked whether the proposed power will extend to that most powerful corporation or combination in our midst, known as trade unionism. Such questions, however, are rather amusing, because, in my opinion, the "" boot will be on the other foot,"" and the trade unions will control this Parliament with that active outside influence which dominates the constitutional machinery. At the present time trade unionism practically - controls the State Legislatures; and so we see the New South Wales Parliament markedly influenced by the Trades Hall. I do not see what greater power the Commonwealth could have than the control of all companies and combinations, which, I take it, include all trusts and similar bodies, and any two or three men banded together for trade, and registered, would come within this legislation. The Bill before us looks a very simple one; but I do not think that honourable members realise its scope and far-reaching effects. It means the control of the thousands of private, but registered, trading companies throughout Australia, including the wool-selling firms, the great stores, and so forth, which are nearly all limited liability companies. Whether a combination be a trust or a company, and whether it represents a monopoly or not, or whether it be inimical to the public interest or not, it will come within the Bill.",21
79,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member say that a trust or a combine is a registered body?,22
80,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , but a company, which is registered, may be a trust or a combine.",22
81,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about the trust that is not registered?,22
82,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I admit that such a body would not come within the Bill ; but all companies, whether in restraint of trade or otherwise, would be within the control of this Parliament.",22
83,Mr BAMEORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Suppos e they were, what matter?",22
84,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think it is well to give to the Commonwealth the control of all companies of which this Parliament knows nothing. Of course, I know that honourable members opposite are in favour of all trading and industrial matters being brought within the purview of this Parliament. I notice that corporations formed for religious, charitable, scientific, or artistic purposes, and not for the acquisition of gain, are excluded, although they were included in the previous proposed amendment of the Constitution, and I take it that that is because of the serious and reasonable objection? that were raised. Then, again, I see that municipal or governmental corporations are not included; and there is no doubt that, if these amendments be carried, these institutions will very much increase in importance. If we take from the State Parliaments much"" of their importance and many of their functions, more work must devolve upon the municipalities and shire councils, which eventually will be entrusted with the whole of the local governing functions of the State.",22
85,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are not interfering with them.,22
86,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"You are going to put more work on their shoulders, and to increase their responsibilitiesby taking powers from the State Parliaments.",22
87,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are not doing that. Mr RYRIE,-The proposals of the Government are to take from the State Parliaments many of their powers. This Bill provides for taking from them the control, regulation, and dissolution of companies.",23
88,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have not taken away a single power.,23
89,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Bill provides for the vesting of powers in this Parliament should the people approve, and any powers given to us must be taken from the State Parliaments.",23
90,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member says now that we are giving the municipalities too much to do. At the last referendum he said that we were taking away everything from them.,23
91,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not complaining; I am merely stating the position. I say that these local governing bodies must increase daily in importance. Municipalities are excluded from the Bill because, no doubt, of the objections raised to their inclusion on the former occasion.",23
92,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They were not included last time, though it was said that they were. We wish to prevent the recurrence of that misrepresentation.",23
93,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,My reading of the last proposal was that it covered the municipal and shire councils.,23
94,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,So it did.,23
95,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is my opinion. I wish to put on record my protest against this attempt to vest in the Federal Parliament the whole power to control, regulate, and dissolve companies.",23
96,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"East Sydney) [11.45] When addressing the House on a previous occasion, I drew attention to what I thought was the view of the people at the time when Federation was adopted. I feel confident that they thought then that under Federation they would get a companies law applying to the whole of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition admits that such a companies law is essential.",23
97,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I said so on the last occasion.,23
98,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On the last occasion the Opposition wished to have the issues submitted separately, so that electors of all manner of opinions could express their views on each proposal, among them that which we are now considering. Most of the members of the Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of Manufacturers in the various States have, at their annuals meetings, pointed out the disabilities which arise from the want of a universal companieslaw, and at the last Premiers' Conferencean attempt was made to arrive at an understanding which would enable this Parliament to pass such a law. No proposal put. forward at the Conference met with a better acceptance, but those who, like myself, have taken an interest in the publiclife of Australia for the past thirty or forty years, know that it would be' impossible to pass a universal companies law through the six Upper Houses of the States. The members of those Houses are connected with companies, and would try to frame a law in the interests of the companies, and the Premiers soon saw howdifficult it would be to arrive at an agreement by striving to make the State legislation uniform. In some of the States the investors are not properly protected now, while in other States there are good companieslaws. It was intended when Federation* took place, and thirty-nine specified powers were conferred on this Parliament, that we should be able to make laws applicable 10the whole of Australia in those respects. The whole object of the Federation is to make laws on certain subjects to have effect throughout Australia. I am afraid' that the honourable member for North; Sydney has been looking through greert spectacles, because his vision seems to bequite obscured. This measure seems to have caused a perfect nightmare amongst honourable members on the other side. Judging by their speeches, I think that they cannot get much rest. They certainly come here with very erroneous ideas. I hope I may say, without being offensive* that I have never heard honourable membersget so far away from the real question before the House as they have done in this matter of corporations.",23
99,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order .,23
100,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Speaker has to continually exercise his control, and rightly so, too. This Parliament was constituted for the purpose of legislating for the peopleof Australia, but we find that nearly every honourable member on the other side isfighting for State rights.",23

102,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am sorry that I have transgressed, sir. I was only replying to the remarks of members of the Opposition,. - and I regret that I cannot go so far as I tthould like to do. I certainly think that «ome honourable members on the other side would be better in a State House than here; they are not Federalists.",23
103,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order . Will the honourable member confine himself to the question ?,24
104,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A m I going too far now, sir? At the last referendum there was a - complaint that the issue was confused, but now the issue is made perfectly plain, and the people can give a clear vote on this question of extending the Federal control to corporations. The definition of the power in this Bill is very concise, indicating clearly that it is not intended to interfere with the control of the municipalities, which, of course, was not really intended - at the previous referendum. Our opponents then knew very well that the proposed power over corporations did not apply, and was not intended to apply, to those institutions which the States themselves controlled, .because that would be offending against an essential of Democracy. So long as an institution is controlled by the people they are satisfied. The municipalities are controlled by the peopie, and - so, too, are the State Governments. The Federal Parliament never intended to in-tefere with the control of such institutions, but now the proposed power is defined so plainly that I cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition, that is, apart from their belief that the present Government - should not have any other power. That is .apparently their real objection to this proposal, and to my mind it does not show much confidence in the Parliament, be-cause no Parliament will ever go beyond the will of the people.",24
105,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It shows no confidence in the people.,24
106,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Seeing that the Opposition have no confidence in themselves, how can they have confidence in the people? l t will be purely for the people to decide how far we should go in any direction, and what we should do. Under none of these proposals will the Parliament go any tuither than the people permit. No Parliament has ever done that yet, for all the powers we desire to secure to this National Parliament have been exercised by the State Parliaments. All the awful things that weTe depicted to the people as likely to happen if the powers were transferred to this Parliament have never happened under the exercise of them by the State Parliaments. This gloomy talk has been indulged in ever since I have been acquainted with politics. I remember that the same predictions were made in connection with the British Parliament when the question of reform was under discussion,",24
107,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order I,24
108,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It was said that various things would happen if the Reform Bill were passed. These tactics were always resorted to with a view to frighten the people.,24

111,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order !,24
112,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I can quite understand the position on the other side. I hope that when this proposal is put to the people honourable members opposite will not do the same as they did at the last referendum. I understand that I am not allowed to state what took place then, but I believe that statements have been made by some honourable members to whom the people of Australia have been very good in the way of emoluments and positions",24
113,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! Will the honourable member confine himself to the matter before the House?,24

116,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I regret to think that when we are explaining to the people the object of applying for this power to frame a companies law, honourable members on the other side will not be assisting us to state the true position instead of placing that which is contrary to fact before the country., I feel confident that the grant of tMs power will do much to improve industries, to cause the wheels of industry to go round much better, to protect the public from the companies which are not doing that which is in their best interest, and also to give companies an opportunity to trade' throughout Australia. It is generally recognised now that no large business can confine its operations to one State, but finds itself compelled to trade beyond the State. All trading corporations are formed with the view of increasing the volume of their business. Sometimes they are formed to reduce the cost of production. I am not one of those who believe that every company is formed with the view of doing an injustice to the community. There are some companies which have been established to reduce the cost of production, and so enable the consumer to have a say as to the price.",24
117,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order !,25
118,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think that we should encourage the formation of such companies.,25

120,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A m I ? I shall endeavour to keep within the scope of your ruling, sir. I am satisfied that it was always intended that this Parliament should have the power to deal with corporations. There are other matters on which I should like to say a few words, but the Speaker thinks that I am getting beyond the line of demarcation. That is due to my enthusiasm in trying to put the real position before the House; but, of course, I shall bow to the Speaker's ruling, as I do at all times. Mr Willis would not be so notorious as he is if other persons had followed my example. It is the members of the Liberal party who have made Mr Willis notorious.",25
121,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order !,25
122,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that, of all the proposals put before the House, there is not one on which the people of Australia will be found so unanimous as the one under which we ask for power to frame a Companies Act, so that the commercial life of the community may be based on sound principles, and creditors and other persons may be secured against those institutions which, in many cases, have been established, not for the benefit of the public, but for their own gain. We all know that many of our friends have suffered losses through not having a Companies Act to protect the interests of all parties concerned in the ramifications of industrial life under corporations.",25
123,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Illawarra) [11.59] There appears to be some difficulty in the minds of some honourable members who have addressed the House as to the real meaning of paragraph b of clause 2, which readsCorporations formed under the law of the State, including their dissolution, regulation, and control",25
124,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I ask the honourable member not to go into details of a clause of the Bill.,25
125,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not going into details, sir, but trying to arrive at the correct meaning of the clause, if I possibly can.",25
126,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I would point out to the honourable member that that may be done in Committee.,25
127,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I wish to get a clear idea of what this Bill means. It contains only two clauses, and yet some honourable members experience a difficulty in arriving at its true meaning. This morning, the honourable member for Echuca asked the Honorary Minister, in the absence of the Attorney-General, what position trade unions will occupy under it? That seems to me a very simple question, but it elicited no reply. The Bill will empower the Commonwealth to deal with corporations; formed under the law of a State. That iy a very far-reaching and dangerous power tovest in the Commonwealth. It is one which will affect not only the big corporations, but the smaller corporations and companies which have been established by primary producers on co-operative lines, in order to improve their position. In Chambers' Encyclopedia a corporation is defined as "" A body or society authorized by law to> act as one individual."" Under the proposal of the Government, therefore, all ourbutter factories, our co-operative institutions throughout the length and breadth of Australia, which at the present time are subject to State laws, will be brought within the ambit of Commonwealth legislation, and will be dealt by one centralized authority. We all know that in every country today the tendency is to get away from centralization, and consequently it seems the acme of absurdity to attempt to deal with all these organizations from one centre, like that of Melbourne or Yass-Canberra. On behalf of the producers, who have done so much to add to the wealth of Australia, and who will be specially affected by this, proposal, I enter my protest against it. I do not trust the Government which is irv power.",25
128,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable membeFmust think that we are coming back?,25
129,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not. I feel satisfied that the people of Australia have had quite enough of the Labour party, and thaf at the next election they will speak in no uncertain voice. From the utterances off the honourable member for South Sydney and the honourable member for Capricornia, I take it that the institutions to which I have referred, and particularly the dairy farmers of the Commonwealth, will not receive much consideration at the hands of the party opposite if this power be vested in the Commonwealth.",25
130,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Specif y one of the marks to which the honourable member refers.,26
131,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Onl y the other day, the honourable member for South Sydney stated that it was a scandal that this Parliament had not the power to fix the prices of our dairy products.",26
132,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! Will the honourable member confine himself to the question which is before the Chair?,26
133,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall endeavour to do so, and I regret that I was drawn off the track by an interjection.",26
134,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have caught the honourable member making so many incorrect statements.,26
135,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That assertion is absolutely without foundation, and, to use the Honorary Minister's own expression, "" he knows it . """,26
136,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I called the honourable member's attention to his incorrect statements at Mount Gambier, but he refused to qualify them.",26
137,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Order ! I must ask honourable members not to interject, as such conduct only provokes other interjections.",26
138,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I wish also to emphasize that the Coal Vend will come within the scope of this Bill. That vend - as has already been pointed out-wa s created at the instance of the coal miners of Newcastle. It was at their request that the colliery proprietors in that centre entered into a combination for the purpose of raising their wages. We have had Ministers representing that district who have proclaimed that the Vend is a very beneficent institution. No doubt it is. But it cannot ever become a monopoly for the 1 simple reason that the Newcastle field is not the only coal-field in New South Wales. Some eighteen or twenty fields exist in the southern district of Illawarra, and there is also a field at Lithgow. The Vend, therefore, can never become a monopoly, because keen competition exists between the northern, the southern, and the western fields. Consequently there is no necessity for the Vend to be dealt with by Commonwealth legislation. This morning, in answer to a> question by the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister stated that what the Government wanted was one law for the whole Commonwealth, so that the poor man would know that his small investments would be secure. It is not usually suggested that the corporations with which rethe Government are so anxious to deal are institutions in which poor men have the in savings invested, although the share-list of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company includes a number of comparatively poor people who are,, to some extent, dependent upon the dividends paid by that company _ We are all anxious that, in every walk of life, the interests of the poor man shalt be properly protected, but what I should* like to know is how the Government conclude that the poor man's investments inpublic companies will be better protectee* if their operations are controlled by the Commonwealth Parliament than if they are controlled by local Parliaments possessed of a much better knowledge oflocal conditions than this central Parliament can possibly have. In my opinion,, the savings of the poor, and of other persons in the community, can be bettersecured under State legislation and administration than under Commonwealthslegislation with administration from Melbourne or Yass-Canberra. The acceptance of this proposal might give rise to a peculiar anomaly. If the Commonwealth Parliament is placed in a position to deaB with corporations in the way proposed by the Government, we may have two businesses conducted in the same street, one by a corporation, the other by an individualcarried on under the provisions of entirely different laws. The corporation would be carrying on its business under Commonwealth legislation which'would not affect in any way the business carried on by theindividual. When this matter was previously before the House, I made my position perfectly clear, and I have also madeit clear to the electors. Believing, as P do, that the grant of these powers to the Commonwealth Parliament would be injurious, I trust that the people will not-accept the Government proposals. The Minister of Trade and Customs seems to bevery confident as to his own and his party's position in connection with these matters, but I feel equally confident that the peopleof Australia, recognising how dangerous it-would be to vest these powers in a central authority will in the next five or six (months give as decided, if not a more - decided answer to these questions than that which they gave when they were last submitted to them.",26
139,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Richmond) [12.15] - I - do not wish to take up much time in connection with this Bill as there are one or two of the other proposed alterations of the Constitution on which I desire to offer A few remarks, but there is one point .arising under this Bill which I think I - should emphasize. It should always be .remembered that these powers are to be taken from the States. The proposals of the Government do not involve any increase in the total sum of sovereign power exer-cised by the different Legislatures of Australia, but rather a change of venue of the - exercise of particular powers from one Parliament to another. In the circumstances, - any change of the kind proposed should :be amply justified by reasons given to this .House and the country. This particular Bill exemplifies what I may term a desire --to grab the greatest amount of power possible for this Parliament, without any de-finite reasons being given, and I venture to - say without the existence of any such reasons. What we have to guard against more than anything else is the .asking of power for its own sake. The tendency - amongst men is always to secure as much power as they can. I confess that at times I feel the difficulty of this Parliament ing unable to do certait. things owing to - the limitation of its powers. Honourable members opposite ask over and over again, "" Can we not trust the Federal Parliament with this poweT? "" It is not a question of trusting this Parliament. We can always trust it to do its best according to .its lights, in the interests of the country. 'It is a question of the wisdom of investing - this Parliament with any particular power. We have to ask ourselves, "" Can this Parliament exercise the power asked for better than can the State Parliaments?"" We - should not forget that once a power is granted to this Parliament, and is exer-cised, our legislation overrides that of the ""State Parliaments. It has been said that 'the grant of power asked for on the last - occasion did not include the power to deal with municipal corporations, but we have it on the authority of eminent constitu-tional lawyers in Australia that it did, and, in my opinion, they took up a very logical ground. Mr ROBERTS.:-If the honourable member refers to Mr Mitchell, he did not sustain his contention as regards municipal corporations.",27
140,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ves , he did.",27
141,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that Mr Mitchell gave it as his strong opinion that the last measure did ask for that power.. It shows the danger of granting unconditional powers to this Parliament. Once they are given in such terms, they are inclusive of everything coming within them. I do not regard the Constitution as sacrosanct in any way. I quite recognise that as we continue under a Federal form of government circumstances will arise proving the necessity for giving this Parliament additional powers. The necessities of the case at the present time show conclusively that this Parliament has not the power to pass a general companies law in regard to the creation, dissolution and winding up of companies in Australia. That has been proved. I am willing and ready to vote in this House for, and to advocate in the country afterwards, the granting of that power to this Parliament. If this Bill had been so limited, it would have had my vote in this House, and my support in the country. There are other proposals in these measures to which I partly agree, because I think we have had proved the necessity for the granting of certain additional bepowers to the Federal Parliament. When, however, the Government propose to go beyond the proved, necessities of the case, then I think they are asking for power for its own sake, and not to advantage the community. I think that they are asking for this power, not because this Parliament can exercise it better than can the States, but simply because the Attorney-General is desirous of so clothing this Legislature with authority that whatever legislation it passes in regard,to corporations, whether it be for the benefit of Australia or not, cannot be vetoed by the High Court. He desires that this Parliament shall take so wide a power that it will be able to pass any law that it pleases in regard to almost any subject touching corporations, and that that law shall not be subject to the veto of the High Court. That is a very nice position for the Parliament itself to occupy; but, from the point of view of the Australian public, I doubt whether it is wise. The question at issue is not whether this Parliament is to be trusted, but whether. in the division of sovereign rights between the Commonwealth Parliament and the State Parliaments, it is wise to give to this Legislature such wide and far-reaching authority as the Government propose. The honourable member for Flinders and others have dealt so fully with the confusion that must necessarily arise if this Parliament exercises the powers proposed to be taken in regard to the regulation and control of corporations that I do not think I need make any further reference to it. What we unquestionably need is the power to pass a general companies law. As honourable members are aware, a law relating to the creation, dissolution, or winding up of companies does not cover their operations in any way. It has regard only to their creation and dissolution as legal entities under the companies law. It goes no further, and that is all that is necessary from a commercial stand-point. If we attempt, through this Parliament, to build up a whole code of laws under which companies may trade and conduct their business-law s which are bound to conflict with some of the laws of the States-w e shall not only create endless confusion, but override those State laws. We would practically have an automatic power of veto over the whole range of State law in this regard. That, whatever else it is, is certainly not in accordance with the scheme or ideal of a Federal system of government. As Mr Justice Higgins once pointed out, the proposal is big with confusion. Mr. Mitchell described it as a bastard form of government, which would mean neither a Federal nor a Unitary system. It was an attempt; he said, to graft on to the Federal form of government a Unitary system, with all its consequent confusion. If this Parliament obtained and exercised the powers that are now being sought, it would not be long before the people, owing to the confusion that would arise, would cry out for relief, and would accept a Unitary system of government as the easiest way out of the difficulty. For statesmen, as honourable members opposite are supposed to be-whateve r the Opposition are",27
142,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I ask the honourable member to confine his attention to the question before the Chair.,28
143,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do no* intend to do otherwise. I think I am entitled to address myself to the advisableness of altering the Constitution in the direction proposed by this Bill. For statesmen to attempt to so mix up two vitally different principles of government-to attempt to graft one on tr> the other,28
144,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is now going beyond the matter before the Chair.,28
145,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Since this Bill provides for an amendment of one of theparagraphs of section 51 of the Constitution, am I not in order in referring to theprinciples on which constitutions are framed? I take it that the scope of thisBill, so far as it proposes an amendment of the Constitution, is as wide as any of the other Bills dealing with proposed* amendments.",28
146,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is quite wrong.,28
147,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I fail to see how that can be. The titles of these Bills are practically the same-the y are all Bills toalter section 51 of the Constitution.,28
148,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That will not justify the honourable member in discussing at thisstage anything beyond the principles of the Bill now under consideration.,28
149,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not propose to doanything more than that; but I do claim, from you, sir, the right to discuss this Bill, in relation to the Constitution. The Attorney-General, in moving that it be read' a second time, was permitted, not only to deal with the subject with which I am attempting to deal, but to enter upon a long, discussion on trusts and combines. I presume that a similar courtesy will be extended to me.",28
150,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not wish to extend to any honourable member any courtesy or latitude beyond that which is hisright. As the honourable member is aware, when these several Bills to amend the Constitution were introduced, I said that I should allow the widest possible discussion, on the first, but that after that had beendisposed of I should confine honourable members strictly to the subject-matter of the particular Bill before the House. That; was the general understanding, and I desire the honourable member to conform to it.",28

156,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kooyong) T.12.31] - The Attorney-General, in urging why this Bill in regard to corporations - should be passed, stated, among other reasons-wha t is a recognised fact-tha trade and commerce at the present time largely carried on by trading companies corporations. I not only agree with the Attorney-General in that respect, but realise that the preponderance of trade commerce is nowadays carried on in that particular way. He urged that for that reason the Federal Government should have the most complete control in the regulation of corporations. Trading corporations so well recognised at the present time, have grown so popular, that there is no doubt that they not only invite, but defirst, mand, the attention of this and other liaments. A most comprehensive measure was passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1908. I refer to the Companies Act. Legislation based upon that Act has also been passed by the Parliaments of several of the Australian States. In Victoria, was passed with certain additions, and aresome rigid provisions in certain respects were inserted. Two classes of companies are commonly known to commerce, and will be very seriously affected by this measure. One is that which is known as the proprietary or private company. Within the last few years it has become a practice - of leading firms to carry on their business means of proprietary companies. A pro-' he prietary company is the same as a private company under the English law. Two The men can create a company. It is a very justifiable and convenient course to resort to. It permits the division of a business into shares. For family reasons it is a useful method of dividing up interests. It Conalso has the advantage that there is a to do so. limited liability.",29
157,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It has also the advanthat shares can be deposited with a,29
158,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly so. as The formation of such companies is a Therefore, in dealing with corporations we have are dealing with an important element It behoves us, for this reason, to offer the utmost facilities to for companies to carry on their business. In addition to proprietary companies, there are public companies, in which the public are more or less interested. It is in connection with such companies that efforts are being made by legislation to secure the utmost protection to the public. The Attorney-General made a statement which, I think, is hardly borne out by the law as t it stands. He said that it was practically is impossible in Australia to obtain any inor formation in regard to companies. My honourable friend was greatly in error in I that regard. In regard even to private and companies, full publicity is demanded by the terms of the law. The Victorian Companies Act of 1910 makes provision as to what shall be done by all companies, including private companies. It is necessary are that every company having a share capital and shall, once at least in every year, make a list of all persons who, at the date of the or of the only ordinary general meetParing in the year, are members of the company, and of persons who have ceased to be members since the date of the last meeting ; or, in the case of a first return, since the incorporation of a company. Further particulars are also required by the law it to be given. I may enumerate what they ' (a) The'amount of the share capital of the company, and the number of the shares into which it is divided; (i) The number of shares taken from the commencement of the company up to the date of the return; (c) The amount called up on each share; (d) The total amount of calls received, inclusive of application and allotment moneys; (e) The total amount of calls unpaid; (/) The total amount of the sums (if any) paid by way of commission in respect of any shares or debentures, or allowed by way of discount in respect of any debentures since the date of the last return; (g) The total number of shares forfeited; (h) The total amount of shares or stock for which share warrants are outstanding at the date of the return; (>) The total amount of share warrants issued and surrendered respectively since the date of the last return; (k) The number of shares or amount of stock comprised in each share warrant; (J) The names and addresses of the persons who, at the date of the return, are the directors of the company, or occupy the position of directors by whatever named called; and (m) The total amount of debts due from the company in respect of all mortgages and charges which are required to be registered by the Registrar-General under this Act, or which would have been required so to be registered if created after the twenty-fourth day of December, One thousand eight hundred and ninety-six. Any company which fails in these respects is liable to considerable fines. It is quite true that proprietary companies are not compelled to file balance-sheets for public inspectiop. There is really no reason why they should be. None of us is compelled to file a balance-sheet in regard to our private affairs. Proprietary companies are really private companies, and there is no reason why they should be required to disclose their private balance-sheets. But where the public is interested, and is invited to take shares good faith is a vital factor, and the law requires full publicity. The utmost precaution is taken. I was a member of a State Government which introduced, I suppose, the most rigid and stringent company law which has ever been in force in Australia, and many of the features of which are now being adopted elsewhere. I am now dealing with the contention of the Attorney-General that, under the present law, sufficient information is not given to the public, and that, therefore, it is necessary that the proposed powers should be given to the Commonwealth Parliament. So far as public companies are concerned, it is provided, by section 115 of the Victorian Act(2) Every company, and the directors and manager thereof(a) shall cause to be kept proper books of account, in which shall be kept full , true, and complete accounts of the affairs and transactions of the company; and (b) shall once at least in each year, and at intervals of not more than fifteen* months, cause the accounts of thecompany to be balanced, and a balance-sheet to be prepared, which, balance-sheet, after being duly audited, shall be laid before the members of the company in general meeting; and' (c) shall cause a copy of such balance-sheet so audited to be sent to the registered, address of every member of the company at least seven days before themeeting. . . . (d) shall forthwith cause to be filed with the Registrar-General a copy of such balance-sheet, and of any auditor's report attached thereto or thereon referred* to; and (e) shall cause to be forthwith posted up, and until the posting up of the next following balance-sheet, kept posted"" up, a printed copy of the same in aconspicuous place in the registerd office of the company, and in every .branch, ofiice where the business of the company is carried on, and every creditor of or shareholder in the company, o r any person acting in his behalf, shalb be entitled to a copy thereof on payment of Sixpence. (3) The balance-sheet shall be audited by thecompany's auditors as hereinafter provided, and* shall contain a summary of the share capital of the company, its liabilities, and its assets, giving such particulars as will disclose the general"" nature of those liabilities and assets, and thebalance-sheet shall include a statement of profit and loss. The balance-sheet may, in the case of a banking company, and shall in the case of any other company, be in one of the forms in the Second* Schedule to this Act, or to the like effect, and comply with the directions (if any) at the foofr of the form. Not only are the requirements very stringent in regard to public companies, so far as the disclosures to be made are concerned, but in the schedules, which I need not quote now, further information is provided for. The Attorney-General, I think, quite overlooked the public requirements made by the laws of the several States in thi* regard; and it is not necessary to clothethe Commonwealth Parliament in order to get more complete information than that already obtainable.",29

160,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not heard 1 from the other side any reply to the argument of the honourable members on this side, and to the statement of high judicial authority, that an extraordinary anomalywould be created if the Federal Government had power to make laws regarding; corporations, and it were left to the States to make laws regarding individuals carrying on the same business. It would create an extraordinary state of things if , in any branch of trade or commerce, corporations were subject to one law and individuals to another.",30
161,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What has the honourable - member in his mind?,31
162,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The embarrassment and confusion suggested by Mr Justice Higgins and others. I wish to deal with the subject from its practical aspect. Although trade and commerce, as the Attorney-General has said, is carried on for - the most part by corporations, a substantial part of it is carried on by individuals.",31
163,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What regulation would apply to a company which would not also - apply to an individual?,31
164,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is difficult to foresee exactly what would happen, but the States have within the ambit of their powers the right to regulate the carrying on of trade, and may prescribe certain regulations in regard to a particular trade. But if the proposals before us are carried, it will be within the competence of the'Federal Parliament to prescribe regulations for the conduct of corporations in that trade, and the Federal law would not necessarily 'be consonant with the State law. For - ihat l have the authority of men like Mr. Justice Higgins, who has great judicial and political experience, and occupies a position which gives him a view bounded *by a very wide horizon. No honourable member opposite has attempted to answer - that objection to this proposal, which, in - my opinion, is unanswerable.",31
165,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member has not given us a concrete case.,31
166,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have already .referred the honourable member to numerous instances cited in the oft-quoted judgment in the Huddart Parker case of Mr. Justice Higgins. The company laws - of the States are not now in absolute agreement, and if it were possible to have a uniform law, it would be a good thing; but it is not what is proposed. The proposition is not to provide for the regulation of a particular trade, but to provide for the regulation of that trade so far as it may be carried on by corporations. I - do not urge this difficulty from a party stand-point, and it has, as I have said, 'been suggested by the Judiciary. Mr HIGGS.^-Difficultie s relating to - wages or labour conditions would be dealt - with under another measure.",31
167,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am thinking of the regulation and control of companies. I am in favour of a portion of the proposals of the Government, realizing that we should have uniformity in regard to the initiation, registration, and dissolution of companies. At the present time, a company has to be registered' in every State in which it does business, and to have one Australian registration would be a very substantial convenience. Similarly, when a company that has been registered in several States dissolves, there must be a separate winding up in each State-separat e assets and separate division amongst creditors. This causes difficulty and confusion. There should be a proper distribution of the assets of a company among its creditors as a whole.",31
168,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Shoul d we not deal with companies between the time of their formation and the time of their dissolution?,31
169,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That would involve regulation; and in that matter you have the practical difficulty that there may be one law applying to companies and another to individuals.,31
170,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Coul d not individuals be dealt with under the trade and commerce power ?,31
171,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think so. Besides, each proposed amendment of the Constitution is to be submitted by itself, and one may be accepted and another rejected.",31
172,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Our proposals are a complete whole.,31
173,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In that case, they should be submitted as one proposal.",31
174,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Opposition objected to that last time.,31
175,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should object to it now, because I do not regard the proposals as a complete whole; but 1 say that each proposal should be complete in itself. The proposal regarding companies should be complete in itself if the difficulty to which I have referred is to be avoided. Should the people accept this proposal and reject the trade and commerce proposal, there would be an incomplete amendment of the Constitution. Does my honourable friend think that that is desirable?",31
176,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; I want the lot.,31
177,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then the honourable member must put all the amendments together. But they are being puti separately, and, therefore, each amend- ment ought to be complete in itself. ' Mr HOWE-When we put them together the honourable member's party said that we did the wrong thing.",31
178,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is no reason why an incomplete amendment should be submitted separately. Intra-State porations ought certainly to he subject to the domestic control of the State in which they carry on operations. That is a contingency which has to be contemplated. The Attorney-General has not attempted to meet the practical difficulty which has been raised by members of the Opposition, and, from his stand-point, by a greater authority than they are. I refer to Mr Justice Higgins. Take the law of libel as an example. A particular law of libel may be enacted by this Parliament in regard to corporations, and a totally different libel law may be enacted by a State applicable to individuals carrying on the same business. Under the circumstances the Bill is incomplete, and I would urge the Government, having regard to the real and practical difficulties which have been pointed out by men of great experience, to consent to strike out of clause 2 the words "" regulation and control."" If that course be followed, it will certainly alter my views on this Bill, because I am prepared to support a proposal to empower the Commonwealth to legislate in regard to the creation and dissolution of corporations, and I make that statement as one who has had some little practical experience in connection with company law.",32
179,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is not this Bill ani improvement upon the present system?,32
180,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It will be a great improvement upon the present system from the stand-point of creation and dissolution of corporations. I would support such an amendment in every possible way, but its value is being largely discounted by the introduction of the words "" regulation and control."" - Mr Fenton - The omission of those words would practically cut the heart out of the Bill.",32
181,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . The measure would then achieve a very practical result in that it would permit of the uniform registration and winding up ot companies. Substantial results can achieved by striking out the words "" regulation and control.""",32
182,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wimmera) [3.20] I think that every honourable member would welcome an amendment of the powers vested in. this Parliament by the Constitution so far as corporations are concerned. Experience has demonstrated the necessity for such an amendment. The difference between honourable members opposite and* members of the Opposition, seems to recor- solve itself into one of degree. This is a question which requires to be dealt with deliberately. An amendment of the companies law, which would render it possible for this Parliament to legislate for companies all over Australia, is a question* which has not merely an Australian' but an Imperial interest. I would remind honourable members that at the Colonial Conference which was held in London in1907, the question of a uniform companieslaw was debated. At that gathering MT. Lloyd-George moved- 1 That it is desirable, as far as circumstancespermit, to secure greater uniformity in the company laws of the Empire, and that the memorandum and analyses prepared on this subject by the Imperial Government be commended to theconsideration of the various Governments represented at this Conference. Sir Wilfrid Laurier thought that the proposal might be accepted. The chairman* agreed with him, as also did Mr Deakin. So that the Conference affirmed not only that we should have a uniform companieslaw in Australia, but that, as far as possible, a uniform companies law should' operate over the whole Empire. Consequently, this question is one of more than? Australian interest. That should be a sufficient justification for action being taken to empower the Commonwealth to deal with corporations all over Australia. In the Huddart Parker case it was clearly shown> that the conflict between Federal and State laws rendered both, to a large extent, ineffective, and that some amendment of the Constitution was therefore essential. Thepoint at which the Opposition part company with the Government has reference to the regulation and control of corporations. No impartial reader of the speeches delivered by the honourable member for Angasand the honourable member for Flinders can be other than convinced that if we include the words ""regulation and control "" in this Bill we shall propagate the endless confusion which was alluded to by Mr. be Justice Higgins. I am sure that honourable members are not anxious to secure an amendment of the Constitution which will cause Commonwealth laws to be enacted; which will come into direct conflict with State laws in matters over which the Stateshave complete jurisdiction. A good' deal of confusion exists in regard to corporations, trusts, and combines. I believe we should have power to enact a uniform companies - law, and that we should have power to prescribe the methods to be followed in the creation and dissolution of companies. The - question of corporations is distinct from that of trusts and combines. Not long ago I read of an American trust which was formed out of quite a number of companies. The trust held a majority of the shares in each of those companies, although the corporation existed separately from the trust itself. It would be possible, of course, for the different companies to disappear. In one instance, they did disappear, so that what was formerly a trust became merged in a huge corporation. In cases of that kind it might be necessary 'incidentally to have control over trusts and combines after they have merged into a huge corporation. Possibly that could be dealt with' under the heading of monopolies. If we could prescribe the conditions under which companies or corporations shall come into existence, and the methods of dissolution which shall be followed, we should go a long way towards preventing the development of trusts and combines. Why should it not be possible for this Parliament to prescribe pany starting in any business shall not be allowed to hold shares in any other company, and thus prevent trusts which might be formed out of corporations from springing into existence?",32
183,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member would cripple some of the best companies in Australia. Nearly all our dairy companies are registered in that way.,33
184,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At the present time we cannot foresee how far legislation ought to operate. But it may be possible by means of legislation to prevent the growth of huge trusts and monopolies out of the operations of individual corporations which may pool their shares in order to gain a monopoly in any industry. When this question was before us on the last occasion - it was submitted in a very similar form. But I am glad to see that the Government fliave recognised the danger, which we then pointed out, of the possible encroachment of the Federal power upon municipal and State powers. But the most objectionable portion of their proposal still remains, namely, the "" regulation and control "" of corporations, to which legal members of the House have already referred. On the last occasion the Government sought to substitute for the power vested in the Federal Parliament to deal with corporations, the power to regulate and control them. On behalf of the whole Opposition, I believe, the honourable member for Angas took exception to the introduction of the words "" regulation and control,"" and moved their omission so that the Parliament would have power to make laws with respect to the creation and dissolution of corporations. That amendment was rejected, but Ministers apparently have not profited by the weighty arguments which were then adduced in support of it.",33
185,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The chances are that if we had proposed such an amendment on this occasion some other objection would have been raised by the Opposition.,33
186,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member should be able to discuss a question of this kind on its merits.,33
187,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The point that I wisned to make was that even if some honourable members ot the Opposition on the last occasion did speak in favour of a certain amendment it is quite possible that on this occasion, if a similar proposal had been made they would have spoken against it.",33
188,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That does not alter that a com- the merits of the case.,33
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister is not allowed to change his opinions.,33
190,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A wholesome feature of our party is that we are entitled to hold different opinions on various questions. Members who are not prepared to profit by information obtained in the course of a debate in this House are not fit to represent the people. The whole House is unanimously in favour of power being secured to pass a uniform companies law, but one cannot read the debate that has taken place on this question, or listen to the criticism levelled at the Government proposal, without feeling convinced that its adoption would lead to endless confusion between the States and the Commonwealth. On the other hand, the proposal made on the last occasion, by the honourable member for Angas, would give this Parliament all the power it requires to pass a uniform companies law. According to leading authorities-includin g Mr Justice Higgins - whos e opinions have been quoted in this House, the proposed amendment of the Constitution now before us would lead to endless confusion between the States and the Commonwealth. If it were adopted we should have one set of laws, passed by 4he Commonwealth, and another passed by the States, controlling and regulating companies in Australia.",33
191,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Brin g them all under """" trade and commerce.""",34
192,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is another point.,34
193,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is a very sore point for honourable members opposite. It ought not to be mentioned.,34
194,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is referring to a Bill which was dealt with last night. There seems to be a disposition on the part of honourable members opposite to side-track the issue. Whilst I admire the Attorney-General's eloquence, and have listened with great interest to many of his speeches on important questions, I certainly think that the speech in which he dealt with the proposed enlargement of our powers in respect of corporations and companies was disappointing. He scarcely dealt with the merits of the question, and we have had to depend on the analytical legal elaborations of the honourable member for Angas, and the honourable member for Flinders, to enlighten us as to the real scope of the proposed amendment. At the Imperial - Conference in 1907 a resolution in favour of a uniform companies law was agreed to. Surely if the subject was of sufficient importance to be considered by the Conference-if it vitally affects the financial and trading concerns of the whole Empire-this Parliament should lose no time in asking the people to give it power to deal with corporations and companies.",34
195,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That would be a useful proposal, but would provide very poor political capital.",34
196,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am afraid that is so.,34
197,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member's party was in power for about two years after that Conference was held; but, as usual, it did nothing in regard to the passing of a uniform companies law.",34
198,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know that that is any reason why we should delay any further. On the last occasion, the present Government rejected an amendment proposed by the Opposition which would have given the Commonwealth full power over companies, whether operating in one State or more; and they come forward today with the same old proposal which would lead to the difficulties so graphically described by Mr Justice Higgins in the Huddart Parker case. It should have been possible to arrive at a unanimous vote on this question, considering that there is no difference of opinion on the part of honourable members as to the necessity for a uniform law. Instead of dealing with the question separately, however, the Government are mixing it up with something else relating to corporations which is foreign to the subject, andi must make the exercise of the whole power confusing, if not abortive. _\ am glad that the honourable member for Indi is present, because I wish now to refer to a statement made by him a few evenings ago.",34
199,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member will not be in order in replying ro a speech made by the honourable member for Indi upon another Bill.,34
200,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for Indi made the charge that the defeat of the Government proposals at the last referenda was due to the expenditure of large sums of money by this party.,34
201,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honorabie member cannot deal with that matter.,34
202,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It relates to the whole question of corporations.,34
203,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Honourable members had ample opportunity, during the discussion on the first of these Bills, to deal with all such matters. The honourable member now states that he desires to reply to a statement made by the honourable member for Indi, who has not spoken to the question now before the Chair. That being so, he must refer to a statement made by the honourable member for Indi during a debate on some other measure. He would not be in order in discussing that matter.",34

211,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I cannot argue with the honourable member. I have already told him that he cannot reply to a speech made by the honourable member for Indi on another question. He is now trying to evade my ruling. If he does that, he will not only be discourteous to the Chair, but will be guilty of a grave breach of parliamentary procedure.",35
212,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I rise to a point of order. My point of order is that, in the debate on this Bill relating to corporations, every honourable member is entitled to address himself to any argument relevant to corporations and in doing so is entitled to refer to any utterance by any other member at any time. Your ruling, Mr. Speaker, as I understand it, was that, while in the discussion on the first Bill we were permitted to deal with every subject relevant to any of the Bills, we are now confined solely to this particular Bill. I submit, however, that in dealing with the Bill before us an honourable member is entitled torefer to any utterance of any honourable member relevant to it no matter when the utterance might be made. If such reference is not allowed it certainly completely cripples discussion on these measures. Mr Fenton,-The discussion would be of undue length.",35
213,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not a question of undue length; if there is improper reiteration there is another mode of dealing with it. Mr SPEAKER^-The point of order that has been raised has nothing to do with the position taken up by the honourable member for Wimmera). That honourable member distinctly stated that he was going to reply to the speech made by the honourable member for Indi the other evening; and I ruled that such a reply is not in order. The honourable member for Wimmera then sought to evade that position; and he must not do so. He has no right to reply to a speech made on a question that has already beeri settled.,35
214,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,May I say a word in> explanation ?,35
215,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I cannot allow any further discussion. The honourable member must proceed with his speech, or resume his seat.",35
216,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I merely intended to show the relevancy of the remarks of the honourable member for Indi to the subject before us.,35
217,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member did not say that, but said that he wasgoing to reply to a speech of the honourable member for Indi on another Bill.",35
218,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gippsland) [3.48] - The whole of the discussion turns on the useof the words ""regulation and control."" Until I heard the honourable member for Echuca and the honourable member for North Sydney, I understood that all parties were agreed that it was desirable to have a uniform company law; but now I find that on this, as on many other matters, the Opposition are divided. In our desire for a uniform company law, it appears to me not sufficient to confine ourselves to the words ""creation and dissolution."" When the subject was last discussed here, the honourable member for Flinders pointed this out very clearlyI think that if this amendment (to leave out "" regulation and control "" ) were carried it would* give a general control over corporations, but limited to what lawyers call the status, or, inmore general terms, the constitution of companies, the oonditions under which they arebrought into existence, and those under which they come to an. end. That does not appear to me to be sufficient. We do not desire a general law limited' merely to the bringing into existence ancE the dissolution of companies. The honourable member for Flinders went on to sayI should not object to including in the Federalpower everything that is included in the ordinary company. law. That is to say, everything dealing with the formation-and regulation in a narrow sense : that is regulation as to the duties of companies in publishing balance-sheets,, and so forth-and the dissolution of companies. If we are not to be able under the proposed amendment of the Constitution to make a uniform company law as to the duties of companies in regard to balance sheets, and so forth, we need not bother about any amendment. We do not desiremerely to establish and dissolve companiesunder a uniform law-w e require a general law to take the place of the various Statelaws.",35
219,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are all with the honourable member as to that. The only question is how to do it.,35
220,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is certain that if the - words "" regulation and control"" be left - out, the case will not be met. The honourable member for Flinders on a previous - occasion also said I should, perhaps, prefer a somewhat different - general wording from that proposed by the honourable member for Angas, but I do not feel that I could take the responsibility of going the matter. If there is no one to suggest the words that will give us the exact control desired, the best course is to take the greater control, and trust to the sanity of the Government and Parliament to limit its exercise to the management, balance-sheets, and so forth.",36
221,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wilmot) [3.50] - I take it that the idea of this Bill is to give the Commonwealth Parliament an opportunity to pass a uniform company law to meet the varying conditions of the country. With that idea I am heartily in sympathy; .and it may easily be carried out without .going to anything like the extent now proposed. The judgment of the High Court : in the Huddart Parker case shows that our present power does not allow us to exercise .any control over corporations after they .have once started operations; and I do not know that, as a Federal Parliament, we need any such power. If we have the control of the starting and the dissolution of companies, we can impose such conditions as to insure that only corporations - of which we approve shall come into existance. When once a company is launched under the conditions to be imposed, it is only right that it should then come - within the various State laws. There has ""been no demand on the part of the business people for more than I have indicated; and the Attorney-General has not, in any of his speeches, shown why any further power should be granted. I am afraid that at the election the public will become very confused as to the distinction between this amendment and the amendment to give us power to deal with trusts and combines ; and if they read the Attorney-General's speeches they can only become the more confused. Mr Justice Higgins, in the Huddart Parker case, pointed out the peculiar position that would arise if the words "" regulation and control "" were retained. We should have the Commonwealth passing a law to regulate a business carried on by a corporation, while a precisely similar business, carried on by a private person, would be quite outside the - powers of the Commonwealth. Under the circumstances, the retention of the words is not only unnecessary, but ridiculous. I hope that honourable members opposite will remember that this is not a question for Parliament, but for the people, and will endeavour to enlighten the public, as far as possible, by laying the facts before into them. I am quite satisfied that the people of Australia are sensible enough to see how unnecessary this proposed amendment is, and to reject it as on a previous occasion. My only fear, as I have said, is that the people will confuse this particular Bill with the Bill relating to trusts and combines ; and this makes it all the more necessary that the case should be fairly put before them.",36
222,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member said just now that the people would be intelligent enough to reject the proposal.,36
223,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the case is fairly put, the intelligence of the people will prevail.",36
224,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Will the honourable member allow me, as a layman, to say that he will lose his legal reputation if he goes to such lengths?",36
225,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I could quote the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins at length, but I merely allude to it, considering that it has been quoted before; but if there is one Judge on the High Court Bench who ought to appeal to my honourable friends opposite he is the man. The Opposition have always favoured the strengthening of the power of the Commonwealth in regard to corporations; and the public, when they know this fact, will realise the lengths to which the Government proposal goes, while conferring no benefit. Surely the people will see that it is to their interest to hold their hands until there is a party in power prepared to give them the legislation that is necessary. The honourable member for Indi made a. remark concerning corporations",36
226,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for Indi has not yet spoken on this Bill.,36
227,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I was going to say that the remarks of the honourable member for Indi were relevant to this particular amendment.,36
228,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is now proposing to reply to a speech delivered on another occasion. I see that he has Hansard before him.,36
229,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not wish to use Hansard.,36
230,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member cannot reply to a speech made on another occasion.,37
231,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I thought, Mr. Speaker, that, when you were giving a ruling a few moments ago, you said that the honourable member for Wimmera was out of order because he did not show that what he was about to say was relevant to the subject of corporations.",37
232,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . Mr ATiKINSON - I shall not attempt to press the matter further, but I am very sorry that I cannot use a very good answer that I have here to the honourable member for Indi. There is great danger that the public will not get fairly and clearly into their minds the distinction tween this amendment and another that is proposed, and great harm may thereby result to the community. If we take the power over corporations which is proposed, it is a guinea to a gooseberry that endless trouble will afterwards arise from the clashing of Federal and State laws, which will cause taxpayers to be heavily mulcted in a series of law suits. The power asked for will enable us to go much further than is needed, and harm will result. I do not know why the Attorney-General asks for an excessive grant of power, because he said nothing in support of his demand. His speeches only tend to inflame the lic mind against ""corporations as against trusts and combines, although much that he has said has been contradicted by the speeches of those on this side of the ber. With a little common sense, the Government might bring about a satisfactory solution of our difficulties, and then we might have on the statute-book before very long a proper company law for the whole of Australia. The words "" the creation and dissolution of corporations"" would give us all the power we need. Once a corporation has been formed, each State is able to police it better than the Federation; but the power to pass laws governing the creation of corporations will enable us to lay down all the conditions with which they must comply. The power asked for, however, would enable us to pass all sorts of laws clashing with State legislation, to the injury of the taxpayers. I appeal to the Attorney-General to dismount from his high horse, and propose what the people need. He has not told us why he makes an excessive demand, or what he intends to do with the powers for which he asks, and the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins shows that the adoption of his proposals will in the end produce a silly state of the law. The words "" regulation and control "" are mere ridiculous excess. Debate (on motion by Mr ROBERTS) adjourned. NA (TRUSTS) BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 21st November (vide page 5840), on motion by Mr. HUGHESThat this Bill be now read a second time.",37
233,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [4.7] - I spoke incidentally on the trust question when dealing with the commerce power, and beagain when following the Attorney-General in the debate on the corporation power; but there are, nevertheless, one or two matters to which I wish now to direct attention, as relevant to the question whether the amendment proposed to the people should be agreed to by them in the terms of the Bill. This proposal is a modification of that submitted at the last referendum. The word "" trusts "" is now added. That is an improvement. It confers, but unnecessarily extends, a power that I suggested should be conferred, the power has to regulate trusts, combines, and monopolies in restraint of trade in any pub- State or part of the Commonwealth. The word "" trust"" has a well-defined 1 meaning in America, as I could show by quoting legal authorities, which justifies it8 Cham- use in this Bill. The power asked for has been widened by the employment of the words "" in relation to the production "" instead of the words, '' in restraint of production."" In all the cases which have been decided in England and America the gist of the charge has been operations in restraint of trade. The Bill gives a power to legislate for the control of operations which may not amount to a restraint upon trade, production, or manufacture. The use of the words "" production "" and ""manufacture"" widens the scope of the power still further. "" Manufacture "" includes primary products transformed by labour, as I shall show by referring to the Sugar case decision in America. It is not correct to say that the anti-trust legislation of the United States of America has failed, though it would be correct to say that human energy and legislative wisdom cannot compass alt the evils of trusts unless all the powers which are to hand* including the revision - of the Tariff, are employed. In America the Tariff power has not yet been used. It is the tremendous complexity and extent of the interests involved in such cases as those of the Standard Oil Trust, the Steel Trust, the Tobacco Trust, and others that has, to some extent, discounted the effects of judgments sustaining the application of the provisions of the Sherman law to the operations of the trusts. I regret that the States, except New South Wales to some extent, have not yet legislated in this matter; but whether the Commonwealth or the States exercise the power we shall still be faced by the mass of obstacles which, by the growing complexity and magnitude of modern commerce and industry is placed in the way of all legislative attempts, however well directed, to control commercial or industrial operations. If one looks into the American decisions, and into the reports presented for the guidance of Congress and some of the State Parliaments, it will be found that it is these obstacles chiefly which have made ineffective some of the judgments of the Federal Court, and many of the judgments of the State Courts. In America thirty-seven States have legislation directed against trusts, and there is nothing to prevent the Australian States from passing even more efficacious laws directed against the growing tendency to form trusts and combines. That there is a growth which in time will certainly become pernicious none would deny. Whether it is due to the protection afforded by our import duties, or would occur under ordinary conditions, is a question that I shall not discuss ""in this debate. It may be asked, If there is a tendency for the establishment of arrangements and combinations in Australia which will ultimately injure the consumer, and the States have done nothing to prevent it, why should not the Commonwealth interfere? I would give the power to the Commonwealth for reasons set forth in the memorandum that has been referred to once or .twice, but I would not give it as proposed in this Bill. I would give ample power to deal with all restraints of trade. The words "" restraint of trade "" have a recognised meaning in English law, and also in relation to our local jurisprudence, because a case, Collins v. Lock, 4, A.C., 674, was decided in the Privy Council about T879, l n nexion with the operations of some firms in Melbourne, in which the principle of what [3] 2 T was unreasonable restraint of trade by combinations was declared. The political reason advanced in favour of extending this power and making it as wide as the proposition before us is that the States have failed to do anything because their Upper Houses are more Conservative than our Senate. As a matter of fact, no attempt has been made, even by State Labour Governments, to introduce measures dealing with combines and trusts. The Upper Houses of the States cannot be blamed for failing to pass legislation which has never been presented to them. In 1908, a measure was passed in the New South VVales Legislature making an offence an act which might be committed by either Labour or Capital, and may be described as a violation of the statutory law regarding conspiracy. The question arose as to whether certain prosecutions should be instituted under our Australian Industries Preservaticn Acts in connection with a coal strike, or whether the matter should be dealt with by the State authorities. It struck me at the time that the State had ample power to deal with it, and that it was not for us to interfere, if we could not justify our interference, on general and clear legal grounds, with the right of the men to strike. They were prosecuted under the State Act and at common law. Since then there has not, I think, been any attempt made to introduce another measure into the State Parliaments, and, therefore, I trust we shall hear no more of the political reason for agreeing to this Bill, namely, that the Conservative branches of the State Parliaments have blocked legislation in this direction. I do not object to extending the power of the Commonwealth in respect ot trusts. I have looked closely into the authorities mentioned by the Attorney General, and I have read every line of the articles in the July number of the Annals of the American Academy of Social and Political Science, in which this question of trusts is carefully considered. I think that Mr Seager put the case strongly from the point of view of those who are directing their energies against trusts. But something has been said in extenuation of the acts of the Steel Corporation in America, where, however, so far from trusts being beneficial in their operations, the position is that while they did injure c o n _ the consumer, they did not protect labour. The hours worked by the majority of the men engaged on blastfurnaces in America,' according to one writer, is twelve hours a day, and 20 per cent, of 153,000 of the employees in blast furnaces, steel works, and rolling mills work seven days a week. Of - course, in their position, as one of the Courts statedwithout some power representing the workman, acting as a check on the great powers of the poration, there can be no real democracy in the steel mill industries. It is for that reason that on the last occasion when it was proposed'to amend the Constitution to confer power on this Parliament to deal with trusts, combinations, and monopolies, an offer was made by the Opposition to concede the power to deal with trusts, combinations, and monopolies whose operations were in ^restraint o l trade or manufacture, though manufacture may not be necessary - no matter whether they were confined to one State or extended throughout the Commonwealth. I still think that it would be better to have one law applicable to all these combines, so that they would not, in respect of their State operations, be subject to one law, and in respect to their Inter-State operations, be subject to another law. The morality of the law would be more recognised in a homogenous community like ours if the same penalty were imposed for the same offence.  assist in doing away with the miserable rate of pay to which the honourable member has referred?",37
234,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I merely mentioned that the plea which was urged that the trust was beneficial to labour is not borne out by recent reports. But I may tell the honourable member, without offering anything more than a prima facie opinion, that if the Commonwealth be vested with direct powers over trusts, combinations, and mono- polies, in relation to production, manufacture, or supply, it will be within our power to do what we like. ",39
235,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . But that is not necessary, because, if the commerce power which is sought under another Bill, be conferred upon the Commonwealth, it will be found that this power is included in that. iSimilarly this power is covered, to some extent, by the power which is sought in the Constitution Alteration (Corporations) Bill. Consequently, we are unnecessarily multiplying our powers. I do not know that under the power to deal with trusts, combinations, and monopolies in restraint of trade we could not control prices to the extent that is necessary. The power possessed by the United States of America is the power to regulate jtrade and commerce among the States, with foreign countries, and with Indian tribes. Under that power corit has been decided, in the case of In re Green, that Congress can regulate freights and prices in relation to Inter-State commerce. That was a case in which it attempted to regulate the profits of a corporation which was formed under a State law. The Court held that, while Congress could not control the operations of that combination in regard to domestic commerce, it could control its operations in regard to Inter-State commerce..",39
236,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Unde r the power conferred by the Constitution?,39
237,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . But if that power be widened in the way that the Government propose, I believe that we could control prices, as they are attempting to do in America. In that country, the power to regulate freights by means of the Inter-State Commission has been deduced from the commerce power. The power to prescribe freights has been conferred on that Commission, and has been exercised under the commerce power. But I would like to refer to the question of controlling production and manufacture. It has been said that unless we are empowered to control manufacture we cannot possibly deal with alleged trusts, such .as the Sugar Refining Trust in America. I do not want to prejudge the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in Australia. But in America it has been held that, so long as the Sugar Refining Trust produces and sells to Inter-State purchasers or directly sends its products into the stream of commerce, whether Inter-State or external, it is, under the commerce power, subject to the control of Congress. The first case decided in America was what is known as the Sugar case. In it the prosecution failed. It was the first case brought under the Act of 1890. Subsequently the company was successfully prosecuted. In 1908, after a little more experience had been gained of the operation of the Anti-Trust Acts, the prosecution was successful. The reason why it failed in the first instance was because the operations of the trust had no relation to commerce or trade at all. The Sugar Refining Company took over control of the four other concerns. They were all Pennsylvania corporations. The direct sales by the trust were for consumption within the States. The sales for consumption outside the States were made by the primary purchasers from the trust, and not uncler any arrangement between the trust and themselves. Hence there could be no successful charge brought against an amalgamation which directly related to manufacture, and did not relate to sales for the purpose of commerce. In 1908 the question of the trust again cropped up. In the meantime there have been several successful prosecutions. There was a prosecution of a combine in connection with the supply of iron pipes throughout America, in what is known as the Addyston iron pipe industry. In that case the distinction between it and the Sugar case was referred to. It was mentioned that in the Addyston Pipe case, which was decided in 1899, every member of the Court endorsed the view of Mr Justice Harlan, who was the dissenting Judge in the Sugar case, thatTliere was proof that the combine was engaged in disposing of their manufactured goods in diverse States; ""and that such proof, the majority of the Court held, was lacking in the Knight case. In a subsequent case, Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company v. American Sugar Refining pompany, 166, Federal Reporter, page 254, the latter company was prosecuted, and successfully prosecuted, because it attempted, by controlling manufacture, to control the operations of a rival manufacturing company by limiting the volume of exports from Pennsylvania to other parts of the United States of America. That circumstance shows that, if a prosecution of some of our local companies were instituted under our Anti-Trust Acts as they stand, it does not follow that that prosecution would fail. In that case it was mentionedI f a contract in restraint of trade products within the limits of a State it is subject only to State laws, any remote or incidental effect on Inter-State commerce being insufficient to bring it within the Federal law; but if , in addition, it attempts to control the disposition of the manufactured article across State lines it then directly affects Inter-State commerce, and is within the prohibition of the Federal Act. In the judgment it is statedAn agreement or combination for the elimination of competition, from an economic point of view, may not operate in restraint of trade. It may actually develop and increase trade. Such an agreement, however, from a legal view-point is necessarily in restraint of trade. The law regards competition as the life of trade, and so that which restricts competition restrains trade. [231]- 2 But a contract in restraint of trade may or may not be in restraint of Inter-State trade. If it directly affects only production in the limits of a State it is in restraint of Intra-State trade, and is subject only to State laws. Any remote or incidental effect upon Inter-State trade is insufficient to bring it within the Federal enactment. If , however, the contract go further, and for example, control the disposition of the manufactured article across State lines, it directly affects Inter-State commerce, and thus may contravene "" both State, and national laws. On the other hand, a conspiracy to prevent a manufacturer who procures his supplies and disposes of his products by means of Inter-State commerce from engaging in business at all necessarily places restraints upon such commerce. Its flow is restricted and interrupted. The importation and exportation of articles of commerce are directly prevented, and none the less so because the conspiracy may be of so wide a scope as to interfere with Inter-State commerce also. There was an attempt to destroy the competition of a rival manufacturing company by preventing it re-starting. The only relation to Inter-State or external commerce was that the company had to import its raw materials and exported the product. That is very often the case in Australia. Even in the case of sugar, raw material,has to be imported. This company imported its raw materials and exported the finished product to other States, and by suppressing the competition of a manufacturing company, it had a direct relation to trade and commerce, and as such was held to be subject to the Federal jurisdiction of the antitrust laws. So far only one case has been brought before the Court to test the efficacy of our legislation within the present power. It has been said that it would be equally futile tq attempt to prosecute in other cases. My reply is that the Government can prosecute in cases of similar facts under the authority of the more recent American decision to which I . have referred. Let me quote from another only affects part of this judgmentI t must be clearly borne in mind that the defendants in this case are not charged simply with preventing the plaintiff from engaging in a manufacturing business. If they were, the Knight decision would undoubtedly be applicable. They are expressly charged also with preventing ihe plaintiff from engaging in Inter-State commerce-wit h preventing the importationof raw materials and the exportation of the manufactured product. In fact, the allegations go so far as to charge a conspiracy to prevent the Inter-State transportation of materials and products. In the face of these allegations this Court cannot say, as a matter of law, that the main purpose of the conspiracy was to prevent manufacture, and that its effect upon Inter-Statetrade was incidental and remote. The combination in the Knight case was for the purpose of procuring control of the corporations in question, and, undoubtedly, of monopolizing the sugar business. The purpose of the conspiracy in the present case was not only to obtain control of the plaintiff corporation, and thus doubtless acquire a monopoly, but to exercise the power of control so obtained to wholly prevent the plaintiff from engaging in a business, the ing on of which necessarily involved Inter-State commerce. We have been told by the Attorney-General within the last twenty-four hours that the operation of a local sugar company extends beyond two States-that the refining process is carried on in one State for the purpose of supply in another. say that theie is or is not an offence in that case. All that I can submit is that in the light of the American decision it is too soon to say, merely because an obstacle on the facts has been met with in connection with the first case brought under our anti-trust law, that that law is a failure. I could point to case after case since 1890 in which the law has been successful in the United States of America. I could point to a tile combination- a combination carried on in a State but whicn affected the stream of commerce by diminishing the volume, and was therefore successfully prosecuted. could also point to a successful coal trust prosecution under circumstances somewhat similar to those alleged in the local case.",39
238,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did it affect production?,41
239,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . Why should we believe that we cannot get at these bodies here uncler a power quite as ample as that in operation in the United States, although in expression it is not identical. We have amended our legislation by omitting the words "" to the detriment of the public."" When you first include a phrase, and subsequently omit it, you impliedly give to the first words-in the case of our Act the words "" restraint of trade ""- a wider significance than they would have had had they been passed originally without the words "" to the detriment of the public "" being attached to them. Is a rule of construction. In America, although the words "" to the detriment of the public "" do not occur in the Sherman Act, they'do in the decisions of the Court. Cook on Combinations defines "" monopoly "" asAny combination the tendency of which is to prevent competition in its broad and general sense and to control and thus at will enhance prices to the detriment of the public. That, according to this authority, is a legal monopoly which may also exist without combination. Under our Act it is open to the defence to show that the matter complained of was not to the detriment of the public, and was not unreasonable in the circumstances. If there is a difference carry- between the American and the Australian law, it is in favour of the Commonwealth law, because in America a primd facie case of detriment to the public must certainly be established. That is also the law as to restraint of trade in England. A restraint that is merely partial, even although it may involve some I do not limitation upon the right of competition of other people, is held to be good as long as it is reasonably applied. But if it is more than partial, if it covers a very wide areaand in America they take the test of "" extent,"" the Court in the Standard Oil case saying literally that the question of extent involved the question of whether it was reasonable or not-the n it may be successfully dealt with. If , in the opinion of any man of common sense the extent is so great as to amount to a detriment to the public, either in its tendency or opera1 tion, then it is opposed to the Federal law in America, and also to our law. The I chances of a successful prosecution in our case, however, are greater than they are in America, because we have so amended our Act that now all that the Crown need prove is that there is restraint of, or an attempt to restrain, trade where the prosecution is for monopolization or for entering into a contract to monopolize or restrain trade. Then the person charged, if on the whole the acts complained of involve some detriment, must prove that the act' is not to "" the detriment of the public,"" and-the phrases are conjunctive- "" was not unreasonable in the circumstances."" The defendents may show that it was not to the detriment of the public, and still be convicted, unless they can show that it was not unreasonable in the circumstances. It is not unfair to suggest that there may be in Australia cases That which, if prepared with that care that characterizes all prosecutions by the Crown, would be successful. The Crown Law Department, I believe, does its work very well. We cannot always command success, but I believe, as the result of direct knowledge, as well as of indirect knowledge gained by reading reports of proceedings in Court, that a great amount of energy and zeal is given to the consideration of tthe evidence in these cases before they are «ent on to the Court. It is too soon to say sthat we have failed under an Act more - favourable to the prosecution than is the .American Act, seeing that in the United ^States of America a great many prosecutions have succeeded. As regards the scope - of this amendment, in pointing out what its effect will be, I shall confine myself to --What was said in the American Sugar case. ""We are proposing to deal with production. How can a combination in production be rinjurious to the public? One can conceive - of very few cases in which it would be injurious to the public. A man produces - for exchange. Cases where men produce - merely for their own requirements, or to - supply every one gratis, are too rare to be - worthy of consideration. Presumably, pro-duction is for the purpose of exchange, and the moment you proceed to the course of - exchange you become subject to the antitrust power. That being so, if this amendment were passed in the terms which I :have suggested, such dealings would be - subject, if not to the power in regard to - restraint of trade, at all events to the .general Inter-State power, and to the special - trust power as regards all trade. Production will cover everything, apart from trade - and commerce, and the supply of services, that manufacture does not touch. What 4he effect would be of including manufacture was pointed out by the Chief Justice in the first of the American .Sugar cases known as the Knight case. He said, quoting the words of the judgment in .another case in which there was a successful prosecutionNo distinction is more popular to the common - mind, or more clearly expressed in economic and political literature, than that between manufacture and commerce. Manufacture is transformation-the fashioning of raw materials into a - change of form for use. The functions of commerce are different. The buying and selling and the transportation incident thereto constitute commerce; and the regulation of commerce in >the constitutional sense embraces the regulation at least of such transportation. . . . be held lhat the term includes the regulation of all such manufactures as are intended to be the subject of commercial transactions in the future, it is impossible to denv that it would also in- elude all productive industries that contemplate the same thing. The result would be that Congress would be invested, to the exclusion of - the States, with the power to regulate, not only 'manufactures, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, domestic fisheries, mining-in - short, every branch of human industry. For is - there one of them that does not contemplate, cmore or less clearly, an Inter-State or foreign - market? Does not the wheat-grower of the - north-west, and the cotton planter of the south, plant, cultivate, and harvest his crop with an eye on the prices at Liverpool, New York, and Chicago ? The power being vested in Congress and denied to the States, it would follow as an inevitable result that the duty would devolve on Congress to regulate all these delicate, multiform, and vital interests-interest s which in their nature are and must be local in all the details of their successful management. . . The demands of such supervision would require, not uniform legislation generally applicable throughout the United States, but a swarm of Statutes only locally applicable and utterly inconsistent. Any movement towards the establishment of rules of production in this vast country, with its many different climates and opportunities, would only be at the sacrifice of the peculiar advantages of a lfirge part of the localities in it , if not of every one of them. On the other hand, any movement toward the local, detailed, and incongruous legislation required by such interpretation would be about the widest possible departure from the declared object of the clause in question. Then he goes on to deal with what may be called the political considerations against the policy of such an extension of power, which, of course, in a matter of doubtful interpretation, must have some force with Courts of Justice^ I have trespassed, perhaps, more than I intended in dealing with the legal aspect of the case, but it is necessary to do so for the right understanding of what the power is. Let us now take the case of combinations in relation to manufacture, supposing there was no direct relation, in the operations of trusts, between manufacture and commerce. Could we control such trusts under the existing power? I^have said that it is the duty of the States* to do so; and we are not to suppose that the States will fail in these matters when they really become conscious of the substantial growth of the evil. It is true that the evil has not attained very great magnitude up to the present, but it is our duty to check it. Thai is, I think, common ground of policy on the part of honourable members on both sides. I said that no attempt had been made by the States to control these trusts except in New South Wales by a somewhat If it limited Act. I cannot see why, however, if there be a detrimental combination among producers-say , sugar producers-it is not possible to reach it under the Tariff, as well as the commerce power-unde r the power in reference to restraint of trade. Why could we not provide, - as in Canada, that if any such combination is helped b; an import duty, that duty should be re duced or abolished until the evil is checked ? What objection could there. be to that?",41
240,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We should be continually altering the Tariff.,43
241,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member found tomorrow that there was a huge trust in Queensland affecting the consumption of a commodity, and, under our policy, inflicting an annual fine of ;£i,ooo,ooo on the people of Australia, would he think it too great a trouble to alter our policy once in three or four years in order to mitigate the evil ? What would the people of Australia say to their representatives if the latter appeared on the hustings and said that, although they had at hand an easy method of automatically affecting the operations of a body which inflicted a fine of jQi,000,000 a year on the consumers, they had refused to use it because of the trouble?",43
242,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is not a fair way of putting it .,43
243,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That would seem to be the logical result; but I shall not prejudge the case until I have read the report of the Sugar Commission. I have never hesitated to ask why it . is-that the people of Australia should be asked to pay 000,000 a year more than is necessary for their sugar; and I think we could, ordinary operation of the Tariff, attain the same result as in Canada. A few years ago the Canadian Parliament passed an Act providing that the duty should be reduced or abolished under the circumstances I have indicated, and I believe that the law has proved pretty effective. There is in Canada a Committees Investigation. Act, passed in 1910, and a similar law has been adopted in America. That Act provides for the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry where there is any allegation by a representative body of people that a trust exists; and if , after evidence, the Commission reports that a trust does exist, and that it affects the public prejudicially, and the operations of the trust do hot cease, a fine of $1,000 a day is inflicted, with other incidental penalties. I am sorry that the Attorney-General has not seen fit to propose some auxiliary to the operation of the Australian Industries Preservation Act on the lines so successfully adopted in Canada. It was only within the last week that we heard that the United Shoe Company had been dealt with, and there have been other cases in which combines have been put an end to. Even in America, as we learn from the newspapers, there have been successful prosecutions of some of the trusts originally controlled? by Mr Harriman; and all this has beendone under the unextended commerce power. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition, and other honourable members on this side, would be willing to give whatever power is necessary to deal with trusts on such lines.",43
244,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear ! Mt. GLYNN - Trust s are condemned by no one more than by honourable members on this side; but all that it is necessary to do is to extend the power to cases where there is restraint of trade, whether, within a State or in Inter-State commerce. I am quite sure that Parliament would be quite willing to give legislative effect toany proposals that the Government could* show to be reasonably necessary. Under the circumstances, I again express regret, as on a former occasion, that the poweradequate to the necessities of the case has-not been asked for,, because that would! have resulted in unanimity on both sides.",43
245,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bendigo) [4.52] Personally, I feel under a great debt of gratitude to the honourable member for Angas for the very valuable contributionby the he has made to this debate. Honourable members on all sides ought to recognise theuntiring industry and thoughtfulness of the honourable member in helping us to arrive at an independent judgment on these various complicated questions. The proposedamendment of the Constitution before us isone of tremendous importance and significance, deserving particular attention and' detailed discussion. I believe that it will form the real battle-ground of the parties;, and it is highly desirable that the public should be assisted by the debates in this House as to the possible meaning and development of the proposed constitutional s amendments. I , therefore, desire to subject it to careful analysis in order to seewhat it really means. We have to considerwhether any case has been made out showing the necessity for such an amendment,, or whether the Constitution is strong enough, as it stands to deal with the problems presented by trusts and combines. Then, again,, we have to ask ourselves whether Federal' legislation, as it exists at present, is sufficient to deal with such organizations, or whether there is any possibility of improving Federal legislation under the Constitution as it is to meet the circumstances. In the first place, I desire to point out that the proposed amendment, in referenceto the supply of goods, is, after all, au - mere fraction carved out of the commerce power as it stands in the Constitution; - stead of limiting the operation of the posed grant to Inter-State and foreign - and commerce, it extends it to all parts the Commonwealth, regardless of State boundaries. The grant of power in the - Constitution over Inter-State and foreign trade and commerce is wide enough to trusts, combines, and monopolies for supply of goods. The greater necessarily includes the less; and the grant of power in reference to trusts, comtion - bines, and monopolies for the supings ply of goods between the States, and with other countries, is only small - compared with the larger Federal grant in reference to Inter-State trade and - merce. In the words of the proposed - amendment we find a limitation rather - an extension of the Federal power, because ""here we have combines and monopolies relation to the ""supply of goods."" orable members will note that the words - cover only the sellers or suppliers of goods, - and do not deal with or cover the purcompletely chasers of the goods. Here, in the very forefront of the proposals, we find extraordinary limitation. There may be combination on the part of buyers of goods, and yet this grant of power will not - strong enough to deal with it ; and I - understand why there should be this limiInter-State - tation. When we contrast this proposal with the wider grant of power over trade - and commerce generally, it seems au extradiffered ordinary piece of draftsmanship, of which no explanation has been given. The prinin cipal novelty in this proposal is the extenin sion of Federal authority over trusts, ""bines, and monopolies in relation to production and manufacture of goods, the supply of services; and the contention is, I understand, that it is necessary - grant Federal power over manufacture - production in order to reinforce the Fedethe ral power over the supply of goods, trade and commerce in reference to We are, I think, under an obligation the honourable member for Angas for the - information he has supplied in the course - of his several speeches, and particularly - day. He has shown that there is no real necessity for such an amendment fo rein inforce the power over trusts and combines in reference to the supply or exchange of goods by an express authority in reference to the production of goods. The honorexchange able member has shown, by the Ameriamong - can cases, that a Federal power which was strong enough to deal with reinstraint Of trade and to fight comprobinations in Inter-State trade is strong trade enough to cover restriction or restraint of in the case of manufacture and production resulting in 'the diminution of the volume of Inter-State trade. The Attorney-General dwelt several times with eloquence and cover unction on the decision of the American the Court in the Knight case, 156, United States Reports. In that case it was held that the Court would not grant an injuncto restrain a monopoly, or the proceedof a corporation that was gradually acquiring a monopoly pver sugar production in one State. The Attorney-General re-' ferred to that case as a terrible example-of com- 'the limitation of the Fedeal power over trade and commerce, ""because,"" he said, than ""you cannot effectually protect trade and commerce unless you have power to control in manufacture."" An examination of that Honcase, however, shows that the monopoly alleged, for which relief was sought, was a monopoly of production, absolutely and dissociated from the volume of Inter-State trade, because the company that a most was gradually acquiring a monopoly by a buying up sugar-refining businesses sold its products to wholesale buyers, who conbe ducted the volume of Inter-State trade. cannot The company itself was not engaged in trade, either directly or indirectly ; it was merely engaged in the sugar-refining business. In that respect itfrom the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which is engaged, not merely the production of sugar in one State, but the Inter-State transportation and sale comofs sugar. I have prepared a brief analythe sis of some of the cases to supplement or the very able argument of the honourable member for Angas. In the Addyston Pioe to case, 175 United States Reports, 239, Mr. and Justice Peckham practically foreshadowed decision subsequently given in the case 01 of - the Pennsylvania Sugar Company v. goods. American Sugar Company 166 Federal to Reporter 256, in which the decision in Knight's case was qualified by the declaration that where monopoly and manufacture toresult in the diminution of the volume of Inter-State trade, the operations come with the Anti-Trust Act. Mr Justice Peckham said, in that case, that if an agreement or combination directly restrains, not alone manufacture, but the purchase, sale, or of the manufactured commodity the States, it is brought within the provisions of the Anti-Trust Act. In the case of The Pennsylvania Sugar Company v. The American Sugar Company, it was made obvious that the Federal authority is not crippled where production and manufacture are concerned. The plaintiff company alleged that its business had been to purchase raw sugar in different States, and to transfer it to Pennslyvania, where it . was manufactured into refined sugar, and, sold in the course of Inter-State commerce. The defendant company, which figured also in the Knight case, had conspired, lt was alleged, to prevent the plaintiff from engaging in the refinery business in competition with it. It was held by the Court that the conspiracy alleged directly operated, not alone in restricting and preventing the manufacture of sugar in the State of Pennsylvania, but also in restricting interState commerce, and the transportation and delivery of raw material and of the manufactured product, and was, therefore, within the Anti-Trust law. The object of the conspiracy, the Court held, was to exclude the plaintiff from the business. The refinery was to be shut down, and the Inter-State shipments would thus have been prevented or reduced. Knight's case turned on the manufacture and production of sugar within a State, without reference to any effect on Inter-State commerce. It was held that if a contract in restraint of trade not only affects production within a State, but in addition attempts to control the disposition of the manufactured article across State lines, it then directly affects Inter-State commerce, and is witbin the prohibition of the Federal Act. It was held, too, that the conspiracy alleged directly operated not alone on the manufacture of sugar within the State of Pennsylvania, but on Inter-State commerce in the transportation and delivery of both raw material and manufactured product, and was therefore within the Federal Anti-Trust Act. my opinion, those cases cut the ground away from the contention of the Attorney General that there is necessity for an amendment giving the Federation control over production and manufacture. decision in Knight's case has been modified by the declaration that where production and manufacture is limited and restricted, and there is an interference with Inter-State trade, the Federal jurisdiction attaches, and if the facts are proved, the case comes within the Federal law. \When I say the Federal law, I mean Sir John Quick. both the anti-trust legislation of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Sherman* Act of the United States. I am firmly convinced that a careful and calm survey off the cases decided in the Supreme Court of the United States under , the Sherman Act,, coupled with the decision of our Court in-, the Vend case, will show thaf we have astrong power over trusts, combines, and' monopolies engaged in Inter-State trade, whether for good or for evil. The words in our Constitution enabling us to legislate in respect of trade and commerce between the States and with other countries are, in my opinion, as strong as could be used to convey a grant of power. They are strong; enough to give this Parliament authority, to deal with trade and commercebetweenthe States and with other countries in any shape, form, phase, manifestation or development. This Parliament has as strong a power as has the Imperial Parliament in? this matter. Within the limitation that the trade and commerce must be between the States, or with other countries, there is no restriction. If it be thought that our Anti-Trust Act is not drastic enough,, allowing too much latitude, or is not sufficiently specific, it would be easy to amend 1 it.",43
246,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Without straining the Constitution ?,45
247,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . Our powersin regard to trade and commerce, subject to the limitation I have mentioned, are asgreat as the Imperial Parliament could' give us. By putting into the Constitution, a provision dealing with trusts, combines, and monopolies in reference to tradeand commerce, we do not add to our power; we merely carve off part of thelarger power granted by the Constitution. Why should we do that? It is possibl'ethat the words may prove a restriction oni our legislation instead of giving an extenIn sion of our power. The trump card of the Government in this connection is said to be the proposal of a grant of power to legislate in respect of production and manufacture. I have shown that we have alreadyThe power to deal with any limitation or restriction of production or manufacture interfering with the volume of Inter-Statetrade. Is there now any pronounced publicgrievance in respect to interference withproduction and manufacture? Is thereany evidence of a conspiracy by any company or group of individuals to seriouslylimit production? Is it not contrary to> I - the interests of producers to limit production? Does not that cripple their operations? It is only under extraordinary circumstances that any one would conspire for the limitation of output.",45
248,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The limitation of output iis common all over the world.,46
249,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Any conspiracy - or agreement for the limitation of output which affects the volume of Inter-State ;trade comes within the Federal power, as the cases show. One would naturally think that the ordinary process of competition would operate to prevent undue limitation - of output, or the restriction of production - or manufacture. Our Anti-Trust Act is a - strong and effectual piece of legislation, clearer in its formulation of prohibitions than that of the United States; but if it is - considered ineffective, and there are other prohibitions which might judiciously be inserted, there would be no difficulty in amending it. I believe that in the United States the advisableness of passing a law - to establish a bureau of corporations to watch the flow of Inter-State trade is being - considered. Sucb a body could be vested practically with all the powers of a Royal Commission. It might be empowered to - demand the production of books and documents, to conduct an examination of witnesses with a view to ascertaining their trade relations, and whether they are conspiring with others to restrain the trade to the detriment of the community. There is (nothing to prevent a similar law being - enacted here. We can, if we choose, constitute the Inter-State Commission the guardian of Inter-State trade. It can be vested with special power to investigate . ithe operations of the Shipping Ring, or of the Coal Vend, or of the Tobacco Trust, - or of any other trust. The real evil of which complaint has been made undoubtedly lies in the region of Inter-State and - external trade.",46
250,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How does the honourable member account for the large body of 'legislation which has been passed by the States of America in reference to trusts ?,46
251,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But , after all, the great fighting arena has been the In-ter-State domain. But here the air rings with cries of trusts, combines and monopolies within the States, although we do not find any evidence of their existence. It is singular that though there has been a lot of talk about the Brick Combine in Victoria, and though it has been alleged that it has interfered with the State Government in. the erection of its works, up till a few weeks ago the State Government was hot sure whether a combine existed to the detriment of the public. In a paragraph in the press I read quite recentl) that when the Chief Secretary of Victoria was asked to appoint a Commission to inquire into the operations of the Brick Combine, he assented to the proposal with a view to ascertaining whether there was such a combine in existence which was detrimental to the interests of the community.",46
252,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Every builder knows that there is a Brick Combine.,46
253,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There may be a combine, but is it detrimental to the public interests? The Minister of Trade and Customs and his party do not denounce all agreements. There may be honourable understandings which do not injure the public, but Which prevent cut-throat competition. My contention is that the grievances or mischiefs which exist, and which are of such a character as to justify Federal intervention, are of an Inter-State, and not Intra-State character. If there are local combines which require fighting we may fairly leave them to be dealt with by the State Legislatures.",46
254,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think there is any chance of them being dealt with by the State Parliaments?,46
255,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My reply is that in New South Wales a Labour Government has been in power for two years, and has not brought forward an Anti-Trust Bill.. Surely if there had been any serious complaints in that State it would have utilized its golden opportunity to put such a measure on the statute-book. Yet the old bogy of the Legislative Councils of the States is trotted out on every occasion. Where is there an instance of any Legislative Council in the Commonwealth having rejected an Anti-Trust Bill? The State Governments, Liberal and Labour, would undoubtedly have introduced such a measure if the occasion for it had arisen.",46
256,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable mem- . ber think that the Victorian Legislative Council would pass it?,46
257,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is becoming a habit with honourable members opposite to sneeringly point to our Legislative Councils.,46
258,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How many times did the honourable member denounce the Legislative Council of Victoria when he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of this State? "" Sir JOHN QUICK - I have denounced it upon land questions, but not in respect of trusts and monopolies. I would not be afraid to criticise the Legislative Council of Victoria if it rejected any measure which was demanded in the interests of the public. But no honourable member opposite can point to any case in which an Anti-Trust Bill has been thrown out by a Legislative Council. The principal area in which trusts and combines operate in Australia is the Inter-State area. In that area we have unlimited power over them. If the present law is not adequate to deal with them, we have a right to amend it. In doing that we can follow the precedents established in the United States of America, in Canada, and in New Zealand. As I have already pointed out, in the United States of America it is intended to establish a Bureau of Corporations to watch the operations of corporations engaged in Inter-State trade. In the same way we might constitute the Inter-State Commission a Bureau of Corporations to watch the flow of Inter-State trade. It could be empowered to do that, and to see that nothing was done detrimental to the public interest. Last night the Attorney-General referred to what he considered to be some defects of the present Act. He spoke of the difficulty of securing the necessary preliminary proofs. If it be necessary to remove any difficulties in that direction, let him bring down an amending Bill, and I am sure he will have no difficulty in inducing Parliament to pass it. We could vest the Inter-State Commission with authority over .a wider area than is controlled by - the Comptroller General of Customs.",46
259,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the present Anti-Trust Act ever been properly tested?,47
260,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Onl y in one case, in which the Government had to feel their way to some extent,, in order to ascertain what really are our powers. But, in the light of the experience gained in the prosecution of the Coal Vend, the Depart. ment ought now to be in a position tn formulate whatever amendments may be necessary.",47
261,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was not that prosecution instituted under the previous Act?,47
262,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was instituted under the Act of 1906. In that case the onus of proof was, to some extent, cast on the Crown. Under the latest Act all that the Crown has to do is to prove that theoperations of a trust are in restraint of trade, and the onus will then be cast ons the defendants to show affirmatively that that restraint of trade is not detrimental to the public and is not unreasonable. They will have to prove that they are innocent, instead of the Crown having to prove that they are guilty. That may have been oneof the causes of the failure of the prosecution in the recent case. I mention this to show that if the Ministerial party arc earnest in their desire to fight trusts, monopolies, and combines, and the law is not strong enough to enable them to do so,. Parliament should be asked to strengthen* it. But, apparently, they will not adopt that course. What they want is the sanction of the people to wholesale proposals, which are part of a wider scheme of nationalization and Socialism. I repeat: that it would be better to vest in the Inter-State Commission the inquisitorial power which is at present vested in the Ccmptroller-General of Customs. But whatever may be the composition of that Commission, I presume it will have to obey the mandate of Parliament. If the power to examine records-, and witnesses in order to pave the way to a prosecution be vested in that body, it canbe exercised more effectively than it canbe exercised by the Comptroller-General of Customs, who has other duties to» perform. It will be the duty of the Commission to maintain Inter-State Free TradeThe honourable member for Angas has already directed attention to the manner in-which trusts, combines, and monopolies arefought in Canada. I think that it will befound instructive to look a little more indetail at what has been done there. I wish, to supplement the honourable member's remarks, and to show to what extent assistance and light can be gained from a perusal of the Canadian law. The Act, which is entitled "" An Act to provide for the investigation of Combines, Monopolies, Trusts,, and Mergers,"" and was assented to on 4th May, 1910, begins by providing for the appointment of a Board of Investigation, and giving a definition of what constitutes a combine. I*, declares that"" Combine"" means any contract, agreement, arrangement, or combination which has, or is designed to have, the effect of increasing or fixing the price or rental of anv article of trade or commerce or the cost of the storage or transportation thereof, or of the restricting competition in or of controlling the production, manufacture, transportation, storage, sale or supply'thereof, to the detriment of consumers or pro- ducers of such articles of trade or commerce. : - . Then, again, section 5 provides thatWhere six or more persons, British subjects resident in Canada, and of full age, are_ of opinion that a combine exists, and that prices have been enhanced or competition restricted by reason of such combine to the detriment of producers or consumers, such persons may make an .application for an order directing investigation into such alleged combine. Section 7 provides that If upon such hearing the Judge is satisfied that - there is reasonable ground for believing that a combine exists which is injurious to trade - or which has operated to the detriment of consumers or producers, and that it is in the public - interest that an investigation should be held, the Judge shall direct an investigation under the provisions of this Act. . . . The order of the Judge directing an investigation is transmitted by him to the Registrar, and then goes before the Minister, who proceeds to appoint a Board, which, it - is provided, shall consist of three members. Section 11 provides thatOf the three members of the Board one shall be appointed on the recommendation of the persons upon whose application the order has been ,-granted, one on the recommendation of the persons named in the order as being concerned in - the alleged combine, and the third on the recommendation of the two members so chosen. Then, in section 18, it is declared thatThe Board shall expeditiously, fully and caref u l l y inquire into the matters referred to it and - all matters affecting the merits thereof, including the question of whether or not the price or .rental of any article concerned has been unreasonably enhanced, or competition in the supply thereof unduly restricted, in consequence of a combine The Board is to make a full report to the Minister, and it is provided, under section 23, thatAny person reported by a Board to have been .guilty of unduly limiting the facilities for transporting, producing, manufacturing, supplying, storing, or dealing in any article which may be .a subject of trade or commerce; or of restraining or injuring trade or commerce in relation to any such article; or nf unduly preventing, limiting or lessening the manufacture or production of any such article; or of unreasonably - enhancing the price thereof; or of unduly preventing or lessening competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation, storage or supply of any such article, and who thereafter continues so to offend, is guilty of an indictable offence and shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars and costs for each day after the expiration of .ten days. . . . This Act of the Dominion Parliament has already been successfully applied. I read in the Argus of 29th ultimo a report from its Canadian correspondent, stating thatThe Combines Act, placed on the Dominion statutes three years ago, has had its first test. The majority of the Federal Government Commission appointed to inquire into the United Shoe Manufacturing Companv have reported that the company is "" a combine in restriction of trade,"" and, as such, liable to a penalty of 1,000 dol. a day. The commissioners recommend that the company be given six months' grace within which to dissolve, or cease its monopolistic operations. It is a United States enterprise, which furnishes Canadian boot and shoe manufacturers with machinery for their factories. It controls the patents, and forbade its customers to purchase from rival machinery men. A large boot manufacturer complained to the Government, and the finding outlined above is the result. The report of this successful prosecution suggests that the Canadian Act contains prohibitions which might be added to our own law, with a view to strengthen and improve it. I think we ought to avail ourselves of any legislation, whether it be American, Canadian, or otherwise, to improve our own, and to make it so effective as to preserve the principle of freedom of Inter-State trade. New Zealand, also, has in force ah Anti-Trust Act, which was passed in 1910. The hearing of the first test case under that Act was concluded in Wellington about the 28th ultimo. In a report, dated Wellington, 30th November, it is stated thatThe Supreme Court has reserved judgment in the prosecution of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Merchants' Association for a breach of the Commercial Trusts Act. This is the first prosecution under the Commercial Trusts Act, passed two years afro. Besides the Merchants' Association and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, several other firms are concerned. The statement of claim alleged that the defendant firms named were members of the Merchants' Association, whose objects and business included the restriction of competition among its members in the sale and control of merchandise. The firms named were further alleged to be members of a ring or combination of sugar buyers who had entered into an agreement among themselves as to the price and terms on which they would re-sell the sugar purchased from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The provisions of the Act, under which that prosecution was instituted, might well be considered by the Attorney-General's Department, with a view of determining whether they would be of assistance to us in formulating an improved anti-trust law. I propose to refer to several of its provisions. It is provided in section 3 thatEvery person commits an offence who, either as principal or agent, in respect of dealings in any goods, gives, offers, or agrees to give to < any other person any rebate, refund, discount, concession, allowance, reward, or other valuable consideration for the reason or upon the express or implied condition that the latter personfa) Deals or has dealt or will deal, or intends or undertakes or has undertaken or will undertake to deal, exclusively or principally. . . . and so forth. Section 4 providesEvery person commits an offence who, either as principal or agent, refuses, either absolutely or except upon disadvantageous or relatively . disadvantageous conditions, to sell or supply to any other person, or to purchase from any other person, any goods for the reason that the latter person(a) Deals or has dealt or will deal, or intends to deal, or has not undertaken or will not undertake not to deal, with nny person or class of persons. . Section 5 deals witli illegal monopolies; section 6 provides for penalties in respect of sales at prices fixed by a commercial trust; 'section 7 deals with sales by a commercial trust; section 8 provides when prices are to be deemed unreasonably high; and section 9 imposes a penalty of ^500 for aiding and abetting offences against the Act. It will be interesting to observe the result of the litigation in New Zealand to which I have referred, and to see whether it is likely to help us in improving our own Anti-Trust Act. The Attorney-General in some of his addresses, and particularly in the speech he delivered last night, referred to the Vend case. He seemed to cite it as an example of the failure and inadequacy of our anti-trust law, because upon appeal the decision given by Mr Justice Isaacs in that case was upset. There is a rather curious circumstance connected with that case. At the hearing, before Mr Justice Isaacs, the Vend, consisting of eighteen or nineteen companies, was convicted of an illegal conspiracy in limiting its output in restraint of Inter-State trade, and each member of it was fined £s > with costs amounting to nearly j£i8,ooo. The members of the Vend have paid those penalties and also their share of the costs, and the Commonwealth is now in possession of that money. The Vend, comprising the coal companies, did not appeal against the decision given by Mr Justice Isaacs, and that decision, so far as they are concerned, is affirmed. parently acquiesced in the judgment, and allowed the ship-owners to fight out the case before the High Court. that the ship-owners succeeded in upsetting the conviction, but they succeeded only on Sir John Quick. the ground that the case against them hadl not been proved. The decision given by Mr Justice Isaacs was not upset on the ground of the inadequacy of either the Constitution or the Federal anti-trust, law. I propose to quote a paragraph from. his judgment, portion of which remainsunchallenged even by the decision of theHigh Court in the appeal case. Dealing, with the meaning of the word "" monopoly,"" he said I have now to ask myself the question, Doesthis amount to monopolizing, or an attempt tomonopolize, or combination, or conspiracy tomonopolize the Inter-State trade or commerce in. Newcastle coal, with intent to restrain, to the detriment of the public its supply or price? The intent is obvious-and to prevent any possiblemisconception I unhesitatingly find its existence- as a matter of fact from the whole circumstances. I invite the attention of the Attorney-General to another quotation, because it showsthat, according to the view of Mr JusticeIsaacs-and his dictum is unchallenged* even by the judgment of the High Courtthe Federal authority extends to production and manufacture which interfere with' the volume of Interstate trade. Here iswhat he said I have no doubt, ancl I cannot imagine any doubt existing that the intention of the defendants was to monopolize in the sense in whichi I have explained that term. They intended toefface competition in every form-competitio n of production, which is only material here as bearing on the Inter-State trade in the article when> produced, and competition of carriage. They intended to grasp into one huge hand the whoreInter-State supply of Newcastle coal. I lay stress on the passage whicE speaksabout the intention to ' efface competi1 tion."" All this is consistent with theAmerican cases quoted by the honourable member for Angas and myself this afternoon, showing that the authority does extend to production and manufacture whenthere is such restriction as to interfere with, o<3 the free flow of commerce between the States. It will be seen, therefore, that there is no necessity for the amendment as proposed. This decision, so far as the shipping companies were concerned, wasreversed on appeal, but stands as against the Coal Vend; and the Federal Government have in the Treasury the ^20,000' paid by the Vend. This, of course, showsThey ap- that the Federal law has been vindicated, and the conviction remains in the absence of any appeal. I contend, therefore, that It is true the Federal law has proved strong enoughto d«al with all this class of cases. The Coal Vend, no doubt, had exercised itsinfluence to limit the output and to impose a maximum and minimum price; and it was convicted because its action limited produc- tion and interfered with the flow of Inter-State trade. This proposition was not challenged either before Mr Justice Isaacs or in the High Court. It is of no use for the Attorney-General to continually harp and lay stress on Knight's case, when it is quite obvious that, both in America and in Australia., that case may be differentiated from any in which there has been diminished production resulting in diminished Inter-State trade. The reversal of Mr Justice Isaacs' decision in the shipping case was not on any legal point at all-no t on the inadequacy of the Federal Constitution or law-bu t on the facts themselves; and I should like to quote one or two passages from the judgment, in order to give honourable members and the public generally the opportunity to consider the real facts of the case. I confess that it did seem somewhat strange that there should be a reversal of a judgment so well considered, so elaborate, and, apparently, so well built up. But we here are not in such a. good position to form a judicial estimate of the merits of the case as were the Judges on the Bench. We are in the fighting arena, and we, naturally, have our own bias and opinions, while the Judges are placed on the Bench to deal out justice between man and man and company and company. that there may be some who do not agree with the reversal of Mr Justice Isaacs' decision; but still the judgment is there.",47
263,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the judgment against the Coal Vend prevented it doing what it was doing before?,50
264,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Certainly . I apprehend that the injunction that was granted is operative and may be enforced, and that if it is not obeyed the Attorney General may move for execution of judgment. The following are extracts from the judgment of Mr Justice Griffith, reported in the Argus Law Reports of 12th November last:Cut-throat competition is not now regarded by a large portion of mankind as necessarily beneficial to the public. Indeed, it is against the evil consequences' of that class of competition that the second part of section 4 is aimed. . . . From time to time during the last forty years arrangements have been come to between the owners and the men for the purpose of fixing the hewing rate of coal, which is obviously an important, but by no means the only important, element in the cost of production. In 1873 (if not before), and again in 1886, 1893, 1900, and iooi, collective agreements, called district agreements, were made between the owners and the men on the basis that the hewing rate should vary with the selling price of coal. Substantially, the basis has always been to fix a minimum rate, with a proviso that for every shilling added to the selling price, fourpence should be added to the hewiftg rate. Other additional expenses at the mine, varying in like manner, raised the total labour additions to the direct cost of extraction to about sixpence halfpenny for every shilling of increase. In substance, therefore, the arrangement was that the owners and the workmen should divide in proportion of about eleven to thirteen any increase in the selling price. This arrangement may or may not have been based on sound principles of political economy, but during a period, as we have said, of forty years, it commended itself as satisfactory to all persons concerned. It may therefore, - prima facie, be regarded as not unreasonable. . . . We now come to deal with the alleged illegal acts with which the defendants are charged. We remark, in the first place, that this appeal is by way of re-hearing, aud that we are bound to form our own independent conclusions as to the facts. We find, as a fact, that at this time all parties honestly believed-and believed on grounds that were not only reasonable but very substantial-that the prosperity of the Newcastle ancl Maitland districts was in danger, as well as their own individual interests, by reason of the excessive competition and unremunerative prices obtained for coal. Whether they were right or wrong in this belief is immaterial, so far as regards the criminal responsibility of the defendants for acts done under it. . First then, as to the Vend agreement. We have already stated the facts as we find them to have existed when it was entered into. In our opinion it was, under the circumstances, a It is true lawful and even laudable transaction, which was intended to operate, and did operate, to the advantage, and not to the detriment of the public at large, notwithstanding that it was intended to operate, and did operate, to raise the price of coal. It would be absurd to attribute to the members of the Vend purely altruistic motives, but a, desire to promote 0 legitimate enterprise from which you desire to obtain pecuniary advantage is not incompatible with an absence of desire to injure the public. When a man enters into an agreement which can be carried out by lawful as well as by unlawful means, the Court will assume primd facie that he intended to do so by lawful means. This has been many times laid down by this. Court. . . . We proceed then to consider whether an intention to cause detriment to the public should be inferred from the acts of the defendants consequent upon the agreement. The detriment primarily relied upon by the Crown is what is called an ""unreasonable"" increase in the price of coal in the Inter-State market, and the suggested intent is an intent to obtain arbitrary and unreasonable prices for coal for the benefit of both the Vend and the ship-owners. . . . The first point made for the Crown is tha 1 the prices fixed by the Vend for coal f.o.b. f c the years 1907 and following years were i i fact unreasonable and exorbitant, from whic! we are asked to infer detriment to the public 1888, and also a common intent to cause such detri ment. . . . The argument on which the Court is asked to infer that the f.o.b. prices fixed by the Vend after 1906 were unreasonable appears, when carefully examined, to be based on the following assumptions : - i . The price at which a commodity sells in any year is f r i m d facie a price actually remunerative to the producer. 2. That price is f r i m d facie a reasonably .remunerative price, i.e., affords a remuneration with which the producer ought to be contented. 3. Any higher price would be unreasonable. 4. All conditions affecting prices are to be taken as remaining stationary until the contrary is shown. 5. Any rise of prices is f r i m d facie detrimental to the public. In our opinion, none of these assumptions is well founded. . . . We find, as a fact, that the f.o.b. prices of as. a ton fixed for 1907, and ns. a ton fixed for 1908 and afterwards, are not only not shown to have been unreasonable rates, but are shown afiirmatively. to have been reasonable. No inference of intent to cause public detriment can, therefore, be inferred from them. have already said that we cannot find anything on the face of the shipping agreement itself to show that the specified prices c.i.f. were unreasonable. It is not, in our opinion, unfair that the merchants who pay a higher price for 'Coal should ask on re-sale a price higher than a - sum representing the exact equivalent of the in- crease, in cost price. . . . We are, therefore, bound to decide the case upon the evi-dence, and upon that evidence we are of opinion that the Crown has failed to prove any intent - on the part of the appellants to cause detriment to the public. This disposes of the case as regards penalties. We are also of opinion that the Crown has failed to prove any actual detriment to the public. This disposes of the claim to an injunction under section 10.",50
265,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,51
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta} -[5.58] - I am very, glad, indeed, to hear the quotations just read by the honourable member for Bendigo, because they bear out the fact that I pointed out last night. They show that, from time immemorial, almost, there has been in the Newcastle district an arrangement between masters and men as to the fixing of the selling price and the hewing rate. There is not a miner or a man interested in the Newcastle district, or any one who knows the district intimately, who will say that the selling price ""at the pit's mouth now is an unreasonable one. The honourable member for Newcastle is present, and will confirm me when I say that the Vend has operated in a beneficial and fair way-that it has been a good thing for both miners and masters.",51
267,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As a vend, yes.",51
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member will recollect that it is only a little while ago when the men were anxious for the employers to raise the price another is., - so that 4c]. might be added to the hewing rate. Whatever goes on up there cannot be in the nature of a monopoly. There are several reasons for that. In the first place, there is abundance of competition, so far as at least half their trade-whic h goes oversea-is concerned, and as to the rest there is the curb of the prices ruling in the western and southern districts. There is no trust whatever there, in the sense in which we use the word when we apply it to the American combinations.",51
269,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why was a verdict given against the Vend then?,51
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The verdict was in favour of the Vend.,51
271,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for Bendigo said the opposite.,51
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He was refer. . We ring to the decision of Mr Justice Isaacs.,51
273,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Vend decision was not appealed against.,51
274,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is what the honourable member for Bendigo said.,51
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Honourable members are quibbling. They know that the Vend case to which I am alluding was specifically excluded by Mr Wise from the consideration of the Court. It was something that happened after the coal had left the district altogether that was complained of, and formed the subject of the trial. I understood the honourable member for Bendigo to refer to Mr Justice Isaacs' decision to show that at no time during the trial had the validity or effectiveness of our legislation been questioned. Mr Justice Isaacs indicated that he had complete power, and proceeded to exercise it. The appeal was not on the ground that there had been undue exercise of power, but that there had been a misinterpretation of facts. Nothing was said about the ineffectiveness of the Act. One of those who heard the appeal was Mr Justice Barton, and he had occupied a position enabling him to know the circumstances of the northern coal-field. That is why, in the summing up read by the honourable member for Bendigo, all the details are set forth with such lucidity, and the local circumstances are so fully grasped. Any one comparing the judgment of Mr Justice Isaacs with that of the High Court, will find that the latter contains a clearer and more succinct statement of the local conditions. Mr Justice Barton for some years presided over one of the district Boards alluded to, and while thus presiding as arbitrator appointed by the New South Wales Government, gave quite a number of decisions. He has had a long, intimate, and varied experience, - in an impartial and tached position, of the operation of these agreements in the Newcastle district, a cumstance which, I think, resulted in clear and complete comprehension of all the facts relating to the Coal Vend.",51
276,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,H a d not Mr Justice Isaacs the same evidence before him?,52
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No doubt; but the High Court had the evidence, long personal experience of Mr Justice Barton, so that it is safe to assume that i was fully seized of all the local circumthe stances.",52
278,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It could deal only with the evidence.,52
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. night. But a man who has had local experience is able to appreciate and comprehend dence and its bearing in a wav that another may not do. On this one case alone, Attorney-General has based his argument for the introduction of the present drastic proposals. His only reference to AustraI lian conditions was to the Vend. Having finished with that case, he took us on excursion to the United America, and bade us behold the goblins there, the menacing trusts and which he says are doing so much damage. I do not know that we ought to pay over much attention to what is going on in America. Of course, I do not suggest that we ought not to be guided by the experience of the world, because we But our first consideration should be our local circumstances. Trusts can never so harmful and malign in their influence, nor so extensive in their operations, in tralia, as they have been in the United States of America.",52
280,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What makes you think that?,52
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because the operations of the dangerous American trusts are based on the possession of railway chises in nearly every case. big trust there has its own railway, and uses it to prevent competition.",52
282,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the English Cotinto ton Trust control the railways of the counwhich try ?,52
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not supleft it there. pose so. The conditions of England are very dissimilar from those of America. The honourable member for Hunter the other day, quoting figures from Mulhall, I told us with some gusto that in the last decade the cost of living in England increased by 8J per cent. Every one in Ausdetralia would be very glad had the cost of living here increased by only 8£ per cent. cirI have seen it stated in the Arbitration the Court on more than one occasion that the increase in cost has been over 30 per cent, here in the last decade. Therefore, it would not appear that the trusts are doing much evil in Great Britain.",52
284,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There must be someand the thing wrong in Australia.,52
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is ; but we i differ as to what it is. I shall probably tell honourable member later, when we come to the labour and employment proposals, what I think is at fault here, and deal with the statements of the Attorney-General last To return to my contention, trusts and:evicombines cannot do as much harm here as they do in America, because our railthe ways belong to the States.",52
286,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not all of them.,52
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The other day had the pleasure of riding on a small line in the honourable member's electorate an which is a private concern, and from what States of I saw, very well managed; but, nevertheless, what I say is true-ou r trusts cannot combines, manipulate our railways.",52
288,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member admits that there are trusts here?,52
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There are combinations that look very like trusts.,52
290,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member should. went further than that just now.,52
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then , to oblige be the honourable member, I shall admit that there are trusts and combines here, one or Ausmore of which seem to need investigation. I want to know what this Government has . been doing during the last two and a half years that they have not investigated the operation of some of these trusts. VVe have passed an amended Anti-Trust Bil l that has never been put into operation. franI t has never been tested. So far as the Nearly every Government are concerned, it is a dead letter. ,The Attorney-General, when in troducing it , said that he intended to put operation the extended powers for it provided; but as soon as the Bill was passed, he placed it on the shelf and",52
292,Mr LAIR DSMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He told the House last night why he had not used it .,52
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He has never think, answered the criticism that has been levelled at him. He has never replied to had the statement that he could have applied that Act to the Coal Vend had he chosento do so. I do not know that the result would have been different had he done so, because the Court decided that on the facts of the case as put by the Crown, nothing vvas taking place but reasonable combination, which, while not detrimental to the public, was, in the interests of those engaged in the industries concerned. far as the Attorney-General has told us, all the facts go to show that only one case has been thoroughly and efficiently inquired into, and in that one case the High Court says that nothing harmful has taken place. On the strength of that one Australian fact, the Attorney-General bases his appeal for the revision of our constitutional power, and the acquirement of a tremendous accretion to that power at the coming referenda. VVe cannot be too keen in watching these trusts and combines.",52
294,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why watch them if we are not going to deal with them?,53
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member knows exactly what I mean. The Attorney-General has a right to investigate combinations in Australia to see that they are not injuring the public. It is his duty tp investigate them, and I wish to know why he has been neglecting that duty for the last two and a half years. No greater Ministerial delinquency has ever taken place in Australia than has occurred during the regime of this Government if all their statements be correct. What did the honourable gentleman do the other night?",53
296,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honourable member must not reply to a speech made by another honourable member on a question that has been dealt with.,53
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am replying to the speech made by the Attorney-General in connection with this very debate. He quoted a list of trusts which he said had been investigated by the honourable member for Angas when he held office, as Attorney-General. The further we proceed with this debate the more we find how indefatigable the ex-Attorney-General was, and how supine the present Attorney-General has been.",53
298,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is a born humourist, only not know it.",53
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable honourable member is a good judge of what a humourlute ist is. We have seen recently specimens of his humour. A man who cuts the is concerned. antics that he does, both inside and outside this House, should not talk of any one else being either a born or a trained humourist. I wish to get back to the point that the only statement we have had as to trusts consists of quotations by the Attorney General of statements made regarding them by the honourable member for Angas. The So Attorney-General says "" I want this further power to nationalize trusts, and to control and deal with corporations- 1 want this all-embracing power, but I have never investigated one solitary trust on my own account."" The honourable member for Angas did investigate thirty-three, and he r found that all, with the exception of four, were Intra-State. That being so, the present Attorney-Genera! is left with four trusts of an Inter-State, or Australian, character, none of which he^ has investigated, although the honourable member for Angas thinks that some of them ought to be investigated.",53
300,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What would have been the result of an investigation?,53
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What a foolish question to put to me. Does the honourable member know what would have been the result?,53
302,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ves . What was the result of the injunction in the case of the American Meat Trust?,53
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is off once more to America. Had we not better stay at home? We are dealing with trusts and anti-trust legislation in Australia.,53
304,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Anti-trus t legislation passed under a Constitution copied from "" Yankee land,""",53
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why does not the honourable member quote himself completely and say, as he did on a previous occasion, "" A Constitution that ought to have been ' up the spout' long ago?"" We have not to consider on what our Constitution was patterned; but I hope that the honourable member will admit that there are some things, even in America, that are wise and efficient. So far as my reading teaches me, they have in America a body of jurists and a set of decisions that have never, been surpassed.",53
306,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And those decisions he does are all "" dead letters.""",53
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then does the member say., that there, is absoanarchy, and no law, in America?",53
308,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,So far as this matter,53
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Has the honourable member read of what has taken place quite recently in the State of Wisconsin? Has he read how that State has tackled trusts and combines; cleaned out, comparatively, all the "" g r a f t "" ; and worked a complete revolution under its own law ? I have read that in other States, also, the authorities have grappled with all those malign workings, and have swept them practically out of existence.",54
310,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Are not the Trust cars running in that State? oourse they are. What is the use of deceiving the House?,54
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What has the Attorney-General to do with the Meat Trust - cars in America? We are asked to undo our Constitution-to re-shape and to amend it drastically and extensively, all because something like that which has occurred in America may occur here. Not one single Authenticated case has been put before the House.",54
312,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Will the honourable member mention the names of the four trusts with which he said the Attorney-General - could deal ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - They are given in the records, so that there is no need for me to dilate in detail upon them. As to these thirty-three trusts, no - - details have been presented House as a justification drastic proposals made by the Government. If the Attorney-General desires to obtain further power of inquiry, let Ihim show, first of all, that he has exercised to the full the power of inquiry he already possesses. If he desires to pel the people believed to in combinations to answer questions, he can - do so under the anti-trust law, which provides for severe penalties in the event of failure to reply to questions put by the Department. The complaint honourable gentleman will not exercise or test this power. Is he afraid prove to be effective ? Is he afraid that, on investigation, these trusts might turn to be something different from those existgiants ing in America? In connection with the Royal Commission ^-n the sugar industry the present Government undoubtedly set out with the idea in their minds that case was going to be made out for the - nationalization of that industry. The jority of the Commission consisted of favouring their own political propaganda. Their inclinations leaned to the side my honourable friends, and they were in sympathy with their platform; but even an investigation conducted by such gentlemen has proved to be dead against the nationalization of the sugar industry here.",54
313,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The report of the Commission must be a bit of a knock-out to the Government.,54
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should think so. The Government should tell us what they are going to do now with the plank in Meat their platform which directs them to go Of on with the nationalization of the sugarrefining industry. Are they going to fly in the face of the findings of that expert Commission of investigation, with their nationalization proposals? Are they going to incur the practical bankruptcy of the industry-for that is what it would amount to, in view of the declaration of the Commission that it could not be made to pay on the basis of a nationalized industry. They will find that they are in the same trouble with that matter as 'they are today in connection with nearly everything the Government have undertaken. The Commission confirms what has gone on always where nationalization is attempted. For instance, the Postal Department, which represents a nationalized indus.ry, according to the Estimates, is going to be in debit at the end of this year to the tune of ^1,592,000. In other words, to the 37 J per cent, of its total transactions will for the represent debits on the year.",54
315,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would the honourable member do away with post-offices? Mr JOSE PH COOK - Certainl y not; that but the fact that the Government controls comthese undertakings does not argue that the be taking part control is perfect.,54

317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Compare d with the huge trusts of America, the trusts in is that the Australia are babies.",54
318,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They will grow into giants that it might if we let them.,54
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was about to out point that out, but at present they are not in the sense that they are in America. Moreover, it is not clear that in America the trusts cannot be dealt with by legislative action. Some time ago the P residenta Elect, <Dr Woodrow Wilson, made a statement to the effect that as yet there had manever been any adequate effort made to conmen trol the trusts in America; and, so far as I recollect, his reasoning was that hitherto ot the law had been directed to the corporate entities, if I may so put it, of the various trusts. What he meant was that the combination qr trust itself had been attacked, and he suggested that the proper method was to attack the individuals who compose the trust-to personify the trust, for the purpose of regulation and control-and make the management and the individuals responsible for the actions and depredations of the organization.",54
320,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They would change the manager every month.,55
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is one of those rash and silly statements which the honourable member is constantly making, and which do not do him credit. As a matter of fact, a trust manager keeps his position until he becomes a millionaire, and is often there for a lifetime. The management is not changed oftener than can be helped, and it would be impossible to keep changing it, for the success of a trust depends on obtaining the best organizing ability and enabling all the threads to be gathered up and manipulated on a wellconcerted plan, extending, it may be, over years. In any case, it is Dr Woodrow Wilson's argument, and not mine, at which the honourable member is gibing. So far as I understand, no attempt of the kind suggested has yet been made in America.",55
322,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member says, then, that there are no trust depredations ?",55
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is another of those incorrect and silly statements the honourable member is always making, and I suppose he thinks they do him credit. I am as anxious as the honourable member is to deal with trusts, but, to that end, I am not prepared to fundamentally change the character of our Constitution. Two years ago we agreed to a proposal of the Government and their supporters, in order to get more power to deal with trusts; but the Act we then passed has been left religiously alone. The Government cannot know whether the present law is sufficient until it been tried, and the non-success of the first and only attempt made is not due to any defect in the law, or the absence of the necessary power. Yet we axe now asked to confer on this Parliament power to control the whole business operations of Australia. In fact, all these proposals rest on an absurd assumption. The present Act gives us large powers of investigation and interrogation, and penalties up to jQs°° a day may be imposed for refusal to answer questions; the proposal before us reminds us of Charles Lamb's Chinaman, who burnt down a house in order to roast his pork. We are told that there aretrusts and combines that are doing damage in Australia, and we have the special instances of shipping and coal. ThreeJudges, one of whom knows all the circumstances intimately, have held that thesecombines are not doing damage to the public; that, on the facts, they are forming; only reasonable combinations with a view to protecting the masters and the men engaged in the industries. The Attorney General contends, however, that these combines are prejudicial to the public, and! produces figures in proof; but, on the same figures, three Judges have held otherwise, and it is for the public to decide.",55
324,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not three Judges.,55
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so; I should have said the decison of the Court. The public have now to judge between theAttorney-General, an interested individual, who is using this legislation for political' purposes and propaganda in the interests? of his party, and three Judges detached from all political controversy and prejudice, who consider all such matters purely in the public interest. I am not in favour of trusts and combines, and would take any reasonable steps; suggested to curb and control them.",55
326,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This is new !,55
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , it is very old; but the interjection is a new one, and silly, as usual.",55
328,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The fact is that the honourable member for Parramatta would never find any ""reasonable steps.""",55
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Act that was passed in 1910 is, as I have said, adead letter. Would it not be better, instead of frightening ourselves with the goblins of America, to try to deal with? our own combinations in an effective way, under such laws and powers as have never yet been assailed or questioned ? The manhas who passed the first Industries Preservation. Bill through the House tried the Vend case under the present law, and neither he nor any of the other Judges question the adequacy of our power. Indeed, the unanimous opinion of the Bench is that there is power under the Actto deal with combinations of the kind; and the only reason that it has not succeeded is that the Court could not agree that the facts indicated injury to the public. Try as we may, we cannot escape 4he working of the law of combinat i o n ; it is the root principle of our industrial and social life. All the currents - of the tune run to concentration, and all - our business operations show their complete subserviency to this law. To depart from the principle, and to try to abrogate or destroy it j would be much the same as attempting to destroy civilization, and all that it means, in the twentieth century. The Jaw of combination is the law of industrial life today; without it the people are absolutely powerless, and can do nothing to keep abreast of the requirements of the itimes in all the ramifications of their social and domestic life. The question is how far, and to what extent, we ought to go in .an effort to deal with those combinations. The Attorney-General says we require power to do what we like with any combination, no matter how simple or elementary, or how far-reaching, powerful, or - dangerous; all limitations have to be swept away, ancl the whole industrial arena has to be traversed without let or hindrance. The only test that has been made shows that we have the power already in our law to be used, and the fact that it has not be-come operative, in the direction the Attorney-General desires is because the cir-curnsfcances are not as he has described them. In America this is the outstanding problem, and has been for many years. The Trusts there, due to franchises of - various kinds, by means of which they are .able to wipe out their competitors, get aggregations of power and wealth which sometimes threaten to destroy the Republic itself; and this is better shown in an illustration that I remember. When the Carnegie Steel Trust was in full blast, another ""Combination was created to fight it . The mew organization had the most up-to-date plant in the world, and everything was seeming fair ; only one or two things had been forgotten. The new: Trust had to depend for its raw material on some mines 33 or 14 miles from the works at Chicago, and the Carnegie Steel Trust simply stepped in, bought up the mines and the communicating railway, and compelled the latest organization to merge in the general Steel Trust. That is how aggregations are piling themselves up today in America, and acquiring more and more power. kind of thing, however, is impossible in Australia, because the railways are in the hands of the various Governments, and every combination and industrial enterprise is entitled to equal facilities in land transport. Year by year the effort goes on in America to deal with the trusts; and my opinion is that by-and-by a way will be found to curb them and make them serve the public while serving themselves in a reasonable way. It is found, so fa r as I can ascertain, in many instances that large management is much more economical than small management-that large management means operations over a wide area, and pressing into its service the best skill and ability in the world. Thus trusts are often able to produce better articles at a cheaper price than is otherwise possible; and nobody has written more eloquently on this subject than the Attorney-General' himself. Time after time he has told us, in "" The Case for Labour,"" in the Sydney Daily Telegrafh, that it is idle to complain of the trustification of industries-that it is only the following of a natural law, the operation of which is for the benefit of the people alT the time. But you must watch that, while the trust is cheapening its products, is making its management efficient, and is extending its operations, it is not becoming the master, instead of the servant, of the public. The problem is : How can these huge aggregations of capital, these huge combinations of skill and ability, be pressed into the service of the public instead of being used solely to make dividends for their shareholders while they ignore the public interest? In Australia three combines-the Shipping Combine, the Coal Combine, and the Sugar Combine-hav e been recently investigated. The investigation, in the case of the first two, was conducted by legal process, with all the legal skill and ability that could be paid for by the Attorney General, and the third by a Commission composed of men for the most part favouring the Labour political view, men who are professed nationalizers of industry, and in sympathy with the Labour programme. These men have now reported against the nationalization of the sugar industry, which, they say, is impracticable, and could not be made to pay. These experts selected by the Government-with , in my opinion, other views-sa y that what we have to do is to regulate and control. As to the other trusts in Australia This",55
330,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Are there anv?,56
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I refer the honourable member to the list of the Attorney-General. It is worthy of notice that during the whole of this debate, so far as I am aware, no mention has been made of the so-called great Tobacco Combine.",56
332,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Attorney-General referred to it last night.,57
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is also what has been called the Mildura or Dried Fruits Combine. A couple of years ago or less the Attorney-General investigated its methods.,57

336,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Where did the honourable member find the statement by the Attorney-General that their's was a good combine ?,57
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I cannot give the exact date, but my recollection of the facts is correct enough, and they are on record.",57
338,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-The honourable member ought to tell us where he got his information.,57
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fro m persons who knew the facts. I believe that the honourable member for Wimmera could substantiate what I have said, that the Attorney-General declared that those fruit growers were engaged in a perfectly legitimate business. But the sooner we have an effective law to control those managing trusts the better it will be for all concerned. Sir Edward Coke once said, "" Corporations cannot commit treason, nor be outlawed nor be excommunciate, for they have no souls."" But, as Woodrow Wilson has suggested, we must see if we cannot give them a soul and a body in the shape of the soul and body of those who manage them, making them responsible for their actions. When, in this way, we have individualized corporations, and driven home to those who manage them charges of acting injuriously to the public, we shall get at the root of the trouble. We have done that yet, nor has America. Ifc may be, as alleged by my honourable friends opposite, that America has not succeeded because of the influence of the trusts, but that is not the position here. My honourable friends could bring down a Bill without being influenced by the trusts, individualizing corporations, so that predatory actions may be sheeted home to those responsible for them. That is the course of action that we should follow. Until we have followed it, it is idle to say, as the Attorney-General did last night, that nolegislation that we can pass will control them. If he thinks that, the Bill is a piece of the sheerest hypocrisy, because its aim and purpose is to control the trusts, there being another Bill to provide for nationalization. His attitude has always been the attitude of the Labour party, and was assumed by Mr J. C. Watson yearsago. He said, "" I shall try this legislation, but I have no faith in it . "" Why do they try it if they have no faith in it? Are they the proper persons to try it ? Why do they not go to the country with a straight-out proposal for nationalization? In my opinion, we can control the trusts, and if our powers are proved to be insufficient, we can get any power needed to make them sufficient, 'assistance to that end being given by every member on this, side of the House.",57
340,Mr DEAKI N,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat) [8.3 r] - It ismy duty, in regard to this proposed amendment of the Constitution, as it was when the last proposal was before us, to stale the course which will be followed by the Opposition, and to place our position before the House as briefly as possible. Thiswas done last year, when, speaking on behalf of the party, I said I think the Attorney-General understands that-, whatever power may be necessary to enable this Parliament to deal at once in the most thorough, and complete manner with trusts and combines;, or operations of that kind, the whole Committee is unanimously willing to concede. The Committee included, of course, all members of the Opposition. Again, ber fore the vote was taken, I saidAs to the amendment respecting trusts and. combines, the Opposition has given the Government its support, though desiring that restraint of trade should be a material condition renderingthem amenable to our law. We have given the Government a broad and general assurance that"" any power which' it can show to be required to enable this Parliament to cope in the most effective manner with trusts, combines, and monopolies, would be heartily supported. The amendment moved on that occasion on not our behalf by the honourable member for Angas would have extended the grant of power to this Parliament to legislate inrespect ofCombines and monopolies in restraint of trade, commerce, or manufacture in any part of a Stateor the Commonwealth. The only qualifying words are "" in restraint of trade""; in every other respecfc« our agreement is absolute, our concession unqualified. As I said, when speaking in regard to another proposed amendment this afternoon, we see no reason for changing our attitude in this regard. The amendment which we then moved, but did not carry, can be moved again, but it would only indicate that our views in regard to one of the most important of the proposals that Ministers have placed before the House have not altered. The honourable member for Parramatta has dealt ably and sufficiently, inter alia, with the businessaspects of corporations, their dangers, and the best methods of coping with them. To deal with them effectively, a power of investigation must be intrusted to competent officials above reproach and suspicion and without personal motives. They should make it their business, without disclosing business secrets, to ascertain the exact character and effects of corporation workings, regarding as confidential, as far as that may be possible, the special business knowledge of each, so that those who are managing these concerns honestly will have no. hesitation in submitting the whole of their transactions for scrutiny. Honourable members will recollect that one of the measures submitted by the last Government provided for the establishment of the Inter-State Commission. The intention was that this body should, in its own sphere, have the standing of the High Court, acquire a similar reputation, and be intrusted with a very wide authority. It was to be the arbiter in matters of dispute, its members being assisted by expert skill and knowledge wherever it was required. Its business, among other things, was to inquire into the conduct of organizations threatening private or public interests. Within the last few days, notice of an intention to introduce an Inter-State Commission Bill has been given by this Government.' The efficiency of the body created will depend entirely on the calibre ,_and quality of those who may constitute - the Commission, and the powers with which they are endowed. Nothing is plainer than that the so-called combinations or ""monopolies,"" whatever that means, 'differ in character and purpose as tliey differ in size. Some- I am afraid that they are not numerous-ar e alleged to be innocent, and, indeed, beneficial, to the public. Even if they are numerous, I suspect that such combinations are not very larg». There are larger combinations whose operations can be fairly measured by intelligent observers,, being conducted, for the most part, in the light of day. They ought not to be difficult to cope with. Behind them, we catch glimpses of trusts of another order, whose processes are secret, merciless, and dangerous to the community.: There is but one opinion throughout Australia as to monopolies of that character,, which use power recklessly and unscrupulously for personal gain. I believe that im nothing are our people more unanimousthan in deciding that the establishment of such trusts within the Commonwealth should be prevented by every means in our power. The gradual growth of such organizations must be watched in order that they may never become powerful enough to> set themselves above the law, above patriotism, and above society, as they are said to have done elsewhere.. For those, I think they will find that theLegislatures of Australia, whatever theircolour, will have scant consideration. The.y will be required to cleanse their processes, and to justify themselves, before they will' be permitted to remain a factor in the Commonwealth. This reference, although crude, issufficient for my purpose, if it remindshonorable members-to return once more to the path of the argument I was pursuinghow necessary it is that there should be a> complete investigation into all the factorsand circumstances concerned before a properdecision can be arrived at, or even expected. Some of my honourable colleagues, notably the honourable members for Angas, for Bendigo, and for Darling Downs, havequoted the researches already made, and thr facts already ascertained beyond question i i the United States of America. They have> shown how absolutely essential it is that there should be a thorough and most search? ing investigation before any step can be taken with confidence. I do not wish, to'detain the House by repeating, although!they deserve to be repeated, many of the official statements already placed before the House, which I trust will be carefully considered by the people. They prove that, just as trusts are discovered operating malignantly in quarters where they werehardly expected, so in places where it seemed perfectly plain that smilar raids upon society were being planned or executed, investigation has proved that wewere on a false track, and that natural and> ordinary causes will in - some cases, at alt - events, account for phenomena which - caused a great deal of alarm. The Select Corrrmittee on Wages, Prices, and Commodities appointed by the Senate of the United States of America in .brought out a number of very vital facts. It has shown that wages did not advance *here as rapidly as did - sentence in itself summarizes a change of - conditions of enormous importance to poorly or less well-paid class of the oiity. The advance in prices outstripped (the advance in wages, leaving the wageis - earner, through no fault of his own, - worse position than he occupied before. Naturally, the question arises how he ^be protected against this impoverishment. '.The Committee reported that the labour - culties, which had then been the subject mediation in the United States of America for two or three years, had as their ; the advanced cost of living. The community was reminded of what it might otherwise ""have forgotten: that the class who earned their living by their daily labour were ipelled to appeal for more consideration in unexpected. - consequence of a rise in prices, for which ithey were apparently in no way remore sponsible. The hours of labour over a are any others. - period, it is true, had been reduced, but while the weekly earnings in some cases vanced, these were usually exceeded by .advance in the prices of necessary commoproducts dities. Employes, therefore, found - selves, even with a certain increment to - - wages, in a more serious position than before. to causes producing higher prices. Oddly enough, as it may seem, this 'Select Committee goes on to show that .prices of many of the trust-produced - commodities had not advanced as rapidly .as those not so derived. It shows that where in some cases trust-produced modities had advanced greatly, short - supplies were apparently responsible for increases, and that the same prices had vanced in other countries where trusts could - not have exercised the same control over - production and marketing. These are sobering reminders which we find on official records of what, in this respect, the most experienced country in the world. Then, again, it is surprising to many us to learn from the same official report that the Tariff seems to have been material factor in causing an advance - prices during the past decade. The Amerithe can Tariff is regarded with the gravest prehensions and the most complete mistrust by some citizens of that country. Yet -.they are officially informed that, as Mr Deakin. had can be traced, it had been no material factor in the increase of prices. In other words, as the report states a little later on, the Tariff has had little or no effect on 1910 prices. Who amongst those anti-Protectionists would have credited that, but for this official, dispassionate, and thorough! prices. That one investigation ? These facts appear to me to be absothe lutely pertinent to the issues before us. cornmuThe advance in prices, says the report of this Committee, has been world-wide. That another matter that will have to be taken in a into account. It has occurred in countries in which, so far as we know, trusts do can not exist, as well as in countries where they operate. The strangest fact of all found diffiby this Committee is that the products of of the farm and foods have advanced in price more than manufactured articles. To find basis that true of the United States of America, with its enormous area of unoccupied and unfilled lands, and with its immense development of agriculture, witnessed to by comits huge shipments oversea, is certainly",57
341,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thos e commodities are under the domination of trusts than,59
342,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; the explanation is adgiven a little later on in the report. It was an found, first of all, that the prices of farm and foods were more sensitive than themwere those of manufactured commodities, their and would, therefore, respond more quickly The Committee found, further, that the demand had outgrown the production of these commodities; that the withdrawal from farms of large numbers of persons who had entered industrial pursuits was another cause. comTheir industrial labours prevented the prices of manufactured articles rising, while the the withdrawal of theii labour from the adfarm and the growth of the demand, caused the farm products, in a perfectly natural way, to increase in price. This Select Committee the discovered that what by accumulation the had become the great disturbances agitatis ing the United States of America, were sometimes due to simple natural causes. of The position seems perfectly plain and open as stated by this impartial Committee of no high quality, after the fullest inquiry. in The withdrawal of labour from the farms, cessation in the attraction of agriculaptural pursuits, the drawing of numbers of farm labourers to the cities, and the increase in consequence of industrial products, tofar as gether with the increase in the price of agricultural products, perfectly explain the position.",59
343,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member will be teaching the Labour party mentspolitical economy, if he is not careful.",60
344,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If c is to the Select Comever mittee of the Senate of the United States much of America that we owe this light. The Committee proceeded to make one or two ducts more statements. It reported thatPrices appear to have advanced somewhat more rapidly in the United States than on the ContinentThat is Europeexcepting possibly Canada and Russia. The two countries that none of us would have expected to be bracketed in such a relation are Russia, with its vast unfilled extent and its unemployed possibilities, and Canada, under very different circumstances, at least in an equally hopeful position. The conjunction of these two countries is the more remarkable since, as I believe I shall be able to show from Canadian testimony, within the borders of Canada trusts and combines practically hardly exist. We find, however, Russia and Canada bracketed together as showing, probably, a more rapid increase of prices than does even the United States of America. The report includes some very interesting tables, with which ' I shall not attempt to deal. I shall .quote only one or two.",60
345,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the statement as to the advance in prices include the price of meat?,60
346,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Prices , I think, are taken as a whole.",60
347,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is said 41113* meat sold in Canada for 6d. per lb. is fetching is. per lb. in the United States of America.,60
348,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That can also be explained. The Committee reported that in the period mentioned the prices of farm products advanced 39.8 per cent., food, &c, 19.7 per cent., and lumber and building materials 19.6 per cent.; while clothes ;and clothing-the first manufactured articles on the list-advance d only 12 per cent., and metals and implements only 3.6 per cent. In another summary it is stated that in a decade the products of forests increased by 40.3 per cent, above the prices ruling in 1900; the crude products of the farm by 36.1 per cent., and manufactured products of the farm by 24.2 per cent.; whilst the products of mines and wells increased by 13.5 per cent., and the products of manufacture by only 5.5 per cent. This table of increases is about the last that one would, have expected in respect of the United! States of America. The Committee comThe figures seem to indicate clearly that whatcauses are operating to advance prices aremore effective in raising the prices of theproducts of the forest and of the farms than of manufactured products. . . . So far as proof the forest are concerned, the supply int the TJnited States is diminishing, and the cost, of production and marketing have both increased.. The farm products are being produced on mucin more expensive land, and farm wages have in creased more rapidly than have those of any other group of workers. We have here the explanation of what: otherwise would seem to be an extraordinary, transformation. The lesson to be derived from this report is the absolute necessity for obtaining similar reports in regard to» Australia, if we are to keep our fingers ort the pulse of trade and to detect and measure the operation of any big trust that may endeavour to set its foot in this country. In addition to that, we shall need to> have either in association with the Inter-State Commission or supplied from othersources a Government Department soequipped that officers of this Commonwealth, without disclosing business; or commercial secrets, shall be enabled? to investigate any challenged operations-giving sufficient suggestion of the operation of unwholesome influences In that way we shall be able to keep our fingers, so to speak, upon the pulse b f trade, commerce, and production, and to interpret the figures laid before us from year to year. In that way only shall webe able to guarantee to the people of this country, not that the idler shall do as wellas the busy, not that the able and persevering merchant will be caught up and passed by the indifferent, not that those who have the means and the wit to use the most modern developments in machinery orappliances will be on the same footing as their more negligent competitors-thes e arematters in which individual competitionmust be left as before, to do its own work - bu t that each and all of these operationswithin the scope of the Commonwealth shall' have a fair field and no favour. In that way only shall we be able to guarantee them against invasions or aggressions that might possibly be directed against them by acombination of the resources of a number of those engaged in particular industrieswhich they wish to subordinate to their own purposes, instead of to the public wealThe whole basis of the success of our inquiry into, and of our handling of, trusts, - combines, and similar organizations, depends upon the thoroughness, the fairness, and reliability of the investigation into all their operations. With nothing less than that can the community be content when it finds itself suffering from what, apparently, may be due to their operations. But the American figures teach us the lesson that we shall need to be supplied even - more fully than we have been so far, with all that mass of information which will knit us more closely to the population placed, and yet to be placed, upon the lands of Australia. We shall need more information to enable us to follow them through all their fortunes, to estimate how far their products-whic h go to make up the products of the whole country-hav e suffered, - or are suffering, from bad seasons, insect pests, or any other cause, and to test the legitimacy of the rise in prices which must necessarily follow when any of these conditions obtain. We need to direct developments into healthy channels, and to make convictions assured whenever trespasses .against the Commonwealth, of the kind .alleged to prey upon the United States - of America, are found. These must be tracked to their dens, exposed, and - subordinated or extinguished. I trust, will be conducted by a body - which, however competent it is in olher directions, must be entirely unaffected and untouched by political considerations or party feelings or relations. Nothing should he done to confuse those great social issues which arise out of causes and circumstances, most of them beyond complete - control. These, if they contain those mischievous characteristics to which I have alluded, can be promptly and fairly dealt with by a body which will turn the searchlight on them in their operations and their processes, if they are suspected of injury to the public weal. But th's should be ^undertaken as a matter of science and of ""business, and not as a matter of politics. There should be no political party in this - country that would soil its hands by association with such trusts as are reported to - exist in some countries abroad. It would be well, too, for us if , from the first, we took care that, in the use of the necessary supervision, justice is done to the people of the country, and, at the same time, injustice is avoided to those who may be only connected with, and in no sense ^responsible for, unexpected rises in prices Mr Deakin. or similar occurrences. Those concerned should have the assurance that independent and impartial inquiry will be meted out - to them, and that they will receive the full consideration which is the due of every citizen of the country providing his hands are clean. That appears to me to be the path which the circumstances require us to tread. I wish it had been taken earlier. I wish that, instead of dealing with the question as we do at present, still in doubt as to the extent of the operations of these alleged combinations in Australia and as to the injurious effect, if any, on the welfare of the country-stil l in doubt as we are, in point of fact, about the whole subject- I wish we were debating the one question as to the best means of dealing with trusts and combines. As a fact, we are scarcely on the threshold of a great subject, which will require to be investigated before we shall feel ourselves capable of dealing with an issue which assumes sufficient importance to call for national attention. If we turn to Canada we find that the evidence to which I have already alluded is reinforced. An Act passed in May, 1910, in Canada has more than once been referred to in the debate already, and might be profitably referred to again were I desirous of This, unduly trespassing on the time of the House. The scope of that Act and its particularity shows that, although Canada is reported to be free from injurious trusts at the present time, a Canadian tribunal exists armed with powers most carefully and elaborately adjusted to the investigation of every suspicious development in trade or production which appears to call for examination. Its definitions are of the widest, and it seems to include everything within the scope of inquiry that could be of service. It actually goes the length of placing in the hands of any six British subjects resident in Canada, who believe a combine exists, and that prices have been enhanced or competition restricted by reason of it, to the detriment of consumers or producers, the power to apply to a Judge to order an investigation to be made. Any six persons in Canada can set the machinery in motion, and the only restriction is the very restriction which we think ought to be applied in the proposal before us. It is a comparatively small restriction in itself, but yet of great value. In Canada the proof has to be that the action of the combine results to the detriment of consumers or producers. It is amazing that there should be any hesitation in granting this very small and mild modification, since, when necessary, larger powers can be added to the immense scope already given by the provision in Canada.",60
349,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But in Canada that is provided in the Bill, and not in the Constitution ",62
350,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is in the Bill, it is true.",62
351,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We can put it in the Bill.,62
352,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And it ought to be put in our Bill. Its absence from our Constitution is only an invitation to many inquiries which may prove barren, and also lead to a number of others in which the detriment to the public may be expressed by the smallest fraction, and investigation would not be worthwhile. The object of our endeavour is to impress on honourable members the wisdom of making this reasonable restriction in order to remove any idea on the part of the public of Australia that there is intended to be what might be called household espionage - an y entering a man's dwelling without warrant or authority, or other abuses of authority. I know the unqualified way in which this proposal may affect persons outside is a factor to be considered. However, we must remember that in Canada the Government have put such a wise provision in the Act, and have put it info operation. We have not. The Ministry refuse to insert it.",62
353,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is there an Inter-Sta'.e Commission in Canada?,62
354,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not what we should call an Inter-State Commission. I was just about to show the procedure in Canada, which may be described as of a directly judicial character. There is no hesitation or half measures in Canada. The subject has there been grappled with boldly. Its Parliament has introduced not only the protecting amendment, which we have always supported, but an additional minor guarantee of the same character. The following shows the scope of the Canadian Act:Combines Act - Canada . NA COMBINES, MONOPOLIES, TRUSTS, AND MERGERS. "" Combine"" is defined to mean any contract, agreement, arrangement, or combination which has, or is designed to have, the effect of increasing or fixing the price or rental of any - article of trade or commerce or the cost of the storage or transportation thereof, or of restricting competition in or controlling the production, manufacture, transportation, storage, sale, or supply thereof, to the detriment of consumers, or producers of such article of trade or commerce, and includes the acquisition, leasing, or.' otherwise taking over or obtaining by any person to the end aforesaid, of any control over or interest in the business, or any portion of the: business, of any other person, and also includes, what is known as a trust, monopoly, or merger. Six or more persons (British subjects residing, in Canada) who think 1. that a combine exists; 2. that prices have been enhanced or competition restricted by reason of suck combine to the detriment of consumers or producers, may make an application to a Judge for an. order directing an investigation into such alleged combine. If on hearing the Judge is satisfied there is reasonable ground for believing a combine existswhich is injurious to trade or which has operated to the detriment of consumers or producers, and that it is in the public interest that an investigation should be held, an investigation may beordered. NA INVESTIGATION. A person reported by the Board to have beeni guilty of1. unduly limiting the facilities for transporting, producing, . manufacturing,, supplying, storing, or dealing in any article which may be a subject of trade and commerce; 2. restraining or injuring trade and commerce in relation to any such article 3. unduly preventing, limiting, or lessening: the manufacture or production of any such article; 4. unreasonably enhancing the price thereof :5. unduly preventing or lessening competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation, storage, or supply of any such articleand who thereafter continues so to offend, is guilty of an indictable offence, and liable toa penalty not exceeding 1,000 dollars and costsfor each day after the expirntion of ten davs, or such further extension of time as in the opinion of the Board may be necessary, front the date of the publication of the report of the Board in the Canada Gazette during 'which, such person so continues to offend.",62
355,Mr THOMAS BROWN,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,An Act operates. in the same way in Australia.,62
356,Mr GROOM,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,And yet the Labour Government have done nothing.,62
357,Mr DEAKIN,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"As the honourable member for Darling Downs interjects, thisLabour Government has done nothing under its own Act. However, we are further told by a newspaper correspondentAssented 4th May, 1910. The Combines Act, placed on the Dominionstatutes three years ago, has had its first test. The majority of the Federal Government Commission appointed to iriquire into the United' Shoe Manufacturing Company have reported/ that the company is "" a combine in restriction) - of trade,"" and, as such, liable to a penalty of $1,000 a day. The Commissioners recommend 'that the company be given six months grace within which to dissolve or cease its monopolistic - operations. It is a United States enterprise - which furnishes Canadian boot and shoe manufacturers with machinery for their factories. It controls the patents, and forbade its customers to purchase from rival machinery men. A large ]>oot manufacturer complained to the - Government, and the finding outlined above is the result. It is reported that as a way out of its difficulty the company will itself go expensively into the manufacture and sale of boots .and shoes in rivalry with existing enterprises. That is to say, the Combine was obliged - cease its monopoly, and, in order to use .machinery, found it necessary to become manufacturer of boots, which we may prerichly deserve. sume will be placed on the market to the advantage of the people of Canada. The dual character of many of ^business organizations has already - referred to. The procedure in the future will, no doubt, be under the last Act passed - by the present Parliament, by which those - suspected will be compelled to prove innocence. Under that Act, the Cornmonopinion - wealth no longer needs to prove the guilt those accused, but is able to place the burden of proof on the defendant. was nothing in our Vend case, to which allusion has so often been made, to oblige vthe Government to cling to this earlier instead of tKe later one, under which - could have operated. What reason there was for that self-restraint I do not know. It has to be remembered, however, that in ""this case against the Shipping Combine in - connection with the Coal Vend the defendsafeguards ants made no defence. The case made impose. --against them was, in their opinion, so - sufficient that they did not put one witness In the box. The case presented by the Crown was so feeble that it was set aside T>y a majority of the High Court. Of - course, the procedure under the later Act - might not have seemed adapted to the case, ""though that, to me, seems impossible. may have been thought that it would be 'harsh to have exercised the powers taken by the Government of forcing the Shipping Combine to prove its own innocence; but all this, and much more, I expect no explabe nation now. I do say, however, that when we commence to deal with the great business operations of this country, it will not couched, - do to handle defendants in that fashion. Dealing with them must not be indefinitely postponed without reason or excuse, and when inquiry is undertaken it must be after an investigation sufficient to satisfy the ""Government that they are certain of proving Mr Deakin. their case; otherwise It would be better not to launch a case at all. The result of the last trial has been to discredit every one concerned, and to discredit, to some extent, the law. It has engendered in the minds of the public a general suspicion that a big gun was used to bring down big game, but so badly handled that' the game escaped. This will not satisfy business people, any ""more than it will satisfy the community generally. On the next occasion the public will demand a justification of the particular to course followed by the Government against its men, believed to be plundering the public, a bringing them to the justice which they so",62
358,Mr FENTON,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,The case is not over yet.,63
359,Mr DEAKIN,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"Because of the apthese peal I make no further comment. It been raises a question-that I shall not argue or further refer to-whethe r the speediest, the most satisfactory, or the mostsuccessful course has been followed. There, their may have been honest differences of among Ministers and their advisers, of but our legal forces have made a most unfortunate entry into this particular field There of operations. What the people of Australia needed was Act a carefully prepared and well-directed they charge proved, and the guilty persons adequately punished. This would have enormously strengthened the Parliament in its claim that industrial enterprises can no longer be permitted to proceed without those which Parliament alone can We need these to protect us inagainst the exercise of misused power upon the enterprises of the community, with a desire to limit or crush them, or to take unfair advantage of business or social conditions to remove rivals and crush fair competition. No civilized country in these days should tolerate the existence of such It a state of affairs. To cope with it, as I have not disguised, great powers must be asked and conceded. It is because great powers have been asked, which we are willof ing to concede, that we the more regret to obliged, by the wholesale and indiscriminate terms in which the proposition is now to be compelled to oppose it on the ground that it does not contain that proper limitation to reasonable causes of injury, and that reasonable consideration for innocent persons affected, which would have enabled us to endorse it unanimously. The House most decidedly does endorse the principle of restraint of trusts within strict bounds, and their continued supervision by qualified and independent men acting on behalf of the Commonwealth.",63
360,Mr GROOM,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"Darling Downs) [9.19]. - The Leader of the Opposition has very properly pointed out that the Liberal party has consistently expressed their willingness by all the legislative means in their power to deal with injurious trusts and combines, and are willing to accept an alteration of the Constitution, which will give effect to that principle. So far as combines are in restraint of trade, this party has always been willing to vote for any alteration of the Constitution necessary to enable them to be effectively dealt with. The idea of attacking trusts and combines is no new thing with the Liberal party, a Bill being introduced in the first Parliament to control them. I refer to a measure presented by the Right Hon. C. C. Kingston, and read a first time on 18th April, 1902. That was a measure covering the first Australian Tariff, and it contained the following clause(1) Whenever the Governor General has son to believe that with regard to any. goods Canadian there exists any trust combination association agreement of any kind among importers inanufactuiers of, or dealers in such goods to some effect. unduly enhance their price or in any other way to unduly promote the advantage of the porters manufacturers or dealers at pense of the consumers the Governor General may by commission empower any Justice of the High Court or any Judge of the Supreme Court of a State to inquire in a summary way and report to the Governor General whether sucb trust combination association or agreement exists. (2) The Justice or Judge may compel the attendance of witnesses and examine them upon oath and require the production of books and papers and shall have such other powers as are conferred upon him by the Governor General for the purpose of such inquiry. .(3) If the Justice or Judge reports that such trust combination association or agreement exists the report shall be laid before both Houses of the Parliament and the Governor General may upon an address from both Houses of the Parliament by proclamation direct that the goods shall be admitted free of duty or at such reduced rate of duty as will give to the public the benefit of reasonable competition in the goods. The clause was withdrawn, because it was thought that the Bill being a taxing Bill, it might be held that the introduction into it of the provision that I have read might be considered a violation of the Constitution, which says that taxing Bills shall deal with taxation only. In withdrawing it-, Mr Kingston saidAs a matter of policy, perhaps, the course of public business will best be facilitated if we withdraw the clause from the Bill , and deal with it subsequently. I trust that honourable members who agree with the policy contained in the clause will be equally desirous of facilitating its passage when it"" is introduced on a subsequent occasion. The first Deakin Government went out of office, but when the second Deakin Government came into power, it introduced a fuller proposal. I refer to the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1906.",64

365,Mr GROOM,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"The Liberal Government has always been in favour of legislation to control trusts and combines, andi took steps for their prosecution in 1907,. as soon as the law was passed. Theprovision brought forward by Mr Kingreaston was, as he stated, taken from thelaw. According to Mr.. or MCKenzie King, the Canadian Minister for or Labour, the Canadian Act has been of This is part of a speechimwhich he delivered in the Canadian House the exof Commons on 12th April, 1910In 1897, just a year after the present Goverument came into office, new legislation was enacted! in the Tariff resolutions. That legislation is to the effect that whenever the Governor in Council, has reason to believe that a trust, combine, or association exists among manufacturers, which is unduly enhancing prices, he may appoint a Judge to conduct investigations into the business of the alleged combine; and if it be found that a combine does exist, and is benefiting by the existence of the Customs Tariff at the expense of tbepublic, that the Tariff may, either in part or im whole, be modified so as to offer to the consumers that redress to which they are entitled. He mentions a combine whose affairs they, investigated, and with which they dealt ire accordance with the lawThat complaint was brought to the attention of the Government by a resolution {rom the Canadian Press Association of 18th Hay, 1900. Thecoinplaint was considered by the Minister of Finance, and an Order in Council was passed on. 22nd April, appointing the Honourable Mr Juslice Taschereau as a Commissioner to - ascertain whether such a dangerous association or combinedid exist. The Commissioner presented his report on 27th November, 1901, and found that a. combine existed which was illegal "" both by theexpress enactment of the Customs Tariff, which/ forbids the act complained of, and authorizesdirect Government action, if it is committed, and by section 220 of the Criminal Code, to say nothing of common law on the matter."" Thereport of the Commissioner having been placed before His Excellency in Council, an Order in Council was passed in February of the following year reducing the duty on news printing paper from 25 per cent, to 15 per cent., which reduction has remained up to the present time. As a. result of this investigation, rendered possible through the legislation of 1897, the consumers of Canada have profited to the extent of a 10 per cent, reduction in the duty on paper ever since, and it is difficult to say how many cases this successful operation of the Act against such SL powerful combination as the Canada paper - manufacturers may not have prevented in like combinations among other manufacturers, or attempts to reap an unfair advantage at the expense of the public in the case of those already m existence. This Parliament has the constitutional right to pass such legislation as that. If in any State, or part of a State, a trust or combine is taking advantage of the Tariff, it is open to us, on the determination of the facts, to reduce its protection, if we think fit, and so bring it to book. That was the proposition of Mr Kingston, whose Protectionist principles no man ever questioned. It was the suggestion of the most ardent advocate of Protection that - ever stood in this House.",64
366,Mr FENTON,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,Is that the way in which the honourable member would deal with trusts?,65
367,Mr GROOM,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"It is a way in which they can be dealt with successfully, and in Canada has been applied to one of the largest combines in the country. As to labour conditions, the majority report of our Tariff Commission, which was signed by the honourable members for Bendigo and Capricornia, Senator MCGregor, and Mr. Frank Clarke, made this recommendationI f the majority of manufacturers of mining machinery and appliances made in Australia .similar to those upon which additional duties are hereby levied do not after the expiration - of one year of the passing of this Act pay .their workmen engaged in making such machines and appliances a fair and reasonable rate of wages, the Governor General may, in pursuance of a joint address by the Senate and the House of Representatives affirming that such fair and seasonable wages are not being paid, suspend the - collection of such additional duty upon any imochine or appliance for such time as may be - deemed advisable. If persons are found to be taking undue advantage of the Tariff to increase prices, the position can be met by the reduction of duties. All in Australia are keenly alive to the evils of trusts, though this country appears to be relatively free from them; at any rate, we have no evidence of the existence of many trusts or combines of an injurious nature.",65
368,Mr SPENCE,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,Then why denounce the Government for not prosecuting them?,65
369,Mr GROOM,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"The Attorney-General says that the industrial unrest is due to the existence of trusts and combines here, and I say that if that is the view of the Government, they should prosecute those trusts and combines; but my opinion is that those who administer public affairs,and who ought to be able to supply us with information on the subject, have submitted ' no evidence of the existence of injurious trusts and combines.",65
370,Mr SPENCE,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,We ought not to wait until the evil has been created. We should be prepared in advance.,65
371,Mr GROOM,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"I agree with the honourable member that prevention is better than cure. That was why we introduced our anti-trust legislation. The honourable member, on one memorable occasion, pointed out that from a Labour point of view there was a great deal to be said in favour of combines, because they were organizing industry, and thus getting everything ready for its nationalization. He regarded them as a step in Socialistic evolution. Although a trust may do good in securing economy and efficiencv, and facilitating supplies, it may, on the whole, be an evil, and we on this side therefore desire legislation to prevent such from doing harm. In this connection, I cannot do better than give a summary, given by Mr MCKenzie King, taken from a work by Professor Jenks, of America, whose book is not in our Library, dealing with the evils resulting from trustsEnormous as these benefits to society may be from this better organization of capital under the new regime, no less pronounced arc the evils. (1) Investors of capital are often grievously wronged through concealment of facts and deception practised by promoters and directors at the time an industry is organized, and later through misrepresentation of the condition of business and methods in which a business is carried on. (2) A second class of persons injured is that of the stock-holders. Directors not infrequently manage the business in their own interests, regardless of those of the stock-holders. At times it is really made less profitable, or is so managed as apparently to be less profitable, in order to depress the stock on the market and to enable the directors through gambling speculations to reap large profits. (3) Persons, not members of a corporation, may be injured as consumers by high prices, which can be kept high, provided the combination can secure monopolistic power. The temptation to keep prices above former competitive rates is, of course, greatly increased when the corporation has issued large amounts of watered stock. (4) The producer of raw material may. be. injured by low prices, which the combination, by virtue of its being the,, largest, if not almost the sole, buyer, can compel the producer to aocept. (5) The combination may so increase its power as to injure the wage earners by compelling them to accept lower wages or to work under less favourable conditions than would be granted by competing concerns. So, too, the power exercised, apparently Arbitrarily at times, of closing part of the iplanls to avert a strike, or even to afreet the - stock market, is dangerous. (6) It may happen al times that the larger organizations will exert so powerful an influence on our political organizations that the purpose of the State will be directed away from the common weal. (7) The mental tone of the business community may be lowered by depriving individuals of the privilege and of the power to enter independently into business as readily as could be done were capital less concentrated. (8) And, again, the moral tone of business may be lowered. He then gives the methods for dealing with trusts in Canada. frankly admit that some of these evils are possible in connection with trusts, of them cart be more or less adequately <0ealt with by means of legislation. Let us take the Attorney-General's proposition that the industrial unrest of today is to trusts and combines. That contention is capable of two meanings-one , that the reported thatindustrial unrest of today is due to the fact that trusts and combines do not give andTheconsumers fair labour conditions; the other that grade of article are they interfere with prices, and so affect the wages of the workers. Will any one say that labour conditions in Australia seriously affected by trusts and combines? If so, my answer is that in the trusts and combines have been reported to exist in Australia there are Wages Boards the determinations or arbitration awards reand lating to the industries carried on by them. So much for that aspect of the matter. to I have already made reference to American and Canadian Acts, and have shown that trusts can be effectively dealt with if the Administration has the courage and strength of character to enforce the law against such organizations. members opposite have dwelt on the question portedof high prices, and have suggested that the high prices prevailing throughout Ausnational tralia are due entirely to the operation of trusts and combines. It cannot be denied that there has been a gradual increase in prices throughout Australia. I have here tributing a return provided by the Government merely Statist of Victoria, showing the purchasing power of £ 1 in 1911 compared with the ten preceding years. The table as followsl'urchasing power of £ 1 sterling expended on Household Commodities, Clothing in i g n , compared with the ten preceding years. Melbourne and Suburbs.

It is world-wide, and in some countries the rise has been much higher than in Australia. The causes of this rise in prices are fully set out in the report of the Massachusetts Commission, to be found at page 12 of the United States I Senate Reports, vol. 46. I shall not refer at this stage to all of the causes enumerated. but all I - desire only to mention as one of the causes which have been given for the increased cost of living in every country the fact that a higher standard of due living is now demanded. A Select Committee of the United States of America standard of living has steadily advanced, demanding a much higher than was the case a few years ago. This advance in standard of living has been a material factor in increasing prices. o are Then, again, the United States Consulcases where General at Vienna writesThe advance numerically in population and increase in the degree of national education material culture have been the most marked influence in raising prices. These influences have led to increased consumption of home products, diminished exportations of foodstuffs, and to a general rise in the cost of living. These influences are constant and permanent, and go livingfurther to account for the increased cost of than all other causes combined. We are also informed that the United Honourable States Consul-General in Germany reRapidly-accumulated fortunes and increasing wealth have created new standards ancl new requirements, shorter hours of labour, higher wages, old'age and accident insurance, abundant tables, better homes-thes e are among the concauses of the higher cost of living, not as respects commodities, but as respects total f e r capita expenditures. That is only one of the many causes given is for the increase in prices. I wish now to refer honourable members to another cause mentioned in the report of the and Kent, Massachusetts CommissionThe primary cause of the world-wide advance of prices since 1897 has been the increase of thegold supply, which has reduced the purchasing power of money and brought about a corresponding increase of values measured in money in all the leading commercial States, and at least in the United States has served as the basis for a vast extension of credit. That is only one of many causes given in the report, but since its operation is world-wide I think it desirable to specially mention it. It is plain from the enumeration of the causes of the increase in prices how delicate a problem the regulation of prices will be. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I desire'to see effectual action taken to deal with all trusts and combines, but that I cannot see my way to support a series of amendments of the Constitution, the sole object of which is not the effective control or regulation of trusts and combines, but the nationalization of the whole means of production, distribution, and exchange.",65
372,Mr ATKINSON,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"Wilmot) [9.46] - As we are likely to hear more of this proposed amendment of the Constitution than of any other during the forthcoming campaign, I think it desirable to emphasize one or two points in relation to it. We are entitled in the first place to have some information as to the intentions of the Government, if the powers for which they ask be granted to them. If the Government are to prescribe the remedy, surely the people are entitled to ask what it is to be, and what will be its probable effect. We have, first of all, to ask ourselves whether all the denunciation of trusts to which we have listened can be justified. It seems to me that the Government and their supporters have sought to make trusts responsible for many evils which cannot rightly be attributed to them, or for which they cam be blamed to only a slight extent. Are trusts the growth of modern times? Have they grown up as part of the ordinary evolution that has taken place in the commercial world during the past few years? If combinations are a natural growth caused by the necessity of producing articles more cheaply-if people have combined to consolidate several small businesses so as to secure economy in production, that is not altogether something to which objection can be taken. If men have been compelled to combine because of ruinous cut-throat competition on the part of a number of small competitors, that is another reason why we should try to look the whole matter full in the face, and to make ourselves thoroughly cognisant of the facts before we take any rash action. If a combination is a bene-: ficent institution, why should we be iti. such a hurry to deal with it? The honourable member for Darling Downs has just referred to the question of high prices and their cause. To hear honourable members opposite talking of trusts, one would imagine that such organizations are solely responsible for the rise in prices. On a previous occasion I showed that Mr J. A. Hobson, writing in the Contemporary Review, satisfactorily disposed of that contention. He shows that trusts and similar bodies are only one of a series of causes-som e much greater-for the increase in prices that has taken place of late years, and that that increase, which is world-wide, dates back to about 1895.. Mr Hobson also indicates the conditions under which prices may be expected! to return to their normal level. I admit that there are in the world to-daymany injurious trusts and combinationsthat should be curbed.",67
373,Mr WEBSTER,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,Giv e us a few instances..,67
374,Mr ATKINSON,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"Thos e who have read of the conditions that prevail in. America must be convinced that there aresome injurious trusts in that countrytrusts with which we should like to deal if they were operating here. One of the matters to be desired in dealing, with trusts and combinations is publicity. If we had some means of making public the operations of trusts-if we could allow public opinion to have its due effect upon them, we' should probably keep most of such organizations within reasonablebounds. I do not pin my faith absolutely to the efficacy of publicity alone as a. means of coping with trusts. I do not attach to it so much importance as does Mr Andrew Carnegie; but I think that it would have a good effect since it would allow public opinion to exercise that healthy influence which it can alwaysbring to bear upon any individual or body of individuals who do wrong. America is probably the home of the trusts. The ravages of trusts are more apparent there than in any other country, yet one canhardly find an American writer who advocates that which honourable members opposite say is the only remedy, namely, the nationalization of such bodies. Mr. H . E. Montgomery, in a book entitled Vital American Problems, writing, of the publicity obtained by inspection, says at page 90Even when such inspection is coupled with 'power to raise and reduce the prices to - charged to consumers, the result as evidenced the foregoing table is not equal to what is sired, and plainly indicates that the system of inspection and regulation fails to remedy - evils complained of. In so far as the law goes it is entirely factory, but it cloes not go far enough. Regucredited lation by fixing prices will not be effectual; .proper control and regulation by inspection will not be 'successful. Taxation of profits - coupled with inspection is .the only way - which prices can be controlled, monopolies curbed, and the public be protected. This writer does not seem to have as much faith in the value of publicity as I have. Notwithstanding his opinion, I think that there is much virtue in allowing the light of day to shine upon the operations of trusts. During the last two or the Government and their supporters have had a splendid opportunity to give pubshould licity to the operations of the trusts which monopolies, they assert prevail in Australia. Under the law as it stands the Attorney-General - could have put questions to the men conis cerned, and have published the answers and given by them. As a matter of fact, the ISherman Government have not taken advantage of bines one of .the powers which they at present lic possess. They are going to the country perfectly to howl down trusts, and to hold up all can sorts of bogies in connection with them in *he hope that they will thus induce the this people to give them the powers for which If they ask. The public, therefore, will learn with interest that they have not atsuppression tempted to use the powers they possesspowers which have been shown to be believe.' - adequate to deal with the Beef Trust, .Sugar Trust, and with others with which they say the country is afflicted. ' The - decision given by Mr Justice Isaacs the Vend case was not upheld by the High Court, not because the law was not wide - enough, but because the Crown had failed to prove its case. The Crown, the opinion of the High Court, had tralia failed to show that the Vend was acting to the detriment of the public. The result was that, in the opinion of Court, the Crown case failed. Since this Government came into power, a fresh tralian Industries Preservation Act has been passed-that is, in 1910-and this legislahave tion altogether alters the position. Under the new Act the onus of proof is placed the accused, who has to show that his actions are not unreasonable, or to the detriment of the public. Of course, this is not quite a British way of doing things, but it is a the course that has been found necessary, not be only in this country, but elsewhere. Howby ever that may be, the Government have denever attempted to put the Act into operathe tion. It is true that some time ago, when we first heard a Beef Trust mentioned, satisthe Minister of Trade and Customs was with saying that he had "" scotched"" it, though since then we alone have it on the authority of the Attorneyby General that the Beef Trust has arrived. If this be the fact, then I think the powers we already have ought to be tried before further powers are asked for. The other day the honourable member for Bendigo drew attention to the fact that the Government had not put their own Act into operation; and in regard to this the Age three years wrote the followingAssuming that the Commonwealth Constitution have the power to regulate trusts and is there needed any amendment of the Constitution in order to effect what is required ? He shows that our Australian Industries Preservation Act, as amended last session, "" one of the world's masterpieces of anti-trust anti-combine legislation,"" far beyond the Act or any other country in the world. t will permit the existence of trusts and comwhen they are not detrimental tp the pub; but, according to the member for Bendigo, it is effective against any combination which be shown to be "" detrimental to the public."" The weak part in all Ministerial speeches has been that no one of them has attempted to meet specific legal argument from a legal expert. it be valid, then all the florid declamation on the iniquities of trusts and the need of their goes by the board. If we have ample powers already, the asking for more would be reduced to the level of a piece of party makethe All we are told by our friends opposite is that in America, and other countries, efforts have been made to cope with trusts; in but we know that in both America and Germany the orders for dissolution have only resulted in the organizations reappearing and flourishing in some other in form. I think the legislation of Ausgoes further than that of any other country in this connection; and Parliament the has never refused the Government powers that were felt to be absolutely necessary. AusHad the Act already in existence been used as it should have been, we should not heard so much about trusts in Australia in the course of this debate. As a on matter of fact, honourable members opposite have no other remedy to propose but that of nationalization; and we can imagine what a delightful position the public would be in if the supply of beef, for instance, were nationalized. We have been told ' by the Government that they do not intend to put into operation the powers for which they ask, but merely to use them as a stepping-stone to the object I have just indicated. In the case of beef, it would be simply handing the monopoly from private hands into Government hands; and, while we may deal with and, perhaps, stop a private monopoly, the taxpayer can only pay and look pleasant when he has to face a Government monopoly. We have heard a great deal during recent years of the great injury that is done to the country by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, bufc it would appear from the report that has just been issued that the consumers are not so very badly treated after all; indeed, from Mr Crawford's minority report one might gather that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is altogether a most beneficent monopoly. As a representative of Tasmania, which State has suffered more than any other from present conditions in the sugar industry, I am not likely to hold a brief for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The fruit producers of my own State have suffered much in this connection, while the State revenue has, from the same causes, been largely depleted. But I desire to be fair, and I find that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company pay their employees very well indeed. If that company had not been in existence some years ago, there would not be a sugar industry in Australia today. I understand that in the eighties, when there was a great slump in sugar, it was practically insolvent. Since then, it has had a good time. As the result of splendid management, pluck, and perseverance, it is today in a strong position. I say that it well deserves success. . It has installed in its various remodelled. fineries the most up-to-date machinery, and it supplies a good article which is more than is usually supplied by any Government which enters the industrial field. VVe have only to go to France, and try the tobacco which is sold there, in order to prove that- I am glad to see that the Sugar Commission in its report has turned down the proposal to nationalize the industry. Considering the personnel of that body, I am satisfied that its report is a crushing disappointment to honourable members opposite. All that it does is to Mr Atkinson. advise the adoption of a sliding scale, by which the price to be paid for raw sugar and sugar cane respectively will vary irr fixed proportion to the selling price of refined sugar. There is nothing in that recommendation to flatter the hopes of my honourable friends opposite. It is a very good thing that the Commission has put a spoke in the wheel of the Government, for I am satisfied that if the latter had the manufacture of sugar in their hands the consumer would get a worse, article than he gets today, and would be taxed to make up the loss incurred in running the industry. Honourable members opposite do not really desire this unlimited power to deal with trusts-the y really desire to nationalize industries. In such circumstances, the whole country would become a hive of civil servants, whom nothing short of an earthquake would shift from their billets. That sort of thing was not contemplated by the people of Australia. They desire to give every individual a fair chance. 1 f a combination is conducting its business operations pioperly, and making only a fair profit, they will be only too ready to sav "" Good luck to it . "" The difference between members of the Labour party ancl members of the Opposition is that, whereas they desire an unlimited power in respect of trusts, we wish to vest in this Parliament power to deal with trusts only if their operations are in restraint of trade, or in some way injuriousfcothe public. I am satisfied that the electors of this country take a keen interest in this matter; and that after they have informed themselves as to what are the facts, they will cast a vote which will not please my honourable friends. I would further point out that our Constitution admits freely of amendments being made in it. It is the elastic method by which it may be amended which makes it such a great improvement upon the American Constitution upon which it is",67

376,Mr ATKINSON,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"We are willing to amend the Constitution, but honourable members opposite would have the public believe that we do not wish to amend it. All we ask is that any amendment of it shall follow the lines upon which our Constitution has been fashioned. When we federated, we did so with the object that this Parliament should be an additional body for the better self-government of the people of Australia- a body which could exercise certain powers vested in it better than they could be exercised by any of sovereign States.",69

379,Mr CHARLTON,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,What has this to with trusts?,70
380,Mr ATKINSON,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"Honourable members opposite complain that the trusts want to control everything. It seems to me that some honourable members opposite want to control the whole of our proceedings, and to suppress anything that tells against them. Fortunately, Mr Speaker, you are here to protect us, and by your aid we are able to get in a word or two sometimes,, even though it may not be altogether palatable to the Ministerial party.",70
381,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"Moreton) [10.21] This Bill purports to control trusts, combines, and monopolies through the instrumentality of the Federal Government. The Attorney-General gave as a reason why the Bill should be passed that there are several injurious combines operating in Australia. He mentioned amongst others the Shipping and Coal Combines, with which the law, strong as it is, could not interfere to any great extent. But the reason why they could not be interfered with was that the Crown was unable to prove that the combines were detrimental to the public. He also mentioned the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. As a matter of fact, our antitrust law is strong enough to deal with the company very rigidly if all that the Attorney-Genera 1 said is true. First of all, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has refineries in three States. That makes its manufacturing operations Inter-State. Furthermore, it draws its supplies of sugar from two States and from abroad. In this respect it is not only Inter-State in its operations, but also foreign. It sells sugar in every State of the Commonwealth, and also abroad. Consequently, in respect of [3] 2 2 commerce its operations are Inter-State and foreign. It is fortunate that even at this the late hour we have been supplied with the report of the Sugar Commission. I have Will the not yet had time to read it through, but I notice that the Commission has turned down the pet scheme of the Ministerial party for nationalization of the sugar industry.",70
382,Mr FENTON,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,The Commission proposes,70
383,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"They propose to fix a minimum price. I find that the followsuggestion is made by the majority of the Commission at page 47 of their reThe suggestion has been made that, since re* are in a position to control prices in the Sugar Industry generally, the Commonwealth might enter into competition with existing concerns with a view to keeping down the price of do refined sugar, while raising the price of raw sugar. We cannot recommend the adoption of this suggestion :(1) The suggestion is probably due to an exaggeration of refining profits. The profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are largely due to items other than refining. (2) The suggestion is open to several of the objections already considered in relation to nationalization. (3) If the Commonwealth Refinery entered into competition with the Colonial ' "" Sugar Refining Company, the Commonwealth Refinery would be severely handicapped. It would have great difficulty in obtaining regular supplies of Australian raw sugar, and in getting its refined article regularly on the market. It would be expected to pay high prices for raw sugar, and to accept low prices for refined sugar. It would, moreover, come into competition with a long-established business conducted \yith a very hijjh degree of efficiency. We have frequently had occasion to criticise the Colonial Sugar Refining Company from various points of view, but we do not hesitate to express our admiration of the economic efficiency which characterizes every branch of its business which has come undei our notice. (4) In order to prove really effective for the purposes we have now in view, the Commonwealth Refinery would have to proceed on a large scale. This would imply a duplication of refining plants in Australia quite inconsistent with a sound economy of national resources. For the foregoing considerations, as well as for others, we are of opinion that the proposal to establish a Commonwealth Refinery is impracticable. The Attorney-General has referred '.') the enormous capital of the company. He said that its shares have been repeatedly watered, and that enormous profits have been put aside. In the minority report I find the following wordsIn 1887 the company was registered as with limited liability, and copies of the published cords of the company since that date were furnished to the Commission. These records show that the company has a paid-up capital of ^3,000,000, which, on the 29th April, igio, was divided among 1,740 shareholders. No watering of stock has taken place. The great part of the capital has been contributed by the shareholders, and the balance transferred to capital account from reserves accumulated during the 70 years of the company's existence. I find that the profits on refining made by the company have not exceeded 6 per cent., and honourable members will agree that that is not a large profit from an industry in which so much capital is sunk. Referring to question 16844, statement "" A , "" Mr. Crawford in his report saysAfter allowing for depreciation, the net on refining was said to be 12s. 6d. per ton. Which would be about 6 per cent The result of the Millaquin Company's refining operations for 9^ years was explained by the secretary as follows :From January to June we refine raw sugar, and this is known as our refining season; from July to December we refine raw and juice mixed, and this is called the juice season. The profit above shown, ^'18,883, was made in the refining seasons. During the refinin"" periods, 80,539 tons of raws were melted, so that the profit on the raw sugar refined amounts to 4s. Sd. per ton. The Millaquin Company is a smaller company working with perhaps less up-to-date machinery and methods than those in use by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Theii product is selling at a better price than that of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and their profit amounts to only 4s. 8d. per ton. It is clear, therefore, that unless we are prepared to put down an enormous plant, and place it in charge of better brains than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are able to command, it will be absolutely impossible for us to put sugar on the market at a lower rate than the Colonial' Sugar Refining Company have been doing. It should be borne in mind that the Millaquin Company sell the whole of their sugar to general distributors, whilst the Colonial Sugar Refining Company sell only three-fourths of their output to general distributors, ancl the other one-fourth to the jam and other manufacturers at a reduction of jQx per ton on the price charged to general distributors.",70
384,Mr TUDOR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,The reduction is sometimes more than £1 per ton. Hr. Sinclair.,71
385,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"If that be so, it only goes to show that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company receives an average price re- per ton lower than the price received by the Millaquin Company, who sell in the same market, and who, according to statements made in this House, have the freedom of the Australian market, and are hot in competition with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The reasons for the "" c u t "" price of sugar supplied to manufacturers were explained in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's general statement as followsThe primary point we have to keep in mind is that all the raw sugar produced in Australia under a protective Tariff must, after refining, be consumed in Australia, otherwise the surplus would have to be exported at a heavy loss in competition wilh sugar produced elsewhere wilh coloured Iaboui. From this evidence it is clear that the Coloprofit nial Sugar Refining Company have not inflicted a very serious burden upon the people of Australia. The Attorney-General instituted a comparison between the price of sugar in New Zealand and in the Commonwealth, and pointed out that there is a difference between the two prices of something like J£-J per ton. That old argument has been trotted out by Free Traders as long as I can remember, and it did not at all surprise me to hear the Attorney-General complain that we have to pay an extra price for sugar because of the protection we have afforded the manufacturers of the article by our Tariff. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - Has the honourable member recanted? How long is it since the honourable member left the Free Trade camp ?",71
386,Mr ROBERTS,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,The honourable member should not answer' that question. It is an awkward one.,71
387,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"It is not at all an awkward question for me.

388,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,It cloes not matter. It has nothing to do with the question under discussion.,71
389,Mr THOMAS,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,Surely the honourable membsr is not ashamed to say what it is.,71
390,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"I am not. It is exactly the opposite of the fiscal faith of the Minister of External Affairs. I am a Protectionist. I wish to point out that New Zealand is supplied with sugar grown in F i j i under conditions which were graphically described by the honourable member for Grey when speaking on the Address-inReply last year. That is one of the reasons why the people of New Zealand get cheaper sugar than we get in the Commonwealth. The principle reason, of course, is one which I hope will never be removed, and that is, we have a Protective duty of £ 6 per ton on outside sugar and sugar manufactured under the conditions described by the honourable member for Grey when he said last year The work of the missionary has been attended in those islands with better results than in many other cases, but within recent years the supar industry has been started there, with results which I propose to describe. Although the Fijian native works for comparatively small wn^es, he would not work for as small .1 wnge as the sugar planter offers. These planters were strong enough to induce the British Government to allow them to import a certain class of people under indenture for the purpose of developing the industry in F i j i . The result has been most demoraliziiu; to the people of the islands. There have been brousrht in about 40,000 Hindoos of the worse tvpe that it would be possible to find. They are the gatherm' un of the scum of all parts of India. Many c them, on their own admission, were criminals before they came to F i j i . They are brought in for a term of five vears by the companv, and during that period the average wage received by the men is 11.5/d., or just under is. per daySugar manufactured under such conditions is the sort of stuff which is sent across to New Zealandwhile the average wane for the women, who also work in the fields, is 5.93d., or just under 6d. per day. If they do not complete the task that is set them they are brought before n Court and heavily fined or imprisoned. In the year 1907 there were 1.460 cases of imprisonments and other penalties for non-completion of tasks. That is how the sugar-workers are treated in Fiji by the sugar-planters; and if the Attorney-General wishes to introduce into Australia sugar manufactured under such conditions, and then calls himself a white Australian, or even a human being, I pity him and the country that is governed by people who would do such a thing. The honourable member for Grey, in addition to his own description, quoted from a book written by ] . W. Burton, as follows:Buck on the plantations the coolies are herded together like so many penned cattle, amid the most insanitary conditions and indescribable and disgusting filth. A man must hold his nose with a firm grip as he passes through some of these lines; but. to live in them ! It is small wonder that sickness and disease hold carnival, and such places are a disgrace to civilization and a stain upon commerce. . '.' . [2323- 2",71
391,Mr RILEY,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,The New Zealanders look well on it.,72
392,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"Yes , they get cheap sugar in New Zealand.",72
393,Mr WEST,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,That is what the Free Traders would do in Australia if they could.,72
394,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,Exactly ; and that is what the Attorney-General wants to do.,72
395,Mr CHANTER,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"No , he does not.",72
396,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"This is what his argument is aimed at. The quotation continuesOne of the saddest and most depressing sights a man can behold, if he have any soul at all, is a ""coolie l in e"" in F i j i . There is a look of abjectness and miseiy on almost every face that haunts him. Dirt, filth, and vile stenches abound. Wickedness flaunts itself unshnmcdly. Loose, evil-faced women throw their jibes at criminal-looking men, or else quarrel with each other in high, strident voices, made emphatic by wild, angry gestures. The beholder turr-.? away, striving to discover whether pity or disgust is uppermost in his mind. There is much occasion for both. Many of the coolies are of low caste, or no caste at ali. The swc"" ngs of: the streets of Calcutta, the rifF-ralT l'ro-u tin; inland towns, the ne'er-do-wells from . the villages, and the men who have become too well known to the police-al l arc to be found in Fiji. 1 might go on reading for half-an-hour in the same strain the words so aptly used by the honourable member for Grey. I regret that such a deplorable state of things does exist. I also regret that the Attorney General advocates the supply of sugar uncler such conditions.",72
397,Mr ROBERTS,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,That is a distinctly inaccurate statement.,72
398,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,It is a distinctly accurate statement.,72
399,Mr ROBERTS,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,He never advocated any such thing.,72
400,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"The Attorney-General complained that New Zealand was getting its sugar at £-} a ton cheaper than we were in Australia, and the New Zealand source of supply is F.iji.",72
401,Mr ROBERTS,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"He pointed to the difference in price, but did not advocate such a thing.",72
402,Mr JENSEN,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,Has the Colonial Sugar Refining Company ' got sugar works in Fiji?,72
403,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,Yes .,72
404,Mr JENSEN,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,That is the sugar which is going to New Zealand ?,72
405,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,Undoubtedl y it is.,72
406,Mr CHANTER,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,And that is the company for which the honourable member is sticking up.,72
407,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"I am sticking up for an Australian industry. In Australia the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has to carry on its operations under Australian conditions, and the Australian Governments have taken care to see that those conditions are suitable to Australian people.",73
408,Mr SPEAKER,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"Order ! The honourable member is now getting beyond the ordinary scope of the question before the Chair, but it is most difficult for me to follow him while honourable members are interjecting across the chamber. them to desist.",73
409,Mr SINCLAIR,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"I admit, sir, that I . was wandering a little from Australia, but it was absolutely necessary to do so in order to reply to the remarks of the Attorney-General. Let me come back to the Australian conditions which are observed by this tremendous combine, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. An organizer of the Independent Workers' Association has written to his union as follows:I may state that in the local sugar mills the lowest wage paid is 30s. per week and found. This is the minimum for eight hours per day, and the board given at the mills will compare favourably with any hotel or boardinghouse.  ' Mr SINCLAIR - I have no reason to disbelieve it. I know, that the Queensland Parliament has passed a Sugar Workers' and Sheep Shearers' Accommodation Act, which provides for pretty decent accommodation for sugar-workers, who see that they get pretty good rations. The letter continues The cane-cutters in the field mostly work by contract, and are earning from ,£3 to ^5 per week. Capital has also been made out of the fact that these combinations supplied money ' for the purpose of fighting the proposals of the Governrnent at the last referendum. That has not been proved by those who make the allegation, but, if it were true, it would only show that these people are prepared to back their opinions with their cash, and I venture .to assert that the amount contributed was small compared with that contributed to support the campaign of the Labour party. I intend to oppose the proposals of the Government with all my might, as I did on the last occasion. I did it then at my own expense, and I shall do it again at my own expense this time probably.",73
410,Mr RYRIE,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,North Sydney) [10.53] - I think we might have an adjournment now.,73
411,Mr THOMAS,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,No .,73
412,Mr RYRIE,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"We have been sitting since half-past 10 this morning, so that an adjournment is reasonable. We should not be asked to rush important measures through without proper discussion. As to the proposal that this Parliament needs more power to deal with trusts and combinations, I ask : What are the trusts and combinations with which we need to deal, I ask and why has this Labour Government not ' exercised the powers it possesses to deal with them if they exist ? Honourable members opposite cannot give a satisfactory answer to those questions. Ever since 1910 Ministers have had power to deal with trusts and combines, but they have not exercised it. Now they ask for power to deal, not only with trusts and monopolies detrimental to the public and in restraint of trade, but with all trusts, combinations, and monopolies as they may choose. It has been shown that it is practically impossible to define the word "" monopoly,"" and the word "" combination '' is almost equally indefinable, because it covers such a wide range. Mention has been made of the Coal Trust or Coal Vend, or Coal Combination, bufc when the Government endeavoured to prosecute it, it failed to prove that its efforts were in restraint of trade.",73
413,Mr ROBERTS,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,We proved that they were.,73
414,Mr RYRIE,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"You failed to prove that they were inimical to the interests of the community, and prominent members of the Labour party, such as the New South Wales Minister for Mines, have stated that the Coal Vend was formed to benefit the workers by enabling the colliery proprietors to pay higher rates for the hewing of coal. Reference has been made, also, to the Sugar Trust and to the Beef Trust. The existence of the latter in Australia is a mere myth. Honourable members cheer ironically, but I do not like this levity when I am discussing an important constitutional proposal. They remind me of a box of galahs.",73
415,Mr SPEAKER,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,I appeal to honourable members to cease from interjecting.,73
416,Mr RYRIE,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"I wish to discuss this matter seriously, without interruption from a lot of jabbering nincompoops.",73
417,Mr SPEAKER,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"I again appeal to honourable members to discontinue their interruptions. I ask them to have more regard for the dignity of the House. The honourable member for North Sydney must withdraw the words that he has just uttered, and confine himself, to the question.",73
418,Mr RYRIE,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"I withdraw what I have said about honourable members opposite. As I was pointing out, the existence of the Beef Trust in Australia has been spoken of because the imagination of honourable members opposite has become inflamed. Speaking with authority, I say that there is no Beef Trust in Australia. It has been said that a branch of the American Beef Trust is commencing operations in Queensland. I certainly would object to the trust getting a footing in Australia, but, although the company which has just started in Queensland may have American interests, it has not been proved that it is in any way connected with the Beef Trust, and it seems to me that it would be impossible for any such trust to flourish here, because it could - not get the command of the railways, which would be essent.al to its success. It could not get control of the railways, because they are the property of the States-. I have given expression to my own views on other occasions upon the question of State owned railways. I think - it right that the railways should belong to the States, and since they are owned by the States, it is impossible for trusts to gain here the footing they have obtained in America. It is impossible foT them to prosecute their nefarious practices as they do in the United States of America. We have heard a lot about the Tobacco Trust, and I have asked for and obtained information in regard to it. I defy any one to say that it is acting in restraint of trade, or is inimibers cal to the interests of the public. On another occasion I brought before the House information showing that the Tobacco Trust, instead of being inimical to the interests of the people, was really supplying to the people of Australia an article that was equal, if not superior, to anything of the kind produced at the same price in any other part of the world. If we need an example of what the nationalization of the tobacco industry would mean, we have only to go to France. I have not been there, but many who have been have told me that absolutely the worse tobacco in the world is supplied by the nationalized tobacco industry of that country. I come now to the question of the great Sugar Combine. . The Government appointed a Royal Commission, to inquire .into its ramifications and operations,, but the report of that Commission shows that it. is not. as we were led to believe, one of the great commercial octopi that spread their tentacles, over the land and seek to drain the very life's blood of the people. There is no doubt that a combine exists in connection with the refining of sugar. The Colonial. Sugar Refining Company is undoubtedly a, combination, but unless it can be shown to be acting in restraint of trade, or to be otherwise inimical to the interests of the people, this Parliament is not entitled to ask for power to deal with it. Why' do the; Government wish to deal with it ? They wish to take these matters into their own hands. The Attorney-General has said that they want power. ""Give us power,"" he says, and it is power that they want. It is not well, however, that too much power should be placed in the hands' of any one man. If we give this Parliament power to deal with trusts, monopolies, and combines, it will mean in a great measure placing very wide powers in the hands of one man. No matter what Government is in office, no matter who the Attorney-General of the day may be, such a thing would mean opening, the door to influences to which I need not refer. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is deserving of the very greatest credit for the part it has taken in assisting us to people tropical Australia. But for that company there would not be in that part of Queensland where its operations are carried on one-fourth of the population that exists there today. For the sake of our own safety we should give every encouragement to such companies-combina tions and trusts, if honourable memlike to call them so-as the Colonial Sugar Refining Com^ pany, which is doing so much to develop tropical. Australia, and to place people on the soil. We must have population if we are to have an efficient military force, and a company that is doing much to promote settlement and to attract population to the' tropical north, should not be stigmatized as a monster or a commercial octopus that.would crush the life's blood out of the people. I wish', now to quote from the report of the .Royal Commission on the sugar industry. No one can suggest that the members of that Commission favour the political views of the Opposition. The majority report of the Commission, signed by W. Jethro Brown, Albert Hinchcliffe, Robert M. MCC. Anderson, and M. R. Shannon, contains the folarrange lowing paragraphWhile the soeml aspect of the sugar industry more important than the industrial, the political aspect is perhaps more important than either. Unsettled areas in the tropical parts of Australia are not only a source of strategic weakness. Tliey constitute a positive temptation lo invasion, and may give to the White Australia policy a complexion which must inevitably weaken Ihe claims of Australia lo external port. As we have already remarked, the ultiof what is to come mate, and, in our opinion, the effective, justificainform tion of the protection of ihe sugar industry beyond questions of industry or wealth production. It must be sought in the very existence of Australia ns a nation. We must attach some weight to the report of this Commission: and although the Colonial Sugar Refining Company specified particularly, credit is given to those who have promoted settlement in connection with the sugar industry. As to power to deal with trusts and combines, the Royal Commission, in reference to political interference, saysAs n result of the bounty regulations, a certain amount of discretionary power is left in the people. the hands of the Government of the day. This appears to us to be a grave objection ; it invites the intrusion of political influence, and it introduces an element of instability into the industry.",74

429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"Certainl y not. The idea of the debate is not to stop the Bills going to the people, but to place them in possession of reasonable informawhich cannot be given on the public of platform. I hope there will be no undue of the debate ; but the Prime Minister is refusing to do what every other Government does, namely, take the House into his confidence and tell us how many of the Ministerial proposals he intends to put through. When we see new Bills and new business introduced every day. we begin to wonder whether there is going to be",75
430,Mr FISHER,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"Wide Bav-Prime Minand Treasurer) [r 1.1.8] - l t is pleasant to hear the honourable member for Parramatta in such a reasonable mood at this time of night. The suggestion he has commade as to a statement about the business a good one; but he is in error in saying that it is usual to take the House into the confidence of the Government so early. No Bills have been introduced other than tliose we intend to put through. However, if it will suit the convenience of the Opposition, I shall make a statement tomorrow or the next day. If the other Bills to come need so much deliberation, it may be to sit a little later to enable honourable members to express their views, seeing that time is passing so rapidly.",75
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,Is the honourable member suggesting that he will jam the Bills through by all-night sittings?,76
432,Mr FISHER,A BOARD IS APPOINTED TO MAKE THE,"No ; but there are only two course's open-eithe r to sit longer or to come back after Christmas.
