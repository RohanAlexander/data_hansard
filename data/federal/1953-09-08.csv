3,Mr MENZIES,ALLAN MCKENZI E," It is always a very sad thing when colleagues who have sat with us for years, and whose companionship we have enjoyed, are suddenly removed by death. Contrary to impressions which arise occasionally outside this place, through strenuous parliamentary debate, there is a wealth of good personal fellowship in this Parliament. This fellowship sweetens public life, and I have no doubt that it will provide for the majority of us most of our happy memories when our political days are over. On this occasion, we are thinking of two old colleagues. The first of them is our late friend, Allan MCKenzie MCDonald, who was the honourable member for Corangamite. He had long experience in local government, State government, and Federal government, and rendered very great service to the people of Australia in Avar, and in peace in public life. Allan MCDonald, who certainly would need no introduction to members of this chamber who sat with him, was the honourable member for Corangamite in this Parliament from 1940 to the time of his death. Before that, he had represented the electorate of Polwarth in the Victorian Parliament for seven years. Earlier, he had played a prominent part in local affairs. As honourable members are aware, he was a distinguished member of the first Australian Imperial Force in World War I . and was wounded in Europe in the course of that conflict. For some time before his death, he had been in very poor health. We all noticed that condition with infinite regret, but it can be said quite truly that the courage and integrity which marked him were well understood and widely appreciated in this chamber. Australia owes a great debt to men who enter its service and spend, as he did, and as did the late Mr Mulcahy, to whom I shall refer in a few moments, their vigour and maturity in the service of this country for many years. Mr MCDonald was the Minister for External Territories and Minister assisting the Minister for the Interior from June to October, 1941. He was the Opposition Whip in this House from 1946 to 1949, and he served on various parliamentary committees. Last year, he was a delegate to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Ottawa. He had a wide and varied experience, and he was immensely popular in his own electorate. He was a man who knew men, and was known by them. It can be said quite truly that everybody in this place, when he heard the news of Allan MCDonald's death, felt that he lost a friend. I should like to convey to places. Mr Menzies. those whom he has left behind a verysincere expression of the feeling whichexists in this place, and of our gratitudefor the fine work that he performed. I move That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of the Honourable Allan MCKenzieMCDonald, a member of this House for thedivision of Corangamite and a former Minister of the Crown, places on record itsappreciation of his meritorious public service,, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.",7
4,Dr EVATT,ALLAN MCKENZI E," I second the motion and' endorse the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) in relation to the late Allan MCDonald. I think that every member of this House, after coming to know Mr MCDonald, regarded 1 him as a friend. We saw his suffering during long months and sympathized with him, and it is an honour for usto have an opportunity to record today,, in the few words contained in the motion proposed by the Prime Minister, ourappreciation of what he did for Victoria and for Australia. He did a great deal. He was a member of the Parliament of Victoria and later a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. He was a Minister of the Crown both in Victoria and in the Commonwealth sphere. Hehad a distinguished war record. He wasactive and vigorous in his expression of"" opinion here and in all his activities,, but I think, perhaps, some of the best work that he did was rendered to this House in its committees. I have in mind particularly a committee on which he served during World War II . , which dealt with repatriation problems, war gratuity and the like. That committeeconsisted entirely of ex-servicemen and was presided over by the honourable  MCDonald was greatly esteemed-nay , he was loved-throughou t his electorate,, and the Parliament is the poorer for his death. On behalf of the Opposition, I join with the Prime Minister in expressing our deepest sympathy with the relatives of the late Mr MCDonald., Question resolved in the affirmative, had honourable members standing in their - DEATH OF MB. DANIEL MULCAHY, M.P. I l r . MENZIES (Kooyong - Prime Minister) - Mr . Daniel Mulcahy, 1 late member for Lang, died on the 13th move) July last at the age of 71 years. He was an Irishman, horn in County Kerry, and of he came to this country as a very young ' man. He, too, had a long experience publio life. He first showed his interest in public affairs in the field of local government. He was an alderman of the Waterloo Council for eight years mayor of the municipality for a number of years. Ho was an alderman of the feel Sydney City Council from 1930 to He entered this House as the member for Lang in 1934, and that constituency continued to return him to this Parliaactive ment for the nineteen years which elapsed thereafter until his death. Hc was, his parliamentary career, a member the War Expenditure Committee, a very important committee that engaged in a great deal of close and detailed work, from July, 1941, to July, 1943. He was a member of the Public Works Gommittee from February, 1945, to August, 1946. He was a Temporary Chairman of Comand mittees for six years from October, 1943, to Ootober, 1949. Our late friend is survived by a daughter. We all on these sad occasions, too many of which have fallen to our lot of late, feel the break that is involved in losing the company a man with whom we have heen closely associated. For nineteen years Mr. Mulcahy commanded the warm and tinuing support of a great electorate. Like our other late friend, Allan MCDonald, he .was,, during the latter portion of hisservice in this House, cluded by his health from being as active in debate as he would have liked to be. It would indeed have been unwise for as for Allan MCDonald, to engage too heavily at that time in the nervous strain of parliamentary conflict. But during the whole of that period Mr Mulcahy maintained a close communion with his electorate. I have heard from manya people how closely . he considered affair of.his electors during that time. am also in a position to know that his to us so much. personal charities and kindnesses to many people who needed kindness, because they had fallen on poor days, were, although never advertised, most extensive. I have no doubt that they earned for him aparticular place in the hearts of the people the whom he served for a long time. I That this House expresses its deep regret at the death oS Daniel Mulcahy, a member this House for the division of Lang, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious of public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his daughter in her bereavement.",8
5,Dr EVATT,ALLAN MCKENZI E," I second the motion proand was posed by the Prime Mmister (Mr. Menzies). We on this side of the House a deep sense of loss as a result of the 1935. death of Dan Mulcahy. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, he did not, especially in his later years, take a very part in debate, but he always performed his duties in the Houso mostduring assiduously; No one worked harder of than he did for the people whom he represented for the long period of nineteen years. In his electorate, especially in the'hitter years of the depression, he was very closely associated with charitable movements. He was associated also with the claims of the under-privileged the pensioners. He was associated most of all, perhaps, with the returned servicemen's organizations in his electorate, for which he worked very hard. A perusal of the questions that he asked in this House over the years will show where of his interests lay and what he felt his duty to be. They will explain the deep affection for him which was evident throughconout that long period of years. To-day, in paying tribute "" to . Allan MCDonald and - Dan Mulcahy, we are paying tribute to representatives of preelements that are very important in the life of Australia. We have a European tradition, but a British heritage. In that him, heritage, not only the English element and the Welsh element are important.. The Scotch element, represented by Allan MCDonald, and the Irish element, represented hy Dan Mulcahy, are also important. We should think of that matter little when we feel the poignancy of our the separation from these two men, whom we I liked so well and who endeared themselves Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their place's. ADJOUKNMENT.",9
6,Mr MENZIES,ALLAN MCKENZI E,"Kooyong - Prime Minister) [3.19] - As a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased honourable members, I move That the House do now adjourn. Question resolved in the affirmative. ' House adjourned at 3.20 p.m.",10
