1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA Consideration in Detail Schedule 1. Consideration resumed from 22 October.",13
2,Mr SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"When the House last considered the bill, at the commencement of the consideration in detail stage, the question was proposed in accordance with standing order 226 that schedule 1 be agreed to. I now understand that it is the wish of the House to consider the bill as a whole. If there is no objection, I will allow that course to be followed. The bill. Mr GARETH EV ANS (Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (9.32 a.m.)-Before proceeding any further with the consideration in detail stage of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, I have a question to the government which must be answered; that is, what is the government's intention so far as further amendments to this legislation are concerned other than the amendment to introduce schedule 4, which has already been foreshadowed? The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) will no doubt be familiar with the press reports this morning that, within the coalition party room--or a subgroup of it-last night, a major revolt was threatened by National Party members demanding that the bill be further amended in a number of ways, otherwise they would cross the floor. It is further reported that the government, in response to those demands and threats, has in fact proposed that there be a further amendment to the threshold test, which is a crucial element in this legislaprinciple tive package, one which is certainly central to our response to it and central to any consideration of both the justice and workability of the legislation. As reported, the government proposal is that an already very tough threshold test will be made much tougher still by a requirement that, as a condition of someone being registered as a claimant, the claimant actually have a current physical connection with the land in question. The notion that any such criterion could be required merely to get a claimant into the condition of being able to pursue that claim, to take advantage of rights, to negotiate 1997 and everything else in the legislation, is nothing short of outrageous. The government has already sold its soul on this legislation to those of its own members who have adopted from the outset an absolutely indefensibly rednecked, one-sided approach to this legislation by being utterly unwilling to acknowledge the reality that, for this legislation to be successful, effective and decent, it has to be balanced legislation which gets the balance of interests right as between indigenous Australians, miners and farmersand of course the Australian public, the taxpayers, who are also stakeholders in this measure. That is the object to which we are trying to address ourselves. The balance of this legislation has already wildly swung in the other direction. It is indefensibly unbalanced and one-sided in its present construction and, as such, cannot deliver the certainty and predictability, quite apart from the justice, that is necessary if the interests of these various categories of stakeholders are in fact to be met. The point, obviously, is that, if you demand a current physical connection with the land, quite apart from anything or anyone else you are immediately excluding from the capacity to benefit from, or to participate in, this legislative framework for a start those indigenous people who were locked out of their land with which they had a'long association and with which, in many cases, they have a very credible claim of native title as a result of the pastoral awards in the 1960s. Lock the gate, lose your native title is going to be the that is adopted, it seems, by the government if this further amendment is in fact accommodated and advanced. There are many issues to be further debated today in the limited time we have available, but I must ask the government to respond, as a threshold matter, as to the accuracy of these reports and to state its intentions so far as a further amendment of the kind that I have been describing, of the kind that was reported in this morning's press, is concerned. Until we have a clear understanding of where the government is going in this respect, it is impossible to approach this already complex and difficult task with any sense of understanding about how the government is proposing to secure the necessary public interest balances that are involved. I ask the Attorney for an answer straight away.",13
3,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am delighted to give an answer straight away. Arrangements have been made for some time between the government and the opposition as to the manner in which the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 will be progressed. The bill, when introduced, did not contain schedule 4. That has subsequently been circulated. It was agreed that major amendments that were contemplated to be made to the bill that was introduced last year-the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996-would be moved and debated in the Senate after debate in this House had been completed. Those arrangements still stand. The government does propose to move one amendment to the 1997 bill-the addition of schedule 4. This schedule involves very minor adjustments to the schedule 4 which was circulated earlier. It will not involve any amendment that has been foreshadowed in the media. The major amendments contemplated to be dealt with in the Senate have been reviewed by the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. The majority report of that committee strongly supports the bill with those amendments, subject to some minor suggestions which are under consideration. An appropriate government response will be made to those suggestions in due course. The objective of the government is to obtain a workable . system that appropriately balances the competing interests, and that has always been the objective. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) refers to the reports in the media that amendments will be moved by the members for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) and Kennedy (Mr Katter) relating to matters to which he has referred. If amendments are moved in the form mooted, they will not be supported by the government. We intend to proceed in the manner arranged with the oppositionMr Gareth Evans-What about the government's own amendment on the threshold test-in the Senate, if not here? Will the government move to further amend and toughen the threshold test, the registration test, in response to these assertions that are being made by National Party members?",14
4,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"There is no intention to make any change in response to assertions that have been in the last 24 hours. Mr GARETH EV ANS (Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (9.39 a.m.)-I am the indebted to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) for that response. I take it that what he has said is to deny outright the substance of the report that a government proposal has been made to the dissident National Party backbenchers, so the debate will go forward without further amendment from the government so far as the content of the threshold test is concerned. If the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who has also featured largely in these reports, wants to further clarify the situation from his point of view and to throw a stone into the millpond that has been established by the Attorney-General in this respect, I would be only too delighted to let him have that opportunity.",14
5,Mr TUCKEY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am delighted to take that opportunity. The process of the Liberal and the National Parties in coalition is a democratic one. When these matters were raised in the party room, they were returned to the backbench committee which I happen to chair-and I would like to underline that it is a 'backbench committee' . I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) even within the caucus knows very well that such committees are not 'the government'. How any journalist of the quality of those who reported on this could believe that a government offer had been made in a committee of that nature, I do not know. Lengthy discussions took place, one of which focused on the addition of a word to that threshold test. I suggested that, if that matter was the only matter left outstanding, as chairman of the committee and with the approval of the committee, I could take it to the government. I did not have the approval of the committee, because even those concerned were not sure where it was. That matter was then apparently reported to the media by persons unknown and, when the media contacted me, I rejected it, and I think Margot Kingston's later article confirms that. Furthermore, I then advised those people that I was not prepared to take any further action whatsoever in the circumstances. All I would have been doing was being a conduit. So that matter can be put absolutely to rest, notwithstanding that I am quite pleased with the democratic processes of the Liberal Party. They allow everybody a say and do not try to put them down as rednecks or anything else when they are trying to represent the legitimate interests of their particular constituencies. It is always the case in these matters you know where you stand. If you wanted to stand with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, you would be amongst a group of people who have no understanding even of the legislation. When they write to me and I write back and say, 'Thank you, I'm very interested in your concerns; please tell me which part of the amendments actually achieves what you tell me,' they fail to respond. And do you know why? Because they cannot find it. It is interesting that the opening remarks from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition today were of a very general nature. I hope the rest of this debate features the actual parts of the legislation that prove it. Let me put another issue to bed. In his opening remarks, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about the Australian taxpayers as stakeholders. I know what that is leading to. We are going to start this argument that we as members of parliament should legislate to prevent Aboriginal people getting compensation. Of course some of their rights have been resumed by the previous act brought in by the Labor Party-by the validation process. Of course their rights in the future-as have been the rights of freehold owners, farmers, lessees and all sorts of other people-will be diminished by resumption. The national interest demands it. But why should this parliament be writing rules-as you suggest, and as some of the other supporters apparently of native title suggest-that deny proper processes of compensation if that occurs? It is appropriate that the Australian taxpayer should be involved in paying that money, considering that all of this arises from past acts of government. So opposition members should just keep 0 going on that one...,-just keep telling the Aboriginal people that you think we should have devices so they do not get compensation, which many of them would prefer to a piece of land somewhere they no longer wish to reside. It might be valuable as a mine, but it is not a very nice place to live. Those people should be entitled to better living standards and the types of facilities they have drifted to over the years, where there are decent supermarkets and decent civic facilities. Your idea that of inalienable, freehold property is to stick them out under a few mulga trees and leave them in those sorts of conditions, because that is what you achieve with those sorts of arrangements. There is another thing about this threshold test-that is, the process to the right to negotiate-that we need to get straight, too. As you had to admit in the parliament the other day, that is not a common law right; that is a law right that you created. It has been abused by a lot of people who have not even got genuine rights, and they are preventing those who do have genuine rights from getting their rights considered because of the log jam that has been created.",14
6,Mr GARETH EVANS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I do not stop to deal with the compensation issue at this stage-it will arise later. I simply say that indigenous people will no doubt be delighted to hear that the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is so sensitive to their interests and aspirations in this respect and, in particular, that their interest in having access to supermarkets is of much greater significance and relevance to them than their particular patches of soil and mulga tress with which they have had long standing traditional associations. I am sure they will be indebted to hear that from the member for ·O'Connor, and that sets the tone very nicely for some later stages of this debate. I am also indebted to get the clarification from the member for 0' Connor on the other matter with which I began which was the question of a possible further toughening of an already very tough threshold test. I am pleased we now have that clarification on the record from both the member for O'Connor and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams). If this issue rears its head again at some later stage of this debate in the form of an amendment being brought forward, we will of course fiercely contest it because it is absolutely indefensible. I make some opening observations about how we intend to handle this consideration in detail stage and subsequent stages of this legislative debate for the sake of clarification. The time before us for consideration in detail in this House is quite limited. It will not be possible, under those circumstances, for us to move detailed amendments across the whole sweep that are necessary to begin the task of improving the Native Title Amendment Bill. In any event, consultations on our side are proceeding as to the very complex matters of detail that are involved. It is appropriate that consideration in that degree of detail, with the moving of specific amendments, take place in the Senate rather than here. In relation to one particular provision, there is the application of the Racial Discrimination Act to this legislation and the need to ensure that nothing in this legislation is incompatible with it-an undertaking that was given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). That issue will be pursued in the form of a specific amendment moved by my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I foreshadow that we will be seeking to divide the House on that issue at an appropriate time. As to the rest of the consideration in detail, we propose to work through the government's so-called lO-point plan sequentially, indicating in outline-it is only going to be possible in outline-the nature of the concerns that the opposition has about the various elements in this legislative package. In some cases, we will have particular proposals to make clear to the House. In others, it will simply be a matter of stating a broad attitude and leaving that further consideration and discussion to the Senate. With respect to the minority report of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, which was brought down a couple of days ago, we regard that as a very fertile source of analysis and argumentation on the matters now before this parliament. We will, of course, be drawing on it a great deal in describing the nature of the concerns that we and so many other Australians have about this legislation. While we see this report as setting the framework and direction of the opposition's response---one that we hope will be shared by the minority parties and Independents in the Senate-it is appropriate at the outset of this debate for me to make it clear that the recommendations contained in the minority report do not necessarily represent the considered final view of the Australian Labor Party opposition. The nature of the process involved in the preparation of parliamentary committee reports with questions of confidentiality, privilege, and so on, is such as to make it inappropriate for these matters to be dealt with in that degree of detail and finality. We are still considering our recommendations and our position on a number of these matters. I conclude by saying that, at the end of the consideration in detail, apart from dividing on the amendment concerning the Racial Discrimination Act, we propose to divide on the third reading and, given that the bill will obviously be unamended in the way that we would hope, we will be opposing that, as we did the second reading. That is not to be understood as representing any dog in the manger attitude by the opposition to the effect that the Native Title Act does not need amendment. Of course it does, in a number of respects, and we will be working flat out in the Senate to achieve just that. We propose in the Senate to support the second reading of the legislation in order to enable the committee process to proceed. Equally, I foreshadow that, if at the end of that committee stage in the Senate a satisfactory outcome has not been achieved, we will be voting against the legislation. (Time expired)",15
7,Mr LIEBERMAN,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Indi) (9.50 a.m.)After hearing the very substantial disclaimers from the opposition spokesman, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), we will all welcome a constructive discussion in the consideration in detail stage about why the Native Title Act needs amending following the Wik decision. This is a very important issue which members should address and do their best on, so that there is a good outcome for all Australians. We remember that a number of opposition speeches in the second reading debate indicated that there was 'no need to amend the Native Title Act because the Wi\c decision guarantees that the pastoralists' rights will prevail'. Although the common law says that the rights of pastoralists' prevail, the effect of the current Nati,ve Title Act provisions may be to produce the opposite result. That was almost conceded by the opposition spokesman at the table. Whatever the belief at the end of 1993 about the effect at common law of the grant of a pastoral lease or any other lease or government grant on native title, the fact is that the current Native Title Act provides only limited means by which future dealings affecting native title can proceed. That is to the detriment of all Australians, indigenous and otherwise. The only way in which many such acts can be done with any legal certainty under the Native Title Act is for native title to be acquired, resulting in extinguishment. The government says quite plainly and unambiguously that this is undesirable. That is why the Native Title Amendment Bill is a very worthy piece of legislation. It is very important, during this consideration in detail stage, to consider acts affecting native title. The Native Title Act will apply if the dealing is one that 'affects native title'. The definition of an act affecting native title in section 227 of the act covers not only acts which at common law may have extinguished native title-for example, a freehold grantbut also dealings which are 'wholly or partly inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of native title rights'. It is impossible to know for certain if an act affects native title until there has been a judicial assessment of both the native title status of the land on which it is proposed to do that act and the impact of the act on any native title rights and interests found to exist. So long as there is a possibility that native title may exist and may be affected by the act, the only way in which those dealings can be done which guarantees their legal validity is to comply with the Native Title Act. There is also the question of the validity of future acts: The dealing has to be one which is 'permissible under the Native Title Act' or can otherwise be done validly under the act. These acts are the following kinds only, and I will refer to them briefly: acts which could be done if any native title holders instead held freehold title to the land in question, for example, the grant of a mining lease by the Crown or acquisition by the Crown-that is, it satisfies the freehold test; renewals of certain commercial, agricultural, pastoral or residential leases and renewals and the exercise of a legally enforceable right in existence before 1 January 1994; acts occurring offshore; acts which are within the definition of low impact future act, but only for so long as there is no determination of native title in relation to the land; acts authorised by an agreement of the kind referred to in section 21 of the Native Title Act; and acts done after the relevant government or lessee goes through the 'non-claimant provisions'. Any other act which affects native title is impermissible-that is, it is unlawful under the Native Title Act. In the words of Justice French to the joint committee, this limited range of permissible dealings reflects the fact that: . .. conventional wisdom of the timemeaning in 1993... was that native title would be found perhaps to exist in some fairly limited and fairly remote part of Australia. It would not be interacting with other ranges of interest in the way that is being asserted today. (Time expired)",17
8,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: Schedule 1, page 5, after item 3 insert: 3A Racial Discrimination Act to prevail over provisions of Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 (1) For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly declared to be the intention of the Parliament that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 shall prevail over any provisions of the Native Title Amendment Act 1997. (2) Nothing in the Native Title Amendment Act 1997 shall be taken to authorise any conduct, whether legislative, executive or judicial, is inconsistent with the provisions or operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. That was the election commitment of the coalition in the lead-up to the last election. In their election platform, in relation to the Native Title Act, they promised: The Coalition approach to Aboriginal land rights is based on the following: (a) the fact of Native Title where it has survived; (b) the Constitutional protection given to all property interests against Government resumption without compensation; (c) the prohibition of racially discriminatory measures or laws; and (d) the special relationship between Indigenous people and land which is at the core of Indigenous culture. In Government, the Coalition will: (a) retain the Native Title Act; (b) reserve the right to amend the Native Title Act to ensure its workability; (c) respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act; and (d) ensure that any amendments to the Native Title Act are preceded by wide consultation. It was coalition policy that any amendments would respect the Racial Discrimination Act. This amendment to the Native Title Amendment Bill is to ensure that the coalition sticks to its election promise. It is a safety net to the effect that this parliament does not intend, intentionally or accidentally, to override the Racial Discrimination Act. As a later federal act, this safety net provision is needed to ensure that what is currently cross-party support for respect for the Racial Discrimination Act is maintained. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in releasing an outline of proposed amendments in May 1996, in a letter signed by him, said: The coalition announced during the election campaign that it would retain the Native Title Act but reserved the right to amend it to ensure its workability while respecting the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. The amendment I have moved does just that. When I asked the Prime Minister a question on Monday, 6 May 1996, I said: My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister give a commitment to this that House that the government will not seek to repeal, suspend or override the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975? Mr Howard answered: The government has no plans to introduce any amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act. This is a safety net. It holds the coalition to their election commitment. It is very important in the current times that that reaffirmation of respect for a non-discriminatory policy is heard in the community. Last year, federal parliamentarians signed a code of race ethics to respect the religious and cultural beliefs of all groups living within Australia in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to help, without discrimination, all persons seeking assistance. That was signed by coalition members in this House-Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, Nick Dondas, Gary Hardgrave, Jackie Kelly, Brendan Nelson, Peter Nugent, Sharman Stone, Kathy Sullivan, Danna Vale, Michael Wooldridge and Paul Zammit. Others in the Senate and other members also signed. As an opposition, we are saying that it is important, especially in the current climate, that we respect the Racial Discrimination Act. The Prime Minister has given assurances in answers to questions in this House that amendments to the Native Title Act will respect the Racial Discrimination Act. He said it to the Minerals Council and he said it to the Farmers Federation. In this amendment we are saying that they should honour that commitment. There should be no discriminatory provisions in this act. This safety net is needed. In legislation last year, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill, the government accepted this specific amendment, so there is a precedent. It is just humbug for the government to say, 'We respect the Racial Discrimination Act', but for it then not to accept the amendment that I have moved. It is important, and it is important in the current climate. We believe that the government should honour their election commitment and that the Prime Minister should honour his solemn undertaking to respect the Racial Discrimination Act. If the government vote against this, then it exposes them for what they are. (Time expired)",18
9,Mr SLIPPER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The government rejects the amendment to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 proposed by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). We believe that the opposition is being absolutely hypocritical in this should be noted that the existing section 7 of the Native Title Act deals with the relationship between the Racial Discrimination Act and the Native Title Act. Subsection 7(1) already makes it clear that nothing in the Native Title Act affects the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. It should be noted that this provision was sufficient in 1993 for the now opposition, the Democrats and the Greens, and in our view it continues to be an appropriate provision. To be valid, an act by a state or territory government must comply with the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act and the Native Title Act. However, where there is an inconsistency between the two acts the normal rules of interpretation would apply, and the later legislation-in this case the Native Title Act-would prevail. The proposal made by the opposition would require all of the proposed amendments to comply with the Racial Discrimination Act, notwithstanding the fact that they would be authorised in the parliament by the Native Title Act. The Racial Discrimination Act provides very broad principles. The Native Title Act provides specific detailed requirements which were designed to respond to the High Court's Mabo decision. Such an amendment would mean that, even if an action is specifically allowed by the Native Title Act, it may be struck down by a court because, in the court's view, it is inconsistent with the general Racial Discrimination Act requirement. What the opposition is suggesting is a recipe for absolute, complete and utter stagnation. It would be a lawyer's picnic, and the outcome would be endless litigation-not about whether native title exists, because the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) have made it clear time and time again that we accept the Wik decision, but whether any act done by government, or indeed anyone, including representative bodies and claimants, was in fact authorised by both pieces of law. The resulting uncertainty would undermine the workability of the act-and everyone agrees, including the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) that the act is unworkable-and in fact would make matter. It it almost completely inoperable. The basic rationale for the Native Title Act was to set out clearly and with certainty what future acts the government could take and by what process, and the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Banks would discard that clarity and that certainty. It seems to me that the opposition is absolutely determined to do whatever it possibly can to make sure that this is simply not workable.",19
10,Mr CAMPBELL,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to oppose this amendment to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. It should be quite clear that the intention of the Labor Party in this matter is to create absolute confusion. That is their agenda. They want a situation where nothing can be worked with. They want to have stagnation. Of course, they are playing to their constituency. One has to determine who that constituency is. Their constituency overwhelmingly comprises affluent, ignorant, urban Australia with no comprehension of the needs or aspirations of Aboriginal people. In the electorate I represent there are more Aboriginal people than anywhere else. They say to me, 'This whole Native Title Act is white fellas' humbug for white lawyers'-for the likes of the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). We are discussing this bill when we still do not know what native title is. The court still has not determined that. There are people in this House, such as the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) and many on the Labor side, who are going around creating the idea that native is akin to property rights. There is absolutely no substance to that at all. It may be that native title is no more than the right to hunt and gather, for which compensation is negligible. In Mabo 1, the judges determined 4:3 that native title probably would not occur in Australia because of the need to show continuous occupation. I would suspect it will be the case that, if we stick to law, there is very little valid native title. As former Governor General Bill Hayden said, the right to negotiate has become an opportunity for extortion-and it is used that way. It must be remembered, when the Labor Party puts forward this amendment here, that in their own legislation their then Prime Minister believed there was a prima facie case in the act, and a far more severe prima facie case than appears to be acting here-one which, when applied by the Native Title Tribunal, simply wiped out a lot of applicants on the grounds that their claims were without merit or were vexatious. Because of incompetence, that was in the preamble but not in the body of the act. The member for Holt and the member for Banks (Mr Melham) know that, as does the whole Labor Party. I must say that Paul Keating, the then Prime Minister, was adamant that native title was extinguished by pastoral leases. Because he thought that, the coterie of Aboriginals he gathered around him all thought the same. Yet we have the absolute hypocrisy of the likes of the member for Holt. I do not think this House has ever seen such a garrulous, sanctimonious heap of absolute fraud as has been foisted upon this place by the member for Holt. He knows very well that, in the act as envisaged by his then Prime Minister, there is clearly a need for a very strict prima facie case, and I do not believe this act goes anywhere near as far as that. It is absolute fraud for the Labor Party to take the stance that they have in this House when they know the mechanism of the previous act. I can only reiterate the words of Dickey Cox, the Chairman of the Yungngora Association at Noonkanbah, when he said, 'This whole native title thing is white fell as ' title humbug for white lawyers, and it will not benefit Aboriginals.' It is quite clear that will be the case. But the Labor Party does not care because its constituency is this mixture, this manure, of middle-class affluence and urban ignorance and guilt that they represent, not Aboriginals.",19
11,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I also rise, like the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), to respond to the amendment proposed by the member for Banks (Mr Melham). The government has said on a number of occasions that it has sought to comply with the Racial Discrimination Act and its international obligations, in particular, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, known as CERD. The government has also sought to implement its considered policies in the Native Title Amendment Bill. Notwithstanding that, the government recognises that a number of submissions made to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund have criticised the bill for allegedly failing to comply with the RDA and CERD. But it is important, I think, to highlight that precisely the same criticisms can be made of the current act. The bill does include a validation regime, but the current act has a more extensive validation regime. We can go back and look at what happened in 1993 when the current opposition was in government. Section 7, subsection (1) of the act provided: that nothing in this actthat is, the 1993 actaffects the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. That provision was designed by the previous government to serve precisely the purpose of ensuring that there was compliance with the Racial Discrimination Act. The effect of it is-and it was discussed in decisions of the High Court-that, in the administration of the act, an act in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act will be unlawful.",20
12,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,It's a later federal act.,20
13,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,The member for Banks interjects that it is a later act. The member Banks is prone to picking up and running with any argument that is put by a proponent of Aboriginal interests.,21
14,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,That is from your own legal advisers. Your own legal advisers put that in.,21
15,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The member for Banks would be well advised to take a little more care in addressing these legal issues. If he listened he would have heard me say that the effect of subsection 1 is that in the administration of the Native Title Act 1993-and it would be the same after amendment by the bill before the House-nothing will affect the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. It will therefore strike down acts that are done in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. What the bill does do is maintain and strengthen the provisions of the bill in relation to a number of things, including compulsory acquisition of title. There is a strengthened non-discriminatory regime. It gives native title holders the same protections as freeholders and some additional protections. It does not prevent the compulsory acquisition of native title which coexists on pastoral lease land, as it does not prevent the compulsory acquisition of native title on vacant crown land. The policy of the government is that there will be in the future legitimate land management needs for native title and non-native title land such as suburban developments, public infrastructure and agricultural developments. The RDA has also been mentioned in the context of the right to negotiate. The right to negotiate provisions have been generally considered a special measure. In amending the right to negotiate provisions, the parliament is exercising the discretion it has in relation to instituting, maintaining and reformulating such special measures. To say that a special measure, once implemented, can never be amended is to deny the sovereignty of parliament and to significantly overstate the requirements of the RDA and CERD. Even under the formal equality approach it is apparent that the parliament enjoys a discretion in fashioning substantive equality measures to take account of the differences between the groups. The government's proposed amendments to the right to negotiate for implement its view as to the proper level of protection which native title holders should receive. Again, to say that the scheme providing substantive equality, once implemented, can never be amended is to deny the sovereignty of parliament and to overstate the requirements of the RDA and CERD.",21
16,Mr BRERETON,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"In support of the amendment moved by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), I want briefly to deal with Australia's international obligations. I do so because the Native Title Amendment Bill as presented by the government is incompatible with the spirit and inconsistent with the letter of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. I submit to the House that it makes a mockery of Australia's responsibilities as a signatory to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. We on this side of the House are proud of our record of leadership in the region and the wider international community on matters of human rights and the elimination of racism. We have a proud record, one that we have just worked very hard to build, but today Australia's international reputation is at risk, it is on the line. Nor can the parliament overlook the moral ramifications of the legislation presented by the government. I think it worth recalling the words in this House of the then Leader of the Opposition John Howard on 5 June 1995 after the desecration of the grave of Eddie Mabo when he said: I would like to specifically associate myself with the message the Prime Minister said should be conveyed to people of racist inclination in Australia: there is no place in Australia for racial intolerance, there is no place in this country for people who peddle racist bigotry and there is no place in Australia for people who would seek to treat one Australian as less important or less deserving of a place in the Australian sun than other Australians. I agree with the Prime Minister that we have come a long way in better understanding the role and the place of Australians and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. I think most Australians are desirous of seeing the disadvantage they have suffered addressed and repaired. Those not willing to see that addressed and repaired are a very distinct minority. It is also worth recalling the coalition's own Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs policy-the one they released prior to the 1996 general election-when they said that their approach to Aboriginal land rights would be based on the following: (a) the fact of Native Title where it has survived; (b) the constitutional protection given to all property interests against Government resumption without compensation; (c) the prohibition of racially discriminatory measures or laws; and (d) the special relationship between Indigenous people and land which is at the core of Indigenous culture. Amongst other things, the policy stated that, when elected, the coalition would retain the Native Title Act and would respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. This bill does not respect the Racial Discrimination Act. It threatens the very existence of that act. It is worth recalling to the House the highfalutin values contained in the white paper entitled In the national interest: Australia's foreign and trade policy which the government so recently released. That paper states under the heading 'national values': Central to the values to which the Government gives expression is an unqualified commitment to racial equality and to eliminating racial discrimination. This is a non-negotiable tenet of our own national cohesion, reflected in our racial diversity, and it must remain a guiding principle of our international behaviour. The rejection of racial discrimination is not only a moral issue, it is fundamental to our acceptance by, and engagement with, the region where our vital security and economic interests lie. Racial discrimination is not morally repugnant, it repudiates Australia's best interests. On questions of race, as on other issues which go to the values of the Australian community, Australia's international reputation matters. Australance is has a direct national interest in an international reputation as a responsible member of the international community, committed to the rule of law, ready to assist in cases of humanitarian need, and a constructive contributor to the economic development of its neighbourhood. This bill confirms that the Prime Minister utterly fails to uphold his own commitments to address the real needs of indigenous Australians, to their disadvantage, or to promote a more tolerant and harmonious society based on equality. Finally, the government fails its election promise. It fails to honour its commitments to equality and to the elimination of racial discrimination as expressed in the foreign affairs white paper. Time prevents me saying anything more other than that the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, in its present form, is morally repugnant, most likely unconstitutional and, if enacted, will lead to divisiveness and further uncertainty. It will greatly diminish our stature nationally and internationally.",21
17,Mrs STONE,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The problem with the 1993 Native Title Act is that, while it was very well intentioned, it is deeply flawed. One of the problems, which has already been alluded to, is in the area of the right to negotiate. Western Australia in particular has used the future act provisions of the NTA more than other states and that experience shows the right to negotiate is just not working effectively. For example, of the 1,910 acts which have been subject to the full right to negotiate process, only 148 were cleared for grant as at 10 October 1997. This is a clearance rate of only 7.7 per cent. Information from the National Native Title Tribunal indicates that, of the 181 tenements advised by ATSIC as subject to agreements, only 148 have proceeded to grant. That is a tragedy both for Aboriginal people and for those who have vested interests in the areas that are under claim. Western Australia has advised that most of the mineral tenements which have attracted the right to negotiate are mining leases, with an overall clearance rate for section 29 notices of only some 18 per cent. This is only exploration prospecting tenures where there is a high clearance rate. In fact, the trend clearrate for mining leases has been declining since WA began using the NTA procedures. We argue that the exemption from the RTN of compulsory acquisitions for infrastructure is appropriate. Such infrastructure has generally in the past been provided by governments, and acquisitions for government purposes have never been subject to the RTN; a nondiscriminatory compulsory acquisition regime is still required; and infrastructure facilities such as pipelines and electricity transmission lines traverse long distances over many land titles with very little impact. It has been suggested that the amendment that the right to negotiate not apply to land or waters within a town or city should not be included. But government policy is that the right to negotiate should not be able to delay the provisions of necessary government services, particularly in towns and cities where it is unlikely that high-level native has survived; that a non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition regime is still required; and that this is not an open-ended provision as it applies only to land or waters within town or city boundaries as at 23 December 1996. The minority report of the recent Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Land Fund inquiry into the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 was concerned about the right to negotiate offshore and the shore line boundaries. The NIWG has proposed that the exemption from the right to negotiate of offshore areas be removed. But we have to remember that the current Native Title Act does not provide for the RTN to apply offshore. The boundary for acts to which the right to negotiate applies has been shifted from 'the limits of the state', because this is notoriously difficult to identify. The mean high-water mark proposed provides a more definable point at which the right to negotiate applies. Indigenous groups who see the intertidal zone as important are still protected by the fact acts in that area must satisfy the future act provisions and, in the case of mining, they must satisfy the 'freehold test'. A nondiscriminatory compulsory acquisition regime is still required. There is absolutely no case to answer in terms of these amendments diluting or eroding Aboriginal rights. In recent months, the percentage of unopposed expedited procedure proposals has been falling in approved exploration acts. This is probably as the result of the broad interpretation given to section 237 criteria-which lists the limitations of the effect that an act under the expedited procedure may have-by the Federal Court in Ward and, consequently, the effectiveness of expedited procedure provisions has been reduced. Without amendment, the use of the expedited provision will continue to fall. Amendments will modify the criteria in section 237 to require a predictive assessment of the likely physical aspects of the activities. The bill includes an amendment which will allow a government party, as soon as an objection is lodged, to 'withdraw' the expedittitle ed procedure notice and switch immediately to the normal right to negotiate process for the proposed act. The change would reduce the costs and delays of an objection hearing in relation to the expedited procedure if the government felt that the objection would be likely to be upheld. The expedited procedure has produced high clearance rates for exploration in Western Australia solely because the native title parties have chosen not to use the objections procedure in most cases. Section 26A provides arguably better protection for indigenous concerns than the expedited procedure as a result of the inclusions of new conditions. The criteria for approval under section 26A ensures contact between miners and indigenous peoples and that site protection and access issues are addressed for all exploration grants covered by the determination.",22
18,Mr BEVIS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to speak briefly in this debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, partly because I am unable to be here later in the day and this evening when the division occurs and I want that to put beyond any doubt my own views on this matter",23
19,Mr SLIPPER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,You are not abstaining?,23
20,Mr BEVIS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am absolutely not abstaining, and this is why I am here. I have a pair and, as one of the whips on the government benches, you might be grateful for the fact that you have a pair. I understand I have been paired with the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who is also unable to be here this evening. I want to take the opportunity to add to and reinforce the comments that I made during the second reading debate. The amendment before us concerning the Racial Discrimination Act should not be an issue of dissension within this parliament. It is worth recalling that the amendment says: For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly declared to be the intention of the Parliament that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 shall prevail over any provisions of the Native Title Amendment Act 1997. All members should contemplate and· ask where the folly is in that. If you believe the Racial Discrimination Act should apply-we on this side certainly do-then why not support that? The response of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is to say, 'Trust me. It applies at the moment, so really you don't need to say that.' He did not say that it is inappropriate, but, 'Trust me, because I don't think we need it.' I am sorry, this is the same Attorney General. who, during the process of this legislation, made it plain to the Australian Law Reform Commission that their views were not welcome. Their views just happened to be different on his legislation, and his best efforts were applied to ensure that their views did not see the public domain. No, I do not trust the Attorney-General's assurance that this is not necessary. If the government want to override the Racial Discrimination Act, they should at least have the honesty and integrity to stand up and say so. They are hiding behind a veil in this debate. The amendment that the opposition have moved is going to put the government to the test on this fundamental question: are all people in Australia, irrespective of their race, entitled to the same rights and compensation before the law? Or are we going to say that Aboriginal and Islander people are in a separate category; that they, and only they, are to be subject to a lesser standard of rights in our community; that they, and only they, are to be denied access to the Racial Discrimination Act, an act which every other person in this country would rely upon as a fundamental basis of existence in a free democracy such as Australia? This amendment puts a fundamental question before the parliament, and the government is going to be put to the test. It will not be a test of faith and trust in the Attorney General; it will be a clear-cut question: do you or do you not believe the Racial Discrimination Act should apply? I also want to take the opportunity, if I may, to say for the record that I think the amendments being moved by the National Party or part thereof-by the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly)-seem not only to want to recast the Native Title Act 1993 but to want to recast the referendum of 1967. I hope that they receive the resounding disdain of the parliament that they deserve. The opposition has made it clear and the minority report, which I think is a very fine document, makes it clear that there is need for amendment to the Native Title Act 1993. The opposition is today in this parliament moving a series of amendments to improve the 1993 act without stripping away from Aboriginal and Islander people their fundamental rights. That approach adopted by the opposition should be supported. The first test of that will in fact be on this fundamental question of the RDA. The minority report quoted some words that are worth drawing to members' attention by the Reverend David Gill, the General-Secretary of the National Council of Churches in Australia. He said: It would be a tragedy for the nation if Aborigines were to be worse off, having won the Wik case. That is exactly what they confront. There is no justice in the proposal that the government is pursuing here. There is no honour in this proposal and there is no reconciliation. Do the honourable thing, support the amendment the opposition has moved, recognise the fundamental integrity and decency of correcting a long-term problem and do not hide behind mealy-mouthed words. Make sure that the parliament gets it right this time so we can move forward into the 21 st century with some justice and with some reconciliation.",23
21,Mr TUCKEY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"O'Connor) (10.27 a.m.)The final words of the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) were about mealy-mouthed words. I have listened to every speaker on this opposition amendment, particuhrrly the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton)",24
22,Mr SLIPPER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,Where is he?,25
23,Mr TUCKEY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"He has put his little note on the record for the branches. The reality is that in his whole presentation he referred to the amendments offending the Racial Discrimination Act but he did not bother, as the member for Brisbane and as previous speakers have not bothered, to point to anyone of these amendments that offend the Racial Discrimination Act.",25
24,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,You should support the amendment then.,25
25,Mr TUCKEY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"No, because I am about to remind you of the second fact. If this is such an important thing and not just a bit of posturing, why didn't you put it in your act? Suddenly it is a matter of importance, but it was not a matter of importance when you presented and prepared the original act. It is posturing. Let me take this a step forward. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who has spent his own money on assisting Aboriginal people, stood up and told you that you are on the wrong track. Of course, he is quite correct to say that your line of communication is not with genuine grassroots Aboriginal people but with middle-class Aboriginals and with other middle-class people who have got a very distorted view of what their own people want. You have come to the conclusion-and the member for Brisbane suggests this as wellthat somehow or other Aboriginal people are denied access to the RDA by these amendments. If you are going to say that, prove it. Do not just get up here, as everybody is doing on this legislation, and make these wonderful broad statements. You are still in the House. Get back to the dispatch box after my speech and point to the facts, as we have in every response. Mr Bevis-Should the RDA apply or not, Wilson?",25
26,Mr TUCKEY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"You have the opportunity. Get back to the dispatch box and identify segments of these amendments-actual pieces of legislation-that support your statement that this legislation 'denies access to the RDA'. Those are your words, and you can check them in the Hansard. Show us where that happens, otherwise you stand on the charge of hypocrisy because you do not know what you are talking about. You come in here and mouth away but you do not produce the facts. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) gave you his response and showed you that the way in which the act that your side created addressed this matter was sufficient. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) had grave concerns that the great profits arising from this legislation would not be for the Aboriginal people but for the legal profession. The figure for that is some $80 million out of ATSIC, while the Governor General tells us of the very genuine and real health difficulties confronting Aboriginal people. You have some view that Aboriginal people are above and beyond the Racial Discrimination Act. They are not. As a consequence, the more complex you make that area, the more opportunities you open. The number of incidents are increasing every day of Aboriginals suing Aboriginals, and other people in the community are also using this piece of confusion that adds nothing to the legislation to attack the rights of Aboriginal people. Confusion is not the preserve of one racial group. Over time, other people are going to use the sorts of silly amendments that you have introduced for purely political purposes to the detriment of Aboriginal people, as well as to the detriment of other people who are trying to develop our nation in some way. This is the point that you have to. take into account. You do not do these sorts of things to legislation unless there is a good and specific reason. The Attorney-General has responded. He has proved how stupid this proposition is because there are already adequate provisions in the act, of your own making, and we are not withdrawing them. You quote Alan Rose of the Law Reform Commission. After he had warned us of this dreadful problem of compensation, I wrote to him and asked whether he was opposed to compensation for Aboriginal people, and he said no. (Time expired)",25
27,Mr CAMPBELL,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The comments of the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) in particular need to be countered. He tried to invoke some form of international censure if we do not pass these amendments. Firstly, I do not believe it is anyone else's business whatsoever, but I draw the honourable member's attention to the words of Professor Wang Gungwu-the doyen of overseas Chinese history scholarship, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong and past president of the Asian Studies Association of Australia. In the Canberra Times of 8 July 1992 he was reported as saying that, as far as most Asians were concerned, the survival of Aboriginal people had never had any priority. What does the member for Kingsford-Smith think he is doing trying to blackmail or intimidate the House on the basis that we might offend some foreign power? He also regurgitated the nonsense about the importance of land. The truth in Australia Aboriginal people who have the longest lifespan, the best lifestyle and the highest disposable income are those who have been alienated from their land for the longest time. In my electorate there are many people who, on an off-pension week, would sell the land for a corned beef sandwich. It is an irrefutable fact that there are more Aboriginal people in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne than there are in my electorate. No-one forced them to go there. They voted with their feet. They went there for what they perceived to be a better lifestyle, and freely and willingly abandoned connections with their land. Members of the Labor Party come in here and preach the middle-class nonsense that has infested the Labor Party. Time and time again I have said in this parliament ties for Aboriginal people have to be-and this is what I am told by Aboriginal peoplehygiene, housing, health, education, training and employment, and if you miss out one, the whole thing collapses. We are in a situation where Aboriginal people are striving to develop themselves on station properties with totally inadequate funding. It was inadequate during the years of the Labor Party; it is still inadequate under the present government. It needs to be reiterated that the member for Kingsford-Smith is out of order coming in here and invoking some sort of international sanction. This is a sovereign matter for Australia. It does not involve any other country and, in fact, most other countries could not give a damn.",25
28,Mr KATTER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I refer to the statement made by the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) that people of Aboriginal descent are going to be dispossessed of rights that the High Court has said they have always had, and that they are not going to be given any compensation. In Queensland, there are 1,539 pastoral leases, nine of which are owned by foreign interests and only 20 of which-this is from advice provided to us by the Queensland government-are owned by corporations. So those 1,539 leases are effectively owned by is that the owner-operators. Mr Bevis-How many are owned by members of the National Party?",26
29,Mr KA TTER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The gentleman interjecting has a parcel of income worth about $120,000 a year. That is his income. The income for these people for the last three years has been minus $2,700. With some other people, I recently visited eight stations and we found only two wives and some kids at home. The husbands were 300 kilometres away working on jobs far away from their homes. Those people were left there all by themselves. What compensation is going to be paid to the people who have gone out and bought properties in good faith? In many cases they have built up these stations, investing close to $1 million in today's money over three or four that the priori- generations. Their ownership of that station has been damaged, and damaged in the most serious manner, by the decision that has already been taken. If the High Court says that was the law, then that was the law. But the governments of Australia never said that. The governments of Australia said, 'You own this land.' I must make that point to this House. Across half of the surface area of Queensland, 1,500 pastoral lessees all had the right to transfer that land over to freehold title. I was one of those pastoral lessees. I am not now, but I was. I looked seriously on four occasions at freeholding our property. On all four occasions I could not see a single reason to freehold and pay the government. It was only a measly $2,000, which when you are turning over a lot of money on a station property is an acceptable figure, but I could see no reason to part with what is still a substantial sum of money-$2,000 a yearbecause I could see no difference between a pastoral lease and a freehold title. The 1870 Supreme Court decision in Queensland clearly stated that we owned that property. Clearly, that decision was that our rights were in rem and not in personam, to use the technical jargon of the legal profession. Look at the marketplace in Queensland. You have to ask yourself: why did nobody in Queensland freehold their land? Why is half the surface area of Queensland still pastoral leases? When anyone, at any time at all and for a negligible figure-we were attacked continuously by the ALP in the state house for having.a negligible figure upon it, so a matter of public record that it was a negligible figure-could convert their pastoral lease to a freehold title, why didn't they do that? The only conceivable answer was that there was no reason to do it because you already had complete ownership of that land. Mr Bevis-But you didn't!",26
30,Mr KATTER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, this genius down here is an expert in this field: the marketplace and people's pockets. The marketplace paid exactly the same price for an acre of freehold land as they paid for an acre of pastoral lease. Whether it was the marketplace and the money decision or whether it was the legal decision through the Supreme Court of Queensland-and it may be that we are a bunch of mugs on the land, but I do not think that all 1,530 of us were mugs-none of us converted our pastoral leases to freehold title. The laws of trespass-we keep talking about exclusive title in this place-have been most specific in Queensland. If you owned a pastoral lease, the laws of trespass operated and you could exclude anyone and everyone that you so chose from your land. Where is the compensation for these people? (Time expired)",27
31,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Just to clarify in relation to this debate what the former Labor government did in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act: we respected the Racial Discrimination Act and that is apparent in the way that the preamble to the Native Title Act reads. The preamble says: The law, together with initiatives announced at the time of its introduction and others agreed on by the Parliament from time to time, is intended, for the purposes of paragraph 4 of Article 1 of the Intemational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, to be a special measure for the advancement and protection of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, and is intended to further advance the process of reconciliation among all Australians. The Prime Minister at the time pointed out in answers to questions in parliament, and indeed to the media, that what we were doing was utilising section 8(1) of the Racial Discriit is mination Act, which talks about special measures, and under article 1 of the racial discrimination convention that is attached to the bill: 'Special measures shall not be deemed racial discrimination.' We were utilising the special measures provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. We did not amend it. We did not override it. That is why we produced a balanced package. But we also relied on the fact that if it was not a special measure-and that was not decided by the High Court in Western Australia v. The Commonwealth-we relied in the twin power of the race power that the package was a beneficial package for the advancement of the Aboriginal race; it was there to protect native title and it set up a framework. That was what the High Court decided in Western Australia v. The Commonwealth, and that was the only thing it decided. It did not decide that the parliament has the power to legislate to the detriment of the Aboriginal race. It decided that the Native Title Act 1993 was a beneficial package for the advancement of the Aboriginal race, so it was supported by the race power. It was a twin argument that was put to the High Court and that was what the submissions to the High Court were on behalf of the federal government: that it was supported by the race power but also by the external affairs power. The High Court did not resolve whether it was supported by the external affairs power. The Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, even back in August 1993, was asked about the Racial Discrimination Act on the PM program, and I think it is relevant, given that we are talking about Wik. Mr Keating said: ' If you are asking me, am I prepared to rule in discriminatory legislation, that is, by suspending Racial Discrimination Act to permit Queensland to pass discriminatory legislation to deny the Wik people their rights to appeal to the courts, I wouldn't pass such legislation-no, I wouldn't. And we did not, in relation to the Wik challenge; that is why the Wik challenge was allowed to proceed. In relation to the Native Title Act 1993, we say that it would qualify as a special measure. But that was not determined by the High Court. They said, 'Enough,' in relation to the race power that was a beneficial package. What this government says is, 'We want to respect the Racial Discrimination Act; we do not like Pauline Hanson.' But when it comes to the test, it is not prepared to put this safety net in. Our legislation did not suspend or override the Racial Discrimination Act; it utilised section 8(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act on special measures, which was an exception to racial discrimination. It was a balanced package. Certainly, in relation to validation, that was offset by the right to negotiate in that statutory form-tribunals.",27
32,Mr CAMPBELL,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I was slow to rise to my feet because I felt sure that you had taken the matter in hand. The member at the table referred to the member for Oxley by her name. I think it is out of order and I do wish he would attend to these details with some more concern.",28
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Jenkins)The honourable member has a very good point. The member will refer to members by their titles. Mr ·MELHAM-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. What does the government's legal adviser, the Solicitor-General, Gavan Griffith, say in his written advice of 10 October in relation to the race power? He says: There was an intentionally racist cast to the power. Indeed, the power seems intended principally to enable laws of adverse impact on a targeted racial group. That is in relation to the race power as it was originally put in the constitution. That is the basis upon which this legislation is founded. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) said it the in his second reading speech. You say that you have the power under the races power. What you are saying is that you have the power to discriminate against the Aboriginal race as a result of the 1967 referendum. We say that question has not been decided. That is why we are putting this safety net in as well. (Time expired)",28
34,Mr LIEBERMAN,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Indi) (10.46 a.m.)The Native Title Act as amended by the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 in fact respects the Racial Discrimination Act provisions, and that is clear. It also recognises and protects native title in Australia as enunciated in the Mabo and Wik decisions. You will recall that Wik held that native title was not necessarily wholly extinguished by the grant of a pastoral lease. This bill recognises and protects native title rights as enunciated by those judges, although the decision did take everyone by surprise, including the member for Banks (Mr Melham) if he was honest today. The conclusion in the Wik decision is in fact confirmed by this bill which allows native title to continue to exist in certain circumstances. To allay any doubts ttlat are being created by the opposition, it provides statutory access rights for certain registered native title claimants to pastoral land and also recognises the statements made by Kirby in the Wik decision that there may be some level of extinguishment of native title rights by the grant of a pastoral lease. Kirby said: Only if there is inconsistency between the legal interests of the lessee and the native title will such native title to the extent of the inconsistency be The bill has very carefully preserved that very test. Sections 23G and 231 enable the states and territories to confirm that pastoral leases have extinguished native title to the extent that grants of rights and interests tent with native title rights and interests. The bill leaves it to the courts to assess this level of consistency. The only actual inconsistency identified by the bill is that between any exclusive possession rights of the native title holders with the rights of pastoral leases. Subdivision G of the bill implements the test that is enunciated by the courts by providing a range of primary production and other activities which can be carried out in relation to pastoral leases so that not only native title holders are given protection but also pastoralists are given clarity as to their rights. That is so they are not subject to imponderances and the uncertainties which are created by the present Native Title Act followed by the Wik judgment leaving certain issues not yet determined. Permanent extinguishment of native title is under section 237 A of the act-that is, the Keating act. The common law title is extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in land by the Crown or other inconsistent dealings with the land by the Crown. That was stated in the Mabo judgment, I think by Chief Justice Brennan. It is not known yet, according to the High Court judgments, whether at common law native title can revive once it has been extinguished. The Wik judges did not come to any conclusion on that point. Brennan, Dawson and MCHugh agreed in that judgment with him and concluded that the Wik pastoral lease had extinguished native title and therefore did need to consider whether native title can revive. Brennan, Dawson and MCHugh in the Wik case, although in the minority, were the only judges that were clear on the issue that I have just referred to, and their view is a considered opinion which I think has weight and which the bill has taken into account. The government could not leave this issue unresolved. It would be irresponsible for it to do that, and it would add to the considerable uncertainty that is already surrounding native title and land management in Australia. We cannot go on with that. Some of the practical and conceptual difficulties that would result from a revival of native title for the lessees of the Wik pastoral leases were identified by are inconsisBrennan in his decision. It would be highly unsatisfactory for all Australians if these kinds of issues were left to be resolved by the courts in relation to every kind of tenure in Australia on a case by case basis. In order to restore certainty to land management, the government has decided, as the bill clearly states, as a matter of good policy in Australia to settle in the bill that the extinguishment of native title is permanent. Motion (by Mr Melham) agreed to: That further consideration of the amendment moved by the member for Banks be postponed.",28
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Jenkins)Before I call the honourable member for Dawson, I wish to advise the House that I have had an opportunity to study the amendments she has circulated.

The purpose of these amendments is as follows: there is an increase to the claims registration test such that a majority of the group is to 'have a current traditional physical connection. One of the amendments removes the operation of alternative state and territory provisions that depend· on ministerial determinations to be disallow able instruments. Another seeks to allow states and territories to upgrade leases in groups or singularly with costs and betterment. There has been a great argument about land grabs. In Queensland there is always a charge for betterment and for the costs associated with an upgrade of a lease. Another amendment ends common law native title claims with a six-year sunset provision. This is constitutionally sound from the legal advice that we have been given. It does not, of course, prevent claims under the Native Title Act. Having secured private property rights for pastoralists, it is most important that we be even handed and secure private property rights for Aboriginals and Aboriginal groups as well. Two of the other amendments of this group address this very important aspect. One asks that states and territories which have laws that enable the issue of freehold for native title holders for any successful claims over vacant crown land be able to do so. In Queensland there are extensive areas of vacant crown land, some of it quite valuable land. When we said this to the Central Queensland Aboriginal Land Council they were very pleased because their claim was over vacant crown land. Further to that, there are deeds of grant in trust in Queensland and also extensive Aboriginal reserves covering some seven million acres. Under these amendments, that land would become effectively freeholded finally in the hands of shire councils. We are looking at a very even handed set of amendments that do not bind Aboriginals and pastoralists together forever in a dual ownership situation but one that looks on the rights of each group and addresses the need for both groups to have private property rights. I congratulate the National Farmers Federation. The majority of the early amendments are theirs. They put them on the table to the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund some weeks ago. They prepared amendments. Unfortunately, those amendments were not picked up by the government. We have chosen to move them with National Party amendments today. I wish to address very quickly the issue of the previous Attorney-General, the member for Hotham (Mr Gareth Evans). He has been very fulsome today in his statements. I would like to remind him of what he said on 18 December 1993. The Hon. Gareth Evans, the then Attorney-General, said: . . . the High Court decision will confirm that properly granted pastoral leases, for example, do in fact extinguish native title. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said as much. That is our legal judgment, that is our belief, that although the High Court did leave a sliver of doubt ... It seems that his memory is deficient because that is certainly not what he is saying today, or was he simply misleading the House, the parliament, the Aboriginal people and the pastoral industry back in 1993? I wish to commend the amendments that have been moved to the House. I believe that they are a fair representation of the needs of both groups-pastoralists and Aboriginals, not the Aboriginal land councils which virtually enslave many of the Aborigines in reserves but Aboriginals themselves. I believe that if these were enacted we would see a much fairer regime. We would see private property rights for pastoralists and private property rights for Aboriginals, land that they would not only have a native title claim over but that they could trade, borrow against, develop, mortgage and bequeath to their children. It would be land that would be rightly theirs as private property. (Time expired)",29
37,Mr GARETH EVANS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Can I make it absolutely clear, if it is not abundantly already, that all the amendments moved by the member for Dawson (Mrs DeAnne Kelly) are absolutely and manifestly unacceptable. If that is her concept of an even-handed approach to this legislation, that is just a grotesque and misapplication of the English language. What this package of amendments do is go far beyond what is already an absolutely unacceptable balance struck in this legislation to make it absolutely impossible for the concept of native title to have any continuing meaning at all. I go very quickly through the amendments that are still left on the table after you cut a swathe through them, Mr Deputy Speaker, for procedural reasons and briefly comment upon them. The first amendment relating to deeds of grant in trust would require those grants to be deemed to be vested in relevant community councils rather than the native title holders themselves. That is a deliberately divisive enterprise being embarked upon here by the member for Dawson, I am sure with the complete knowledge of what she is doing in this respect. It does not make any sense at all in terms of the basic concept of native title recognition and protection. So far as her amendment No. 5 is concerned, what she is doing there is widening an already extremely wide definition of primary production. We will come to that issue later on. It is not something that is necessary to protect the interests of farmers. We will talk about those interests later on. This is an unnecessary further extension of an oversweeping approach that is adopted to the coexistence issue in the government's legislation and is simply not acceptable. The changes in division lA in amendment 11 frankly amount to simply a wholesale further extinguishment of native title and the right to negotiate associated with it. What is involved here is provision for basically wholesale title upgrades, the effect of which would be to confer rights of exclusive possession by statutory fiat thus involving absolute extinguishment. There is a further gloss on this in the original version of the amendments in that the Commonwealth would have to pick up the tab for these particular enterprises by the state governments. That is an utterly fanciful proposition which I would not wish to bequeath on even the present government. That particular obligation is manifestly unacceptable in policy and in good government terms. The amendments from 16 onwards seem to involve an attempt to remove altogether the Commonwealth's supervisory role in relation to the arbitral and determination process, with the states left to determine for themselves whether their own institutional machinery and schemes in relation to the right to negotiate and so on do in fact conform to the legislation without any provision for supervision by the Commonwealth. Again, in a matter of absolute national importance of the kind that this is, that is a manifestly unacceptable abrogation of responsibility by the Commonwealth. We would not have a bar of it, and I cannot imagine that the present government would either. Amendment 31 relates to the sunset clause and not only involves the application of a sunset clause in relation to claims made under the Native Title Act but appears to apply across the board, or purports to apply across the board, so as to extend to common law claims as well. The immediate impact of that would be to expose the Commonwealth to massive constitutional liability for the demise of the property rights thus involved in an across-the-board removal of the chance to pursue those common law claims, quite apart from the statutory claims. The provision in amendment No. 33 for freehold title, or so-called ordinary title, to be vested rather than native title on vacant crown land, which the member for Dawson claims is a nice little bit of trading off, cuts a swath through the whole concept of native title as articulated in Mabo and as accepted by second governments. In the guise of offering a new opportunity to grant freehold title, it picks up the concept of native title being something unworthy to be recognised in Australian property law. The government has extinguished just about every other possible manifestation of it. It is a nice gesture to offer it in those but it is a gesture that is loaded with significance, is pregnant with significance, in terms of the government's basic attitude to the whole Mabo concept. Then, of course, you have the application of a new test to be applied to any claims, and we will have to revisit that issue. (Time expired)",33
38,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to respond to the amendments moved by the member for Dawson (Mrs Qe-Anne Kelly). I say at the outset that my understanding is that she asserted that the amendments were National Party amendments. That was not my understanding. That understanding has been confirmed by the National Party Whip. They are amendments moved by the member for Dawson; they are not amendments moved in the name of the National Party. Can I briefly comment on them, having already foreshadowed that the amendments will not be supported by the government. A group of amendments relate to sections 43 and 43A. These are designed by the member for Dawson to address the concern that ministerial determinations under sections 43 and 43A may be disallowed in the Senate. The proposal seems to be that they not be disallowable instruments. Relevant provisions in the current act are disallowable. The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 conforms with accepted legal policy that changes to general laws, as distinct from decisions applying general laws, should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. A determination of section 43A will change the law in the state. It will replace the Native Title Act process with a state based process, and such a change should be subject to some level of parliamentary scrutiny. I am advised that amendment 17 appears to be a mistake. This removes from disallowance determinations to make additional future acts subject to the right to negotiate. The amendments in this group would leave great uncertainty as to whether alternative regimes were in place since there would be no ministerial determination as a trigger. Another group of amendments relate to the claims test, the registration test and the terms, subject of current physical connection. The amendments require claimants in the Federal Court to provide evidence that members have had a traditional physical connection and currently have a traditional physical connection. The proposal is that this would also be a requirement for the registration test. The bill provides that, for registration purposes, a member of the claim group needs to have, or previously had, a traditional physical connection to the land covered by the application. To require a demonstration of current connection would exclude groups who have been removed from their traditional lands or who have been unlawfully or improperly locked out. It would work an extinguishment of these people's rights. Amendment No. 31 relates to the sunset clause. The proposal in the member for Dawson's amendment is to include a new provision, section I3A, the effect of which would be to prevent any person claiming native title rights or relying on the assertion of native title rights in any proceedings more than six years after the commencement of the amendments unless as a result of an approved determination or the person has a claim under consideration which was made within the six years. This would operate as a sunset clause on common law claims and, as such, would run the risk of extinguishment of native title and subsequent massive compensation liability. I will deal with three other amendments together-amendments 3, 5 and 11. Amendments 3 and 11 would allow the wholesale upgrade of pastoral leases to freehold or exclusive tenures and thereby the extinguishment of native title. The provisions would allow for the wholesale extinguishment over the 40 per cent of Australia which is pastoral lease land. The government's position is that, in the future, pastoral leases subject to native title should only be able to be upgraded with the agreement of the native title holders or by a rigorously non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition regime. Amendment 5 would allow permits to be granted for incidental activities over the whole of the pastoral lease land. This would be a significant widening of the bill, which requires that the majority of the lease be used for primary production activities. The relevant provision is proposed section 24GB(1)(d)(ii). As I indicated, those amendments are not acceptable to the government. Consistent with the treatment of the amendment moved by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), I move: That consideration of the amendments moved by Mrs De-Anne Kelly be postponed to a later hour this day.",34
39,Mr GARETH EVANS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"If I can just very briefly conclude my previous remarks by saying that, possibly for the first and last time in this debate, I am in wholehearted agreement with what the Attorney General (Mr Williams) has just said in his response to these amendments. Just for the sake of completeness, can I say that the opposition also absolutely rejects the proposed changes in amendment 34 and, subsequently, the test to be applied both for the registration and the pursuit of claims. For claims only to be pursuable by those groups, a majority of whom have had a traditional physical association not only in the past but currently, is manifestly to work a huge injustice to a very significant number of native title claimants around this country, many of whom have si-I?ly been unable-not for want of trying or wlllmgness-to pursue that particular association. We were discussing this issue earlier and there is no need to repeat anything I said. This is just an even more extreme manifestation of that position in these amendments. The final thing that needs to be referred to is the change accomplished by amendments 40 and 41, which would include in schedule 4 accomplishing complete and permanent extinguishment as a result of the effect of past acts. What about pastoral leases? The effect of these last two National Party amendments would be to treat pastoral leases-which the government has excluded from the scope of the provisions for which there is automatic extinguishment applicable and for which there is reference made in these schedule provisions of the act-as now having produced an extinguishment of native title where there is any inconsistency involved with the native title claim. That is absolutely against the result of the Wik decision, where the High Court held that, as a - atter. of law, pastoral leases are subject to natIve tItle and they can coexist on that lease. There is no question of treating it as an exclusive possession situation. Just to respond to the particular reference that was made to my remarks",35
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Nehl)Order! I am loath to interrupt the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but the question before the House is that the amendments be postponed.

43,Mr GARETH EVANS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I do not want to come back later. I just want to get rid of it now in the remaining 30 seconds and not bother anyone else. I just say that reference to it in the schedule is inappropriate, particularly for the western lands in New South Wales.",35
44,Mr CAMPBELL,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I am getting increasingly concerned at what is happening in this House. There seems to be two sets of rules-one for us and one for the member for Holt. It is quite clear that he was speaking against the motion. It seemed to be an adjournment motion. But, seeing as we have had some debate on it, I would like to sit down now and then rise again to speak on this adjournment.",35
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. You have repeated what I have said. I have said to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the motion before the House is purely a proceduralone and that any remarks he wishes to make should be addressed to that motion and that motion only. Does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have anything to say about the postponement?,35
46,Mr GARETH EVANS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"No, I am perfectly happy now having made my point for the postponement to proceed. Question put: That the motion (Mr Williams's) be agreed to. A division having been called and the bells being rung",35
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I note there have been some exchanges across the chamber. I say to all members that, if those calling for the division wish to call it off, that is fine, but there will still be no debate on the procedural motion of postponing the amendments until that question is put. If you wish to contribute something, it will be on the basis of whether the amendments should be postponed or not, not on the content of the amendments. Mr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, obviously our worry is that we will be pushed on so late in the day that none of us will have a chance to put what is a very valid point of view, representing some 2,000 pastoral lessees in this country, their relatives and the majority of Australians. Also, this will be moved up to the Main Committee, so we will not be able to put our arguments, as has been the case in this debate throughout.",36
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I appreciate the point the member for Kennedy has made, but I would suggest to you that calling the division actually lessens the amount of time you have got rather than the other way. Mr Katter-If we could get assurances to that effect, we would most certainly be inclined to call off the division.",36
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Is the Attorney-General prepared to withdraw his motion if we call off the division?

That also includes the possibility for debate of the amendments of the member for Banks and the member for Dawson which have been postponed. They are on the table and may be debated.",37
53,Mr GARETH EVANS,AYES,"I take this opportunity to move the debate a step forward, I hope, by addressing the first of the package of amendments that go to the government's la-point plan. The first such item I refer to is the provisions to validate certain intermediate period acts. What is involved in this part of the legislationAYES division 2A-is to take up all those acts which occurred after the commencement of the Native Title Act on 1 January 1994 before the date that the Wik decision was handed down, on 23 December 1996, where those acts might have been invalid because they impact adversely on native title and to declare them all, with the stroke of the legislative pen, utterly and completely validated. The validation of intermediate period acts in this way is the first of a number of examples of the scheme of the bill where deliberate NOES or reckless flouting of the law by governments is cured by legislative action, where miners and others have had their invalid titles validated-or will have if this legislation goes PAIRS through in this form-where Aboriginal people lose the native title that they would have been able to enjoy without this legislation being passed and where the taxpayer foots the bill for the financial consequences of it. That is obviously a pretty unhappy and unsatisfactory state of affairs. What makes the way this particular part of this legislation is constructed all worse is that the effect of validation is not only to extin4 or guish native title permanently in the case of grants of freehold and other such legal interests where the High Court has left us in no doubt that the grant of such an interest does have that effect of permanent extinguishment; what this legislation purports to do now is to go further than that and, where grants of nonexclusive possession are involved-grants of interests which would not in themselves necessarily permanently extinguish native title rights-nonetheless have that permanent extinguishment now achieved. I am referring in particular to the validation of these intermediate past acts in relation to native title impairing acts taking place on pastoral leases where native title, if those acts are to be validated, would normally, to the extent of that inconsistency, not be permanently extinguished but simply suppressed or put in abeyance until such time as the overriding title constraint was removed. What we have here is something that goes further than that and actually permanently and completely removes the possibility of that native title right ever in effect bouncing back into life and being legitimately exercised in the event that the overriding constraint disappears. What the validation is all about is to really mop up after a number of state governments in fact behaved very badly when it came to issuing interests or permits, or whatever, over leasehold areas. They did so, claiming that they assumed that native title had in fact been extinguished. They, ignoring that all of us in 1993 who expressed a belief-and I was one of them-that probably that would be the case when the High Court addressed this matter, nonetheless left open certainly the possibility that the High Court would otherwise decide. The High Court did otherwise decide in the Wik case. It did decide that it was possible for native title to coexist on pastoral leases. As a result, a problem arose for all those . states who had gone down the track of acting on the assumption that native title had in fact been extinguished, granting interests willy nilly, and risking invalidity of those acts High Court held otherwise. The assertion in the explanatory memorandum to the bill that governments believed that they were free to do various acts over pastoral lease land simply does not hold up. The truth of the matter is that a number of governments, particularly the Queensland government, chose to believe that that was the case. The Western Australian government, I acknowledge, was much more cautious in this respect and, as a result, there are less problems of this kind. The problem arises as to what to do about all of this. Justice would demand that history be unwound; certainty would demand, on. the other hand, that a line be ruled under all this and that we move on. The minority report in the joint committee adopts a rather robust approach to unwinding and tracking back over this. This is an issue which the opposition wants to have another more careful look at. It may be that a more workable approach would be to come at this from the other end and try to identify those situations where a manifest injustice was worked and to try to correct those individual injustices rather than to cut across completely this legislation.

56,Dr KEMP,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"Goldstein-Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (11.47 a.m.)-This is my first opportunity to speak in this chamber in any detail on the substance of the Public Service Bill 1997 and the Parliamentary Service Bill, which are being considered cognately today. I welcome in particular the chance to set out the government's reform proposals for the Australian Public Service. I start from the proposition that the Australian Public Service is a great institution. It is a vital part of our system of democratic government. It plays a crucial role in providing advice to government on the development of its policies. It lies at the heart of accountanopoly bility for the way in which the decisions of government are implemented. But, like many of our national institutions in the private sector and in the public sector, the Public Service itself is showing signs of age. This is no reflection at all on the calibre or the commitment of individual public servants. The reality is that too often the creativity and innovation of those who work within the service are being undermined by inflexible work systems and process driven procedures. The Public Service Act, enacted in 1922 and amended more than 100 times since, is a key reason for that. It looks to a bygone age rather than forward to the next century. The act-together with the regulations, awards and agreements-preserves a rule-bound culture that emphasises control of inputs rather than effectiveness of outcomes and process over client serviCe. The previous government recognised that truth. Our government intends to address it. If we do not, then taxpayers will pay the costs 1997 through inefficient and expensive work practices, and the public will have less access to the services they need when they need them. Equally important; the Australian Public Service will provide a less rewarding environment for those who work within it. I acknowledge that, over the last decade, the APS has already undergone considerable change. Under the previous government, the Australian Public Service was significantly restructured and reduced in size: its machinery of government was restructured, program budgeting was introduced, many of the operations were commercialised and put on a user pays basis, the tenure of secretaries was made fixed term, the Public Service Board was abolished and the ties of central control were loosened. Yet considerably more needs to be done to enable the Australian Public Service to become flexible and adaptable to the needs of government in the 21 st century. We need to provide the foundation for a high performance public service while reaffirming its sense of public purpose. Reform of public administration is a key part of our micro-economic reform agenda. Until recently, the Australian Public Service had a moin the provision of government services. If effectively enjoyed a protective barrier from more efficient competitors. Now, as the provision of public services becomes contestable, the pressures for structural adjustment in public administration are just as great as they are in other industries such as the manufacturing industry. There are some fundamental distinctions between the public and the private sectors. The private sector is responsive and accountable to the market. It delivers goods and services to customers. The public sector is, within the framework of ministerial 'responsibility, accountable to the public. It must ensure that, when citizens receive services through the marketplace, the standards of conduct of public servants remain accountable. The Public Service must ensure that citizens continue to receive certain fundamental services, often entitlements for which the government of the day remains accountable, no matter how those services are delivered. But recognition of this essential truth should not blind us to the fact that the manner in which the Australian Public Service workplaces are organised and people are managed is subject to the same economic, social and technological pressures that face other Australian institutions and Australian businesses. Maintaining and revitalising a career public service is a key part of our government's strategy to improve Australia's governance and to prepare it for the future. That in particular is why the government has sought to give a priority to the process of public service reform as an integral element of its broader reform agenda. Our commitment to reform is reflected in the passage of new financial management legislation, the introduction of government service charters and the promotion of more flexible employment arrangements under the Workplace Relations Act. The modernisation of the principallegislation regulating the Australian Public Service, the Public Service Act 1922, is a vital element of this public service reform agenda. On 26 June 1997, my predecessor-the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith)-introduced into parliament the Public Service Bill 1997 to replace the current legislative framework for the establishment and management of the Australian Public Service. This bill proposes a modem act embodying a new approach to protecting the public interest of citizens while providing a far more flexible framework for the management of employees. It seeks to replace an act which is generally accepted to be outdated, excessively complex, overly prescriptive and unnecessarily centralist in its perspective. The new bill will provide a legislative basis for APS employment which will allow the APS to provide better policy advice to the government and higher quality, more accessible services to the community. It will encourage the APS to seek maximum value for public funds rather than minimise risk. The bill emphasises the distinctive ethos of Australia's public administration and parliament's expectations of the Public Service. The bill will maintain the service's integrity and professionalism by setting statutory values and a code of conduct that must be upheld by all public servants. This will strengthen the traditional ethos of the Public Service and remedy the manifest shortcomings of the current legislation. The 1997 bill establishes a framework for an apolitical and non-partisan Public Service. In contrast, the 1922 act is silent on such fundamental matters. The new bill provides a fair balance between enhanced accountability and devolved management responsibility. It establishes that employment powers within APS agencies rest with their chief executives and vests in them greater authority to meet the distinctive needs of their own organisations. This will provide secretaries and agency heads with the flexibility needed to provide more rewarding jobs for their staff and to develop employment arrangements tailored to the expectations of the clients they serve. At the same time, the bill ensures that the powers vested in agency heads are exercised appropriately. The bill provides for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny and greater public accountability. It requires agency heads to uphold and promote the values of the Australian Public Service. Together with the subordinate legislation, it provides the Public Service Commissioner with far greater powers of review, investigation and report than are provided by the current act. The Public Service Bill 1997 has undergone extensive scrutiny by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I am pleased that the committee supported the need for the present act to be replaced and favoured the simplification, modernisation and more accessible format of the new bill. The report of that committee-a most thorough and professional report-made a number of unanimous recommendations. I put on record my gratitude to the committee and its members from both sides of politics. I applaud both its bipartisan spirit and the care that went into its assessment. The government proposes to adopt, in whole or in part, the 20 recommendations made. The government has also given close consideration to the substantive comments contained in the report but which were not expressed formally as recommendations and, in one crucial matter, intends to accept the committee's views. Let me now indicate how the bill will be amended to meet the suggestions of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The government has been persuaded that the APS values can be further strengthened. In particular, the bill will now recognise explicitly the need for secretaries to provide frank and honest advice to government and will place accountability in the context of ministerial responsibility. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts also asked that clauses 13 and 15 of the bill, which relate to the APS code of conduct, be further considered. Changes will be made to the bill as a result. Much of the evidence given before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts related to the status of secretaries. This is somewhat perplexing since, as the committee noted, the tenure of secretaries will not be changed by the new act. The Public Service Act was amended during the opposition's term of office to allow a secretary's appointment to be terminated. It was during those years, too, the policy was introduced that all future appointments of secretaries would be fixed term. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts supported the continuation of the current arrangements. I agree with this conclusion. I must say that I have found no evidence that secretaries are less frank and fearless in their advice today than they were in the 1970s. Robustness of advice is a matter of character, not tenure. The Public Service Bill 1997 proposes that the Prime Minister set the remuneration of secretaries and that agency ministers set the remuneration of the heads of executive agencies, usually after seeking the advice of the Remuneration Tribunal. On the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the remuneration set for agency heads will be made public in the annual financial statements of Commonwealth agencies. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts also proposed-and the government agrees-that secretaries and heads of executive agencies must prepare annual reports in accordance with the general requirements of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The bill retains the concept of the Senior Executive Service and includes for the first time a clear statement of the service-wide role of the SES. While agency heads will have enhanced responsibilities in relation to the SES, the Public Service Commissioner will be required to issue directions about employment matters relating to SES employees, including certifying that a termination is in the best interest of the service. This will address JCPA concerns that a Senior Executive Service employee should be free from any apprehension that they may be dismissed for providing robust advice to their agency head. I emphasise that the directions, like the regulations, are legislative instruments which parliament can disallow. The bill introduces a streamlined approach to the review of employment actions. I agree with the conclusion of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that there is a clear need for a revision of the current grievance and appeal mechanisms. The present review system that contains too many avenues of appeal, resulting in complicated and convoluted processes. The responsibility to afford public servants a right of review of employment decisions needs to be balanced wi th the need to reduce the costs associated with a grievance based workplace culture. However, I emphasise that the bill does not propose and has never sought the abolition of external review. It explicitly provides public servants with a right to seek review of any APS action that relates to their employment and allows for independent external review from outside their own agency. The detail of the review processes and the particular rights afforded to staff will be set out in the new Public Service regulations. With due regard to the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, these provisions will be made simpler, clearer and more concise than the draft they considered. Although the JCPA made no recommendation on the matter, it expressed a view that it was appropriate for the Public Service Commissioner to set standards and to review service-wide performance. However, to address any perception of a conflict of interest, it was suggested by the committee that, in addition, there should be a Merit Protection Commissioner with separate statutory powers to review individual employment actions. The government has agreed to take up this suggestion. It reflects a significant amendment to the existing bill, and has been made only after the most careful consideration. The Merit Protection Commissioner will be able to investigate a complaint and, much like the Commonwealth Ombudsman, make recommendations to an agency head on how it should be addressed. If not satisfied with the response, the Merit Protection Commissioner will report that conclusion to the Public Service Commissioner, who will have the power to report to the minister and, if necessary, to parliament. These represent very substantial powers of review and scrutiny. It is clear from my remarks that merit selection will remain a fundamental principle in selection decisions under the bill. Indeed, the bill specifically prohibits patronage or favouritism in staffing and prevents ministers from involving themselves in individual staffing decisions. The JCPA has recommended that the definition of merit should be included in the bill rather than, as originally proposed, in the subordinate legislation. That recommendation has also been accepted. The definition is based upon suggestions made by the Women's Electoral Lobby and supported by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Another important element of the bill is protection it provides, for the first time, to public interest whistleblowers. Public servants who believe that they have evidence of fraud or misconduct will now be able to make reports to their agency head or the Public Service Commissioner; an approach which, unlike the leaking of confidential information on government business, will serve to protect the public interest. The act will provide them with protection from victimisation or discrimito nation. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the government consider widening the whistleblowers legislation beyond the APS. The government has agreed to this recommendation and has referred the matter to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) for his consideration. An important initiative is the requirement that each agency head must establish a workplace diversity program. While these programs will operate to ensure that workplaces are free from discrimination, they go further than the arrangements in the current legislation for equal employment opportunity. The programs will recognise that a service which values and uses the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of its employees is likely to be more productive and creative. The need to better balance work and family responsibilities through the development of appropriate workplace systems and structures will be an important aspect of a workplace diversity program. It is important for parliament to be able to assess the effectiveness of these programs. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the Public Service Commissioner's directions should require agency heads to evaluate the outcomes of their workplace diversity programs and provide the commissioner with all the information necessary to carry out comparisons of the programs on an agency-by-agency basis. The government accepts that these proposals will strengthen public scrutiny of its programs. The current Australian Public Service Act gives various rights of return to those who leave the APS to work with other Commonwealth bodies. These mobility provisions are the lengthy and complex. They represent a considerable liability for Public Service agencies. The government's intention is to provide agencies with the discretion to determine arrangements that best meet their needs. The mobility rights of people covered by the current provisions will be preserved for a transitional period. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has recommended that the transitional period be extended from one year three, and the government has accepted this proposal. It should be noted that mobility of staff between agencies is specifically provided for in the bill. Employees will still be able to move from one APS agency to another on promotion or transfer without having to resign or be re-engaged. The classification rules, by grouping similar classification levels, will facilitate mobility across the service and again underpin the concept of the career service. The bill also continues, in a simplified form, the current provisions for the movement of APS employees where the government has made machinery of government changes or administrative rearrangements. The parliamentary departments are not covered by the Public Service Bill 1997. Instead, it is proposed that they will operate under their own Parliamentary Service Act. It is the government's view that the independence of the parliament and its employees can best be recognised by establishing a separate statutory regime for those who work in the parliamentary departments. For that reason, the government supports the bill brought to this House by its Presiding Officer. The establishment of a separate parliamentary service also has the support of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I am pleased that this Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 reflects the new approach set out in the Public Service Bill 1997. The drafting of this bill has been the responsibility of the clerks. The recognition of the independence of the advice provided by the two clerks and the proposal that they have 10-year nonrenewable terms reflects the views of the Presiding Officers. It is supported by the government. I have had a brief opportunity to peruse the amendments put forward by the opposition. It will be clear from my earlier remarks that the amendments proposed by the government address a significant number of the opposition's concerns. However, the government is unwilling to contemplate the high levels of prescription and central control that the opposition would impose on the engagement of staff and the management of their duties. I remind the House that it was the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, the Hon. Gary Johns, who reported to parliament in 1995 that there was a need to establish a more contemporary employment framework and, to that end, proposed that secretaries and agency heads be given employment powers in their own right. I am also disappointed that the opposition suggests the reintroduction of binding appeal mechanisms for all APS employees. The government is keen to make it clear to the opposition that it wants bipartisan support for this piece of legislation. We believe it is an historic piece of legislation that will provide the framework for this and future governments of this country. We approach the bill in that spirit.",40
57,Mr MCMULLAN,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"The House will note that we have had an unusual process for dealing with this complex package of legislation on the Public Service. The first two speakers on the Public Service Bill 1997 have been ministers, not only because we have had a change of minister since the legislation was introduced, but also because it was agreed generally that it would be more appropriate that the debate be preceded by the ministers' opportunity to outline the amendments which the government intends. We were happy to cooperate in that process. There are a number of opposition and government members who wish to speak on this important package of bills. We do not wish to take more time than is necessary in dealing with it, so I will try to keep my remarks below the half hour required. Some colleagues will smile and say, 'Yes, he has said that several times before,' and that is true. On the odd occasion I have carried it out and I will try again. This is a complex and important package of legislation before the parliament. It has far-reaching implications obviously and immediately for the Public Service, but it has implications for all Australians, and particularly for those Australians who depend on government services. Whilst in one way or another that is all of us, in particular those Australians in greatest need tend to be those who most rely on government services. It is a bill which has far-reaching implications also for the institution of parliament and for the servants of the parliament. The government on several occasions-and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service (Dr Kemp) in speaking on this occasion-has repeatedly assured us that its intention is to simplify the 1922 Public Service Act. The opposition certainly does not challenge the need for its simplification or its reform. As the minister acknowledged, we were the first to recognise that need, instituting when in government a process to reform the act. But we do question the way in which the government is going about simplification. There is widespread concern that simplification may not in fact be the government's principal motivation in bringing forward this legislation, because under the guise of simplification we actually have some radical changes to the future and operations of the Public Service. I will comment briefly on some of these changes. We now have a circumstance, for example, where the Prime Minister and ministers will be able to negotiate salary and conditions for agency heads and these will not be subject to public scrutiny. That is a signifiment's cant change and I think a cause for some concern. Agency heads, in turn, will have the power to hire and fire and determine salary and conditions for agency employees. They will have the power to revoke and amend determinations which give effect to conditions of service which have been negotiated and agreed between the government and APS employees. Officers of the SES, who constitute the management core of the Public Service, will not even have recourse to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. It is a bit hard to say that this constitutes a small business, even if we were to revert back to that debate. Furthermore, a vast range of responsibilities will be devolved to agency heads, which will result in increased differentiation, competition and the potential for rivalry between departments and duplication of administrative procedures. I note this with interest in the context of a recent speech by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) on 15 October when he talked about the need for a cohesive corporate government framework. I have to say not that I disagree with him saying it but I disagree with his view that this bill will make it more cohesive. To the contrary, it is likely to dissipate the cohesion and make it more disparate. We have seen some problems of that typeand if I have time. I will refer to themfollowing upon the restructuring of government in South Australia after the South Australian elections. Without going into the merit of those changes, which are none of the business of this parliament or related to this bill, some of the difficulties that have been thrown up in trying to deal with the devolved decision making process as a result of that example of government restructuring are something that we need to give consideration to. Furthermore, the opposition is concerned that the APS will become less of a career service and there will be a loss of institutional memory. The Merit ProtectIon (Australian Government Employees) Act is being repealed and with it all of the current mechanisms for review of employment decisions affecting APS employees. We welcome the governdecision to support the continuation of an independent Merit Protection Commissioner, but we are still concerned to see what responsibilities the government proposes to give the commissioner. We got some indications in the minister's speech just now, and that is something we will wish to consider. I would like to take this opportunity-and it is relevant to this point-to agree with the minister about the good work of the JCPA on this bill. I was not altogether convinced that it was the appropriate committee for it to go to. I was certain that it should have gone to a committee and there should have been a review. If I had been asked, I would not have been sure-although I served briefly on the JCPA and have a high regard for it-that it was the appropriate place. I acknowledge they did a very good job. The opposition welcomes the fact that the government has taken up a number of the suggestions, some of them in full and some of them in ways that we may still have some concern about. This issue of merit review is one where, if I understand the minister's remarks and the previously publicised aspects of it, we may still have some concerns about the way in which that aspect of the JCPA's recommendation is going to be implemented. We hope that the regulations will be available well before the Senate has to give consideration to this bill so that we can have a look in detail at how the government is proposing to implement it. Nevertheless, we welcome the fact that there has been some decision, however belated, to support the continuation of an independent Merit Protection Commissioner. Another concern expressed by members of the opposition, which I wish to reflect here, is the issue of mobility rights such as thosebut not only those-that APS employees who are employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act enjoy. Those rights will be removed after a 12-month transitional period, thus limiting the movement of staff between the Public Service and Parliament House, and other mobility aspects as well, as I understand it. The benefits to both institutions which have flowed from this movement have the potential to be limited. I think that is an unfortunate change. The overall effect of these and other changes introduced by these bills, in the opposition's view, contrary to the government's assertion and declared intention, creates the potential for a public service which will be more easily influenced by the government of the day and less willing to offer critical advice. I do accept that at its heart the capaciensuring ty and willingness to provide critical advice flows from the commitment to public service which most people take when they join the Public Service. They make a decision that they wish to pursue a career in the service of the Australian people and part of that is to give frank advice. I accept that we do not make people give good advice by passing laws. They give good advice because they make a commitment that that is what they want to do. They apply that principle and they apply themselves. It is nevertheless true that the legislative framework is what influences the marginal decisions and sometimes those will be very important decisions. They are matters that therefore give us some concern. Behind that concern, and why we interpret the government's intentions perhaps with some caution, is a strongly held suspicion that the government has a deep-seated antipathy towards the Public Service, that the government is very suspicious of and mistrusts the Public Service, and that it seems to be frustrated by the fact that public servants see themselves not only as servants of the government but also as servants of the public. Why would we hold that suspicion? It could be that 30,000 jobs have been cut from the Public Service, despite the fact that the Prime Minister said that 2,500 jobs would be cut over three years. We now find that there have been massive cuts to the Public Service and core Public Service responsibilities are being transferred to the private sector, sometimes in circumstances which we consider to be highly inappropriate. Against that background, I do not think it is surprising that many Australians, many public servants and the opposition share the suspicion which I have just outlined. Of course there are some positive aspects to these bills which the opposition welcomes and supports-for example, the inclusion of public service values in the legislation and a code of conduct for APS employees. Our concern is that, while the government claims to be ensuring the preservation of the traditional ethos and values of an apolitical and non-partisan APS by incorporating these values in legislation, which is a good thing to do, it is their destruction and that they are undermined by the inclusion of other provisions which we consider are incompatible with, and in some circumstances positively hostile to, these same values. For example, it is true, as the government claims, that the legislation proscribes patronage and favouritism. It is also true that the structure of the Public Service as a consequence of this legislation, if it were passed unamended, would create an environment where agency heads will be made completely beholden to ministers for their continuing employment and for their salary and conditions of employment, where departmental employees will be made similarly beholden to agency heads, and where the government will remain determined to restrict the appeal rights of public servants. That combination of circumstances encourages patronage and favouritism. If the government had actually set out to create a framework which was designed to undennine those traditional values and that traditional ethos of the APS, it could hardly have come up with a more effective blueprint than those elements. The bills also need to be assessed in the context of the challenges the country is currently facing: the problem of continuing high unemployment, lack of job security, lack of confidence by industry and small business. At a time when unity of purpose and interdepartmental cooperation are needed more than ever, it is foolish in the extreme to risk undermining the cohesion and professionalism of the Public Service. By weakening the ties that bind the Public Service-such as classifications, conditions and rates of pay and mobility between departments-and accentuating division and competition, the government is engineering the demise of the strong, unified, apolitical Public Service that has served Australia so well. On the face of it, that will not serve this government well. It is not in their interests. I suppose people would say, 'That is not particularly a concern of yours. If it does not serve this government very well, that is their problem.' But I do not think this undermining of the cohesion and professionalism of the Public Service is in the national interest. I not believe that the legislation, as structured, would give us the Public Service that Australians want. I accept that we need an amended, more contemporary Public Service Act and that needs to reflect the ethos, values and employment relationships. The patchwork quilt which has emerged over 75 years of amendment of the Public Service Act 1922 is not the framework for the 21st century Public Service, but my concern is that nor is the replacement. There is a high risk that departments will become personal fiefdoms, headed by secretaries hired more for their loyalty to the minister or government of the day than their professional qualifications and dedication to public service, and within departments personal loyalties are also likely to become significant determinants of advancement. As with the general tenor of measures taken by this government, particularly by the minister-not this minister, but the minister who was originally responsible for this legislation and who has worked so hard to earn the nickname Partisan Pete-this bill is directly against the interests of those who work in the Public Service in many ways. It is at its core a piece of legislation against the interests of the employees of the Australian Public Service in its underlying philosophy of all power to agency heads-the capacity to hire and fire at will and name their own price. The proposals for agency based workplace agreements will undermine the collective bargaining capacity of public servants. This will particularly disadvantage workers in the smaller agencies and those agencies singled out for higher efficiency dividends. It does seem to me that the government is confused between its industrial relations agenda and its Public Service agenda, and its industrial relations agenda has prevailed against the better interests of what would have served the Australian people in terms of a modem, contemporary Public Service and against the interests of public servants. A further irony of the provisions contained in this legislation is that, while the government may be simplifying the Public Service do Act, it is complicating the Public Service in the process. It is sowing the seeds of a complex and confusing mix of regulations, directions and instructions that will vary from department to department. It is creating a twotier service of executive agencies and core departments. It is creating multiple fiefdoms headed by powerful agency heads and, as a result, creating a confusing mishmash of pay scales and workplace conditions. The legislation, as I have already said, will also remove the mobility provisions of the Public Service Act. Right of re-entry to the Public Service is a condition of employment of many public servants in other forms of public employment. It would have been a vital factor in the decision of these public servants to take up their current positions. Mobility is also the mechanism which has been used to encourage public servants to take up positions in ministerial offices, for example. Governments of all political persuasions have benefited from this practice. The government is proposing to remove this condition of employment retrospectively by this legislation. Instead, it will become something that can be granted or denied at the whim of an agency head. We regard this as thoroughly unacceptable and will be moving an amendment to preserve the mobility rights of public servants who currently have them. Ultimately, what the public wants from the Public Service is the delivery of taxpayer funded services in the most efficient and effective way possible. The Australian Public Service has a proud record in this regard. I agree with the minister with regard to that matter. We do have a Public Service of which we can be proud, one which gets criticism it does not deserve and does not always get the defence it does deserve. I .am pleased to have the opportunity in speaking in this debate out of the proceedings of the JCPA and the minister's remarks to say that, as an elected representative, as a former minister and as a person who has been involved in public activities for a long time, I greatly value the contribution of the individual Australians who choose to work for their government as public servants and collectively for their contribution to our nation and to our democracy. We do have a proud record. It is a record which should be built upon and maintained. The problem is that the legislation tends not to take that record and maintain it and use it as a framework upon which to build. In fact, the outcome of this legislation risks undermining much of that which has made the Public Service so successful and effective. The opposition supports the concept of separate legislation for the parliamentary departments. As we are having a cognate debate, I will refer briefly to that legislation. We recognise the importance of maintaining the independence of the institution of the parliament. The tricky issue in that legislation is the proposal that the clerks be appointed for a la-year non-renewable term. It is not an easy issue to deal with. I am sure that, on both sides of this House, amongst Independents and minor parties in the Senate and among those who are students of and concerned with this matter there are views ranging from those who believe the arrangements should be no different to those for any other agency head to those who think something more akin to the existing arrangements should prevail. The opposition, like all those other bodies considering this matt-r, had a pretty vigorous debate about it. At the end of the day, we have decided that we will support the proposal that the clerks be appointed for a la-year non-renewable term. We believe that this is the proposal which will provide an appropriate and sufficient safeguard for their independence. The only other thing I wish to say about the Parliamentary Service Bill is that we will be seeking to amend it in ways which are consistent with our approach to the Public Service Bill as a whole. The unique aspect of it relates to that la-year non-renewable term. Our conclusion is that that is the appropriate way to proceed and we will therefore be supporting that proposal. In conclusion, the bills which are before us are not acceptable to the opposition in their current form. We will be seeking to amend them to remedy the defects we have identified. Perhaps in an air of unjustified pessimism I suspect that our amendments will not be successful in this chamber, in which case we will vote against the third reading. We will not vote against the second reading because we want the Public Service Act 1922 to be amended. We support that. We support some parts of the legislation. We want to be able to deal with our amendments. Similarly, we will attempt to persuade the Australian Democrats and Independent senators in the Senate of the risks of endorsing the government's proposal and the merits of our proposed amendments. We very much want to see those regulations concerning the Merit Protection Commissioner dealt with before the matter gets to the Senate, but we will deal with that in the consideration in detail stage here and then again when it gets to the Senate. If we are unsuccessful in achieving substantial changes to the bills in the Senate, we will again oppose them. In any event, we will be deferring a decision on our vote on the third reading of the bills in the Senate until the conclusion of the committee stage of debate in that chamber. I welcome the fact that we are having this debate and dealing with this legislation. It is an important matter and an important package of bills. It is an initiative in ing the legislation that the previous government and this government share. We do not, of course, share all views about all outcomes, but that is in the nature of the Westminster approach to politics and to public administration. There is nothing terrible about the fact that we review the same matters and come to different conclusions. We would live in a very strange democracy if that never happened. I welcome the fact that we have the legislation before us and that the JCPA was given the opportunity to give it such a comprehensive brief and that many of its amendments have been taken up, some of them in ways which we welcome, and we will therefore be supporting most of the government's amendments. I will deal with that in detail when we get to the consideration in detail stage. The opposition will be supporting most of those government amendments. We will be supporting the second reading. We will be moving our amendments, as briefly as we can, essentially en bloc in the House so that they are before the chamber and we can speak to them, but we do not seek to have divisions during the committee stage. If those amendments are not successful, we will be opposing the third reading of the bill here and then proceeding as I outlined in the Senate. Mr WA:KELIN (Grey) (12.30 p.m.)-I rise with pleasure to speak today on the Public Service Bill 1997. I note the comments of the member for Canberra and shadow minister (Mr MCMullan). I note particularly his comments about the need to strike a balance between the personal fiefdoms of ministers and the need to implement the will of the people through the elected government. As a regional member, it is to be regretted as a matter of national perspective that too often we think of Canberra as the place of the public servants. Public servants serve us as a nation all over Australia, in isolated parts of Australia as well as in the national capital and the metropolitan areas of Australia. So in my brief contribution today-and I, like the previous speaker, will not use myfull time. I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the Public Service, certainly in my time in this place and previously as a lay person in terms of reviewthe public domain. The perspective from time to time of the Public Service is that of an imbalance of power. That famous television series centred on Sir Humphrey Appleby in the British Public Service quite often draws out in a very humorous but, nevertheless, very practical way the dilemmas facing the balance between the parliament-the elected members and the executive-and those who serve in the Public Service. After nearly five years in this place, I have certainly drawn some strength from the Yes, Minister television program in coming to terms with my frustration in terms of what I believe are sometimes rather inflexible approaches to the problems of our country, certainly in the translation of the solutions to those problems through the Public Service. The other issue that I wish to raise in my preliminary comments this afternoon is the symbolism of the national capital. Those images should be positive images, ones of pride. The negative image that is too often portrayed and too easily used for rhetorical reasons should be put into greater balance. There is no doubt that in this country we suffer from the tyranny of distance, but there are many ways that that has been broken down by the various communications techniques that are available to us. It would be my hope that in the time ahead, with the help of this legislation, we may see a more positive, more practical and more dynamic contribution by the Public Service. It is very important that the integrity and the respect of our Public Service be protected. When there is even a sniff of corruption or malpractice within our public sector, it reflects on all of us and it reflects on our country at large. We can be proud in this country that we have very limited examples of that kind of malpractice which may bring disrepute. Integrity is something which is accepted as being very much a part of our public sector. The Public Service Bill 1997 has three other components-that is, the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997, the Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 and the Parliamentary Service (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997. The Public Service Act 1922 is now 75 years old. It has been amended more than 100 times. Its capacity to guide an effective Australian Public Service, serving the Australservants Ian public and national development, is in question. The act, as it stands, sets in legislative concrete values and practices that are historiexpresses cal rather than effective. For this reason, public servants themselves have sought in recent years to create workplace environments that can best serve the public rather than the act. Innovation is neglected and flexibility denied. The Public Service in Australia is a part of our economy. As the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) mentioned in his second reading speech, these Public Service reforms are part of the government's broader micro-economic reform agenda, an agenda that was ill served by the empty rhetoric of the previous government. The previous government did consider the kinds of reforms being debated here today. They held the reviews, they conducted the negotiations but, in the end, their allegiance to the Public Service unions outweighed the rights of taxpayers, the nation's economic health and, it should be noted, the interests of Australia's public servants. The good intentions of ministers such as Hon. Gary Johns were wasted in such an environment. This bill goes a long way towards putting those good intentions into practice. What is more, it goes a good deal further in providing not only an effective Public Service but also a service in which the public servants can take pride and have their talents and achievements recognised in workplaces where mutual interest and cooperation are paramount. The public interest too is enhanced by these reforms. The improvements to the status of the Public Service Commissioner and the increased parliamentary scrutiny will help ensure that there will be an adequate legislative basis for public accountability. Specifically, the bill does the following: it articulates the Public Service's ethos by stating the key APS values, including impartiality, merit and accountability; devolves most employment powers to agency heads, subject to the Workplace Relations Act; establishes a code of conduct to guide public in their work and dealings wi th the public; enhances the role of the Public Service Commissioner; requires agencies to introduce workplace diversity programs; anti-discrimination provisions; provides for internal and external review of workplace grievances; and provides, for the first time, new protection for whistleblowers. It should be noted that we are also debating this morning the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill crucial 1997. This amendment bill smooths the transitiC')fl from the 1922 act to the 1997 act in the interests of those who work in our Public Service. The issues addressed include the classification of APS employees, secretaries and the Public Service Commissioner himself or herself, leave without pay arrangements for staff taking up employment outside the APS and the need to allow processes such as promotions, appointments, transfers, et cetera which may have commenced prior to the passage of this bill to be completed. When we talk about the Australian Public Service, we often neglect to mention the special role played by those who keep this institution, the parliament, running. The the Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 provides for a separate parliamentary service to support the operations of this House and the other place. This bill is modelled on those reforms designated for the broader Public Service, whilst still recognising the important role of a separate parliamentary service. Nonetheless, employees of both the APS and the parliament will be provided with a degree of reciprocal mobility in employee transfers. Distinctions between the parliament and the APS do require some differences in administration. As such, this particular bill contains a statement of parliamentary service values and a code of conduct. The bill also provides for the creation of a post of Parliamentary Service Commissioner, who will have the task of advising presiding officers on management matters and will also have some investigative powers, and contains specific references to the clerks of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Tenure for those clerkships will be enshrined as a lO-year period, and I am pleased to note the support from the shadow minister. Secretaries will be appointed by the Speaker and the President for five-year terms, with similar arrangements to those applying to secretaries of executive departments. These reforms will help ensure that the parliament continues to be served by an effective, impartial parliamentary service. The current high service provided will continue into the future. Consequential factors from the passage of this bill will be addressed further by the Parliamentary Service (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997. These four bills represent considerable reforms to government in Australia. That they represent a continuation of a long-held recognition that the Public Service in Australia needs reform is obvious. This is no reflection on this nation's public servants. Many of those men and women are constituents whom I am proud to represent in this place. Those public servants who choose to serve their nation in areas of the electorate of Grey like Woomera, Ceduna, Port Augusta and others do so often at great costs to themselves. It is not an easy life to serve one's country in as remote a part of the country as, say, Woomera. That those who do so are often employed at the forefront of Australia's defence is all the more admirable. So it is not that the public servants have been found· wanting, rather those rules that guide them, but also bind them, have been found wanting. In fact, a driving force behind these reforms is a desire to recognise merit as a central principle of government administration. As part of this recognition, there will open advertising of Public Service positions, a move that will ensure the best possible service to the government and to the public. This legislation stems from a long-held belief in the need for reform, and its details are the product of prolonged and careful consideration and consultation. As the minister noted in June, the discussion paper Towards a best practice Australian Public Service generated much discussion last year, including 250 submissions. Focus groups attended by 1,500 people further generated discussion across the continent. Groups such as the Australian Democrats and the trade union movement have also contributed to these reforms. All who came to these discussions had one goal: the pursuit of the public interest. These discussions generated over 30 amendments to the original legislation. Furthermore, since June, this bill has also been examined by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and its fundamental reform agenda endorsed. In closing, I would like to draw attention to the efforts of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service (Dr Kemp) and the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) in bringing forth these reforms. I commend the bill to the House.",44
58,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"I rise to give support to the amendments to be moved by my colleague the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) and to oppose the Public and Parliamentary Service bills if these amendments are not passed. In doing so, I refer to the fact that the so-called intent of the legislation is to provide for the creation of a new and independent framework for the employment of staff in government departments. In that context, it is significant that, in their original form, these bills sought to delete the 75-year-old requirement for the Public Service 'to provide frank, honest, comprehensive, accurate advice to the government of the day'. I am pleased to say that, in some ways, the government has been pushed back with respect to its original intent to undermine the be thrust of that very important objective-'to provide frank, honest, comprehensive, accurate advice to the government of the day'. In that context, I give credit to members on both sides of the House because, clearly, if they had not stood up with respect to the original intent of the two ministers responsible for this bill, we would have been debating far more significant changes to the Public Service today than those currently before the House. The tradition of Public Service employees giving frank, honest and accurate advice without fear or favour is, to my way of thinking, an important tradition based on an important principle. If anything, it does not just to the principle of public service; it to the very fabric of the Australian democratic system-a principle more important today than ever before. At a time when individual values are dominant and communities are fragmenting, we need principles which go beyond narrow or mere commercial self-interest. The Labor Party may not always have liked the advice coming from the Public Service,but at least we were prepared to listen and debate the issues in a constructive and open way. I refer, in passing, to the famous Yes, Minister television series which was based on the frustrations experienced by a real life cabinet minister in a British Labour government over civil service opposition to his policies. They are as expressed in the diaries of Richard Crossman, a minister in the 1960s Wilson Labour government. In Australia, too, I might say, the Whitlam Labor government and other Labor governments have often had difficulty with particular Public Service departments-especially in more recent times, I might say, the Treasury and, in some instances, the failure by other departments which we would have expected more vision and strength from to actually stand up and counter the Treasury's view of life. This is about the independence of the Public Service. You do not necessarily always have to like the advice given to you by an independent Public Service, but you must always respect it, accept it and be wiIling to debate it. We have never sought to overturn the fundamental principle of an independent Public Service, which was the intent of the biIl before the House as originally drafted. We even kept John Stone on as Secretary to the Treasury after our election to the treasury bench in 1983. For some in the Labor Party, that was a big ask, to actually accept that John Stone-someone who, historically, is regarded as pretty close to governments of the other side of the House-retained his position after the election of 1983. That was a clear statement by this side of the House, the Labor Party, that we understood and respected the nature of independence in the Public Service, both with respect to independent advice from go departments and with respect to the question goes of individuals who held those positions in various departmental structures. I also believe that the Labor Party fostered the careers of some of Australia's greatest public servants for that very reason. Take Nugget Coombs and the other architects of Australia's great program of post-war reconstruction under the Chifley Labor government, a government which, I believe, all people across Australia have tremendous respect for, especially the nature of the Public Service and the advisers involved in that process of government. In their original intent, these bills sought to overturn the fundamental principle of an independent Public Service until the government was forced to retreat, in part because of opposition not only from this side of the House but also from its own backbenchers. I hope I can include the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) amongst those backbenchers. I await his speech with interest. Another action of the government is suppressing independent Public Service advice. These bills embody the Thatcherite, economically dry Liberal wing of the Liberal Party. They embody the cold, hard approach personified by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who I know is not a close ally of the member for Kooyong. After all, at least the member for Kooyong believes in a bit of independent advice and has a heart. They wade into the Public Service trying to impose purist free market principles, mindlessly indifferent to the fact that not all areas of social endeavour can be run on these lines. They clash with the better strand of Liberal Party tradition, and I do not include the member for Braddon and Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in this particular group. They clash with the conservative view which sees a role for public duty and which led to the formation of a civil service in the first place. Sir Lenox Hewitt, a very distinguished public servant, for that very reason made some very strong, critical comments to the Joint Committee on Public Accounts hearing on these bills. They were well reported, understood and respected in the wider community following the hearing of that Joint Committee on Public Accounts. He suggested that this government will destroy the Australian Public Service as a career prospect. It seems, for example, that within the Liberal Party people like the member for Goldstein, a Liberal Party apparatchik, or the member for Kooyong can have career prospects, but public servants who seek to devote their career to community service are not to be given such career prospects under the Howard government. The coalition government has made clear by its actions towards the Public Service since being elected that it is motivated by hate and has a small-minded, mean-fisted approach to government. It hates the idea of government being involved in employment at all. It has directly dismissed tens of thousands of public servants. There are varying estimates of the extent of the damage already done by the government's actions. When we talk about the dismissal of public servants, we are not just talking about the loss of jobs; we are talking about an attack on the very fabric of Australia and delivery of services to all Australians in a country of significant geographical area which requires a government in Canberra to be willing to invest in the provision of services through direct employment across its length and breadth. According to the notifications of job losses by portfolio in the Commonwealth government Gazette, some 30,000 departmental positions have gone or are going. Independent Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that there were already 62,100 less Commonwealth government employees in February of this year than one year earlier. When the combined Commonwealth and state government job losses are put together for the first 12 months of the Howard government, they amount to a staggering 80,000 jobs. That is, if anything, equivalent to the number of young people officially registered as unemployed in Australia today. So much for the commitment of this government and especially the commitment of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to the issue of jobs and overcoming the problem of unemployment that perhaps, unfortunately, may worsen in the foreseeable future as a result of events of recent days. More importantly-this is understood in the broader community but perhaps not in the government's benches-for every direct government job that has gone there has been a multiplier effect into the private sector, especially in local, regional economies. The closure of government offices in regions has had a devastating flow-on effect on local, private sector small businesses. Research for the government's own department of regional development before it was abolished, and which was reported to federal cabinet in July, shows that flow-on economic effects from the closure of regional offices can be up to double the direct impact. Presumably, this is exactly the kind of frank, honest, comprehensive and accurate advice which the government wanted to make illegal in its original intent. The hatred of the Liberal government towards government employment is nowhere better demonstrated than in the fiasco over the privatisation of the Commonwealth Employment Service. This privatisation was masterminded by none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the new Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. As is normally the case in this House, be it on aged care or on the privatisation of the CES, it is left to one of the other ministers to carry the can rather than the real decision makers standing up and copping the odium of the Australian community with respect to their mean-fisted decisions. On this occasion, it was left to one of the few women in the government's cabinetnone other than Senator Vanstone who, I might say in passing, is a far more intellectually honest politician than the person who replaced her in the cabinet and in portfolio responsibilities with respect to the issue of employment and training in Australia. She was left to carry the debate. She was left to carry out these mean-fisted decisions. For example, under the new arrangements, the definition of a real job for the purposes a placement by an employment placement enterprise is not whether it is a quality job with career prospects-and I might say that this is relevant to the issues before the House at the moment-or whether it is a full-time job, but simply whether it involves a government subsidy. According to the new government's definition, a clothing outworker being exploited at $3 per hour is doing a real job, but a community worker for a local council is not doing a real job because they are employed by government. In place of the Liberal Party's Public Service, I suggest that, on the return of the Labor Party to the government benches, we will continue to show respect for an independent Public Service that is dedicated to community involvement and service. There needs to be recognition that many areas of vitally needed work in our local communities and regions need direct government employment and involvement. The private profit motive by itself will not find the long-term unemployed a job. Nor will it care adequately for the needs of our children and our aged. There have been 80,000 jobs lost at Commonwealth and state government levels since March last year-80,000 young unemployed in Australia today. That is not a bad comparison as to this government's commitment to the provision of public service and the employment of our young people. I remind the House that, in days gone by, many of those entry level jobs that young people took up were actually through entry to the Public Service and a commitment by those people to serve the Australian community loyally and faithfully through a dedicated Public Service. Also, the private profit motive by itself will not build the physical and social infrastructure Australia needs for its future. These bills also make changes to the terms and conditions of public service employment. These changes are amicrocosm of what the Howard government is trying to do to employment across the Australian work force as a whole. In these bills, the Howard government seeks to break down equality of earnings between different government departments and agencies, just as it is trying to break of down equity of earnings across the Australian work force as a whole in its industrial relations reforms. I find it strange, for example, that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) goes around making speeches about how he wants to legislate for fairness with respect to small business yet, at the same time, he makes a speech about industrial relations and taking away the right to contest unfair dismissal for the little people out there-the right to argue, on the basis of fairness, whether they were rightfully or hatred of the wrongly dismissed. Equity of earnings between women and men, between younger and older workers and between well organised and less well organised groups of employees is the crux of the debate. In these bills, the Howard government is attacking job security for Public Service employees-yes, perhaps, security for the member for Kooyong, but not for an independent public servant seeking to provide decent advice to this government-just as it is undermining job security for so many other Australian workers. It is easy to see why the Howard government and, I might say, the member for Goldstein, in particular, wanted to legislate to remove requirements for honesty from anything to do with public service employment. Let us look at the government's own record of honesty when it comes to public service employment. Nearly every day under this government there is a new revelation of public sector job cuts. Nearly every day there is a new outrage. In the 1996 election campaign, John Howard, the current Prime Minister, said that there would only be 2,500 jobs lost from the Public Service. After the election, it rose to 15,000 and then to 30,000. I suppose that is John Howard's multiplier effect. In the Senate estimates processes, there were revelations of countless more indirect, deviously hidden job cuts yet to come. That is honesty in government from Honest John, the Prime Minister of Australia. In October 1996, Max 'the axe' MooreWilton, the person the Prime Minister put in charge of his department, said that the Commonwealth Public Service could be cut from the approximately 130,000 who remained there to just 50,000 by the turn of the century. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) then announced that he was looking for more cuts to come. In other words, more and more nails in the coffins of young Australians' employment opportunities-those very important entry level jobs to the Public Service-and the hopes of a lot of communities and parents around Australia. Ever since, the government has proceeded down the path of slashing and burning jobs, which is one of the main reasons why the total number of full-time jobs in Australia has actually gone backwards since the first Howard government budget of August 1996. The public sector is one of the main places where young Australians have traditionally found jobs and career prospects-their hopes for the future, their reward for committing themselves to education and training and their commitment to putting in and expecting a return from the government of the day. By abolishing so many public sector jobs, the Howard government has directly increased unemployment. It has directly undermined the future employment prospects of our young people-the future of Australia, the future leadership of this great country. It is stealing from future generations far more than it would be by investing more public funds to help expand our economy for the future. These bills express the hatred which the Kemps, the Howards and the Max MooreWiltons have for public sector employment. Labor, I suggest, has a very different view. We have a vision of and a commitment to achieving full employment. Integral to this is an expanded role for appropriate government funded jobs, expansion to meet the needs of local communities for community development and physical and social infrastructure new human services and new environmental programs. We need to directly address areas of particularly hard-hit unemployment through additional publicly funded jobs, involving meaningful and rewarding work in areas of unmet community needs. These bills are not about a new and independent Public Service. These bills are about the Howard government's intent to spitefully cut back jobs and suppress good ideas for Australia's future public policy. That is what this government is about: a spiteful attack on the Public Service. Just think about the Department of Administrative Services and how it has been handled by the Howard government in recent weeks, and the spiteful manner in which the Howard government set out to destroy the careers of decent public servants. The Howard government destroyed the careers of decent public servants: people who had committed themselves to free and independent advice; people who were prepared to stand up in an honest way and seek to ensure that there was accountability and a sense of independence and honesty in government. The Australian Public Service is an icon. It is something which past governments, irrespective of their political persuasion, have defended and sought to maintain as an independent area of advice-an area in which you debated ideas and sought the best solutions to the major problems confronting Australia. Since last year's election, department after department, and even the Department of the House of Representatives, has been attacked by the Howard government. This is a slash and bum policy aimed at undermining independence, at ripping away at good policy in Australia and at putting in place, in essence, a government of mediocrity, a government bereft of ideas and a government whose own backbench had to bring it to heel with respect to the very bill before the House. The intent of the bill before the House is to rip away integrity in government, and honesty and independence from the Public Service. Well might the parliamentary secretary hold his head in shame, because he is one of the for architects of a small group of mean-fisted, small-minded people who put this strategy in place. Mr Miles-You are a fraud.",51
59,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"That is what it is: a fraud by those on the other side of the House when they seek to stand up and talk about independence and honesty in government. We need a free and independent public service. We need good policy and a willingness by departmental representatives and independent public servants to stand up for the betterment of Australia and demand accountability for government, irrespective of who occupies the treasury bench. That is what the debate is about. (Time expired)",56
60,Mr GEORGIOU,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"Kooyong) (1.02 p.m.)Australia has always been confronted by change. It has been confronted by substantive change, new fashions, novel catchphrases and a variety of fads. Today we have globalisation, privatisation, outsourcing, deregulation, contracting out and private sector best practice. But, amidst all this fluidity, there are some bedrock political realities. One reality is that the federal government, whichever party rules, is the body that the Australian people look to for their nation's sense of purpose and direction. The federal government is the single most powerful entity in our society, and the government's actions and inactions do not just set the parameters within which our society operates. To use a somewhat archaic phrase: they do set the course of the Australian nation's destiny. The second reality is that the quality of governance the federal government provides is only partly determined by the representatives elected by the people. Despite the many stirling but all too often unrecognised attributes of politicians, the quality of governance that politicians deliver depends on the calibre of their bureaucracy. Politics has few certainties, but one of them is that the Commonwealth bureaucracy will continue to serve the Australian public and the national interest beyond the life of any particular government. Accordingly, the Public Service Bill 1997 is not just another of the so many important pieces of legislation put before this House. It is not just about private sector notions of efficiency and effectiveness-important as these are. This bill is about an institution unique traditions and values, and basic responsibilities and accountabilities to Australia's government, parliament and people. However, important values and traditions are not invincible, as exemplified by Winston Churchill's brutal dismissal of the traditions of the Royal Navy as nothing but 'rum, sodomy and the lash'. The fact is that jokes, stereotypes, resentments and misunderstandings about the Australian Public Service are legion and for over a decade the Australian Public Service, along with the rest of Australian society, has been severely buffeted. I must say that I was touched by the members opposite painting an idealised picture of the Public Service under the Hawke and Keating governments. Some of us actually do remember what happened. The so-called bureaucratic mandarins have been attacked; the public service ethos, effectiveness and efficiency have been criticised, downsizing has been continuous and departmental changes incessant. But underlying all this is a fundamental reality that we should recognise that throughout the history of the Federation the Commonwealth bureaucracy has served Australia with talent, dedication and distinction. The contribution of the Public Service to the shape, size, achievements and accomplishments of the Australian nation has been massive. The Public Service Bill 1997 is intended to supplant the Public Service Act 1922. That act has, for much of its existence, served Australia well. However, the consensus is now universal that, despite multiple amendments, and possibly because of multiple amendments, the 1922 act is not adequate for the demands of the 21 st century, and a new act is necessary. In government, the opposition shared in this consensus. Labor set up the MCLeod review of the Public Service and accepted many of its recommendations, but it did not actually get around to introducing a new public service bill into the parliament. The present government moved quickly, consulted widely and, having brought the bill into the House, referred it to the Joint Committee of Public with Accounts for review. The JCPA's advisory report on the bill maintained the committee's tradition of straightforward advice. The committee endorsed replacing the 1922 act, and supported the 1997 bill's simplification, modernisation and more accessible format. It also identified areas where the bill could be improved by making some 20 recommendations and a number of observations. The committee's recommendations included strengthening the APS values in the bill and the reference to merit as a fundamental APS principle, enhancing the scrutiny of agency workplace diversity programs and addressing mobility rights for parliamentary departments and the staff of members of parliament. The shadow minister for public administration, Senator Faulkner, who came onto the JCPA especially to consider the Public Service Bill, initially doubted both 'the minister's motives' in referring the bill to the JCPA and 'the thoroughness of the scrutiny that the bill was likely to receive' because the government 'had the numbers on the committee'. Eventually, his doubts about a thorough scrutiny were dispelled and he congratulated the JCPA 'on the comprehensive and professional way it went about its work'. Nonetheless, Senator Faulkner, like some of his colleagues in this House, still felt compelled to fire a couple of politically partisan parthian arrows, saying that the JCPA's report was a 'slap in the face for the government', and that he was sure that the JCPA's government members wanted fewer recommendations that were actually contained in the report. Of course, neither is the case. But let us forget the good senator's partisan byplay. The important thing is that the JCPA did produce an objective report supported by all its members and the government has announced its acceptance of the JCPA's recommendations. This should dispel Senator Faulkner's purported doubts about the government's bona fides. I would also commend an understanding of this to the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). The bill covers a large number of issues and I can highlight only some key ones. The first issue is the one of advice, which has been raised on a number of occasions in this debate. There were substantial concerns that the bill would erode the quality of APS advice. From my perspective, nothing in our system of government is more precious or more fragile than good advice. Occasionally, I speculate whether there is a Gresham's law of advice with bad advice tending to drive out the good. But it is the province of science to discover laws; politicians are restricted to making them. And, as a politician, I am comfortable about saying that good advice is often uncomfortable. Good advice may cut across the grain of policy commitments that will not work or undermine apparent short-term political advantage that will boomerang in the longer term. Good advice occasionally contradicts the predispositions of superiors and, by so doing, it can, unfortunately, bruise their egos. Good advice is essential to good government and the concern to protect good advice is not only legitimate but, I believe, imperative. Some of those appearing before the JCPA testified in quite dramatic terms that changes in the position of secretaries and others would mean the end of so-called frank and fearless advice. There was debate over whether advice was a matter of character or of tenure. Personally, I have long believed that, ultimately, advice is a matter of character, but this is probably the overhang of a youth misspent as an untenured adviser. I am now old enough and ugly enough to admit that it is probably easier to express one's character through good advice if one is not subject to sanctions, particularly the sanction of quick termination. However, the departmental secretaries' tenures effectively ended in 1983. They were ended when the Hawke government made the change to contract employment. The bill does transfer the appointment and termination of agency heads formally from the Governor General to the Prime Minister, and in this respect the JCPA concluded that: . .. the Bill reflects the reality that ... [the appointment and termination of Secretaries] rests with the Prime Minister of the day and therefore supports the proposed changes. Legislatively, guaranteeing good advice is impossible, but it is, however, the responsibility of government to encourage and support the culture and ethos and provide the incentives for the bureaucracy to give the best advice. A government writing a new public service act has a particular responsibility to specify the quality of the advice expected from the Australian Public Service. In this respect, the bill can be improved because its only description of the quality of advice expected of the Public Service is 'timely'. Under questioning, some current secretaries advised the JCPA that going beyond timeliness was unnecessary. I must say that this threw me a bit, because timeliness is not next to godliness, and there are more important requirements than this when giving legislative expression to the quality of advice the APS is expected to offer. Indeed, in a hierarchy such as the APS, which it still remains, particularly given that the Public Service Bill concentrates even more power in the hands of secretaries, it is important that the quality of good advice be specified. The APS needs to be given a clear legislative signal that governments expect all public servants to give frank, honest, comprehensive, accurate and, of course, timely advice. It is an indication of this government's commitment to the importance of the APS advice that it is moving amendments to the bill embodying this. A couple of further comments should also be made about Public Service values in the bill. There was a concern that the accountability of the APS be fully defined as being within the framework of ministerial responsibility to the government, the parliament and the public. The JCPA did recommend accordingly and the government is making the appropriate amendments. Much has been made of the fact that the Public Service Bill for the first time provides for an explicit statutory reference to the merit principle. The reference to merit in the bill was not, however, accompanied by a legislative definition of merit, and the JCPA recommended one be included and the government is moving on this front. The clauses in the bill relating to streamlinPublic ing of APS review mechanisms generated very substantial contention. The Public Service and Merit Protection Commission and the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business submitted that: There is a belief that the APS suffers from a grievance mentality. This appears to be a long standing malaise ... This view is not necessarily the sole province of academics but has credence amongst many Human Resources practitioners, for example, a senior officer remarked that ' ... perhaps today too many staff think in terms of rights and entitlements and not enough in terms of obligations and responsibilities.' It may be that I have not quite mastered the Anglo-Saxon art of understatement, but it seems to me that there are a few too many phrases such as 'appears', 'it is believed', 'not necessarily' and 'perhaps' in this passage for the assertions about a Public Service grievance mentality to be absolutely compelling. The methodological disputes between the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission and the Merit Protection Review Agency over the costs of current appeal processes and comparisons with private sector best practice are complex, but at the end of the day they are not totally to the point. The real bottom line is that a strong and widespread consensus does exist that the grievance and appeal procedures of the existing Public Service Act do need revision. The public interest does require streamlining and we need to reduce the costs of appeals procedures consistent with fair and transparent review processes. As usual, the general consensus about streamlining and cost saving becomes a lot muddier when we come to specifics. A large number of reservations have been expressed about this section of the bill and the accompanying draft regulations. The Public Service's external and independent review mechanisms are of substantial importance, and the bill did involve a major change in the review system. The MPRA is to be abolished and the Public Service Commissioner was initially to be the external reviewing authority. As the Public Service Commissioner pointed out, this represents a significant shift because, although it provides for external review through the Service Commissioner and is quite clear about the grounds for review and what action is and what action is not reviewable, it does not allow the external review authority to overturn the decision of the primary decision maker. A commissioner not satisfied with a response to his recommendations must advise the agency head, and include details of the recommendation and any other relevant information in a report to the agency minister in the commission's next annual report, or make a separate commission report to the parliament. There were understandable concerns about whether the Public Service Commissioner, who is a member of the management advisory committee comprising departmental secretaries, would be seen to be totally impartial in judging the actions of his management advisory committee colleagues. It is of central importance that the impartiality and the independence of the external reviewer be clear. Various options were put about how this could be achieved. The JCPA thought that a sensible solution to this complex issue was having a public service commissioner and a merit protection commissioner operating within one administrative organisation, but having separate statutory powers. The government's amendments will implement this. It still needs to be said, however, that the bill's termination of the external reviewer's capacity to actually overturn primary decisions remains a substantial change. This is consistent with the government's commitment to giving secretaries the maximum flexibility to manage their workplaces. The other side of the coin to flexibility accountability. For this to be met, the independent review body will have to be very robust in reporting to the parliament on cases where secretaries choose not to implement its recommendations. This is of great significance and I do expect that the parliament will be monitoring such reports very closely to see that what is intended actually does occur. The JCPA was also concerned with regulations dealing with the review of Australian Public Service employment actions and recommended that they be redrafted in a way which is simple, clear and concise. As the minister has indicated, I understand this is to be done. Finally, I would like to touch briefly on the bill and the issue of workplace diversity. The bill states that the APS provides a workplace which is free from discrimination and recognises the diverse backgrounds of the APS. Agency heads are required to establish a workplace diversity program giving effect to this. There will also be a commissioner's direction setting out the requirements of the diversity program. These are important but broad legislative commitments and to be effectively implemented there needs to be adequate internal and external evaluations of outcomes and appropriate reporting on achievements and shortfalls to the minister and to the parliament. The JCPA made a number of recommendations relating to the required level of adequacy and transparency and the government has adopted them. The Public Service Bill 1997, together with the changes proposed by the JCPA and accepted by the government, will, I believe, substantially strengthen the ability of the APS to discharge its responsibilities to the government, to the parliament and to the public in the 21 st century. The bill sets out the codes and values of the Public Service as a set of enforceable standards and expectations and does make them uniquely accessible to the public and, I think, accessible to a lot more public servants. It creates a more flexible environment in which secretaries really do have the capacity to is manage their departments and will provide appropriate external and independent appeals mechanisms for public servants. The bill does this while preserving the key elements of the Public Service's values, ethos and traditions which are prized by individual members of the APS and which have enabled the service to make such a great contribution to Australia. I would like to acknowledge the work done by the JCPA and the secretariat. I compliment the government, the minister and the Public Service Commissioner for their openness and responsiveness to the report of the JCPA. I commend the bill to the House.  start where the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) finished. I commend the work of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts. If I have a minor criticism, it is that I wish they would think of sexier titles than report 353. With that qualification, I appreciate the good work that the committee and the secretariat put into this report, and they are to be commended for that. I think no member of parliament or member of the community would oppose the simplification and modernisation of the Public Service Act. Clearly, the shadow spokesmen has indicated the thrust of our general support for that. I wanted to start off a little differently in my contribution to this debate on the Public Service Bill 1997 because I am a former public servant. Notwithstanding that, I think that all too often we forget the important role of the Public Service-that is, they are the administrators and the deliverers of those things that governments seek to do. It does not matter whether we are talking about taxation, social security, defence or a whole range of other things. They are always vulnerable to attack and politically we take quite a few cheap shots at them. I commend them for the very honourable tradition that they uphold. We also need to take into account that, for some years now, the Public Service has operated in an environment of staff ceilingsthey go back to the Whitlam days--efficiency dividends, special efficiency dividends and budget cuts. Increasingly, we are asking them to look to private enterprise as some sort of model and adopt all the procedures that private enterprise does-forgetting the special responsibility they have to fairness and equity in the way they carry out their business. I made the point to the former head of the Prime Minister's department, Mike Keating, that one of the problems with pushing for increased productivity and increased efficiency and operating with smaller budgets is that we can become more efficient and effective but actually lose sight of the goal which we are trying to achieve. We get a tick for efficiency. We get a tick for accountability. But as far as customer service and people being able to access the service goes, we lose hands down. A classic case of that is the Department of Social Security telephone information service. I have no doubt that it is more efficient and more effective and that people are churning through inquiries at a rate of knots. What it completely ignores is that there are a whole range of citizens out there who are absolutely intimidated and threatened by the whole process. They are not able to use a keypad to flick through the proper options and to finally get through to the correct area for an answer to their question. I flipped out one day myself, I apologise, because I got so frustrated using the same mechanism. We can adopt all of the Public Service models but fail miserably on customer service. I do not want to take a cheap shot at the banks, heaven forbid, but look at the banks. They are withdrawing from face-to-face contact with their customers, they are closing branches at a rate of knots and they are almost embarrassed about dealing face-to-face with their customers. This is not a good model for the Public Service. I am putting in a plug for all members of parliament to acknowledge that under difficult circumstances, under a rapidly changing environment, under considerable budgetary and staff pressure by successive governments, by and large the Public Service has done the right thing. I notice that the bill addresses the accountability of public servants and a code of conduct. This is terribly important. It is no good having codes of conduct unless they are known not only to those within the Public Service but also to clients of the particular department. Again, you may feel that I am a little critical of the joint committee, but when we look at issues like the accountability of public servants we need to start specifying what the rights of clients are. For example, is it the government's view that a citizen, in dealing with a department and a departmental officer, has the right to know who that officer is? If any government member wants to rush back and say to me, 'Oh, yes but of course we do', I would tell them that that is not the case today. There is not a situation where you have the right to know . You do not even have the right, by the way, to contact your local Centrelink office or DSS office, as I have mentioned before. While I can accept that pooling calls via queuing system is efficient, I still think constituents who deal with the department or Centrelink ought to have the right to the number of the local branch as well as the right to deal with an accountable and responat sible officer. This is not the most efficient the most productive way of organising your different. team. It comes with some cost. We now have to start factoring in that if we are giving citizens rights then it may cost some more. In a democracy, in an environment in which we are proud of human rights and the rights which our citizens enjoy, this is a cost of government which is well worth paying. If anything, the rights of citizens are being eroded as this administration has gone on. Certainly, I do not think that we were perfect in government, but the wholesale attack on Public Service numbers and extraordinary efficiency dividends has now exacerbated that situation for ordinary citizens. I hope that when the Senate comes to consider this bill, more. when they look at this issue of accountability and a code of conduct for public servants, which I strongly support, they will also look at perhaps a charter of rights for citizens. I can give you another example. It is only a minor thing, but in the Child Support that Agency it has always been the case that the agency can make act of grace payments where the agency has made an error. The real parliament problem is that the clients of the agency never know about it or hitherto have not known about it. If you have clients of Public Sermembers vice departments who are ignorant of what they can apply for, then it is virtually having the provision at all. That is why it really important that you not only have this accountability through a code of conduct but also have citizens rights enshrined in a public service act, and well publicised so that citizens are equally knowledgeable. This act does deal in a limited way with mobility for parliamentary departments under the MOPS Act, but I think the issue of bility is so much bigger than that. I think would all agree that Canberra is a wonderful and a beautiful city, and I certainly enjoy coming down here to do my work as a member of parliament. But I think it is also ima portant that Canberra based public servants that get some idea of what I could call the real cities are like, particularly the western suburbs of Sydney or the western suburbs of Melbourne. No doubt the parliamentary secretary the table, the member for Braddon (Mr or Miles), would say Tasmania. They are very Mr Tony Smith-Dickson.  feature very prominently somehow in the next 12 months. If we do not have that mobility, if we do not give public servants some operational experience, then they can tend to very much live in a cocoon. There is an enormous cost and there is an enormous differential for a public servant living in Canberra and then moving to other capital cities. I do not have a perfect way of overcoming it, but I think the lack of overcoming that problem leads to an enormous longer term cost. Therefore, I believe we should be encouraging this much In terms of cutbacks and given that the parliamentary departments are also mentioned in this bill, I wanted to say how saddened I was that the Liberal government hacked $10 million off the parliamentary budget. I guess if I were speaking out in my electorate I would get very little sympathy for this. Let me say that I think, in the main, members of are as good as their support staff, whether that is in their electorate or in the committee system. I the point in terms of of this House of Representatives that if we were congressmen in the United States like not Congress, every member would have a is minimum staff of 18. I do not argue that we should have a staff of 18, but what I do say is that, if we were to provide additional staff to members of parliament there is no doubt all that, overwhelmingly, the members would be able to utilise the staff very effectively. The power of the executive-that is, the ministers of the government-has increased enormousmoly, and the only way to redress that is to we strengthen the countering institutions. I believe our democracy as a whole, if not the government as well, would be immeasurably strengthened by having greater staff numbers for members of parliament. I have often spoken about the parliamentary committees in this place. I think they are the one source of credibility out there in voter land and make this institution more relevant. Indeed, as other speakers have said and as I have said, the basis of this debate is not only the legislation but also a very good committee report. If we are looking at staffing structures, committees were the first ones that were hit. In other words, we did not reduce the number of committees and we did not lessen their responsibilities, but we took more staff off them. The staffing ratios were reduced. This really is an attack on that institution and an attack on the counterbalance to the power of the executive. I have previously suggested that this parliament ought to show the way in the way in which it staffs its committees. Not only should we have the permanent staff that we already do, but I sincerely believe we should develop a system of internships or apprenticeships for university graduates. So we would offer modest contracts, traineeships or whatever you want to call them, to very bright, young university students for no more than 18 months. They would work within the committee structure. They would be the fresh, young, enthusiastic, bright brains of the committees, and I think they would give committees extra strike power in the important work that they do. It saddens me that, notwithstanding all the changes we are discussing today, we are not discussing that about parliamentary departments. I have to say again that there is a case for increased mobility of the permanent staff within Parliament House. I think it is the case that you can benefit from a degree of mobility. Incidentally, lest someone interjects that perhaps members of parliament should have a greater degree of mobility, I just remind them that the triennial shareholders meetings that we face in this place tend to exact a greater degree of mobility than is unanimously felt is necessary amongst members of parliament-none more so than at the last election. While we are talking about the Public Service, I want again to remind members that the Ombudsman has consistently reported that many of our fellow Australian citizens, and quite a number of small businessmen, are missing out on the redress afforded by the Ombudsman because she does not have the jurisdiction to track the dollars. What does all that mean? It means that we are contracting out a lot of the work of the Public Service. When you contract out, you do not immediately give the clients of the Public S&vice the same rights of appeal that every citizen has to the Ombudsman. I think it is very important that this parliament rectify that legislatively. It is a matter of regret to me that the two principal institutions of human rights in this country, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Ombudsman, have both taken phenomenal hits as far as budget cuts are concerned. This only demonstrates the old adage that departments with portfolio responsibilities for other agencies are always keen to offer up much greater cuts to those other agencies than they themselves would be prepared to accept. That is true of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and of the Attorney-General's Department in this case that I have mentioned. Whistleblowers are mentioned in the report. The committee is expressing concern and recommending that we need to see greater legislative protection for those public servants who come across fraud and maleficence. I think the whole issue of whistleblowers is an important one, but we cannot expect that public servants will put their careers on the line without sufficient legislative protection. I regret to say that there is example after example where whistleblowers have come forward and have suffered dramatically in terms of their career or their employment. I think this is a particularly unhealthy situation and one that needs to be redressed as soon as possible. I wanted to sum up by saying that, so far as I am concerned, I do welcome the fact that we are reforming the Public Service Act, bringing it up to modern days with much simpler language. If there is one thing you really miss in opposition, it is the impartial, objective advice that you were privileged to receive from the Public Service when you were in government. I do not think government members have any idea of the impact of that. Not having that advice does make you feel terribly isolated. I was always very privileged in the relationships I had with departments or with the ADF. I can never say that they always agreed with me, but we always had a good discussion about it. We always recognised and believed that they were giving very honest, impartial advice. I think in a democracy without a Public Service capable of giving that, or encouraged to give that, you really do have a second-rate Public Service. Like other opposition members, I will be supporting the amendments that will be that moved by our shadow minister, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan).",56
61,Mr TONY SMITH,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"I am pleased to support the Public Service Bill 1997 and associated bills. Before speaking about these bills, I will endorse some comments by the honourable member  to his suggestion about staff for members of parliament. I can imagine that is not a popular point to make in the community. If it were discussed across the country in the context of the need to employ young people in a position where they can learn an awful lot about how the system works and about how busy an electorate office can be, as well as provide them with some opportunity to commence a career-albeit perhaps in the Public Service or even in industry, following on from working for a member of parliament-I think that should be encouraged. I am puzzled by the structure of our electorate offices, where we have three staffers each employed on a salary ranging between $31,000 and $35,000. Each backbencher has three people employed within that salary range, yet there are- so many jobs in an electorate office that involve quite menial and repetitive activity. These jobs would be a good start for juniors. If members of parliament were allowed to employ an extra staffer-that is, a junior, who has just left school and who is looking for work-I think it would be a great message to send to the community. There would certainly be no shortage of work that they could do in a member's office, and it would also send an important message. I have employed juniors, young kids who have left school, on a work experience basis in my own electorate. I am pleased to say that I have a pretty good record of having those juniors going on to find work. I am very pleased to see that that has occurred. I think that by giving them that start-many of them have seized the opportunity although they have not been paid-they have been able to progress. I can think of one person in particular, Michael Atkinson, who has progressed. He is now working for Boral and has a very good position. He worked unstintingly and untiringly for me for some months in my office on a completely voluntary basis. So I give a gentle message to the executive about that: we should look very seriously at employing juniors. It would give members' offices a greater balance. Also, if it were explained to the community, I do not think the people in the community would have much opposition to it. I will now tum to the bill itself. I should say by way of preface that in my electorate I have considerable numbers of public servants, both state and federal. From time to time, in the period that I have been a member, I have received a number of representations on a number of different issues. One thing we should bear in mind when any change is foreshadowed is that it is important that we explain that change and that we consult widely. I am pleased to sec that, in relation to this particular measure, wide consultation with representatives and Public Service employees and individuals, as well as the ACTU, has taken place. It is important to consult for the reason that there are obviously concerns about changes, work security and what is going to happen. That particular area of concern has been brought to my attention recently in the Australian Taxation Office, where changes have been foreshadowed. There is concern out there amongst my constituents, particularly for workers at a lower level, about the explanation for those changes. In recent times I have spoken to a number of workers at that very low leveland I do not use that term disparagingly-in the Australian Taxation Office who are concerned about their future. At the rung where people basically do administrative assistant-type work, there is concern about future of their jobs-and I understand that. Many of these people have been in the Public Service for many years. A couple of people who hav- come to see me recently have service that collectively adds up to a period of just over 50 years between them. They have been in the Public Service all this time, and they are now something like 10 years from retirement age. They are very concerned about proposals for change-and understandably so. I have spoken to them at length, and I have consulted with the Minister for Workplace  about this matter. We will continue to advise and consult with the relevant groups. I understand that that process is a difficult one to work through but, over time, I believe that the arrangements that will be made will be fully explained, that there will be full consultation and that a very sensitive approach will be taken, especially to those who are concerned about their security, and particularly to those for whom the Public Service has become their life. I respect those members of the Public Service because they have worked very, very hard. They have worked unstintingly and unselfishly, and they have been committed to their jobs in a lifetime way. For many of them, that is all that they have ever done, and I think that that commitment and that determination to serve, no matter what government is in power, has to be respected by governments when looking at any changes. The Public Service Bill itself is intended replace the current legislative framework for the establishment and management of the Public Service. It is a key element of the government's Public Service reform agenda which is being implemented within the framework of the Workplace Relations Act. The government considers that the Public Service should operate to the maximum extent consistent with its public responsibilities, but under the same industrial relations and employment arrangements that apply to the rest of the work force. I think that that is fair enough. The current legislative framework for the Public Service contained in the old Public the Service Act 1922 is riddled with unnecessary prescription and detail. It has been amended piecemeal more than 100 times since its enactment, it creates a regulatory environment and an emphasis on process which is inconsistent with contemporary management philosophy, and it acts as an inhibitor to innovation and best practice. This has in fact led to critical comment about the act, and in particular to arguments that it has become excessively complex and fragmented. Its language and organisational layout continue to reflect the climate of a previous age with central regulation of employment decisions, and results in an Australian Public Service which is rule bound and risk averse, with personnel matters being much more expensive than best practice in the private sector. Many jokes have been made over the years about that, and I think public servants have borne the brunt of that. Some of it is quite unjustified, I might say, but some of it is justified because of the unnecessary fragmentation and complexity. The bill is designed to address a number of those problems and deficiencies, and in particular areas such as the character and purpose-the ethos-of the Public Service being clearly defined. Likewise, there will be an acknowledgment of the need for a non-partisan and apolitical Public Service. There will be a prohibition on ministerial directions to agency heads in relation to individual Public Service staffing decisions, except in areas where this is allowed-for example, with the engagement of permanent heads. to There will be a clear statement of the principle of merit, which I think is also a good thing. There will be a statutory code of conduct, where again there have been some difficulties. Last year there was some legislation in relation to problems that arose in respect of particular peculiarities in legislation which effectively prevented a person who was on leave without pay from being dealt with for a breach of conduct, and legislation had to be introduced to deal with that specifically. That was an anomaly in the old legislation. There are a number of other things, including specific provision for the Public Service Commissioner to report through the minister to parliament, and also provision for an independent review of employment decisions by a merit protection commissioner. I have mentioned consultation. There were about 100 groups who were consulted. As I said before, these involved public servants, state and territory government representatives, management consultants, unions and academics. There were a number of seminars conducted, and more than 1,500 people were involved in those. So all of these consultations were used to develop the proposals for reform. The legislation before the House is more ambitious and bolder than envisaged by the previous government. The Public Service Bill, together with the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill, replaces not only the old Public Service Act but also the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984. The act itself is quite short, really, having regard to the fact that it succeeds an amorphous piece of legislation and enactments and regulations. It contains only about five per cent of the words of the existing legislation and is written in a very contemporary style. It will provide a framework for Public Service employment which achieves an optimal balance between improved accountability and devolved responsibility so as to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the service. It seeks to ensure that the service is able provide both better policy advice to government and higher quality services to the community. Ultimately, this will enable the more effective and efficacious use of Commonwealth resources; greater responsiveness to the government in providing timely advice in implementing the government's policies and programs; and a fair, effective, impartial and courteous service to all Australians, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Chifley. Generally speaking, in my electorate office in Dickson I get a number of complaints about Public Service-type matters, such as social security. But the complaints are more about problems of process than individual examples of rudeness. The latter are fairly rare. When complaints have been made of that nature, obviously I have dealt with them fairly expeditiously. But, generally speaking, they have not been about the way individual members of the service have performed or about the way they have spoken to members of the public. That should be put on the record because sometimes there is a lot of exaggeration in the community about the way public servants speak. Their job is not an easy one at all. I think generally there is a greater expectation out in the community for more and more services from the Public Service. They have to work within a framework. They cannot perform miracles. I think it is fair to say that at times maybe we all ask a bit too much of them. We must remember that they are doing their best, and sometimes in quite difficult circumstances. The legislation goes on to talk about a number of other areas which I cannot cover in the time available to me. It is important, though, to refer to the fact that the bill provides for far greater freedom for public servants to manage their own workplaces. I think this is important. I feel that this shows great innovation in this area. The industrial relations system in this country has been transformed by the Workplace Relations Act, and it is important to incorporate those reforms into employment practices within the Public Service-that is, as I said before, to to put the Public Service on a similar footing to the private sector. Already, that is taking place. Recently we heard the minister speaking about that in relation to an enterprise agreement. The half-hearted enterprise bargaining introduced to the Public Service by the previous government foundered on central control and third party negotiation. That was the problem, and that is the problem that the Workplace Relations Act has sought to redress in the wider community. But, with its application to the Public Service, I think it is an important step forward in a uniform application of those principles across the public and the private sectors. The minister had lengthy meetings with the ACTU and public sector unions about this matter. After those meetings he responded with about 30-odd changes to the original draft. So it is important to recognise that there have been adequate consultations. There have been considerable efforts put in by the minister to ensure that the bills before the House reflect those concerns but at the same time implement the government's policy on this important area. It was interesting to note that one message that emerged in the discussions that the minister had with groups of public servants and public sector unions was the wish to ensure that the traditional ethos, conduct and values of the Public Service were preserved. In my submission the bill does that, and indeed it reinforces those values in a way that has not been done before. In summary, I will not support the amendments to be moved. I support the bills and commend them to the House.",63
62,Mr GRIFFIN,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"We are here today to consider the Public Service Bill, which has been proposed by the government. As a member of the opposition, I support the of the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), and reject the government position as it currently stands. As the Deputy Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, I, together with other members of this House and also the Senate, had this bill referred to us to consider what was in the bill and what in fact could be done to improve it to make it a more effective reform of the Public Service. I would say that in the circumstances a good report was produced. The recommendations of that report were unanimous. But, as has been referred to by other speakers, there are a number of areas of serious disagreement. The committee took the view in the circumstances that perhaps it was best to concentrate on those areas where there was agreement on what might be done to make changes, rather than going to those other issues where in fact there was vehement disagreement, although some of them are referred to in the report. When I am able to come back after question time and the MPI, I will consider some of those issues in more detail. The fact of the matter is that there are some real issues here. When we look at the government's attitude on this particular issue, we see it couched in terms which seem superficially acceptable-in fact, even desirable. The nature of the change principally is about simplification. Simplification is something which the government supports, as does the opposition. But, beyond simplification, we are seeing other changes occurring. We talk about efficiency, we talk about effectiveness, but in the circumstances what we are doing is destroying the nature of the Public Service. The Public Service has served this country well for many years. The situation is that we are looking at changes which will undermine the independence of public servants and put them in a situation where they are at the behest of the government to an even greater extent than they are today. When we look at what this government has done to the Public Service in the year and a half they have been in government, we can see what their real agenda is. From their own figures, 30,000 jobs have been cut.",66
63,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 10 I A, The debate will be resumed at a later hour, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",66
64,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government will be absent from question time today because he continues to be unwell. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. Mark Vaile, will answer questions on Mr Somlyay's behalf. I welcome back the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. COOMBS, DR HERBERT COLE 'NUGGET': DEATH",66
65,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to inform the House that I have just learnt of the death of Herbert Cole Coombs---or Nugget Coombs, as he was well known across Australia. I informed the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-in Jakarta-of this a few minutes back. The government has agreed to-and the Prime Minister has offered-a state funeral to the family of the late Herbert man. Cole Coombs. Dr Coombs was an outstanding Australian, who contributed greatly to the community in many and varied ways under many prime ministers. He was Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia for eight years and Chairman of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust, to nominate two areas of his diverse interest. On behalf of the government I convey to the family of Nugget Coombs our sincere sympathy.",67
66,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If I could briefly have your indulgence on the same matter, Mr Speaker: firstly, I express the wholehearted agreement of the opposition to the course that the Acting Prime Minister has set out for a state funeral for Dr Coombs. It is a sad loss to the nation. His commitment to the national interest and to the public good is legendary. He was one of those public servants whom you describe as being 'in at the creation of the modem Australian state'. He was an economist by training-a Western Australian, I might sayand a product of what was then the only free university system in the country. They certainly are not free now, but it was the only free university in the country at the time. He subsequently went-unusually, for a person of that era-to the London School of Economics, where he did a doctorate. After that, he came back and almost immediately began work with the Reserve Bank and the Australian Public Service. He was an interpreter of the work then being done by the economist, John Maynard Keynes, into the Australian setting. He became a strong supporter of active government through roles as Governor of the Reserve Bank, member of the Commonwealth Bank Board and Director General of Post War Reconstruction. In his later years he proved himself to be truly a man of letters, a person concerned with the arts, and a man of great social vision. He was used by successive prime ministers in his latter years as an adviser in those areas in particular. So he was, I suppose, in terms of our Public Service, the ultimate renaissance Late in his life he spent a great deal of time visiting Aboriginal communities, sitting down with indigenous Australians and working with them to attempt to achieve some measure of justice. This is a great Australian life which has passed. The country is the poorer for his passing but the richer for the fact that he came this way. 'QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE Asian Financial Issues: World Stock Markets",67
67,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Has the Acting Prime Minister seen reports that what he described as 'the severest of meltdowns' and an 'economic firestorm which continues to unfold' in the Asian economies has caused the Treasurer to report to the government backbench that a 0.5 per cent cut to GDP is likely to occur next year? Does the government have an estimate of how this will impact on employment in this country, and is he prepared to tell the Australian people what it is?",67
68,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"There is no doubt that the equity markets around the world have been through a severe correction, although in the Australian circumstance it is instructive to note that there have been seven more severe market slides since 1929 than this market slide has been. It should be seen in perspective, but that is not say that it has not been a very severe correction involving many people around the world losing many precious dollars of their savings. I acknowledge that, but I do not acknowledge that the Treasurer said anything like what he has been represented as saying by the Leader of the Opposition. At a later stage in question time, I am quite confident that the Treasurer will lay before you what he actually said throughout yesterday on these matters. At no stage did I hear him make the utterance attributed to him by the Leader of the Opposition, and I was in the chair at the joint government party meeting for the entire three hours durationMr Martin Ferguson-Did you listen?",67
69,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"You have no choice but to listen to the Treasurer if you are less than one metre from him when he speaksand I think that is one of his many attributes. I make that particularly clear. Let me say one other thing. Whilst you can never be complacent about our trading performance, I do want to point out to the House that for the 12 months ending 1 July this year we had an alltime record in exports, some $104.4 billion. That was the first ever surplus in goods and services. I do not underestimate the task to build again on that record figure this year, but we are off to a flying start. The truth of the matter is that it is far too early to say what the ramifications will be from what might be termed 'Red October 1997' or 'the October economic firestorm' - a phrase I have used, in fact initiated, and which many others have used around the world. Mr Crean interjecting",68
70,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"You might joke about the circumstance; I don't. Neither does the government, and we have a taken a range of steps to very carefully monitor all that is happening. In addition, I remind the House that it is far too early to reach any absolute conclusion with respect to the ramifications of all that has happened during this month. Economy: Share Market",68
71,Mr MCDOUGALL,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer provide the House with an update on the movements in the financial markets overnight and, in particular, how Australian markets have responded today?",68
72,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I thank the honourable member for the question. Most members will be aware that the Australian stock market opened strongly this morning, reversing all the falls that occurred yesterday and bouncing back by around seven per cent by mid-morning. The consequence is that the falls which occurred yesterday have now been unwound. That followed a recovery on Wall Street overnight: Wall Street had fallen the previous time by about seven per cent and it bounced back 4.7 per cent last night. As a consequence of that, we may observe that there is still extreme volatility in the stock markets, not just in Australia but around the world. Neither the sharp dip yesterday nor in previous days reflected any major change in the underlying or real economy, and so the unwinding of that today returned the status quo position. It is important when looking at world markets to bear in mind their potential for volatility and the fact that people make investment decisions for their own reasons. It is those reasons which will move the markets, to a large degree, but the important thing from the public's point of view and from a government's point of view is to ensure that all in the real economy the fundamentals are kept strong. In the Australian economy we have sound public finances as a result of fiscal consolidation measures, low inflation, high productivity growth, good growth prospects, flexible labour and product markets as a result of micro-economic reform and a sound financial system--economic fundamentals which are in the developed world amongst the best and make Australia an excellent place to invest. I have said on a number of occasions in this House that, as a result of currency instability in South-East Asia, those economies will unquestionably grow slower than was previously expected and that that will affect Australia's exports to that region. But Australia's exports to that region are but 10 per cent of our overall exports. I have also said that, if there were a substantive downturn in North Asia, that would have another effect on the Australian economy. I most certainly did not say to the joint coalition party room yesterday or anywhere else that this would result in a particular variation to the government's forecast for economic growth. That was a story which was  Morning Herald who, of course, was not present at the meeting, and who reported completely falsely and in error-the kind of shoddy journalism that one would hope not to see from the Sydney Morning Herald. Those other journalists that did report it accurately can take comfort in the fact that they did not miss a scoop; it was Mr Cleary's worldwide scoop which he alone had. He had it because he invented it, which is probably the best way for Mr Cleary to get his scoops in the current climate. I do want to make one point about the stock market, and it is this: obviously, with volatility on the stock market people should refrain from trying to use that for sectoral or political partisanship. We noticed yesterday that members of the opposition were taking great delight in referring to volatility, larly in the context of the Telstra float. This is not the way responsible politicians behave.",68
73,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I go to the point of relevance. There is nothing in the question that was asked the Treasurer which could sustain a deviation like this. He was asked a completely responsible question yesterday in the normal processes of accountability and that is all there was to it. In contrast to discussions of meltdowns and fire storms, it was utterly responsible. Frankly, this is irrelevant, right off the point.",69
74,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,There is no point of highlight order.,69
75,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If the stock market could go down seven per cent one day and order. recover seven per cent the next, one could make the observation that there was a great deal of volatility, not just in the Australian stock markets but in world stock markets. a context of volatility like that, responsible politicians do not go around trying to heightperfectly en the volatility. Responsible politicians do not go around trying to create problems in relation to the Telstra float. We saw the height of irresponsibility yesterday",69
76,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr Speaker, on a further far, point of order: this is a fatuous piece of grandstanding irrelevant to the questionsiderable. absolutely irrelevant to the question. It to be dealt with.",69
77,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Resume your seat. The Treasurer appears to be winding up his answer.,69
78,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"a point that was made by a writer in the Australian this morning who wrote these words: A responsible politician would not utter the words of ALP deputy leader, Gareth Evans . . . And a responsible politician would not back calls yesterday by Evans",69
79,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order again: in your remarks to the Treasurer, you rightly drew his attention to the fact that he was straying from relevancy and he proceeded to continue to do so. I would ask you to bring him to order on that. Nobody on this side of the House has been talking about particu- firestorms and meltdowns.",69
80,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"There is no point of order. M.. Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: here we have another gross abuse of the points of order procedure in the House. It is quite clear that the question to the Treasurer related to the behaviour of the financial markets in the last few days. He is entitled therefore to draw upon comments and the issues surrounding the volatility in the markets. The three interjections we have had now from the Leader of the Opposition only his sensitivities. They are not points of order. I ask you to bring him to order.",69
81,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,There is no point of,69
82,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr Speaker, I would point out that you quite reasonably took the point that I made with you when I talked about the In question of relevance and you drew his attention to it. I would submit that it was a appropriate intervention on my part.",69
83,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"There is no point of order. There is volatility not only in international markets at the moment. This is a very serious topic. The Treasurer's response thus whilst drawing on an array of information that has flowed through into his office, is conThe response is in order. I remind ought everybody about the conventions of the House. These are very serious days, as we all know. The Treasurer may continue his answer.",69
84,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The point that I am making is that there is exceptional volatility in the Australian share market and, indeed, in international markets. People will be making their own decisions in relation to investments. Any politician who tries to use that volatility for sectoral political advantage-to go into a situation where a government entity is being put up for a float-is not a responsible politician. I hope the Australian people and those people who observe politics remember the statements and remember the behaviour that was being engaged in for a long time, because we most certainly will. Glyphosate: Dumping",70
85,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs. Has the minister seen reports that an $80 million investment by chemical producer Monsanto has been lost to Argentina because of the government's decision to treat China as a free market economy in anti-dumping cases? Can the minister confirm that, before the Monsanto decision was taken, the former minister's office, DFAT and the AntiDumping Authority received a copy of a memo from China's Ministry of Chemical Industry, calling manufacturers to a conference for 'the coordination of glyphosate prices'? Does the coordination of prices by a government agency fall within your definition of a market economy?",70
86,Mr TRUSS,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I have seen reports in one newspaper that Monsanto had made a decision to locate a plant in Argentina. Naturally, I have no knowledge of what reasons may have been in Monsanto's mind-if they have in fact made such a decision. However, the article contained quite a number of inaccuracies. so the honourable member for Hotham should not rely on it for his information. For instance. the article inferred that there had been changes to anti-dumping laws late last year. That is not the case. Mr MCMullan interjecting",70
87,Mr TRUSS,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,There were no changes last year. What happened was that the department received legal advice to the effect that certain Telstra. provisions which had been used in the past were no longer applicable in the case of China and that we needed to deal with those matters in a different way. The government has now introduced legislation into the House to deal with China and other countries as economies in transition. Mr Crean-When is it coming on?,70
88,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The member for Hotham!,70
89,Mr TRUSS,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"--As you well know, the Senate chose to take the matter up and to deal with it by way of a Senate committee report. Mr Crean interjecting",70
90,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Order! I warn the member for Hotham.,70
91,Mr TRUSS,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"--It has recently reported. It has recommended passage of the legislation, but there have been a number of issues raised. The government is considering those issues. We will bring the legislation on at the appropriate time. Telstra",70
92,Mr HARDGRAVE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance and Administration and my question relates to the forthcoming sale of one-third of Telstra. Is the minister aware of any suggestions that more of Telstra could be sold beyond the current one-third?,70
93,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order: firstly, the question is hypothetical and, secondly, the minister is not responsible for suggestions made by anybody around the place. This is a foolish question and has no basis whatsoever.",70
94,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,There is no point of order. The question is in order.,70
95,Mr FAHEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I detect a certain amount of sensitivity from that point of order. It is obvious, noting where that point of order came from, where that sensitivity is coming from at present. That is exactly what I think the honourable member for Moreton had in mind when he asked this question. I am sure that he, like me, is aware of the considerable debate that is going on within the ranks of the Australian Labor Party at present on what policy it should adopt for a further sale of Over the past week there has been more turbulence in the debate within the Labor Party than anything that has occurred in the markets at present. But this is always what seems to happen in the lead-up to what passes for policy formulation by the Labor Party. What happens is that the Left adopts the traditional approach of opposing everything; the Right adopts the traditional approach of agreeing with the Left; then the right wing ignores the left and does exactly what it wants. That is the traditional approach for assets sales that we have seen throughout the past decade or so, as the member for Werriwa fully appreciates and understands. What makes a farce of this process are the reports in this morning's press. I note that today's Financial Review, under the headline 'Beazley heads off a row over selldown', states: A Labor party spokesman told reporters yesterassists day that Mr Beazley ""personally doesn't want to see any more of Telstra sold"". The honourable member for Holt is nodding his head in agreement. That is the view of the Leader of the Opposition at present.",70
96,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,What is your view?,71
97,Mr FAHEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I will tell you about the view of the member for Holt. His view is that we should renationalise Telstra; 'Let's buy it back'. Opposition members-Oh!,71
98,Mr FAHEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The Left loves him for it. He says that we should buy it back. Of course we know what happened when you bought back AIDe. That is what he says in debate within the House, but when he is out in the public he is saying that we should have more flexibility for a further sell down of Telstra. We know that the honourable member for Holt constantly slides all over the place on policy and this is another example of him sliding all over the place. Just as the Treasurer told the House a short time ago, we saw him in this place yesterday positively salivating at the prospect of a stock market correction. He could not restrain himself from foolishly and recklessly trying to talk the market down even further. He stands condemned for trying to talk down the sale of Telstra. He was condemned universally today in the media. It seems that the Leader of the Opposition is more intent on impressing the newest member of the Labor Party. It ispretty clear that he is trying to honour some sort of an arrangement with the former Leader of the Democrats, who we all know is off on a transmogrification holiday. She is out there going through transmogrification so that she can come up with Labor Party ideals when eventually she enters the scene in some shape or form. I want to make very clear the views that the Leader of the Opposition expresses on privatisation. He has told the National Press Club in the past that, of course, he supports privatisation. He recognises the value of privatisation. He has stated in the past it in creating jobs. Of course he presided over the very healthy and very active privatisation when Labor was in government. The Leader of the Opposition was involved in various sales: the CSL public share offer, the uranium stockpile, the Qantas public share offer and the Commonwealth Bank. There arc about 15 on the list, but of course we know what the story was with the Commonwealth Bank. He stood up and said, 'We won't sell anything of the Commonwealth Bank,' and then he said, 'We'll sell only a third.' Then, ultimately, they went for the total selldown of the Commonwealth Bank and put that in place before the government changed. What we see here is hypocrisy of the highest degree. No-one would believe the Leader of the Opposition-no-one. Whatever credibility the Leader of the Opposition and, for that matter, tre front-bench of the Lahor Party had on privatisation or on any economic issue was dashed yesterday with the disgraceful effort in this House. I can understand why the poor member for Canberra was put up to it-after all, he is the fourth opposition spokesman on finance in the last 18 months. But that was deliberately designed to undermine the sale of Telstra. Today there are long faces in the opposition because the market has bounced back. It seems right now the higgest battle that the Leader of the Opposition has got is satisfying his puppet mistress, Cheryl Kernot.",71
99,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on relevance, but what I would like to do is ask the minister if he could table the document from which he is quoting for the comic section of our archives. Mr SJ?EAKER-Order! There is no point of order. I remind members of the conventions of the House in respect of points of order. There is far too much noise in the chamber.",72
100,Mr FAHEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Let me conclude by saying that the Leader of the Opposition may look to advice· from one person on what his position is on asset sales, but I can assure all members of the House that the government will consult the Australian people before it considers any further sell down of Telstra. BHP: Takeover",72
101,Mr GARETH EVANS,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Don't give up your day job, John. My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware of further reports emanating from London overnight that a foreign takeover of BHP is about to be launched by one or more major multinational resource companies? What is the government's assessment of the implications for the Australian economy of such a proposed takeover and what action, if any, would the government propose to take in the national interest in such a circumstance?",72
102,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The matter of foreign investment comes under the FIRB and that is under the jurisdiction of the Treasurer. I no further comment. Australian National Line,72
103,Mr NEVILLE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, the government has said that it is committed to the sale of Australian National. Could you inform the House whether or not the sale is to go ahead?",72
104,Mr REITH,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. The government is committed to the sale of ANL. I reaffirmed that position last week. I can inform the House that I am working with my colleague the Minister for Finance and Administration on the approach to be taken in handling that matter. The government's position is quite clear and we are working to achieve our objective. ANL, the shipping company that we collectively own, has cost the taxpayer in the order of $250 million in losses over the last 10 years. We have been very concerned about ANL and the exposure of the taxpayer to these losses. My predecessor in respect of maritime issues, the member for Hume, put in place a number of remedial actions to address the issue. Within the confines of that which he inherited, he has obviously made a positive impact on the circumstances of ANL. The annual accounts of ANL are today being released by the ANL executive chairman, and they will show that, for the 1996-97 year, ANL had recorded an operating loss before abnormals of $1.6 million. That is better than what it has been. It compares with a loss of $11 million in 1995-96 and $19'12 million in 1994-95. On reading the accounts, it is also revealed that, after abnormals, the company recorded an operating profit of $16.4 million, which was the first operating profit after abnormals since 1991. That is the position that we have inherited. Some work has. been done to improve the situation, but the government is, as I say, committed to the sale of ANL and I am working with my colleagues to achieve that end. I conclude by saying that this whole ANL saga is a testament to the economic incompehave tence of the previous government. No-one could have done a better job of botching the interests of the taxpayers than the previous government. Mr Brereton interjecting",72
105,Mr REITH,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The member interjecting was the one who said, 'Oh, you couldn't give it away!' Of course, he couldn't do anything with ANL because he was under the instructions of his trade union bosses, which exposed the Australian taxpayer to an absolute fortune. And who was the grandmaster of economic incompetence? None other than the Leader of the Opposition. Tourism Industry",72
106,Mr MARTIN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Sport and Tourism. Has the minister's attention been drawn to media comments by Bruce Baird, the managing director of the Tourism Council of Australia, concerning the shrinking of Australia's Asian tourism market as a result of what the Acting Prime Minister describes as the economic firestorm that is unfolding? In particular, did he note Mr Baird's assessment that he believes that up to 50,000 jobs will be lost in Australia's tourism industry? Can the minister advise the House how he intends to deal with these real concerns and ensure that the employment opportunities of Australians in the tourism industry are not jeopardised?",73
107,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I think it is a reasonably timely one. I did see reports that Mr Baird had made those remarks. I am not sure that he actually made the remarks himself. It may have been the chief executive of his organisation. That said, there have been other remarks made by others in the industry besides him. To my mind, they have been a little exaggerated. I took the opportunity to ask the Tourism Forecasting Council to have another look at the outlook for the industry in the light of the volatility in the markets. I took the opportunity myself to look at the figures for arrivals in Australia in 1987 and through 1988, which was the last time that the financial market suffered a similar sort of volatility. At the time, I was working in them myself. I was surprised to see two things. The first was that, in about October 1987, the Australian dollar was trading around 67c in the US dollar. By about June or July of the next year, 1988, it had risen in value to about 80c. You might say that the country was therefore rendered slightly less competitive in price terms. When we looked at the arrival figures, we found that the number of people visiting Australia continued to rise very steadily, and even quite sharply, through 1988, such that by June 1988 we had about a 40 per cent year on year increase. Mr Lee-Do you think it had something to do with the bicentenary?",73
108,Mr BRERETON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,What about the bicentenary?,73
109,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"As some people interject, yes, there was certainly increased interest in Australia given the bicentenary in that year. Mr Martin interjecting",73
110,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Let me finish. Likewise we also have an event coming up in the Olympics here, which is drawing more and more interest. I think it goes to the durability of our brand as a tourist destination, and I think people underestimate the attraction of this country for foreign visitors. Furthermore, it must be pointed out that, whilst the Asian market in the past few years has certainly been our strongest one, it is not our only one. I would point out too, to Mr Baird and to other people in the industry, that we have some expectation of an increase in arrivals from China, likewise from Taiwan, with extra flights from Mandarin Airlines, I believe, to come into Brisbane. This is not the time to be quite so gloomy as perhaps some people have been. If anything, it is no time to be talking a great industry down. Taxation: Family Trusts",73
111,Mr GARETH EVANS,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is to the Treasurer. Do you recall your tax commissioner expressing his concern, in a speech in Adelaide last month, that high wealth individuals were avoiding tax on a huge scale through tax free distributions from trusts, with individual distributions as high as $19 million tax free? What is the estimated cost to revenue of your decision to ignore Treasury and Taxation Office advice and allow trafficking in trust losses by non-beneficiaries within the extended family?",73
112,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Just because you repeat a falsehood it does not make it the case. You make various assertions about advice and think that if you repeat them that makes them true. Unfortunately, it does not. I thought the question was comprehensively answered yesterday. The question is: what was the effect on the revenue of the changes? Right? In relation to a budget, we always put down revenue measures and the effect on the revenue. Here's your question: what was the effect on the revenue? Mr Gareth Evans-I know exactly what you are going to say.",73
113,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"You know exactly what I am going to say. Well, why do you ask the question? You asked me: what was the effect on the revenue of the changes in the 1997-98 budget-the effect of the changes which you say were going to lead to a huge hole? Positive. Mr Gareth Evans-On a point of order: the answer is irrelevant to the question. The question was about the revenue effect of allowing a particular further exemption. I want an answer that goes directly to that amount of revenue, not the size of the total pie, which continues to be very large. As long as he avoids that, he is irrelevant.",74
114,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,74
115,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Some mothers do have 'em, don't they? Your question was: what was the effect of the changes? I told you yesterday that it is in the published budget figures. Here are the financial implications: trust losses, and an effect on the revenue of plus $5 million in 1997-98, $15 million in 1998-99 and $20 million in 1999-2000. If this had actually had a negative effect on revenue it would have had a minus in front of those figures. But it does not have a minus because, as you can well see, in relation to this trust loss legislation it did not have a negative revenue effect at all. Nursing Homes",74
116,Mrs DRAPER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,My question is addressed to Minister for Family Services. Can the minister outline to the House what happens to accommodation bonds for hostels and nursing homes once a resident leaves a hostel or nursing home? Mr Wilton interjecting,74
117,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I warn the member for Isaacs!,74
118,Mr WARWICK SMITH,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I thank the member for Makin for her question. Other members would be aware that she is one of the few in this place who has actually worked professionally in nursing homes. Some regard should be taken of those that have worked in nursing homes. Yesterday I received a press release from the Aged Care Organisations Association in her state. I will read it to honourable members: Has anyone at all given thought to the damage this scaremongering campaign is doing to the many wonderful organisations where staff and conditions are of the highest standards, where care, nursing and love is given unstintingly as a matter of course. You have given no regard whatsoever to what your scaremongering campaign is doing.",74
119,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question from the government's side was very specific in relation to what happens after the bonds. It had nothing to do with scaremongering or any of those issues. It is irrelevant. The minister is being irrelevant.",74
120,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The honourable member will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,74
121,Mr WARWICK SMITH,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I think the sensitivity of having to take a point of order illustrates my point. In answer to the question, one method of paying an accommodation bond is a lump sum. Remember that that accommodation bond is not a fee. It is not a payment to the government. It is not a levy imposed by the government. The fact is that the bond is an amount of money that a care recipient effectively agrees to lodge for the time they are in the care facility. They get it back. When the resident leaves the facility the bond must be paid back to the care recipient, less no more than $2,600 per annum, with the maximum deduction being $13,000 over the five-year period. I repeat that the most the resident will pay from their bond will be $13,000. This is the same system that operated under the Labor hostel system for the past 10 years. Under the government's proposal, all accommodation bonds will be protected by strict prudential arrangements, and this is very different to what happened under your arrangements. Under Labor there were no requirements as to how the up-front entry contribution had to be protected. Labor let the hostel sector operate without formal prudential supervision. It was only effective cash control by hostel operators that allowed payments to be made. You turned a blind eye to protecting the money of the people in hostels and no prudential requirements were put in place. You totally ignored the problem. Under our scheme these prudential arrangements protect those bonds and people will get them back. The money will be used, as I have said repeatedly, to address the standards issue in homes and hostels around this nation. It is right that it should be so. It is a legacy of your neglect in this area-a 75 per cent reduction in your 13 years of government-in supporting capital improvements to nursing homes and hostels. It is an absolute disgrace to hide behind a scare campaign, to ignore the needs of the aged and to reflect poorly on all those people who care for the elderly in our community. NA",74
122,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the honourable member for Calare, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afterand noon a delegation from the Republic of the Lebanon led by Mr Boutros Harb. On behalf of the House we extend to you a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Aged Care",75
123,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Can you explain what education, media or mail-out programs you will be undertaking to better explain the changes to the aged care reforms? I am receiving calls from elderly people still confused by the changes announced on Monday and still believing the accommodation bonds will inevitably require the sale of the home. They wonder why there is no limit on bonds and why all aged care providers should not be required to pool bonds in the national prudential fund.",75
124,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his constructive question. Opposition members-Ha,ha!",75
125,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a constructive question seeking information, which is something that we have not had from you for nearly two weeks. The arrangements for making sure that the community understands this matter are well in train at present. We are extending the 1800 number facility . We are also, as we have already done, training the aged care assessment teams. I am in discussions with a range of professional bodies around this country that see that we are acting in the national interest. Some of that has been published already by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, for example, and others. Those aged care representative bodies, such as Aged Care Australia and so on, have also indicated to me that they are quite prepared to assist in making sure that the community, and the aged in particular, get all the information they need about this policy. We are developing programs. We will be writing, as I did yesterday, to all the residents in nursing homes and hostels indicating the changes that we made earlier in the week, which have been extremely well received by responsible commentators as being in the national interest, asking them to give us an extension of time to explain the need for the changes. With regard to the prudential arrangements, there is a central national scheme, a prudential scheme, and those groups such as the Uniting church, the Anglican church and the Catholic church have also indicated that they would like to establish prudential schemes. They need to apply to my department. There is discretion at the hands of the secretary to issue authority for them to establish prudential schemes. They must stand behind every bond. I make the point-and I did not make it in the last answer-that, during the hostel arrangements where people were making entry contributions for the 10 years, many millions of dollars-and I have no exact figures-have been lost to people because there were no prudential arrangements. This is the reason why, throughout the consultation process as we developed this policy-as I have explained, the Democrats supported this policy as well-we wanted to have formalised prudential arrangements: to make sure people got their money back. Labor did not care and they did not do anything about it. Australian Defence Force: Sexual Assault",75
126,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister, what are you doing about continuing claims of sexual assault and harassment in the Royal Australian Navy? Are appropriate structures in place to counter such alleged incidents?",76
127,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I know she, like I and other women on this side of the House, is concerned that young women are not deterred from having a career in the Australian defence forces. Reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault do indeed affect the decision of young women to seek a career in the Australian Defence Force. Earlier this year I tabled the Burton and Quinn reports. As a result of the Burton report, we established an equity organisation designed to deal with this sort of problem. Despite the good work that is being done there, we are still continuing to have the sorts of reports that were in both the Bulletin and the Sun-Herald newspaper articles. There is sufficient concern that today there are terms of reference being settled by the personnel executive of the Defence Force, to be signed off by the CDF, which will enable an investigation to take place, particularly of behaviour at ADFA where a number of the reports emanate. The important thing is that we want confidence to be restored. Accordingly, there will be contained in those terms of reference the need to identify and eradicate any incidents of repeating offences-that is, a single individual may be reported on one occasion but no action is desired by the complainant at that particular time; however, that person could offend again. That is totally unacceptable. The Defence Force has a policy that zero sexual harassment and sexual assault is acceptable. To achieve that, we need to continue to have a very strong backup situation whereby, even if the complainant says that she or he does not want any further action taken, it is necessary that the offence is still formally reported in order that it can be dealt with. With regard to sexual assault, it is necessary that civilian police forces be involved, that it is not dealt with simply by the Defence Force, in order that proper transparency is always available in the prosecution of those cases. That agreement has been reached. If a person is acquitted or fails to be convicted by a civilian court, there is available action for the Defence Force to take only if the DPP agrees to it. That also requires looking at because it is not always forthcoming in some instances I have seen where perhaps it should have been. All those issues need to be looked at. But, at the end of the day, we must ensure that our policy is pursued rigorously, that zero is the acceptable level and that young women are not deterred from finding a very successful career in the Australian Defence Force. Nursing Homes",76
128,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, on the John Laws program this morning you claimed that, first, your hardship provisions would allow you to grant extensions to the amount of leave a resident can take from a nursing home and, secondly, you would allow retirees to keep fringe benefit entitlements if selling their homes forced them to breach the pension income or assets limits. Minister, how do you intend to do this and are these changes consistent with the Prime Minister's and Treasurer's claims that there would be no further changes to your discredited nursing home policy?",76
129,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have already indicated, as we did when we made our announcement, that we were extending the hardship provisions. We have already announced that. As to the other matter you raised, I do not believe that was an accurate representation of what was said on the John Laws program this morning. Last week I made it a point not to do any media as I listened to all the views of my colleagues and the community. This week I am quite prepared to go anywhere to argue my case because the case that I argue is right. After the John Laws show they were kind enough to provide me with other information that came to them to assist people to understand.",76
130,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about Howard Satler?,77
131,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You interject about Howard Satler. Let me tell you about Howard Satler. The first interview I did was with Howard Satler. Yesterday I was prepared to go on his program but there was a shark attack and he turned me down. Someone else got the guernsey. I am quite prepared for Howard Satler to give preference to a shark attack. I felt that I might have been the subject of a bit of an attack with John Laws this morning, but he gave me a reasonable go. I will go anywhere to argue this policy because it is right. Waterfront  the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, in light of the discussions due to be held tonight with the Maritime Union of Australia and the ACTU, what are some of the concerns the government has, particularly in light of the poor levels of occupational health and safety that beset the waterfront?",77
132,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Sturt for his question. Beer and sandwiches will certainly be supplied upon request. We are looking forward to a constructive meeting with the MUA and the ACTU. One of the issues we want to discuss with the MUA is the whole issue of workplace safety on the waterfront and in the stevedoring industry generally. We have already done quite a bit of work analysing the safety of people who work in the stevedoring industry. We· have been struck by some quite startling results of our initial research. For example, fatalities on the waterfront are running at more than twice the level of the Australian mining industry and seven times the all industries average in the years 1991-95. Over the same period, the incidence of injuries and disease rose from 108.6 cases per thousand employees to 169.6 cases per thousand. These figures compare highly unfavourably with the all Australian average of 29.1 cases per thousand. The report that we have had prepared sums it up very well in the executive summary. It says: Our review of the available statistical evidence suggests that the stevedoring industry is perfonning very poorly in comparison to other sectors of the maritime industry and other major industries in Australia. This is reflected in a high rate of work related fatalities, injuries and disease. It then goes on to recount some of those figures. It also says: Clearly, previous calls to attend to the poor safety record of the stevedoring industry have gone unanswered. That is not a report put together by the government. We have gone outside of government to an independent firm to obtain advice on safety levels within the maritime industry. One of those persons who was responsible for this report was Michael Easson, the former secretary of the New South Wales Labor Council, an associate commissioner of the Industry Commission On occupational health and safety, and current chairman of the workplace relations group at Corrs Chambers Westgarth. When we meet with the MUA and the ACTU tonight we will give them a copy of this report and seek from them a constructive response. The last thing I would say to members of the House is that, when we sit down with the unions to talk about the waterfront and the problems of the waterfront, the one thing we ask of them is that they at least acknowledge the problems that are genuinely there and that genuinely need to be fixed. If they have trouble accepting the reality of these claims that we have made, we only ask them to fairly look at the evidence. The evidence put together by Michael Easson on safety is very compelling. If the unions are genuinely concerned about the safety of their own members, the level of the first thingMr Tanner-So it is their fault, is it?",77
133,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not a question of fault. If anybody is at fault it is the previous Labor administration who for 13 years was never prepared to do anything about this. You claim concern about the average worker and you have one of the worse safety records in the country. Thirteen years of Labor and you leave them with a shockingly unsafe workplace and you have the cheek to interject about what we are trying to do. We want to sit down sensibly with the unions and say, 'To the extent that you have responsibilities on the waterfront, don't deny the problem, acknowledge the problem.' We want to see whether we can find solutions in the interests of their own members. Veterans: Nursing Homes",77
134,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Given the particular impact that the government's nursing home policy will have upon Australia's ageing veteran and war widow population, and bearing in mind their special sacrifices for the nation and payment of taxes over many decades, has he or his department ever at any stage made any submission whatsoever to exempt them from the up-front accommodation bond? Mr Bruce SCOTTI see the shadow minister has moved up the front bench. I do not know what is going on over there. We are missing you down there. Mr Tanner-Unlike you. You didn't get to move up, did you.",78
135,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They do not want to hear the answer. As I have reiterated House, there are some very special provisions for veterans and we are acknowledging the great service that our veterans have given to this nation. The government will continue to pay the residential fee for ex-POWs in nursing homes.",78
136,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. It was a very specific question. It went to the bond-not any other matters, just simply the bond. The answer that the minister is giving is irrelevant to that point. The question was: what did you do about the bond?",78
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am listening very carefully to the minister's response. There is no point of order.,78
138,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My department has been cooperating with the Department of Health and Family Services in the development of the policy to make sure that the very special provisions that we have agreed to in this legislation take account of the special service of veterans, which is acknowledged by the Department of Health and Family Services. Veterans Entitlements",78
139,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Minister, veterans in my electorate of Parkes and others west of the Great Divide in New South Wales have had to rely on visiting departmental officers from Sydney to provide information and assistance on their entitlements. Does the government have any plans to increase the presence of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in rural New South Wales?",78
140,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parkes for his question and acknowledge that his electorate is one of the six largest electorates in Australia and is represented in this House very well by the member for Parkes. I am very pleased to inform the House that this government is extending services west of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales. Under new arrangements being developed with Centrelink and the New South Wales government access program, information and advice on veterans' services and entitlements will now be available in six in this western New South Wales centres. They include Tamworth and Orange-and the member for Calare would be interested in that-and also Wagga Wagga, and I am sure the member for Riverina would be interested in that. We are also planning similar services through the New South Wales government access· program in Gilgandra, Grenfell and Oberon. In addition to the information and advisory service that will be provided in these centres, veterans will also be able to lodge a claim for their entitlement. That is a particularly important point. We want to make sure that veterans not only gain ac<;ess and information about their entitlements but also know that they are able to access their entitlements and get them processed quickly by my department. Since we have come to government the time taken to process a claim has reduced from about 170 days to approximately 80 days. This is a vast improvement on the previous level of services which were available to veterans in western New South Wales. They previously had to rely on visits from the centre in Sydney. The department's staff have done that extremely well. I want to thank the department's staff who have had to travel into rural New South Wales and spend time away from their families to take these services out there. . There are some on the other side of the House, and particularly their comrades in the other chamber, who have suddenly become born again rural activists. They have discovered, after 13 years of Labor, that there was a problem with services in rural areas. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy recently brought this to our attention. A recent report shows that up to 28 per cent of people living in rural Australia do not know that under the act they have an entitlement from the Department of Social Security. Taking these services out to rural Australia will ensure that our veterans are not unaware of the entitlements which they so justly deserve. This is about bringing services west of the Great Dividing Range and acknowledging that a third of our veterans in Australia live outside metropolitan Australia. Veterans: Nursing Homes",78
141,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Vast numbers of Australian veterans and war widows grew up in an era when the purchase of the family home was central to Australian, personal and family ambition. If they are now assessed by aged care assessment teams as requiring nursing home care before I March but are not able to obtain a bed until after that date, will they be forced to pay the extra daily fee slug?",79
142,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They will be paying from when they enter the nursing home. Let me reiterate: we do not want to see veterans going into homes when we know that up to 10 per cent of them today do not meet health standards and in excess of 12 per cent do not meet fire standards. We want to make sure that veterans are not put in a place,79
143,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a point of order. The question was quite specific: will those assessed veterans unable to get in before 1 March be obliged to pay? That is all. There is nothing else to it than that. Mr Truss- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: these are frivolous points of order. The minister had spoken only about 10 words. How can he be irrelevant?",79
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,",---Order! There is no point of order.",79
145,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the shadow minister once again that prisoners of war will have their daily contribution met by the federal government. He is a very slow learner. He should stop his scaremongering. And he should also stop putting out notices which raise the fear in the veteran community and which say, 'Come and talk to me about your concerns about the abolition of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.' That is wrong, and he knows it is wrong, but he is out there putting fear into the veteran community. Once again, we see those on the other side of the House using our veterans as a political tool. The veteran community of this nation have nearly always had bipartisan support from this parliament. That appears to have gone out the window with this shadow minister, under the leadership of this particular Leader of the Opposition. Social Support Programs",79
146,Mr W AKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Minister, what is being done to address issues identified by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics about awareness by farming families of social support programs?",79
147,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can tell the member for Grey that I have been apprised of the report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and its findings, which included some very useful information. Around 40 per cent of farm households received some form of assistance through the Commonwealth social support programs in the year 1995-96. The awareness of social support programs at the national level was generally high, but there was evidence that some families were unaware of the existence of particular programs that might be available to them and of the varying assets and income provisions. So it is important in that context to look the range of service delivery mechanisms to ensure that people are properly briefed on the information about the services, programs and payments. That information is generally made available through regional offices, but in rural Australia provision is made for mobile and visiting services to operate in small and remote towns where agencies may not be . Amanda Vanstone. present. There are non-government agencies in a number of areas that act upon the Commonwealth's behalf. There are also cooperative arrangements with state and local governments for delivery of services. There is a community agent program which enables our indigenous people to obtain access to services. We have the teleservice centres for people who are able to access teleof phones to obtain information. There is a range of mechanisms whereby information Kalejs can be imparted. Efforts are being made to were ensure that people are able to access each of those services. As I am advised, we are also looking at use of modem technology. In the electronic lodgement of claims will be possible. The provision of information through mechanisms such as the Internet and touch screen terminals is also possible. The agency is working towards being able to use telethat phones in the way they are being used so much in banking and other areas so people may be able to have claims, or at least varimade ations of their entitlements, effected through that mechanism. War Crimes",79
148,Mr HOLDING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Can the Attorney inform the House what investigations have been or are being conducted by the federal government into Mr Konrad Kalejs, who was deported from the United States for his involvement in war crimes? What investigations are being conducted into Mr Karlis Ozels, a resident of Melbourne who was a member of the same Nazi unit as Mr Kalejs? Can you assure the House that these are proper investigations-and not just file reviews-and will be sufficient to indicate why these two former Nazis were granted Australat Ian citizenship? Can you tell us whether they lied or used forged documents to mislead Australian immigration authorities about their role in wartime atrocities?",80
149,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. I point out that this area is principally now the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Senator",80
150,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,80
151,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Excuse me. I will give you an answer but I will also consult Senator Vanstone to see if there is anything further she wishes to add to the answer. This government is committed to the proper investigation any serious allegation of war crimes. I had wide informed the House at the time Mr Konrad returned to Australia of the steps that put in train. Those steps are still in train. I should mention that it is not the practice of attorneys-general or ministers for justice under this government or any previous government the to be involved on a day-today basis in future, operational investigations. The allegations relating to Mr Ozels have more recently been the subject of publicity. In the course of that publicity, it was revealed under the previous government, while the war crimes investigation unit was in existence, there had been extensive investigations in respect of him. The investigations, I understand, ceased after the previous government closed the war crimes investigation unit. My understanding is that the matter has been reactivated but, as far as the investigation by the Federal Police is concerned, the allocation of resources and the prioritisation of investigations are matters that are done by them on a national basis. It is their decision. I will make further inquiries. If there is anything I can add to the answer, I will come back. Home Affordability",80
152,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the results of the most recent home affordability study? What factors have led to such a positive result for Australian home buyers?,81
153,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cowan for his question. I know that representing an electorate with so many young· home buyers, as he does, .he will be pleased to know that Australian home afford ability reached a record high in the September quarter. The Commonwealth BankHousing Industry Association report which came out showed that housing affordability rose six per cent to be up 15 per cent in the year to September and it is now at its highest level since the index was introduced in 1984. Isn't that great news for Australian home buyers? Home affordability is now at the highest level since the index was introduced in 1984. I think all members of parliament will be pleased to know that home affordability is at the highest since September 1984. Is that right? All members of parliament will be pleased to know that. The report said: In the year to September, established house prices increased by 15.3 per cent but sustained falls in interest rates combined with a 2.6 per cent rise household disposable income made home purchase more affordable. Home mortgage rates are now at the lowest level in Australia since the 1960s. The average Australian with the average home mortgage is now saving $3,000 a year as a result of reduced interest rates. I am sure all members of parliament will welcome the fact that home buyers in Australia are saving so much money on their mortgages. I am sure even the Labor Party will welcome the fact that home buyers are saving $3,000 on their average mortgage as a result of low interest rates. Mr Speaker, I am trying to cheer up the opposition members. They are looking so sad. I am sure even the Labor Party will be pleased to know that the average Australian mortgagee is paying $3,000 less per year as a result of lower interest rates. The best thing you can do for home buyers in this country is get home affordability prices down. The best thing you can do for them is keep their mortgage interest rates low. When you have an opportunity to buy a home and pay a 6Y2 per cent mortgage rate, that is a benefit which you could never have imagined in 1988-89, when the home mortgage rate was 17 per cent. Who was in government in 1988? I think even the Labor Party, which would not have been happy to take mortgage interest rates to 17 per cent as it did in 1988-89, would be pleased to know that interest rates are now nearly a third of that-at a little over six per cent. But you do not just produce results like that out of nowhere. It takes a disciplined fiscal policy. Can you imagine where we would be now if the government had said, 'We will keep Australia in deficit to the tum of the century'? Can you imagine where we would be if the government had not run a new agreement on monetary policy with the Reserve Bank? Can you imagine where we would be if the government had tried to match the cheap jack economic populism of the Australian Labor Party-Hansonomics of promising everything to everybody and not facing up to the economic consequence of their decisions? We would not be able to produce the benefits for Australian families that they receive as a in result of good economic policy, which this government intends to maintain and continue. Nursing Homes",81
154,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Is it a fact that 65 per cent of older Australians in nursing homes are full pensioners? Would the minister agree that a person who is a full pensioner is on a low income? If 65 per cent of nursing home residents are on low incomes, why has the government reserved only 27 per cent of nursing home beds for people who cannot afford to pay a bond?",81
155,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a fact that, of the 3,000 nursing homes and hostels in Australia-now described as residential care facilities-with some 135,000 residents, 65 per cent of them are full pensioners. That is why they were delighted with the announcement that we made earlier this week. They will not be affected by the fee increases that start on 1 March. The figure of 27 per cent has been agreed in conjunction with industry and with all the consumer groups as being the operative figure to put into the legislation. It was one on which we did not Acthear one peep out of you in the course of the debate on this legislation. Isn't it funny, this sion-Report confected concern? It is first I have ever heard from you; not a letter, not a press Torres97. release, nothing at all have I seen from you about this issue. This is part of the scare campaign. The 65 per cent of pensioners know that this policy caters for them. They are the ones who are not affected by the fee increase-now or on 1 March. They are delighted with the steps that I have taken as minister to protect their interests. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I ask that Australian further questions be placed on the Notice for 1996-97.

160,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received letters from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 107, I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney, namely: The urgent need for all who attempt to influence public opinion to demonstrate a responsible reaction to the current volatility on world equity markets, especially pending the close of the public offer relating to Telstra next Monday. I therefore call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",84
161,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Since 1987 when we had the most recent significant downturn in the equity markets, a number of changes have occurred that have changed the fundamental nature of equity markets world wide. In the first place, we have had the rapid development of hedge markets and derivative markets. For example, in 1995, the Australian Stock Exchange introduced LEPOs, which arc a form of derivative product. We have also witnessed a significant increase in the number of options being traded. In fact, the volume of option trades has increased threefold since 1987. There has been a second significant change in the equity markets. Today, Australian equities represent 75 per cent as a proportion of Australia's GDP. In 1987, it was just over 50 per cent. Today, there are 4.7 million Australians who are direct investors in the Australian equities market, compared with around 1.5 million in 1987; that is, over a threefold increase in the number of mums and dads investing in the all ordinaries. Since 1987, we have seen some memorable failures. Of course, the people who used to embrace the Labor Party and the people who the Labor Party used to embrace-the Alan Bonds, the Christopher Skases, the Laurie Connells and the George Herscus-are not around anymore to either serve the purposes of the Labor Party or to take away from the Australian investors their equity, their hardearned cash and their heart and soul, if you like, that they have invested in the stock market. Instead, we have seen a replacement with quality stocks. Blue chip stocks have entered the markets: Colonial Mutual with around 500,000 small-time investors; National Mutual with around 500,000 investors; the GIO with 140,000 new investors; Qantas, which I will come to a little later, with 120,000 new investors; and the Commonwealth Bank with around 300,000 new investors. The numbers of mums and dads-the average Australian battlers-who are investing in the equity markets today have increased threefold over the number of equity investors in 1987. But there are two very fundamental differences. The first difference is that today our markets are more global. The globalisation of international markets has been linked to the development and the increasing strength in the US dollar. We have also seen a further development in global banking, with the net result that, out of this globalisation, world equity markets arc almost, in many ways, trading as one. The more they trade, the more they rely on information. The information that they receive can, at any moment-in the moment of a heartbeat--change the nature of th- market. Anyone who has been down to the Sydney Futures Exchange would have noticed that there is a large black board that reports to the exchange every question of moment that is asked in the House of Representatives or the Senate. That is a clear indication of how fragile the market is; how sensitive it is to every utterance that comes from this place and from people who hold positions of responsibility in this place. I suppose that when we came in in 1996, the class of 1996 was under the assumption that individual members of this House wbuld be responsible not only to this place but also to the people whom they seek to represent. So, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) went before the Australian people yesterday and talked down the Australian economy, there could be only one conclusion from his remarks: that his sole interest and purpose is to debase the politics of this nation by simply debasing the Australian economy. There is only one outcome from that. The net result of the comments by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was reported by AAP within moments with the headline, 'Australia too weak to handle stocks crisis: opposition'. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is under the impression that he has scored a momentous political point, he should realise that the only people who suffer are not the people on this side of the House, but the people whom we seek to represent. They are the mums and dads of Australia-the 4.7 million Australians who directly invest in the Australian equity markets, who have, in many cases, their livelihoods riding on the all ordinaries index and the strength and purpose of the Australian economy. In this current environment of great volatility in world markets, there is what is called in market terms a flight to quality. When there is a flight to quality, people go back to the fundamentals. Analysts and investors go to the fundamentals. They do not just look at PE ratios, net asset backing and so on, they also look at the economy in which individual companies are operating. They look at economic growth, and we have one of the highest economic growth rates in the OECD. They look at inflation, and we have one of the lowest inflation rates in the OECD. They look at the direction of the current account deficit, and Australia's current account deficit, after a long time under Labor, is now going in the right direction. Those fundamentals are vital when it comes to an individual investment decision. Those investment decisions are made in New York, London, Brussels and Tokyo because people are seeking a haven for quality. When new Labor makes comments such as those made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition yesterday, one can only conclude that it is old Labor again. But it is not even the Labor of 1987; it is almost the Labor of the 1950s with the old tactics. You could forgive the Deputy Leader of the Opposition if you thought for a moment that he was going to be making a considered, informed and statesmanlike comment on the economy, but you cannot forgive him for making a statement that is so economically illiterate as that which was made by him yesterday when he talked about the flailing Australian economy. You cannot forgive him. It might be okay for him to be innumerate; it is not okay for him to be economically illiterate. The net result was that he was trying to ensure that, out of all of this process, we had mutually assured destruction. It seems to be a classic tactic of the Australian Labor Party at the moment. They are seeking to destroy us and to destroy themselves at the same time, with the net result that the only losers over the last few weeks and, more particularly, out of the comments in the last 24 to 48 hours, are the Australian people. It is not just those 4.7 million people who directly invest or invest through managed funds in the Australian equity markets; it is every Australian worker who has superannuation in the Australian equity markets. What was their motivation? What has been the motivation of the Australian Labor Party over the last 24 hours? Apart from self-interest and base political gain, there is only one motivation: they are trying to derail the Telstra float. They are trying to derail the most significant initial public offer in Australia's history. They are trying to derail the float of the company that will be in the top five stocks in Australia, the company that will have over 700,000 investors, the company that is going to be the flagship of Australian interests in New York and around the world-with the net result that all we can assume is that the Labor Party does not understand privatisation. I notice that the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) is at the table. It was his question yesterday which took politics to the lowest level possible. What he tried to do, at the expense of 18 million Australians who have everything invested in Telstra, was bring to the attention of the markets, of mums and dads, of investors, the parachute provisions in the prospectus for Telstra. There is only one motivation for that: they want to derail the float. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you do not believe me on this, I will quote from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I might put this into the context of the current debate within the opposition about privatisation, particularly the current debate about privatisation of Telstra. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition scoffed at suggestions that he was not interested in the current sale of Telstra. Yesterday he said: Of course the Government shouldn't be selling Te1stra at all. If it wasn't selling Telstra at all wouldn't be this source of anxiety about reduced returns on the sale. This is a person who sees himself as Treasurer. He does not care what the asset is worth; he doesn't care about the returns. He says, 'We don't have to worry if it remains in government ownership.' He goes on to say: Obviously they are going to think long and hard about selling into the present down market. We've made our position very clear. Telstra should be in public ownership. The whole exercise has been misconceived, and the hopes for windfall gains from this are now likely not to be realised in the present environment. The Government's only got itself to blame for creating expectations that the world is now not going to satisfy. There is only one explanation for that statement: Gareth Evans is taking the Australian political scene to the lowest level by cheating the Australian public, by cheating the 700,000 investors in Telstra and by cheating the equity markets. In the middle of the battle within the opposition about privatisation they cannot come to terms with what their real policy is. You can imagine Kim Beazley's photo album. In 10 years time he is sitting down with his family and showing them his photo album. He says, 'Here I am in 1989 standing outside AIDC headquarters. Look at it. I was selling that.' AIDC headquarters: he had a bit of a problem. 'In 1996 I had to buy it back. In 1991 here I am standing outside the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a proud institution, a great institution. We were selling only 29 per cent.' And then in 1993 there he is with his arms around Ralph Willis, smiling in front of the camera.",84
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl}-The honourable member will refer to members by their correct title.,86
163,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Gellibrand is there smiling in the photo, with the 19 per cent going. Of course, there have been others: the flip-flops on Australian Airlines; the fact that 'Well, we are only going to have a quarter of the Qantas jets replacing kangaroos on the tail with the British bulldog' in 1995; and they failed on airports in 1995-96. There is only one conclusion about their there attempts on Telstra. They are jealous of the fact that we are getting on with the job, that we want to try to provide reasonable, hard working, diligent Australians with an opportunity to invest in one of Australia's most progressive and significant companies. By asking that question yesterday, the member for Canberra was smart enough to know that the vendors in the sale are not in any position to sell to the Australian people the significant benefits of the sale. The vendor, the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), is not in a position to talk up the sale in the way that a stockbroker can, because you have to keep referring to the prospectus, and the Corporations Law is very explicit about ramping shares. And yet the opposition in this House is seeking to devalue the sale, to talk it down to the markets, to talk down the Australian equity markets, and to elicit a response that is less than glowing from the vendors. Well, the vendors are not in any position to talk up the sale; that is up to the brokers. They are not in any position to go beyond the constraints of the Corporations Law. If you do not know that, then you are being grossly irresponsible to the people that you seek to represent. In the overall context of the volatility of the equities markets, we should bear in mind the fact that not one of us can significantly influence the direction of the markets. But what we can do is have an effect on the level of confidence and the mood of the Australian people and of international investors. I believe that the opposition in this case has severely let down the people they seek to represent. (Time expired)",86
164,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Canberra) (3.36 p.m.)There are some matters of public importance to be discussed here. It is a pity that the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) did not get to discuss them. They are these. We need to talk about the role of the parliament-and question time in particular-as a clearing house of information for the Australian public. It is a very important point in the accountability process. It is one that in 1987 you used in ways I will just mention to you in a moment, which nobody told th- member for North Sydney about or he would not have got up and made that speech. That is why they got someone who was not here in 1987 to make this speech-because they would have been too embarrassed. They knew what the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the then Leader of the National Party said in 1987 at the time of the stock market crisis. Nothing careful, measured about questions; they were in there trying to whip it up. And we will be referring to that. We never have until now, but we will. We will not be bullied or bluffed out of discharging our responsibility by a government that is sagging in the polls and desperately looking for a diversion from all their woes-their nursing home woes, their unemployment crisis, et cetera. They are looking to change the debate, and this one is not going to fly. They tried to run this hoary old line around the. gallery last night and they could only get poor old John Short to run it. After all, he will always run the press releases of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). They should just have handed it to him on paper; they would not have wasted the taxpayers' time having their trusted servants running around trying to sell it to decent journalists. What was the most important public issue yesterday? We do not need a poll of those of us in here. The media made it absolutely clear it was the situation with the stock market and its consequences for the Australian economy. What was the most important direct public policy matter? The Telstra float. That is the matter that is the immediate financial responsibility of the Australian government. The other issues are important, we want to know what their implications are, but they are not the direct responsibility of the Australian government. It would have been an abrogation of our responsibility had we not raised those matters; it is not that it was irresponsible to raise them. The government must have considered that the Telstra float was something about which public comment was required because the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) was out talking about it at breakfasttime. He was not out in response to my question; before I asked the question he was out talking about it and making public comments. We all know that people throughout the media were asking questions about the level at which the government might need to consider whether it would proceed. People tried to get us to join the Democrats' move for it to be put off. We said no. Media people came to us hoping that we would join the Democrats' proposal calling for it to be deferred and we said, 'No. We will not join that. That would not be responsible. The call as to the timing must be made by the government because they are the people who have the information.' That was our position publicly and privately when everybody approached us, as was made clear again this morning by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). It would have been an abrogation of responsibility for us not to raise it, but we needed to be very careful how we raised it, and we were. What was the big allegation made about me by the member for North Sydney? He said I tried to raise the issue of the parachute clauses as if they were a secret. When I raised that issue, what did the minister say in response? I will get away from the fact that he could not work out what page of the thing it was on and quote him: - hat is on the page of the public offer document IS exactly what I have been talking about since the commencement of the tloat. It was not that I raised something that he was trying - ake sure no-one knew about. He got up and III response to my question said, 'Yes, that matter you raised is something I've been talking about.' He then went on to say-I did not think it was an unreasonable thing to say, but if your allegation about my question is right this is an outrageous answer, although I did not think it was-'The government is still monitoring it, I assure you,' that is, the Telstra share offer, 'on a very regular basis as the market goes through this correction.' A perfectly responsible reply, I did not criticise it, but if I was wrong to ask the question that was an outrageous thing for him to say in those circumstances. I do not think it was. It was a perfectly reasonable response to a perfectly reasonable question, but you cannot have it both ways. If you say, 'You should not ask a question,' you cannot then say that it is all right for the minister to answer it and say, 'Yes, we're reviewing it and we're monitoring it.' You cannot have it both ways. The fact of the matter is simply that it is an important matter. The media is full of comments by people on the Telstra float price. They are not quoting me; they are quoting the Minister for Finance and Administration. Nobody in these articles-except for poor old John Short who fell for your line againnobody in the media, is saying I said something or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) said something. They are saying, 'The worsening share market rout would affect the final Telstra float price, the federal minister for finance, John Fahey, conceded today.' It is not me. It says here: John Fahey, federal minister for finance. He is the person who was out there saying it. I do not criticise him for saying it, but you cannot criticise us for asking simply: as a resul- of these facts on the public record, what conSIderation is the government giving to the circumstances around this matter? Asking that question is a proper discharge of our public responsibility . We have been very careful about the way in which we have asked every question. If you think that the questions asked on - onday by the Deputy Leader of the OppositIon and yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition about the share market were, as the Treasurer said today, a terrible attempt to use the volatility for political purposes and we should not be using it for sectoral or political partisanship, how do you explain this? On 26 October 1987-this date might be a bit familiar to some of you-the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, asked, 'What impact will this have'-that is, the stock market decline-'on Australia's balance of payment and domestic demand?' He went on to ask: Does the Treasurer agree that investment, jobs and the Budget deficit are also likely to be affected That, almost word for word, was the question asked by the then Leader of the Opposition. Or later when he asked: Is it true that the Australian stock market has fallen by 44 per cent . . . Is it true that the Australian dollar has fallen by 10 per cent ... Of course, he was not using that volatility for sectoral or partisanship purposes; he was asking a socially responsible question. What about when the Leader of the National Party asked a question which, almost verbatim, was the question the Leader of the Opposition asked yesterday: I ask t-e Prime Minister: How will the continuing dramatic fall on the Australian stock market and this morning's increasing pressure on the Australian dollar affect investment, employment, interest rates and Budget projections? Of course, that would not have affected the interests of millions of shareholders. No, he was of course being very responsible. There was no question that that might affect shareholders' interests. But, as if that were not enough, on 26 October, having asked a question and got the answer, there was an MPI moved by the member for Bennelong, Mr Howard: The urgent need to recognise the vulnerability the Australian economy to sudden shifts of economic sentiment. If anybody in Australian political economic history has ever sought to exploit a stock market circumstance for partisan or electoral purposes, there is only one: Mr John Howard, the member for Bennelong. He got up moved this MPI. I say to the member North Sydney: I know they did not tell you about it. I know you have not read it. Go away and read about it on pages 1408 and 1409 of the budget document. You will see exactly what it had to say. Mr Howard is only person who has attempted to use market variations for partisan political poses. What was the response to those questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion, by the Deputy Leader of the Oppoable sition and others? The Acting Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), said, 'This is a very serious situafloat, tion.' He then went on to make the only provocative, over-the-top comment that has been made in this parliament about the nomic circumstance. He said, 'We've got an economic firestorm in Asia.' That was designed to calm market sentiments. He did that because he thought that, if he did not say something calm, it might be up on the memfrom ber for North Sydney's black screen in the futures market. So he thought, 'I had better say something calm. I will say there is an economic firestorm unravelling.' And today he repeated it, and he is proud of it. I am sure the member for North Sydney made fervent representations to him about not saying these things. It is a great pity that Leader of the National Party was not able understand that. He was too busy in his hunt for 'Red October' in here. Talking about this being 'Red October'-very calming, very good for the market-a responsible comment by the Acting Prime Minister. What would have happened if nothing had been asked about these matters yesterday and if we had gone on pursuing you about the debacle in nursing homes or about the debacle with the trust tax situation or about the terrible circumstance with regard to your of failures in anti-dumping and its conseworld quences? People would have been saying, 'You ignored the main game. You were off the big issues yesterday, fiddling while Rome burned. ' We had to ask those serious questions and we did. The only overblown rhetoric about it that was not considered, calm and and reasonable was from the Acting Prime for Minister with his firestorm comments. We had a whole lot of media comment after what happened yesterday in the parliament about Telstra and about the stock market. Essentially, the media comment about the Telstra was derived from the volunteered stock public comments-not in answer to my purquestion-from the Minister for Finance and Administration where he was trying to inform the public about his concern and his view of the consequences, which is not an unreasonthing to do. But, if you are worried that there could be media speculation about what might be happening with the Telstra share have a look at where the Australian public gets their information from, whom they were referring to and what they said. If you ecodiscount for the John Short factorMr Hockey-What was his account?",87
165,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for North Sydney might as well have written it. It is a much more objective assessment than we got him. Nobody else made any reference to any matter other than the comments made by the Minister for Finance and Administration. It was not in response to us; it was in his breakfast comments. If the response had been as measured and as serious as the questions, the nation would have been well served. Even the Treasurer, I am told, on Monday the tried to gi ve a serious, measured response to to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question about the stock market. I wish I had been here to see it. The thought of the Treasurer giving a serious, measured response would have been a Thespian alternative to that which we usually get. It would nearly have heen as good as the piece of fiction which the Minister for Finance and Administration came up with at question time today about our policy on Telstra. I wanted it tabled so that we could submit it for the Booker Prize for fiction. not know what they are putting in the water over there in that office.",89
166,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It could have been Helen Demidenko.,90
167,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, it could well have been. But let us now get to this serious allegation that we tried somehow or other to undermine the Telstra float. From discussions with people in the market, were we assured that, provided the question was reasonable and carefully phrased, there would be no tremors in the market? Yes, we sought that assurance and received it. There were none. Mr Hockey-You're kidding!",90
168,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There were none, and you know it. If there had been something up on your black screen that caused concern, maybe you would have seen a response in the market. There was none. In response to media questions, we made three points in addition to our primary view that TeIstra should not be on sale at all. points were that the matter of the timing was the government's call, not ours, and that we were concerned to ensure that the taxpayers got value for their asset-the asset which they currently own. We want to say, 'Don't sell it in circumstances where they're not going to get value for their asset.' And we want to be reassured that the government is not just going on with this sale against good advice because electorally and politicallyMr Hockey-Against whose good advice?",90
169,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, I am saying that I want to be reassured that it is not the circumstance that they are receiving the advice that, electorally and politically, they have to go on with the sale because they have made electoral and political commitments. Their whole strategy is based upon this sale. Those are the things which we want to be assured of. We are not. We had the easy political opportunity to score by joining the Democrats' call for the float to be deferred and we did not. We did not and we do not join that. I have said it would be an irresponsible thing for us to do. It was a reasonable thing for us to ask whether the government had considered using this clause. The minister made it clear in his I do answer that that was so. It is obvious that they would have considered it; it would be irresponsible of them not to. It was obvious that the market and the media were speculating about it. The minister confirmed that in his answer. I want to reiterate: we will not be bluffed or bullied out of asking questions in similar circumstances in the future. And when you become the opposition, which is getting closer and closer, you will not be bluffed out of it either. If the same circumstances ever arise, you would not be bluffed out of it either and you should not be. You will be entitled to ask the question, and we will answer it. (Time expired)",90
170,Mr FAHEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I sat back and listened with great attention to what the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) said in respect of this matter of public importance proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), Those and I have not heard the apology that I believe was well and truly on the cards. In fact, I felt there was no other option but for the honourable member for Canberra to come into this House today and to apologise-not to me, not to the government but to the Australian people. What the honourable member for Canberra was about yesterday-it was very obvious not just to Mr Short but to everybody on this side of the House and to the public more broadly-and what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) and it seems the entire Labor team were about yesterday was a conspiracy, this time with the Democrats, to scuttle the Telstra sale. They opposed it, despite the views they expressed in opposition, they opposed it when the legislation came before this House and they have continued to state-publicly at least-that they oppose it. As I indicated a little earlier in the afternoon, that is not the view of all members of the opposition and some considerable debate is going on at the present time as to a further selldown. Of course that further selldown will not occur under the control of Labor because they will not get that opportunity. I make it clear again that any further sell down from the on track. government will occur only after the government has consulted with the Australian people. It was a disgraceful episode in public administration that we witnessed perpetrated by the Australian Labor Party yesterday. It was designed, as I have said, to scuttle the Telstra sale, but what it did was simply undermine some 820,000 applications that had been lodged by about midmorning today by the Australian people. I noted the figures were given earlier in this debate by the honourable member for North Sydney in respect of the number of shareholders in other large Australian companies. I can say at this point-and there are still some days to go before the retail offer closes-that that figure of 820,000 indicates very clearly what the Australian people think about this great Australian company. Further, I can indicate that over 53,000 employees of Telstra have made application under the employee share ownership plan to acquire shares in Telstra. That represents over 80 per cent of those eligible to in that company. I think it is fair to say-and I am sure even the members opposite would acknowledge this-that there are no associations between the government and the employees of Telstra. In fact, I seem to recalland I am sure my ministerial colleague who has just entered the chamber, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) could well recollect-some the antics of the Telstra employees and the communications union prior to the last election when government very honestly said to the Australian people, 'We intend to sell one-third of Telstra.' Those 53,000 members of the Telstra work force I would think would be absolutely embarrassed by the behaviour yesterday, both in this chamber and outside, of members of the Labor Party, because they were seeking to talk down the shares. As I made abundantly clear yesterday, despite all of those prophets of doom and all of those hoping that we were in for some complete free fall in respect of our market, nothing had been indicated in the Telstra sale to suggest that we were other than I note the honourable member for Canberra, with his embarrassment, has now left the chamber. He went through 15 minutes of squirming. He tried to go back a decade or more to see if he could get some history that might back him up on all of this. Any trip back through memory lane will not excuse his behaviour or the behaviour of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition and Labor yesterday as they that sought to undermine the economy. They are happy only when there is bad news out there. They never smile when there are good figures and good news, when the inflation figures come through on a regular basis or when those five reductions the interest rates were in fact discussed in this chamber as a result of the decision of the Reserve Bank over the past 18 months or so. None Of that gives any joy to the Labor Party. The only joy the Labor Party gets is when someone is in trouble and when of course yesterday that market correction was taking place. That market correction has been going on for acquire shares some considerable time. But that did not in any shape or form interfere with the demand, both in terms of volume and, dare I say, price, by the institutions both here in Australia and offshore. The institutions have applied for considerably more than the entire shares available at this stage for Telstra and they certainly are not going to get the entire allocation of sharesthat has been made clear from the beginning. The demand is there in terms of price be the cause, as at today, more than 94 per cent of those institutions bidding for shares in Telstra are above the high point in the range-and that range, as I am sure all honourable members would know, is between $2.80 and $3.30. Yet I am supposed to go along with this scuttling process, to add to it and to give them the words they sought yesterday'Telstra has to be pulled.' We get this outlandish rubbish from the Democrats. Of course it is not entirely the Labor Party which is at fault here in seeking to tum down the economy, in seeking to talk it down, in seeking to undermine it, in seeking to undermine the markets and in seeking to destroy the investments of hundreds of thousands of small Australians. We saw a performance by the Democrats which contained within it the usual amount of lies. They talked about an $8 billion reduction in the price that the government would get for Telstra. That of course has nothing to do with the facts. It is simply in line with some of the speculation that has never been contributed to by me or anybody in government since this whole process of Telstra started. Sadly, the member for Canberra unwittingly, I suspect, and naively was caught up in this process of seeing if they could predict gloom and make it happen, which was what the exercise was about. We have seen the entire Labor Party from the Leader of the Opposition right through and the Democrats condemned universally-not just by John Short, as the honourable member for Canberra would want us to believe, but by the market. From a number of discussions that I had yesterday-as I indicated, I was monitoring what was occurring in the .market-if there was any belief that there might be some sensibility from the Labor Party in terms of economic policy, economic management or otherwise, that responsibility or otherwise went out the door with the approach that was taken yesterday. I believe that Mr Short said it appropriately. As the honourable member for North Sydney said today, Labor sought to reinforce investor fears by raising the spectre of a stock market collapse, forcing the government to delay the Telstra float. It did not work yesterday and, I suspect, despite the blackboard down at the futures market which quotes what might occur in the House from time to time-which keeps the members in the trading rooms informed of what the debate is in this chamber and in other parts of this parliament-there is little likelihood that they will take much notice of anything that is said in the future by the Labor Party because its members are seen to be nothing but scaremongers on this issue and on everything else. The Labor Party will not undermine the foundations that this government has in place. Those foundations are about low interest rates. Those foundations are about low inflation. Those foundations underpin sustainable growth. Those foundations are the best asset this government and this nation have had in the course of the past week when we have seen the correction of the equity market, not just in Australia but on the international scene. Australia was in the lucky position, as a result of a change of government, to be able to withstand whatever the outcomes might have been on other markets. I can also say very clearly that we will continue to act responsibly in respect of the Telstra sale, as we have from the beginning. (Time expired)",90
171,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What an appalling outbreak of disloyalty this matter of public importance represents. We have seen a lot of disloyalty on the coalition side recently. We have seen the revolt on the nursing homes legislation in the caucus room. We have seen National Party MPs crossing the floor on native title. But this matter of public importance takes the cake. It refers to: The urgent need for all who attempt to influence public opinion to demonstrate a responsible reaction to the current volatility on world equity markets What a clear, naked attack on the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) who, in the last couple of days, referred to 'firestorms in Asia' and today topped that with 'Red October'. I think we have heard references to 'a meltdown' as well. What a clear, naked attack this is by the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) on his Acting Prime Minister. The member for North Sydney is not the only one engaging in this. Today, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) made another thinly veiled attack on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)in his absence, let me say. The Treasurer said earlier: I do want to make one point about the stock market, and it is this: obviously, with volatility on the stock market people should refrain from trying to use that for ... political partisanship. The memory of the member for North Sydask ney, who came into the parliament in 1996 like me, perhaps might not go back this far, but I have no doubt that when the Treasurer made those remarks he knew perfectly well that his leader, the day after the October stock market collapse, asked this question of policies. the nation's Treasurer in 1987: Does the Treasurer agree that investment, jobs the Budget deficit are also likely to be affected therefore, that the strategy behind the Government's last Budget has been significantly undermined? Prime Minister Howard, in his capacity Leader of the Opposition in 1987, the after the October stock market collapse, asked that question of the then Treasurer. Now the Treasurer says that we should not be talking about the stock market or trying use it for politically partisan purposes. All the Treasurer is trying to do is to make his Prime Minister look bad. Not only did he ask question, but the then opposition followed that by moving a matter of public importance which talked about: The urgent need to recognise the vulnerability the Australian economy to sudden shifts of world economic sentiment. That was the sort of thing the then Leader the Opposition, now Prime Minister, was raising at that time. In the debate, he went further and said: Our concern is that hethe Treasurerwill sit on his hands again and he will not nise that one cannot live in the fool's paradise imagining that some adjustment to economic might not be necessary as a result of the convulpointed sions of the past few weeks. How apt in today's circumstances that we should hear a line such as that. It really appalling to hear the member for North Sydney attacking his Acting Prime Minister in the blatant and flagrant way that he this afternoon. It is most unfortunate and inappropriate to hear the Treasurer ing the Prime Minister in his absence. This matter of public importance refers to the need for a 'responsible reaction to the current volatility on world equity markets'. What has the government's reaction been? We need to answer that question before we can whether it has been a responsible reaction. The government's reaction has been to say, 'It's okay. We've got the fundamentals right.' The government has been saying that the current crisis on world stock markets is an 1987 endorsement of the government's economic That is not a responsible reaction at all. and That is a complacent and self-serving reacand, tion. What the current volatility-and what the Acting Prime Minister refers to as the 'firestorms in Asia' - says is that we have as wasted the opportunities of the economic day upturn to bring unemployment down. We have failed to make hay while the sun has been shining. When the coalition came into government, to it flattened the economy and talked it down. It talked incessantly of the $10 billion deficit, the $10 billion black hole. That talking down that of the economy was immensely damaging. What was the truth of the matter? The actual budget outcome for 1995-96 was a deficit of $5 billion, about half the figure given by the of Treasurer, and the forecast actual budget outcome for 1996-97 was not a deficit at all; it was a surplus of $464 million, forecast to of grow to a surplus of $6 billion. The Treasurer did not want to tell the parliament and the people the truth about that deficit because that did not suit the government's agenda of attacking community services. The Treasurer did not want to talk recogabout the real budget outcomes, he wanted to of talk about the underlying budget deficit. As policy the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has out previously, the Treasurer's misuse of that term has turned the underlying budget outcome into the lying budget outcome. Even is when we look at how this figure was arrived at, we can see that only $0.6 billion of it arose from spending decisions of the former has government; the rest came from changes in the parameters. They were lower inflation and undermin- lower employment growth. Lower inflation does not lead to a need for tightening of economic policy. It is, in fact, a good thing. It is exactly what the nation is trying to achieve. It helps us to achieve our savings objectives and the like. As for reduced employment growth, it absolutely makes no sense whatsoever to react to lower employment by substantial cutbacks, as the government did. Those cutbacks, with over 30,000 public servants losing their jobs, industry assistance programs being slashed and Working Nation being abandoned, further slowed employment growth. As a result, unemployment rose. The budget papers of 1996 admit that the effect of the budget would be a net contractionary impact on activity in 1996-97. Indeed, right from the outset, the government ran up the white flag on unemployment. Their unemployment forecasts showed that over the three years from 1996-97 employment growth would be only 5.3 per cent compared with a rise of 8.7 per cent in the three years under the previous government. They were only aiming at 440,000 additional jobs over the first three years compared with the 666,000 additional jobs in Labor's previous three years. That is all they aimed for. It was pitiful. It was a declaration of failure right from the outset, and this from a Prime Minister who admits that unemployment is Australia's No. 1 problem. Indeed, their record has been even worse than their aims. There are 4,600 fewer full time jobs than at the time of the first Howard budget. We have the largest number of long term unemployed in Australia for 31 months, as of September 1997. We have had 17,000 more people becoming long-term unemployed and their numbers up 58,000 since the Howard government started cutting Labor's successful jobs program back in May of 1996an appalling record. The government has been failing to make hay while the sun shines and now we see the skies, particularly over Asia, clouding over. Where are our 'five minutes of economic sunshine'? We are yet to get our first 60 seconds of economic sunshine from you. Where are we now? We had the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry yesterday expressing concern that 30,000 jobs could be lost following the slide in world share markets and Asian currencies. We have industry groups representing tourism, farmers, coalmin- first time. ing and manufacturing also expressing concern that job losses will follow in the wake of the financial markets crash. Mr Fitzgibbon-What is the unemployment rate?",92
172,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is 8.6 per cent-higher than what this government inherited. We have had the Tourism Council warning of a loss of tourism; we have got education authorities warning of a reduction in overseas students; in the bush, the National Farmers Federation has said that it expects existing growth to fall between 0.3 and 0.8 per cent. The Herald-Sun has reported that the Asian currency crisis could strip a billion dollars from the value of Australia's rural industries. It is not as if we were starring in Asia in any event. I have an editorial from the Los Angeles Times talking about the way the failure of Australia to tackle the statements of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has reduced our standing in Asia. This editorial talks about Hanson proving to be a onewoman wrecking machine for the image of Australia. It is not as if we were starring there in any event. What we have is a situation where the Prime Minister is fiddling while, according to the Acting Prime Minister, South-East Asia burns---completely inactive, sitting on his hands, complacent and cautious as always, to this nation's detriment. The government's response has not been a responsible response, as the member for North Sydney would have urged us. We need a lot better from this government. We need a focus on economic growth and a change in the kinds of policies which have caused this nation to stagnate-its economy completely flat.",94
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion has concluded. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1997-98 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Fahey, and read a Second Reading",94
174,Mr FAHEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1997-98, together with Appropriation Bill (No.4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the additional estimates for 1997-98. In these bills, parliament is asked to priate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1997-98 under Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. The additional appropriations in these three bills total some $1,684 million; $1,173 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), $510 million in Appropriation Bill (No.4) and less than half a million dollars in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2). These amounts are partly offset by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1997-98. Reflecting the government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs, these savings, amounting to some $373 million in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations, which has been distributed to honourable members. After allowing for prospective savings, the total appropriations sought represent a net increase of $1,311 million in appropriations for 1997-98, an increase of about three per cent on the amounts made available through the annual appropriations at the time of the 1997-98 budget. Honourable members should note, however, that this increase does translate to a similar increase in either the estimated headline or underlying outlays as: (a) the appropriations include amounts which are functionally classified as revenue or financing transactions; and (b) the figures relate only to expenditures financed by annual appropriations, which comprise about 30 per cent of budget headline outlays. They do not include variations to estimates of expenditures from special appropriations, transactions recorded through the Trust Fund or Loan Fund; nor do they incorporate any revisions to receipt items which are offset within outlays. I tum now to the main areas for which the government seeks additional provisions in the approAppropriation Bill (No.3) 1997-98 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the government. Running costs appropriations provide for the recurrent and minor capital costs of agencies in providing government services. The total gross supplementation for running costs for all departments and of $269 million. After allowing for estimated savings in running cost appropriations of $84 million, the net increase in the provision for running costs of $185 million represents an increase of about 1Y:z per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1). Principal factors contributing to this increase are higher than anticipated carryovers of unspent moneys from 1996-97 and borrowings against the forward estimates. Gross additional estimates of some $111 million are sought for the Defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1997-98. This figure includes: $12 million for compensation and legal expenses in respect of the military compensation scheme; $6 million for ex gratia payments for additional military compensation agreed by the government earlier this year; $88 million for equipment and stores for high priority logistic items including spares and equipment repair activities; and $4 million for Defence cooperation to provide urgent assistance to the Papua New Guinea Defence Organisation. The increases have been partly offset by reductions of $72 million in other Defence annual appropriations, giving a net increase of some $39 million. In addition, Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1997-98 includes provision for: $13 million for medical services and $23 million for pharmaceutical services for veterans, reflecting the government's commitment to maintain effective care for an ageing veteran population; $245 million for the maintenance of veterans in non-departmental institutions, largely reflecting to a self-balancing transfer of $189 million from the nursing homes benefit special appropriation in the Department of Health and Family Services following the government's decision that responsibility for residential aged care for veterans first time. would be centralised in the Department of Veterans' Affairs; $27 million for payment to the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, reflecting a delay in the time of the commencement of the new employment services market anticipated at budget time; $71 million for managing surplus staff of the former Department of Administrative Services business units for which the actual costs could not be reliably determined until arrangements for the sale of the businesses had been completed; $20 million for estate management expenses to meet the estimated costs in 1997-98 of the sale of the first tranche of Commonwealth office buildings; $40 million for the cost of major asset sales, largely attributable to an anticipated increase in the sales commission as a result of an expected increase in the proceeds of the partial privatisation of Telstra; $31 million for the Australian National Railways Commission, largely reflecting the costs of interest on its outstanding debt following a delay in the anticipated assumption of that debt by the Commonwealth; and $174 million for the assumption of the debt of the Australian National Railways Commission principally as a result of a decision to repay early one of the commission's loans. The balance of some $149 million in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1997-98 is made up of minor variations across a range of programs in most departments and agencies. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1997-98 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Fahey, and read a Second Reading",95
175,Mr FAHEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. In Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1997-98, appropriations totalling $510 million, additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No.2) 1997-98, are sought for capital works and services; payments to or for the states, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory; advances and loans; and for other services. The proposed appropriations are required to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in the budget appropriation measures. The additions are necessitated by certain cost and price increases that have occurred since the budget, together with other commitments that have been made by the government. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Act (No.2) 1997-98 include: $35 miIIion for payments to the states and Territories for legal aid to cover funding under the new arrangements with the states which is largely offset by a reduction in the budget time estimate of Commonwealth direct funding of legal aid; $25 miIIion for payments for hearing services under interim arrangements as a result of the deferral of the introduction of contestable funding arrangements for the hearing services program from 1 July 1997 to 1 November 1997. This increase is fully offset by a reduction in estimated payments for contestable hearing services through a voucher system; $30 million for assistance to the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games to reimburse SOCOG for any income and sales tax paid; $58 million for rural adjustment largely as a result of 'exceptional circumstances increases' for South Burnett, Gippsland and extension of drought relief in parts Queensland and NSW and a transfer from the integrated rural policy package for repayment of interest rate subsidies commitrange ments under the rural adjustment scheme; $22 million for assistance to Tasmania under the Tasmanian regional forest agreejourned. ment; $21 million for income support, counselling, re-establishment grants and for service delivery under the farm family restart scheme; $12 million to meet the Commonwealth's share of the shortfall in the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority's recovery of the net cost of t-e production of electricity; and $29 million to the Department of Social Security for computer equipment; $29 million for compensation to the states and territories for the extension of fringe benefits to pensioners and older, long-term allowees and beneficiaries; $10 million for the Newcastle assistance move: package following the announcement by BHP that it would cease its steel manufacturing operations in Newcastle; $10 million for assistance through the states for regional assistance to ameliorate the impact on local communities of the restructure of the Australian National Railways Commission. This increase is offset by equivalent reduction in direct funding on this program by the Commonwealth; $16 million for payment to the National Rail Corporation under clause 5(b)(4) of the national rail shareholders' agreement meet its outstanding obligations; $96 million for payments to the states in lieu of stamp duty on the sale by the Commonwealth of the leases of airports due journed. to a recent High Court decision that the states are unable to collect stamp duty relating to the sale of Commonwealth properties within state jurisdictions. The Commonwealth will collect the stamp duty and make equivalent payments to affected state governments in respect of the sale of leases of the Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne airports. of The remaining $117 million included in Appropriation Bill (No.4) comprises minor the increases in a number of programs across a of portfolios.

177,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (4.28 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Denial of certain capital losses Under the existing law, it is possible for corporate groups to multiply capital losses through manipulation of the capital gains tax provisions. This measure removes the benefit of such losses where the loss was created by the rolling over of an asset before 3 p.m. on 29 April 1997. However, losses already used prior to the announcement of the measure at 3 p.m. on 29 April 1997 will not be affected. These provisions will not apply to small businesses as defined in the provisions relating to the capital gains tax rollover relief small businesses. They would also not apply to certain assets used both before and after rollover in manufacturing businesses. The measure also amends the anti-avoidance provisions contained in part IV A of the act to enable those provisions to apply to capital loss creation schemes in the year in which the losses are created. The amendments to part IV A apply to capital losses resulting from schemes entered into after 3 p.m. on 29 April 1997. Concessional tracing rules for company loss, etc, provisions This bill gives effect to the government's 1996-97 budget announcement that the prior and current year loss and debt deduction rules for companies will be amended so that two concessional tracing rules that are available to trusts under the trust loss measures will also be available to companies. This amendment will apply to losses and debts incurred in the 1996-97 income year and later income years. The two concessional tracing rules are the family trust concession and the alternative condition. The family trust concession will apply when a family trust holds an interest - irectly or indirectly in a company. The trustee will be taken to beneficially own the interests as an individual for the purposes of the continuity of beneficial ownership test. The alternative condition relates to the situation where a company cannot pass the continuity of majority beneficial ownership test because non-fixed trusts hold interests in the company. Under the alternative condition, the loss or debt deduction will be deductible if certain conditions are satisfied. These amendments will allay taxpayer concerns by making the law consistent with the way it has been generally interpreted by the Commissioner of Taxation where the majority of shares of a company are owned by certain non-fixed trusts. They will also ensure consistency between the company loss rules and the trust loss rules where tracing of interests is required. Fringe benefits tax The bill will amend the fringe benefits tax legislation to extend and simplify the existing for exemption for taxi travel. It will also exempt car parking benefits provided by certain small the businesses unless the car parking is provided in commercial car parks. Further, the bill will simplify the 'arranger' provisions. The exemption for car parking provided by small businesses also involves amendments to the income tax legislation. These measures will reduce fringe benefits tax compliance costs for small businesses. The measures were foreshadowed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his statement 'More time for business' on 24 March 1997 in response to recommendations made by the Small Business Deregulation Task Force in November 1996. The changes to the arranger provisions result from a review undertaken by the Australian Taxation Office that was announced in the Prime Minister's statement. The changes to the exemption for taxi travel and the exemption for car parking provided by small business employers will apply from I April 1997. The changes to the arranger provisions will apply from 1 April 1998. Temporary, importation of goods The bill amends the sales tax law so that goods imported into Australia under a temporary importation exemption, used in Australia, exported and then reimported are subject to sales tax at the time of the second importation. The amendment will correct a deficiency in the sales tax law. Payments of tax by small companies This bill will change the company tax instalment system to allow small companies and other small instalment taxpayers to pay their likely tax on 15 December following their income year and to pay the balance of their tax liability on the following 15 March. Corresponding dates will apply for taxpayers that balance on dates other than 30 June. Consequential changes to the date for classifiPassive cation as small, medium or large will also be made. These measures will allow small companies extra time to meet their income tax obligations and will also ensure that the classification of an instalment taxpayer can based on their most recent year's income tax return. Dividend imputation and RSAs The bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure that no franking credit or debit arises from the payment or refund of tax where those amounts are attributable to the retirement savings account business of a life assurance company. This amendment, which will apply to franking credits and debits arising for life assurance companies after the date of introduction of the bill, will implement the government's 1996 announcement concerning RSAs by bringing the dividend imputation treatment of RSAs for life assurance companies into line with the treatment for ordinary companies. Deductible expenditure and CGT cost bases The bill proposes amendments to the income tax law in relation to the capital gains tax cost base provisions. These amendments were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 13 May 1997 as part of the government's 1997-98 budget. The bill will ensure that taxpayers will no longer be able to include amounts of expenditure as part of the cost base or indexed cost base of an asset to the extent that the expenditure is deductible. The amendments are consistent with the principle that an item of expenditure should be either deductible for income tax purposes or included in the capital gains tax cost base of an underlying asset, but not both. The amendments will prevent double deductions that could currently arise in calculating the capital gain on the disposal of an asset. The amendments will apply to assets acquired after 7.30 p.m. AEST on 13 May 1997. However, expenditure incurred before 1 July 1999 in respect of underlying land or buildings acquired on or before 13 May 1997 will not be subject to the measure. income of insurance companies The bill also contains amendments announced in the 1997-98 budget to correct a deficiency in the formulae used to calculate be the passive income of controlled foreign insurance companies that are subject to accruals taxation to ensure that the original policy intent is achieved. The new formulae, which were developed in consultation with the insurance industry, will exclude from a company's passive income only the income derived on assets that are referrable to insurance policies owned by non-residents that are not related to the company. The amendments will apply to passive income derived on or after 1 July 1997. Average calculated liabilities of life insurance companies This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to require life companies to use average calculated liabilities, rather than calculated liabilities at the end of the year of income, as the basis for determining: the amount of income that relates to immediate annuity policies; the amount of income that is attributable to policies issued by overseas branches; and the amount of income and capital gains to be allocated to each class of assessable income. The amendments apply from the first year of income that commences on or after 29 April 1997. However, the amendments will apply to the preceding year of income if a significant event occurred in one of the insurance funds of a life company in the period from 29 April 1997 to the end of that year of income. Depreciation The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is being amended to ensure that, for tax exempt entities which became subject to taxation before 3 July 1995, depreciation deductions and balancing adjustments are based on the notional written down values of their depreciable assets as if the entity had always been subject to taxation. The calculation of notional written down values will include any loadings that would have applied under the former section 57 AG if the entity had always been subject to taxation. Full details of the measures in the bill are· contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

178,Mr MILES,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (4.38 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Medicare levy low income exemption thresholds The bill increases the low income exemption thresholds that ensure that low income individuals and families are exempt from the Medicare levy. The increases were announced in the 1997-98 budget. The thresholds for the 1997-98 financial year will be increased to $13,389 for individuals and $22,594 for families. The family threshold continues to be increased by $2, I 00 for each dependent child. These increased exemption thresholds result in changes to the income ranges over which the exemptions are shaded-out. The new upper limits of the ranges for individuals and families will be $14,474 and $24,425 respectively. The individual exemption threshold is also used to provide an exemption from the Medicare levy surcharge for a low income person who would otherwise be liable for the surcharge because of the level of income of the person's spouse. The exemption level there is also to be increased to $13,389. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members.

(14) A lease under section 5 of the Crown Lands Act of the Northern Territory. This amendment replaces schedule 4. I also table the supplementary explanatory memorandum. The amendment to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 substitutes a new substant of schedule 4 which contains a new schedule 1 to the Native Title Act 1993 referred to in the definition of 'scheduled interest'. Generally speaking, the existing Native Title Act only provides a framework for dealing with native title. It says little about whether or where native title may still exist in Australia and, apart from the very limited validation provisions in division 2 of part 2, it says nothing about whether native title mayor may not have been extinguished. The act leaves these issues to be determined by the common law, an approach which has given rise to significant uncertainty for native title claimants and the holders of other interests in land. The purpose of the proposed amendments dealing with confirmation of extinguishment of native title is to limit this uncertainty. The types of leases included in the schedule are leases which the Commonwealth and the relevant state or territory believe with reasonable certainty have provided exclusive possession and have, therefore, extinguished native title. The government believes that the grant of a right conferring exclusive possession has extinguished native title on the basis of Mabo No. 2 and Wik. The grant on or before 23 December 1996 of a lease that appears in the schedule will be a 'previous exclusive possession act' because of the operation of a new subparagraph 23B(2)(c)(i). A state or territory may legislate to confirm that previous exclusive possession acts attributable to it extinguish native title the land or waters in relation to which the act takes place. This is based on new section 23E. By operation of the new section 237 A, such previous exclusive possession acts will have permanently extinguished all native title to the area covered by the act. The schedule principally contains specific types of residential, commercial, community purpose and agricultural leases. If there was significant doubt about whether a type of lease conferred a right of exclusive possession, it has not been included in the schedule. There are no pas toralleases in the schedule, nor are there lesser interests, such as licences or permits. The definition of a scheduled interest in section 249C expressly excludes mining leases. Neither the Commonwealth nor the Australian Capital Territory have included any leases in the schedule. The Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund heard evidence that the total area that would be covered by the schedule is less than 7.7 per cent of the total area of Australia. This represents approximately 5.8 per cent of New South Wales, 7.4 per cent of South Australia, 22.3 per cent of Queensland and 0.37 per cent of Western Australia. The areas in the Northern Territory and Victoria are less than one per cent of the total area of each jurisdiction. A draft of the schedule was made available to representatives of both the pastoral and mining industries and indigenous interests on 20 August 1997. Discussions were held subsequently with representatives of ATSIC and the National Indigenous Working Group on Native Title, which resulted in a number of lease purposes being removed before the schedule was released publicly on 23 September. The schedule moved as an amendment is the same as that released and circulated on 23 September, apart from the following. As a result of representations by indigenous groups, the reference to tillage leases granted under the Western Australia Land Regulations 1851 has been removed. The leases contained a reservation for Aboriginal access. A reference inadvertently overlooked when to the schedule was compiled to perpetual leases granted under the South Australian Lyrup Village Association (District Extension) Act 1921 has been included in subclause 37(4). The method of citing Northern Territory legislation has been changed to reflect the Northern Territory government's practice and an incorrect reference to section 2 of the Victorian Land Act 1962 has been omitted. The schedule contains both historic-that is, no longer in effect-and current leases in determining whether any particular lease should be included in the schedule. The relevant state or territory and the Commonwealth have principally had regard to the substantive rights and obligations of the grantee under the relevant legislation. Regard was had to a variety of factors in the relevant legislation, being factors of the kind to which the High Court had regard in the Wik decision. In relation to that, I move: That further consideration of postponed. I point out to members that this would not preclude in any way debate of the amendments in the remaining portion of the debate of this bill. Question resolved in the affirmative.",100
180,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,This is possibly the fourth incarnation of schedule 4. Only Dr Who has had more incarnations. It is a beast that has been designed to last forever. Mr Williams-Maybe James Bond.,126
181,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"That is probably right. If we were so bold as to excise its more obviously fraudulent claims to extinguishment, the minister can, under the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, put them back by way of regulation, along with a few more whimsical additions, any time he or she so wishes. Eventually they might get it right, but not this time. This wish list for extinguishment is a fatal combination of poor policy and worse law. The government has taken an option laden with the potential for litigation and massive compensation. The decision to declare that previous exclusive possession acts permanently extinguish native title is a policy decision. It is not the law. It does not derive from the common law, where the less invasive notion of suppression for the term of an inconsistent grant would allow for the revival of native title. It claims to offer certainty by listing a schedule grants of interest that this legislation declares to have permanently extinguished native title. 'Bucket loads of extinguishment', as the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) says. Where did this schedule come from? Public servants produced a list of criteria which they say could amount to permanent extinguishment of native title. The state and territory governments put forward wish lists of legislation which they hope might fit the criteria. The state and Commonwealth public servants applied the criteria, and presto ! We had a schedule of interests that the minister declares to have permanently extinguished native title. No need for the courts; we can do it by the amendment be administrative fiat. Just in case they may have got it wrong, the bill includes a 'Whoops, I'm sorry' clause; that is, clause 23J in division 2B. Through this provision, if the schedule that purports to merely list acts of past extinguishment in fact itself brings about extinguishment, then compensation will be payable. Thank you very much! Some of the more outrageous try-oTIS have been excluded from earlier exposure drafts, but I reiterate that they can be put back in at a later date, as long as they have the numbers in the Senate. The schedule introduced today differs from that released on 23 September 1997, and that is conceded by the Attorney General (Mr Williams). Could it be that the government has read the minority report of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund? I note that it is the Western Australian tillage leases issued under its Land Regulations 1859, cited by the minority as an example of an instrument falsely represented as granting a right to exclusive possession, that has been withdrawn from the latest version of the schedule. The problem lies, in part, in the method used in deriving this schedule. Consultation was scant. Chief Justice Brennan and others made it clear in the Wik decision that at common law the test for determining the effect of an interest in land on native title inin volves, among other things, an examination of the grant document, be it a lease, title deed or whatever. The creators of this schedule have not looked at any individual lease or title documents. They have simply applied their general criteria to hundreds of pieces of colonial and post-colonial legislation and summarily declared them as instruments that have permanently extinguished Native Title. Accordingly, the extinguishing effects of the grants allegedly derived from instruments in the schedule bear no relation to their effect in common law. Despite the protestations of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Attorney General and now the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin) that the bill will not legislatively extinguish native title, the explanatory memorandum confirms that the operation of this schedule will extinguish such title. At page 13, the explanatory memorandum tells us: The Schedule may contain some leases the grant of which were Category D past acts, such as the grant of a commercial lease from the Crown in one capacity to the Crown in another capacity. It should be note here that, under the existing Native Title Act, section 232, a category D past act did not extinguish native title. Further on, the explanatory memorandum says: The inclusion of a lease of this kind in the Schedule means that its grant will extinguish native Michael Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner, put the situation into perspective in his evidence to the parliamentary joint committee when he said: To proceed at this level of generality is indeed 'pregnant with the possibility of injustice'. This process is designed to enable the Parliament of Australia to dispossess, once and for all, native title holders across this continent. If the national values of this country include genuine respect for justice and equality before the law, then the federal parliament must reject the schedule of extinguishment. I foreshadow that we will be voting against this at the third reading stage.",126
182,Mrs STONE,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"As the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) stated a very short time ago, the Native Title Act 1993 currently says very little about whether or where native title may still exist in Australia and, apart from the validation provisions in division 2 of part 2, it says nothing about whether native title mayor may not have been extinguished. This is an enormous problem in terms of some sense of security and understanding of what rights Aboriginal people have in Australia today. The Native Title Act generally leaves the issues to be determined by common law. This has given rise to significant uncertainty. The purpose of the proposed amendments dealing with confirmation of extinguishment of native title is to limit this uncertainty. The main effect will be to allow the states and territories to confirm that native title is extinguished on exclusive tenures such as freehold and residential leases and extinguished to the extent of any inconsistency on non-exclusive agricultural and non-exclusive pastoral leases. An argument has been made that this approach pre-empts the common law. However, to leave these issues to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the courts has the following implications: cost and uncertainty arising from involving potentially many thousands of respondents to claims; so long as there is a question about the legal status of particular tenures, the Registrar of the NNTI is not able to reject a claim on that basis; and whether claims are registered or not, there can title. be no certainty under the Native Title Act, as currently drafted, about the capacity of governments to carry out future activity until there is a judicial determination. This would be an immensely expensive and time consuming process and, on the basis of Wik, this massive expenditure of generally public resources would deliver nothing tangible to Aboriginal people. From the government's point of view, such a massive expenditure for no or very little tangible benefit for Aboriginal people cannot be justified. It is, in fact, a cruel diversion. Expenditure should be directed to determining where native title does exist and protecting the rights of the holders, not to confirming where it has been extinguished. That is just time wasting. The opposition has suggested that exclusive possession is not the appropriate test. The majority in Wik was made up of four separate judgments. There are some differences between the majority justices so it is difficult to establish what the majority test is. However, the grant of exclusive possession remains the major indicator of an implied intention to plainly and clearly extinguish native title. The bill also allows states and territories to confirm that the vesting of land in persons has extinguished native title. That is in subsections 23B(3), (4) and (5). This is vesting of particular lands or waters by or under legislation of a state or a territory. This provision is not intended to catch the acquisition of sovereignty by the Crown over any part of Australia which would fly in the face of the Mabo No. 2 and· Wik decisions. Nor is it intended to catch the simple management of crown land by a government. It is not intended to catch the creation of national parks or reservation of land generally or for a purpose. The vesting is limited to where exclusive possession has been given to a person, including a statutory authority-subsection 23B(3)-or where what is vested in a person is clearly equivalent to exclusive possessionsubsections 23B(4) and (5). The court held in Wik that there may have been some level of extinguishment of native title rights by the grant of a pastoral lease. Justice Kirby stated: Only if there is inconsistency between the legal interests of the lessee ... and the native title ... will such native title, to the extent of the inconsisthoroughly tency, be extinguished. The bill adopts this very test. Section 237 A provides that the extinguishment of native title is permanent. It has been said that this pre-empts and perhaps goes beyond the common law. Three judges of the High Court stated that extinguishment is permanent; four judges left the issue unresolved. It is the view of this government that to leave this issue unresolved adds to the already considerable uncertainty surrounding native title and land management in Australia. Some of the practical and conceptual difficulties that would result from the revival of native title for the lessees of the Wik pastoral leases were also identified by Chief Justice Brennan in his decision. There has been some confusion about references to the area of land which remains claimable under the Native Title Act if areas covered by previous exclusive possession acts cannot be claimed. The statistics show that this leaves 79 per cent of the land mass of Australia which can be claimed. The total area of Australia covered by the schedule is 7.7 per cent, freehold land is 12.8 per cent, so the figure for total land not claimable is only 20.5 per cent. I repeat: that leaves 79 per cent of the land mass of Australia which can be claimed. Therefore, this part of the bill is all about a better deal for Aboriginal people so that, at the end of the day, they are delivered an efficient and fair outcome.",127
183,Mr GARETH EVANS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"One of the fundamental grounds of the opposition's objection to this whole legislation is the way in which, over and over again, it overreaches beyond that which on any view is necessary to achieve certainty, predictability and a cleaning up of some of the problems that arise from the operation of the Native Title Act-the previous act passed in 1993and the Wik events that have followed subsequently. There is no clearer example of that overreach than in these provisions dealing with purported confirmation of extinguishment where previously exclusive possession has been granted. On the face of it, that looks a innocuous set of provisions implementing a principle which is well established at common law and about which there is no argument-that if there is exclusive possession in some form of tenure that has been granted in the past, that is an end to the matter. For better or worse, so far as native title is concerned, it has disappeared. However, we find that provisions of this legislation which, on the face of it, should be no more than declaratory in their effect and uncontroversial are, in fact, anything but that because they go way beyond what is necessary to simply declare the existing uncontested common law and get into some very controversial territory indeed. That the act operates in this way is an absolutely critical issue because, of course, other provisions of the act make very clear that you cannot even get started in the native title determination process if what is involved is a claim over a piece of land which has previously been the subject of a so-called 'exclusive possession act'. What are defined as exclusive possession acts is very critical and, to the extent that the legislation goes beyond that which the common law would clearly regard as such acts, then the government has a very real problem and we will certainly be opposing this part of the legislation. Schedule 4 is the main body of the new amending legislation which purports to deal with this. My colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has already explained some of the problems that are related to that particular schedule and all the overreach that is involved with it. I want to refer specifically to another part of this enterprise which overreaches so far as so-called confirmation is concerned and that is in relation to crown freehold. Many interests in land are vested in the Crown in one capacity or another. National parks, state forests and defence reserves are clear examples. Under the Native Title Act 1993, grants of freehold and leasehold title from the Crown in one capacity to the Crown in another capacity-for example, the Crown in right of a state to the Crown in right of Commonwealth, or from the Crown in right of a state to a particular statutory authority version of that Crown-these sorts of transactions expressly did not permanently extinguish native title. They were called 'category D past acts' in the jargon of the act, and it was up for subsequent judgment about what precisely their effect would be. At worse, they simply suppressed native title to the extent of any inconsistent enjoyment; they did not override it to the extent of permanent extinguishment. We now have, however, under the new regime in this amending legislation, a situation where Crown to Crown grants of a whole variety of characters will achieve the absolute extinguishment of the native title rights in question-and, in fact, do so permanently, just as Robert French of the Native Title Tribunal, as the minority report points out on page 68, has expressed very real concern about the impact of this provision on national parks in Western Australia, where the land is vested in a particular authority under the act by virtue of legislation passed by that state parliament. Other problems of this kind arise in relation to defence grants of land in the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth holds a number of large areas of land in the Northern Territory for defence purposes. Much of this is undeveloped, with indigenous people having a strong connection to it, but the prospect of securing native title claims in respect of that land by virtue of its history of previous Crown to Crown grant transactions makes it impossible to pursue. It is similar with the Yampi Sound defence area in the western Kimberley where, by virtue of a grant of that land from the Western Australian government to the· Commonwealth in times past-even though it is used only about three weeks a year for defence purposes, even though there are, on the face of it, very legitimate Aboriginal claims to native title over that land-by virtue of .a stroke of the legislative pen which we are being asked to endorse but will not, that land is no longer subject to effective claim if this legislation gets through. This is all in addition, of course, to other forms of extinguishment which are rampant throughout this legislation-bucket loads, as the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) said. And it is just manifestly unacceptable. (Time expired)",128
184,Mr TUCKEY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"O'Connor) (5.02 p.m.)The first responsibility of any parliament is to add to the law as much certainty and detail as possible so that it can be used in the courts and understood by the people on the street. It became very significant that this opposition when in government avoided that whenever possible. They seemed to think it was easier to come up with obscure proposals in their original Native Title Act and leave it to the courts to decide, notwithstanding what the High Court said in its Mabo judgment as it related to such titles as extinguish native title. The High Court said, in talking of these titles: The personal rights conferred by common law native title do not constitute an estate or interest in the land itself. They are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown, such as a grant in fee or a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession. And this schedule is a very conservative assessment and list of the types of title on issue throughout Australia by the constitutionally established land administrators, the state government land authorities. This is their opinion, the opinion of good, qualified and practising lawyers, who have in fact come up with a proposal as to what these properties consist of. We have taken the step that was incumbent upon the previous government to put them into the act, so that there is some instruction. We all well know that there is an opportunity to contest that decision. My committee was greatly concerned not to be pushed around politically and add to that list on political grounds, even by arguments put by our close supporters that might put that schedule at risk from that sort of legal attack. It is a good list. And it is list that gives some guidance to the courts and it gives encouragement to people, particularly some who have received native title claims when clearly their title deed, though it was described as a lease, gave them exclusive possession. If you want some further authorities on this, let me quote a one-time Leader of the Opposition, Leader of the Labor Party, Governor General of this country, Mr Bill Hayden AC. This is what he told the Premier of Queensland when he was asked to participate as a mediator in the Century Zinc process: What became abundantly clear to me quite early is how complex, even confusing, the drafting of the relevant legislation is:he is talking about the Labor native title legislationthe opportunities the legislation offers for outside manipulation of processes and for the adoption of measures which come perilously close to being extortion; the absence of any definition of who can be a claimant and the seemingly unlimited opportunities for people to register as such; the unrepresentativeness of some who register as claimant; the confusion and tension which can become rampant as long standing factional and family disputes within a tribal group manifest themselves at the expense of the issue to be settled; the jealousy and mistrust which can arise between different tribal bodies and which can impair negotiating processes. And this is by no means an exhaustive list of the problems which stud the present NT A. There is a fair and independent assessment. And what is it all about? It is about the confusion created by the present legislation and our attempts to fix it up. Extinguishment is not the result of the list, of the schedule; extinguishment is the result of the High Court Mabo decision. The judgment said-and I repeat: They are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown, such as a grant in fee or a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession. We have all this rubbish about 'after the event' and 'after the passing of this act, other titles can be included by regulation'. Of course they can; of course they should-if they meet that test. And you have that opportunity at any time in the future, in government or in opposition, to disallow them. (Time expired)",129
185,Mr MAREK,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I came to this parliament on the grounds that we would work to sort out the problems we have in this nation with native title. I campaigned strongly on the issue during the campaign preceding the March 1996 election. The Australian Labor Party should be condemned for their Native Title Act. They have misled the Aboriginal people in this country. Ultimately, when everything is said and done, under their legislation the Aboriginal people will get nothing. My greatest conviction is that we must have certainty and security of land tenure in this country so that all Australians are able to move forward and survive. Of all the amendments moved today, the amendments I will heavily focus on are amendments 33 to 38 that say that, for native title claims to be valid, Aboriginal people 'must have had their toes in the sand continually', and I stress the word 'continually'. As far as I am concerned, if someone has not had a continuous physical contact with the land for which they are making a claim they should not be entitled to make a claim. A spiritual connection should not give grounds for a claim under native title. On the other hand, as far as 'spiritual' is concerned, if it can be proved that the area has been or is a burial ground, in that particular case I would have no problem supporting a native title claim. However, 'connection' must amount to more than transitory access or intermittent access. It is not sufficient that a claimant's grandfather held a picnic on the land in the early 1900s or that the claimant's relatives crossed the land on motorbikes from South Australia. Claimants must be able to establish a physical connection. When conferring with the National Farmers Federation and other associations, the statement was made to me that the 10-point plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is better than what Australia would have had under Paul Keating and the Labor Party's native title legislation. On those grounds the Prime Minister should be congratulated for having the gumption to address the native title problem the best way he saw fit. As I have already said, I came to this parliament having made a commitment to the people of Capricornia that, to the best of my ability, I would leave no rock unturned in ensuring that the native title issue was resolved to the betterment of Australian society. It is not only my opinion, but it is the opinion of the majority of the people I represent in Capricornia that the Australian Labor Party's native title legislation is a no-win situation farmers, graziers, pastoralists and Aboriginals. Wik is having a disastrous effect on primary production, mining, gas production and waterfront development-the list goes on. Industry development creates jobs, jobs for Australians-black, white or brindle. The representation most often made to me by the people of Capricornia is that they want a one-off package that addresses all the issues for our Aboriginal friends. I particularly refer to schedule No 1 of the amendments that have been moved here today. The people of Capricornia want a package that delivers better health, better education and better employment prospects for Aboriginal people so they can own the land that they are living on. I expressly refer to the deed of grant in trust land where Aboriginal people currently have communities. That land could be turned into freehold land so that the Aboriginal people can develop it. This would give the Aboriginal people of this great nation certainty, security and a better quality of life. The people on both sides of the debate would own their land and both parties would be legally and financially responsible for the land. I have listened to a great deal of the debate on this issue and I have spoken to many people within the electorate of Capricornia about native title. I must stand firm and drive these amendments, in particular amendment Nos 33 to 38 moved by the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly), as they strengthen the 10-point plan and give certainty and security of land tenure within this country. Mr GARETH EV ANS (Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (5.11 p.m.)-A further point of concern for the Opposition involving overreach in this legislation goes to point 4 of the so-called 10-point plan-the issue of coexistence between pastoral leaseholders, native titleholders and claimants. This is an area in which the National Party has a lot to be ashamed of, in particular the dissident noisy ones up in the comer there who have gone absolutely beyond any reasonable constraint in arguing for the absolute extinguishment of any remaining rights of native titleholders in relation to pastoral for leases. They showed their colours with the amendments that were moved earlier on today. I make the point very clearly that it is reasonable for this legislation to meet the reasonable expectations of pastoralists and farmers so far as the use of their land is concerned. Had the legislation remained unamended after the Wik case it would be the case, as was pointed out earlier on by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman); that the existing regime would imply or would require compulsory acquisition right to negotiate for a lot of forms of additional diversification activity on pastoral leases which had traditionally been allowable provided a proper process was gone through with the state authorities of seeking permits and decisions in good faith being made. That was obviously a very difficult situation to contemplate. The government's amendments address that but, as so often, they go too far. It is one thing to address that kind concern, but another thing to introduce a wholly new regime that gives across-the board, open slather, carte blanche approval for, in effect, pastoral leaseholders to engage in any activity which is describable as constituting primary production within the meaning of the Income Tax Act. Ian Viner QC, the Deputy Chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, commented in his evidence to the minority committee about the inappropriateness of using legislation intended to define tax deductibility to enable the accomplishment of the extinguishment of native title. Let us not be in any doubt about what is involved here. If exclusive possession acts of one kind or another, exclusive possession activity, is allowed on pastoral leases in a way that is inconsistent with the full enjoyment of native title rights, we effectively are looking at a situation of permanent extinguishment. There are some circumstances in which the non-extinguishment principle is supposed to apply, but in others the overreach potential of the legislation is self-evident. There is a particular concern about that, so far as we are concerned, and we want it addressed properly in the legislation. Another concern that we have is about the way in which the pastoral lease primary production permissible activities extend to adjoining land, with the pastoralist able to obtain a permit to do all sorts of things on adjoining land without any requirement to involve native title holders in any way, shape or form, which can significantly prejudice their capacity to advance their native title interests. The question is: what is to be done about this situation? It is not a matter of sitting with the status quo in the legislation. That is not going to work. I have made that clear enough in my own discussions with the farm organisations. But, equally, it is not good enough to contemplate going down the path the government is going without significant modification. We will be pursuing this in a lot more detail than is mapped in the minority committee report when the bill comes to the committee stage discussion in the Senate. We proof pose a situation which has these characteristics: so far as basic pastoral activities are concerned-understood in their fullest possible connotation-we agree that no pastoralist should have to go through a right to negotiate process to carry out any activity which is permissible under his or her lease where that opportunity has been taken up. The act ought to make that perfectly clear. Equally, at the other end of the scale, when what is being sought is a formal upgrade for all practical purposes of the title in question or the activity is such that it can only properly be carried out with such a formal upgrade, we say then that the compulsory acquisition/right to negotiate provisions should apply where there is no ready agreement reached between the parties. For all of that very large range of activity that occurs in the middlewhere a pastoralist, for example, wants to put in a grape block or a cotton block or wants to engage in some diversity of his agricultural activity-where a pastoralist might in the past have reasonably been expected to get permission from the state or territory authorities to do so, we say it is fair enough that there be even this kind of radical change in land use. But here there should be an appropriate recognition of native title holders' procedural rights. There should be some notification; there should be some consultation; and there certainly should be respect for heritage considerations. It is possible to find a workable, balanced regime in this area. (Time expired)",130
186,Mr SLIPPER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I wish to deal with the issue of validation, which is one of the key elements of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. The purpose of proposed division 2A is to validate certain kinds of interests created and acts done in the period between 1 January 1994 when the Native Title Act commenced and the date of the Wik decision on 23 December 1996. The justification is that these interests were created and acts done on the assumption that governments were free to do various acts over pastoral leases and other leasehold land, including converting it to freehold, without following the processes of the NTA. As a consequence of this belief, acts were done over leasehold land which, on the basis of Wik, may have been invalid. The preamble to the Native Title Act stated-and the whole world believed-that native title was extinguished by pastoral leases. However, the Wik decision proved this was not the case. The government does not believe that invalidity is the appropriate consequence for acts done on the basis of a legitimate assumption subsequently proved wrong. The ALP is totally hypocritical in this matter because, all the way through the debate over the original native title bill, they predicated their debate on the basis that was extinguished by pastoral leases. The acts to be validated were done on the assumption that governments were free to do various acts over pastoral lease and other leasehold land without following the processes of the Native Title Act. This was an assumption supported by the decision of the High Court in Mabo (No.2), by many statements of the former government, by the Native Title Act itself, by the practices of the National Native Title Tribunal and by decisions of the Federal Court. It is clear that the assumption that pastoral leases had extinguished native title was one which would legitimately have been held and one which was encouraged by the former government. Even so, a number of jurisdictions have changed their practice in relation to future acts. Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales originally used a 'Swiss cheese' approach to granting exploration licences which excluded areas from the licence which might be subject to native title. Following the unanimous High Court decision that the Land (Titles and TraditionaI'Usage) Act 1993 was invalid in March 1995, Western Australia commenced issuing section 29 notices in relation to exploration, mining and compulsory acquisitions on behalf of third parties. South Australia's alternative future act regime in relation to mining and compulsory acquisitions, along with its ability to determine native title claims, commenced operation in June 1996 following Commonwealth approval. The proposed validation provisions for 'intermediate period acts' are in fact substantially more limited than the existing NTA validation provisions, which potentially apply to all government acts since Australia has settled. Proposed division 2A only covers acts and grants done on land in relation to which it was reasonable to assume that native title had been extinguished. It does not extend to acts done on land only previously the subject of a licence or reservation or which has always been vacant crown land. It also does not extend to invalid acts consisting of the making of legislation except where the legislation itself directly creates an estate or makes native title a grant or reservation. The document prepared by the National Indigenous Working Group rejected 'blanket validation' and suggested that some categories of grant which have no compelling urgency or commercial imperatives requiring immediate validation be validated through the future act regime or the proposed regional agreements process. The major objection to this proposal is purely a legal one-it is not possible to provide validity through agreements. Even if a legally watertight agreement were obtained with native title holders not to challenge the legality of the grant, the beneficiaries of the invalid grant or title would remain vulnerable to legal action from any other person with interests affected by the grant-such as trespass where, for example, an exploration permit is given over a pastoral lease-because the grant itself would remain invalid. The option of including a statutory validation provision but making it dependent on the satisfactory negotiation of an agreement would necessarily result in an effective veto for native title claimants in relation to mines and developments already under way. There would be a serious question about the legal status of these acts in the period before an agreement, even if the agreement were done on a government-representative body basis. It has also been argued that the effect of the proposed validation provisions in relation to public works will be to extinguish native title on the whole of the area of the tenure on which the work was built. This is incorrect. The effect of the validation of a public work is to extinguish all native title 'in relation to the lands or waters on which the public work concerned (on completion of its construction or establishment) was or is situated'. The concept of 'land or waters on which a public work is constructed, established or situated' is defined in section 251D to include any adjacent land or waters 'the use of which is or was necessary for, or incidental to, the construction, establishment or operation of the work'. The fact of the matter is that what has been suggested by the other side is simply not correct. (Time expired)",132
187,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I join the debate this afternoon firstly to associate myself with the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) and, secondly, to repeat the general comments that I made in the second reading stage. Detailed consideration of this Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 makes it clear that this bill will make the situation worse rather than better and that all of the constituable tional, legal and compensation difficulties we have drawn attention to consistently since this bill was exposed will ring true. Since the bill was debated in this House, I have had the opportunity of spending a number of days in Western Australia in the company of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the member for Banks (Mr Melham) where we discussed the detail of the bill with interested parties in Western Australia-the WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy, AMEC and a delegation from Kalgoorlie. I think it is true to say that at the end of that round of discussionsMr Williams interjecting",134
188,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"No, they had a much better appreciation of the weaknesses and deficiencies, constitutionally and legally and in compensation terms, of your legislation. There is a growing and compelling appreciation of the constitutional deficiencies that your bill has. It is not just the opinions that are appended to the minority report from Mr Castan and Mr Basten which make that argument compelling but also the most compelling evidence of the Solicitor-General before the Senate committee when he said that it was his duty and obligation to argue the validity of this bill until the High Court determines otherwise. That is code, Daryl, for what he really thinks.",134

193,Mr TUCKEY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: quite clearly the member is not entitled to make remarks like that. It is an offence to the entire House.",134
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,That is quite correct. The honourmember for O'Connor does make a valid that point. All members should be addressed by either their electorate or their ministerial responsibility.,134
195,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. There are two particular points I would like to make. One is the recommendation we find in the minority report in respect of the tax deductibility of expenses for companies in this area. That is a submission that has been made to me by the AMC, by AMEC and by the WA Chamber. That recommendation is found at pages 123 and 124 of the minority report. The minority report says that there is considerable merit in this proposal. That is my view as well, and it is something which we on this side of the chamber are very happy to give favourable consideration to. There is a second area I want to touch on which deals with offshore waters and the petroleum industry. That is covered by subdivision H of division 3 of the bill. This is a complicated area but, essentially, under the regime in the current act, the right to negotiate extends to the low-water mark. It is proposed by the government to r{(move the right to negotiate for what is known as the intertidal zone and take it to the high-water mark. This is a precise and particular example of the general deficiencies of this bill. This is an overreach. It opens up the Commonwealth to suggestions that it is extinguishing property rights without compensation. It is a very good example of where the status quo is entirely satisfactory. So on this side of the House we say: why move away from the current onshore-offshore regime when it is quite clear so far as the hydrocarbons industry is concerned? With whatever difficulties there are in this area, I suspect the Croker case currently before the courts will in any event help matters for us. I come back to my friend the Attorney General, the honourable member for Tangney. The Solicitor-General said before the Senate committee: Whatever I think about the issue of Wik which I have pleaded, whatever I think about the issue of validity of this law, if I am retained as counse- to make an argument for validity, this is something which I will do. That is code, Mr Attorney-General, for the weakness of your position, and in your heart of hearts you know it.",134
196,Mrs GALLUS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I want to address specifically the amendment brought before the House by the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I want to address this amendment, and none other of the amendments before the House today, because it specifically mentions the Racial Discrimination Act. This act is extremely important to all members of this parliament in that it is observed by all acts of the Commonwealth. The amendment brought forward by the shadow minister is a stunt designed to embarrass the coalition in relation to our election policy, which clearly stated th-t we. w?uI.d respect the provisions of the R-clal Dlscnmlnation Act. It is my sincere belief and understanding that we will respect that act in - very­ thing we do in this parliament. In relatIOn to the stunt performed by the shadow minister, if it is not a stunt, why doesn't it apply to the whole act? It is a stunt; if it were not, it would read 'the Native Title Act'. It does not apply to the Native Title Act. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) looks surprised. I will read to him what it actually says: . . . the provisions of the Racial - iscrimination - ct 1975 shall prevail over any provISIons of the Native Title Amendment Act 1997. I ask the shadow minister-who has turned his back and seems to have suddenly lost any interest in this debate-why this particular amendment would apply only to the Native Title Amendment Act. If it is a genuine move on the shadow minister's part to subject this bill to the Racial Discrimination Act, he would have done it to the entire Native Title Act.",135
197,Unknown,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,Opposition members interjecting,135
198,Mrs GALLUS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"He did not; he was too scared to do it to the whole act. He could not because he knows that, if he did, the Native Title Act itself, brought down by the opposition when it was in government, would fail under that very amendment. Therefore, he brings it up in this spurious amendment, simply to limit it to the amendments to the act and not to the act itself. He knows that this act, by its very nature, comes into the immediate concern of the RDA in every single clause. The RDA was passed to cover all Commonwealth legislation as it applied to all acts in all areas. It was to ensure that whatever the area-social security, education or whatever-there was no racial discrimination. That is how it should apply. Once you then bring it into an act which itself deals with race, you have a particular problem. That means that with every single phrase in that act, any action ta-en under that act is therefore subject to raCial overtones. The Native Title Act is, by its very nature, a racial act, unlike all other acts. To move-as the shadow minister has declined to do-that the Racial Discrimination Act would prevail over the entire Native Title Act would mean-and he knows it-that any action at all taken under that act could be subject to litigation, chaos would follow, and any part of the act that was mo-ed and passed by the opposition when it was III government would fail. I think everybody in this House agrees that we have a duty to Aboriginal people to ensure that they progress in our society . We took their land, we destroyed their communities, we stole their children, but we do not need to engage in political stunts because in no way does that assist Aboriginal people in this country . We cannot change the past and we cannot dwell in the past, but we can work towards a better future for Aboriginal people. A political stunt, simply designed to embarrass one or other side of the House, is no way to achieve that end.",135
199,Mr CREAN,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the amendment to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 moved by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), an amendment that reflects the policy of the Liberal Party written by the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who just sat down, a member who has said that we should recognise and preserve the RDA but who will not support an amendment that does just that. She comes in here saying that moving an amendment to that effect is a stunt. That is an insult to the people that you campaigned for in the last election, and they will know it at the next election. I also rise to oppose the amendments moved by the National Party and, in essence, to argue that the sensible course for resolution of this native title issue is based upon regional agreements. The government's approach to this bill is flawed. It will add to the uncertaintive ty, not lessen it, and the cost to the nation will be big time.",136
200,Mr TUCKEY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,Give us an example.,136
201,Mr CREAN,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I will give you examples of where it is flawed. This bill involves de facto and explicit extinguishment. The amendments proposed by the National Party, which show the division in the government on this, take us back further: They take us back to the position pre-Mabo. The National Party amendments will extinguish all native title after six years. That is bound to produce legal complexity ad infinitum. You cannot, as a matter of principle, legislate away that which the High Court has determined is common law. You cannot do it. That is one of the reasons why this bill is flawed. The second reason is that to proceed in the way suggested in your bill would require just terms compensation. The result would be an incalculable bill to the nation. This nation does not want that. The just terms provision in the bill will also end up in the High Court, causing further uncertainty. To the extent that I am arguing for this approach to be based on negotiation, and this is a bill that purports to be based on negotiationMr Tuckey interjecting",136
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,Order! I ask the honourable member for O'Connor to allow the honourable member for Hotham to make his remarks in some silence.,136
203,Mr CREAN,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The fact of the matter is that the agreement approach proposed in this bill through 'the new right to negotiate' would also end up in court, because the new provision proposed in this bill limits negotiation to four weeks, and the definition over the matter to be negotiated is so vague you could drive a truck through it. You say that this bill produces certainty. It does not. For those three fundamental reasons, it is flawed. That is the reason why we oppose it. Let me go to why agreements work. This is the basis upon which, we assert, the approach should be adopted. There needs to be legislaamendment, and we have conceded that. What the solution to this native title issue should be fundamentally built around is negotiation, but negotiation backed up, where appropriate, by legislative and/or tribunal support. That is what needs to be involved in this. Why do those who argue that the agreements do not work not look at the examples of Century and MCArthur River? The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) wanted to refer to Century before, quoting the former Governor General. It was reached under an agreement under the previous act, as was MCArthur River. Recently Striker Diamonds in the Kimberley negotiated at the early exploration phase under Labor's act. This argument that what you do is creating uncertainty for diamond mining, oil mining and for mineral sands mining is debunked. You have also got the Yandacoogina agreement in the Pilbara and the Murrin Murrin agreement in the Eastern Goldfields. In contrast to that, we have also got the called Wik agreement where you went the legislative route; it goes back to 1993, and it is still not resolved. We are saying that we need a bipartisan approach to this resolution. We are prepared to be involved in a bipartisan approach, but the government has rejected any real attempts to secure bipartisanship. This bill is no basis for the solution. You need to go back to the drawing board. (Time expired)",136
204,Mr LIEBERMAN,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The Native Title Act, of course, does not contain adequate mechanisms to manage future acts on pastoral leases, which is a very serious issue and has to be addressed. The bill does that. There are no express provisions in the NTA which allow governments to continue to authorise pastoralists to carry on activities authorised under the lease where additional authority is necessary. There is no provision which states that the rights of the pastoralist prevail over any coexisting native title rights and interests. Of course, at common law, pastoralists' interests do prevail, as is spelled out in the Wik judgment. The effect of the current NTA provision, however-the Labor legislationmay be to produce the opposite result. That is why this bill is necessary. The definition, for example, of an act affecting native title the NTA makes it possible that activities done under the authority of a pastoral lease or permit are what we call, under the jargon of the Keating act, 'future acts'. The grant of a future right, and even activities related to leases, may therefore become impermissible under the existing Native Title Act because they do not satisfy the freehold test. This has to be addressed and the bill does that. That is why it should be supported. The definition also of primary production activity in section 24GA is designed to ensure that the NTA does not prevent the full range of activities which pastoralists are currently authorised to undertake on pastoral leases from continuing and that the states and territories are not prevented from exercising their ordinary land management powers to vary land use on pastoral leases as technology and markets change. This bill unlocks that problem and allows for a satisfactory and very so- fair resolution of that issue which has been caused by the inadequate provisions of the Native Title Act passed by the Labor government. In some jurisdictions, a range of activities is permitted expressly by the lease, while in others some additional activities require further permission. The bill allows permits for additional activities on pastoral leases to continue to be granted, but ensures that native title rights are only suppressed, but not extinguished, by such grants. It is a very fair provision. Off-farm activities directly relating to primary production may also be carried on in areas adjoining or near to agricultural or . pastoral leases or freehold estates notwithstanding the existence of native title. Why should adjoining properties be blighted where there is a claim for native title? It is an extraordinary proposition and it should not be allowed to continue. It needs to be addressed and is addressed in the bill. Under the amendments, pastoralists are able to carry on any activity authorised under their lease without reference to native title holders, which is section 24GC. This is consistent with the Wik decision that pastoral lease rights prevail over native title rights. If the pastoralist wants to exercise additional rights to those in authorised by the lease, it will be necessary to obtain whatever legislative or administrative authority is required under the relevant state or territory legislation. If those additional rights come within the definition of primary production activities in the Native Title Act, then those activities can be carried on, but native title is suppressed and not extinguished. The granting of additional rights cannot convert the lease to one that confers a right of exclusive possession, nor into a freehold estate. Under the current and amended Native Title Act, a state or territory cannot legislate across the board to upgrade pastoral leases to exclusive possession tenures. The only way in which an upgrade to exclusive possession tenure, including a freehold tenure, can be granted is through the surrender of any native title interests by agreement or by compulsory acquisition of the native title on a case-bycase basis in accordance with the relevant Native Title Act provision, section 24MD. Acquisition, of course, if it is occurring, can be done only in a. non-discriminatory way with all the rights in the land-native title and non-native title-being acquired and just compensation paid. Those principles are preserved faithfully in the bill. Whether a particular state or territory can acquire rights for the purpose of a third party is a matter, of course, for the state or territory law. States and territories have indicated to the government, and publicly, that no change to current land management policy is intended in relation to freehold or pastoral leases. Despite suggestions by some that the bill removes the right to negotiate-(Time expired)",137
205,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The Labor Party believes that the settlement of outstanding native title issues is of fundamental importance to the future of the nation. I also believe this is particularly important at the moment, at a time of so much international economic uncertainty. The current international stock market crisis is the latest example of that. It is also at a time when unemployment remains entrenched at unacceptably high levels with one in three Australians who are now unemployed being long-term unemployed and there being little hope in the current economic environment under the Howard government of any improvement with respect to that major issue. To get any meaningful improvement in the job market for the unemployed, Australia requires a number of significant changes to the way we are approaching the issues before us today. We all accept that we need to have significant economic growth and that to achieve this growth requires substantial private investment. But, as we all know, investors are unlikely to make the decision to invest where there are questions about the security of their investment. Mr Marek- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I ask in relation to relevance what this has got to do with native title. He hasn't even mentioned the bill.",138
206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,Order! I call the honourable member for Batman.,138
207,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"As I was saying before that ignorant interruption, in the context of the native title debate, the prospect for regional agreements-and those who are concerned about the issue of jobs, unlike the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), understand that between native title holders and developers we must provide certainty that investors require-is that they have the capacity to deliver certainty while providing real economic opportunities for indigenous Australia, particularly in terms of jobs. The flow-on effects to regional economies are obvious and have the potential to bring the benefit of real growth to these economies. There is the potential for very real benefits to flow for everybody. There are numerous practical examples of agreements that have already been reached between indigenous Australians and developers and others with an interest in land. Thirteen of these in Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria were listed in the Weekend Australian of 18-19 October.",138
208,Mr TUCKEY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,How many? Thirteen?,138
209,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I understand that the member for O'Connor is more interested in the form guide than the successes listed in the Weekend Australian. An example in the Northern Territory that I am personally aware of involves agreements between the Central Land Council and Alice Springs acting on behalf of local communities and miners in the Tanami region. I am pleased to say that I have visited the Tanami and seen at first hand the success of these negotiations on a range of mining projects. These agreements provide not only jobs for Aboriginal people in Central Australia but also the capacity for them to be involved in some of the business opportunities that have arisen as a result of this mining development. The benefit of these agreements is plain. The government, while advocating in its legislation acceptance of and a need for these types of agreements, has neutered the ability of indigenous Australians to participate in any negotiations by gutting the right to negotiate provisions in the Native Title Act 1993. Pastoralists, miners and other investors with an interest in the land want the Native Title Act to be workable and to provide certainty. Anyone in business knows the key to investment is certainty, not legal uncertainty and ongoing challenges through the legal processes in Australia. That is what we are aboutcertainty, investment, economic growth and jobs. We also want to give some hope to the people of regional Australia, the people so neglected by the Howard government. We want to give them the opportunities they so rightly deserve, to give them the opportunities the Howard government has withdrawn from regional Australia. What we are about is providing them with a chance to get maximum benefit from mining and other developments within their regions, jobs and business opportunities. It is about saying that, yes, there is certainty on the development front. It is about saying that, yes, we will go ahead with development of job growth in Australia. It is also about saying to our indigenous people that we treat you with respect and we want you to participate in the economic and social benefits of Australia. Members such as the member for Capricornia have clearly evidenced today the lack of understanding and their ignorance of the very fundamental issues of certainty that are so much central to this debate. They have no concern for jobs, no concern for regional Australia, no concern for indigenous people and no concern for a sense of decency and prosperity in Australia. They are condemned for their ignorance. They are condemned for their lack of respect for indigenous people in Australia. They are condemned for their failure to face up to their responsibilities, for their failure to create opportunities for all in Australia, not just the self-interested group that sit on the other side of the House today.

210,Mr KATTER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"It is quite extraordinary to listen to the ALP. Listening to the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), I would have thought that I was on another planet. Paul Kelly's comments that Australian leadership is characterised by a certain vacuous lucidity is a phrase that leapt to my mind. In an extraordinary exercise in hypocrisy, I must read out what Labor's former illustrious leader and deputy leader for a decade and a bit said in this House two years ago, and everyone in this House voted for that proposal. He said on 16 November 1993: Validation and Security for Existing Grants Equally, it is essential to safeguard the rights of those who hold existing grants of interests in land. This bill sets out a regime for the states to validate grants with certainty. It does not prevent states and territories from attempting to validate on their own terms. But they would do so at their own legal risk. And the Commonwealth would obviously not, in that case, help meet any resulting costs. Validation covers not only past invalid grantsmade before 31 December 1993-but renewals and extensions as defined in the bill. It also covers invalid actions of government. And it covers laws made before 30 June 1993. Validation by the Commonwealth, or in line with the Commonwealth regime, limits the extinguishment of native title. Only validated freehold grants, residential, commercialand this is the pointand pastoral or agricultural leases ... As the honourable member said previously: am I mad? They have just said that this is all bad. We are the only people in this House who are proposing what you and your leader of 12 or 13 years voted for two years ago. I may be mad but I am not a hypocritical and inconsistent person who comes into this House and says and votes one way and then, within two short years, votes in the opposite direction and then expects us to believe that they have some credibility or intellectual integrity. They have neither of those things. Let me move on. In the most incredible speech from the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), which was beaten only by one of the previous speakers on the ALP side, he talked about jobs. In North Queensland, Shelbourne Bay, worth $3,000 million a year to the Australian economy, has been held up for 12 years. The Wik claim was to hold up the Weipa expansion program, which was worth $1,000 million to the Australian economy. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) used the example of Century. He said, 'Look at Century; what a success story.' That four-year hold-up cost $600 million a year-that is, $2,500 million to the Australian economy. Not only that, it has raised the bar line. Every time anyone wants to go mining in Australia now they have to parcel out $100 million because an aggressive 24-year-old negotiator called Jason Yanner was able to secure $100 million and 3.5 million acres of land. If Jason chooses to use it as a Berlin Wall, stretching from the Gulf of Carpentaria one-third down the entire length of Queensland-and qe has very anti-development attitudes, which is his privilege-then he has a very valuable and powerful weapon. Labor say that we need to go down this pathway and they used the example of Century. Most extraordinary stuff! In saying those things, I. think there are some very important issues that need to be addressed here. The laws of trespass have prevailed over the pastoral leases in Queensland since pastoral leases were issued in the state of Queensland. You are not allowed to come onto a pastoral lease. As far as I am concerned, if you have a trespass law operating, you have exclusive tenure. I will not negotiate that here. I will simply say that when your wife and kids are at home by themselves-as is probably the case on most cattle and sheep runs in Queensland at the present moment because for the past three years their income has been minus $2,700, so obviously their husbands are not at home living off cattle and sheep; they are awaythey, unlike any other person in Australia, have their backyard accessed by people they have never seen before in their lives. (Time expired)",139
211,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I want to speak about statutory access rights on pastoral leases. Subdivision Q provides a conditional statutory access right for native title holders over pastoral leases. The rights of the leaseholder prevail over statutory access rights-section 44B. Additionally, while the statutory right of access applies to any part of the lease, no person can enforce any native title rights or interests in relation to the whole of the land covered by the lease-section 44e. The statutory access right to pastoral leases only applies where native title holders have not previously been excluded from entry. As such, it is clearly a bogy rather than a bonus. The absurdity of the provision is that it will be unnecessary for claimants who already have access and it is unhelpful for those who do not. The government states that access for registered native title claimants to pastoral leases will be guaranteed. This is restrictively qualified, however, by requiring that the claimants regularly had physical access at the date of the Wik decision. This provision has been described by witnesses before the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund as one of the cruellest hoaxes in the amendment bill. The National Indigenous Working Group comment: The provision is of very limited benefit, is likely to be difficult to enforce and precludes the exercise of common law rights of access. If it is of benefit to Indigenous people at all, which is doubtful, the benefit is likely to be entirely marginal. Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation comment: The rights provided by this subdivision are so proscribed and difficult of achievement it is unlikely that any native title holder will expend the time, energy and money to pursue them. The registration test which must be passed before Aboriginal people can claim the conditional statutory access right is onerous. The failure of native title holders to pass this test will prech,lde them from gaining any statutory access right. Many Aboriginal people have access to pastoral leases and good relationships with pastoral leaseholders. However, throughout history, many Aboriginal people were forcibly moved from their lands as part of government policy and Aboriginal people are, in some instances, denied access to their traditional lands by pastoralists. If the native title claimants did not enjoy, or were refused, regular physical access to the area up until 23 December 1996, the statutory right of access is not available to them. The government has embarked on a high risk strategy in proposing this test for statutory access rights. Common law native title rights exist and are exercisable. If native title holders are prevented from exercising their rights, they can apply for an injunction even against a pastoralist who claimed wrongly that they were trespassers. The purpose of the Native Title Act 1993 was to prevent common law court actions which are time consuming, expensive and the outcome uncertain. The question of what constitutes regular physical access is not easily answered. Unclear concepts like this will find themselves in the court being subject to the necessary judicial interpretation. The bill does not improve the situation of those native title holders who have been locked out of or have no security of access to their country. There is evidence that some native titleholders have been put off or locked out of their traditional country by pastoralists. The Kimberley Land Council lists several pastoral leases where denial of access is currently occurring: Springvale, Bedford Downs, Moola Bulla, Margaret River, Christmas Creek, Thangoo, Fossil Downs, Paradise, Brooking Springs and Ellenbrae. The joint parliamentary committee made decisions to exclude the testimony of non-English speaking Kimberley people, but we have some of their stories. Mr Andrews, a Bunuba man, gave evidence in relation to Brooking Springs. He said: I want to talk on behalf of my country. I am out of the boundary from my country on a station. The manager of the station won't let us go back. He has the gate locked. It is my father's country and my grandmother's country. I never will go back to my country any more. My mother country-I do not know why that manager is a very hard man for Brooking Springs station. We tell him to go home and I am trying to visit my own country but he does not let anybody go. Why? Twice 1 talked to him and he said, 'I got cattle and horses in here.' 1 said, 'That is all right. 1 don't come into your country while you have cattle and horses there, trying to shoot your bullock in a paddock or trying to shoot your horse in a paddock. 1 don't come for that reason. 1 want to come back and visit my country.' That is what 1 tell the manager but that manager don't agree with anybody. Mr Butcher Wise from the Wangkajunga community, talking about Christmas Creek, said: 1 come from Christmas Creek. 1I have worked all my life at Christmas Creek since 1 was a little kid. 1 did not go to school. What we are doing in Christmas Creek is we have a little community outside and we live there. We do not get through to that riverside friendly site and grave site. We got nowhere to get through for the countryside, to see every waterhole and take the kids for hunting and all that thing, because there are gates ... With one of the first managers there at Christmas Creek, we do not have that sort of trouble at that station. We used to go all through the river all along all around that country area. We did not hunt any cattle, we just went through there all our lives. But this new bloke, when he came about 1990, he did not want the right people to get through there. I don't know why. Mavis Wallaby, a Kija woman, in a statement read by Peter Yu,' wrote about Moola Bulla station. She said: My country is Moola Bulla station. This is my country, the place where my parents and my grandparents come from. That is where I was born and grew up and was living for a lot of my life. Then in 1995 the government pushed us off our country my family and hundreds of other people. They sold the station to a bloke from Queensland or New South Wales and they shipped us off on a truck to Fitzroy Crossing to live. We were always trying to get back there. (Time expired)",140
212,Mrs STONE,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"In relation to registration tests, most people who are dealing with native title in this country know that there needs to be an effective registration test to ensure that only claims with merit are registered on the register of native title claims to prevent overlapping and multiple claims by members of the same visit group or others who are simply vexatious or have major ambit claims. Too many of us have seen the sad situation which emerges when it is almost impossible for one group to have a just outcome when multiple claims arrive one after another, day after day, as others compete to have the same rights as those who are most likely to succeed. As has already been mentioned, Bill Hayden, soon after he had the experience of being chief negotiator for the Queensland government in a right to negotiate process, wrote that: The absence of any definition of who can be a claimant and the seemingly unlimited opportunities fo- people to register as such; the unrepresentatlven-ss of some who register as claimants; the confUSIOn - d tensi?ns which can become rampant as longstandmg factIOnal and family disputes within a tribal. group manifest themselves at the expense of th- l-sue to be settled . . . which can impair negotIatmg process. These problems have to be overcome with a registration test which is more sensible. Under our bill, a physical connection requirement is to be found in subsection 190B(7). The test is whether one member of the claimed group has or had at any time a traditional physical connection with any part of the area claimed. Justice French commented on the question of how many currently registered claims would fail under the proposed new physical connection test. He said: My impression is that there are not too many cases where people do not actually have access to the country that they are claiming. I- any event, a claim which fails a registration test under our bill is not precluded from judicial consideration and determination. To this exterit, it is not accurate to argue that the inclusion of the criterion pre-empts common law on the issue of physical versus spiritual connection. The restriction on the registration of overlapping claims has been criticised by some for - ot t-ng account of customary law. The mte-tl?- of the provision is not to ignore the posslblhty of more than one traditional group having customary rights to an area-we know that was sometimes the case traditionally-but to reduce multiple claims by the members of the same claim group for the same area. Where it becomes likely that a claim in an application will not satisfy the registration test, it is anticipated that the claimants would seek to amend the claim under section 64. Subsection 64(3) specifically provides that claims may be amended even while the registrar is considering them under section 190A. Substantial benefits flow to registered native title holders that are not available to other clai-ants using the NTA or to applicants makmg common law claims. These benefits justify an appropriately strict test. Briefly, these benefits are: that the claimants have the right to negotiate-where the right to negotiate still applies under the amendments-in relati.o- .to the mining on or the compulsory acqulSltIOn for third party purposes of the a claimed land; that the claimants are entitled to be specifically notified, heard and consulted in relation to the doing of an act that is an approved scheme or an approved gold or tin mining act; and that the claimants are entitled to be specifically notified of a state or territory minister's intention to request that the Commonwealth minister determine that an area be an approved opal or gem mining area for the purposes of the right to negotiate regime, to make submissions in this regard and to have those submissions considered. The benefits also include: that the claimants are entitled to be specifically notified of and object to acts in any alternative state and territory right to negotiate regime under sec-ion 43, or equi-alent state and territory regime under sectIOn 43A in relation to pastoral lease or reserve land; that the claimants will qualify for the statutory access rights provided by the act; and that the claimants are able to prevent what could otherwise be impermissible future acts in relation to the claimed land which is subject to a nonclaimed application. The benefits include, further: that the claimants are entitled to notice of and an opportunity to comment on a grant of a right to take natural resources from non-exclusive agricultural or non-exclusive pastoral leasehold land; that they are entitled to be specifically notified in some cases of the provision of facilities for services for the public, acts that pass the threshold test and offshore acts· and that the claimants have the right to bnotified of other claims made in the area and are required to be party to an ILUA-that is an indigenous land use agreement-for that agreement to be valid. So we are taking care of the problem that there now is with this act. We know that the curr-nt act is not working in particular in relatIOn to those who are able to register claims. We are going to do all we can to make future legislation work.",141
213,Mr CAMPBELL,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The schedule the government is proposing is inevitably flawed because it does not extinguish native title of pastoral leases, as Paul Keating believed. The reality is that it is not pastoral leases that are of concern; it is the mining industry. The reason this has been fought so tenaciously is that people know that the great bulk, the overwhelming incidence, of mineral finds will occur on pastoral leases. There is no money in the pastoral industry. Therefore, there is very little to negotiate. This is about extortion from mining companies, and there is no doubt about that. It is laughable when a member from the Labor Party gets up and talks about jobs. I happen to know first hand about the Murrin Murrin negotiations and a lot of the other negotiations there. Murrin Murrin is not finished yet. We were almost at the stage of guns as various Aboriginal groups were lining up to fight over this-those who wanted to work, those who wanted jobs and those who were simply seeking to extort the mining company. Unless you can extinguish native title on pastoral leases, there can be no certainty for the mining industry. That is quite clear. That is what is going to be the threat to jobs in Australia. The hypocrisy is enormous. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), for whom I have some regard, comes into this House and puts forward Ron Castan as an authority. Ron Castan has about as much intellectual honesty or rigour as the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). It is just absolute nonsense to come in here and support him as some sort of authority. Why does Mr Castan not go over to Palestine and campaign for land rights for Palestinians? I would say he would have a much better chance. We have members of the Labor Party coming in here and telling us that they are going to vote for exactly what they supported fewer than two years ago when their then leader was adamant that pastoral leases extinguished native title. Instead, they come in here and genuflect to power crazy, social engineering, hypocritical, guilt ridden control freaks who run the High Court of Australia. This is the place where we should make this legislation. Why have we failed? Because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) did not have the nerve to put beyond doubt in legislation what Paul Keating believed in. Had he done that, he could have sent a message to the High Court and they probably would have had some more caution in the way they behaved. The member for Banks (Mr Melham) mentioned incidents in the Kimberley. We talk about regional agreements. In many instances, regional agreements are simply a disaster because the people who want to control regional agreements do not have any support of Aboriginal people. That is clearly the case in the Kimberley. The Labor Party, like the Liberal Party, will hand this over to the Kimberley Land Council, but the Kimberley Land Council represents very few Aboriginal people. Most of them do not trust the council. When I first got into parliament, the Aboriginals used to say to me that they could remember when Peter Yu was an Aboriginal. The Aboriginals-these people to whom English is a second language-now call him Peter Me, which I think shows a very good understanding of the nuances of the language. With respect to access in the Kimberleys, generally there is a very good rapport, but Mr Klopper on Christmas Creek did not ban Aboriginal people until he could not stop his stud stock being slaughtered. It is interesting that there are other Aboriginal owned stations that simply will not allow Aboriginals onto their properties for exactly the same reason. They say, 'You come on with hordes of dogs and you stir up the cattle. We are trying to run quiet cattle.' It is just a nonsense. As far as Brooking Springs is concerned, I am sure that Brian Fielder and Adam Andrews have a very good rapport. I do not really see any problems there in terms of access. It is quite clear that, unless we are prepared to put some certainty into this, it is hopeless. We must abandon the nonsense that is the government's proposal and go for a constitutional referendum and let the people decide. What could be wrong with letting the people of Australia decide? I vouch that, except for New South Wales-which is perverted by Sydney-the rest of Australia will vote with common sense and put some certainty back into this whole legislation. For years we had everybody talking nonsense about terra nullius. We had them criticising the British and saying that it was the British attitude that no-one was here before them. Terra Nullius did not mean that. The member for Holt knows that, but he continually went along with the lie. (Time expired)",142
214,Mr SLIPPER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Like the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), I wish to address the matter of statutory access rights. Following the High Court's decision in Wik, concern was expressed by some indigenous groups that some lessees may attempt to prevent native title claimants who have regularly had access to the lessee's land for the purpose of conducting traditional ceremonies from continuing that access. At the same time, concern was also expressed by some pastoralists that native title claimants who had not previously had access to pastoral land would, after Wik, attempt to access the pastoral lease land. In creating a statutory access rights regime, the government's intention was to preserve the status quo on pastoral lease land, subject to a registered native title claim pending the determination of that claim. It was not the government's intention to decide whether members of a native title claim group have native title rights of access to pastoral lease land, as that is an issue for the court to decide when it makes a determination of native title. Statutory access rights are only interim rights. There have been calls to change the cut-off date for statutory access rights or to remove the cut-off date completely. The statutory access rights regime is, however, intended to reflect contemporary practice. The government chose the date of the Wik decision as the cut-off date for statutory access rights, as that was the date on which the High Court found that native title rights could coexist with a pastoral lessee's rights and, of course, that was previously understood not to be the situation. Proposed new section 44A, by attempting to reflect the status quo, strikes a fafr balance between the concerns of both native title claimants and lessees. Suggestions that statutory access rights be available to native title claimants who were locked out of non-exclusive agricultural and pastoral lease land as a result of the unlawful actions of lessees misconstrue the very object behind these provisions. To expand the statutory access rights regime in this way would, in effect, clearly change the status quo. Furthermore, the suggestion is impractical. Litigation would inevitably be required in order to determine whether native title claimants were unlawfully locked out of their traditional lands. Such litigation would raise issues of a similar kind to those raised in the native title determination application itself and would probably take as long to resolve as the application. Calls by the National Indigenous Working Group to provide in the Native Title Act a general right of access without the necessity of a claim are completely at odds with the intention behind the statutory access rights provisions. Firstly, it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commonwealth to legislate in the Native Title Act in relation to general rights of access to pastoral land wholly unrelated to native title issues. Secondly, such a proposal would completely change the status quo. It is not the government's intention to decide who should or should not have access to pastoral lease land. That is a matter for state and territory governments. The Nation(al Indigenous Working Group . has suggested that the intention behind section 44C is to prevent the enforcement of common law access rights. This is not true. Section 44C proposes that, where a person has statutory access rights in relation to a pastoral lease, no other person can enforce native title rights in relation to the lease. This does not include rights under the Native Title Act. Where members of a native title claim group enjoy statutory access rights, other persons who claim native title to that lease should also make a claim under the Native Title Act. If that claim is registered, then those members of the claim group who had access as at 23 December 1996 will have a right under the Native Title Act to continue that access. Section 44C has been included to strengthen the government's policy in relation to the claims process. It is unreasonable to allow native title groups to stand back from the Native Title Act processes once they have been triggered by a native title determination application made by another native title claim group. It is unfair to expect parties to a native title determination application under the actand this includes applicants and respondents-to also be parties to native title claims made under the common law by persons who claim native title in relation to the area of land the subject of the Native Title Act claim. It is sensible and just that the court should determine all the native title rights in relation to an area of land, not just the rights of one group.",144
215,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I wish to continue the story of Mavis Wallaby, a Kija woman. She says: We were thinking about our place all that timeworrying for it, missing it. We want to go back to visit important places for us, the burial places and camping places, for bush tucker and fishing. The country is always on our minds. We want to take our young children back to learn them properly about their family and their culture but we can't go back to country. The manager stops us from visiting. He's clear that he doesn't want us to go there. He only lets us go there for very special occasions with the museum mob, but not for hunting and fishing. Our kids have never seen this place. We have got old people buried there and we can't get to the graves. My proper mother is also buried there, but I don't know where and I can't get on to find out. This makes me really unhappy and sad, and I can't teach all these things about the country to my kids and grandkids. There has been much discussion at committee hearings about the extent of 'locked gates' on pastoral leases. The following discussion at a committee hearing answers the debate: CHAIR-But could I suggest that thatmeaning being locked outis an exception rather than the rule? Father Brennan-It may well be. Let us rectify the exceptions. Native title rights for all claimants are suspended over the whole of the lease area, even if one individual claimant is entitled to statutory access rights under this subdivision. This provision has been labelled 'curious' and its purpose is unclear. There is no just basis for the suspension of native title rights. If a determination of native title is made, no compensation is payable for the suspension of the native title rights. Failure to provide compensation for the inability to exercise a disputed property right would constitute racially discriminatory action. Suspension of native title rights in this way could constitute an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth, giving rise to a constitutional obligation for compensation on just terms. In other scenarios, damages or compensation would be granted to a property holder for the impairment of property rights once established. Michael Dodson, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social,Justice Commissioner, commented to the parliamentary committee: It seems inconceivable that freehold or leasehold rights could be placed at risk of being 'suspended' without compensation where a title-holder had done nothing wrong and no inconsistent government action was proposed. Not everyone in a community may be able to obtain the statutory access right. The question of who may accompany a person exercising traditional access rights arises. This may be divisive and disruptive of cultural practices. ATSIC raises the spectre that: Spouses and relatives may be deprived of rights and opportunities to accompany claimants during access. Whilst the performance of rights and other ceremonies are ""traditional activities"" which may be carried on under subdivision Q, it may not be possible to conduct them because the Subdivision is likely to deny access to people whose attendance is necessary for the performance and to people who, in accordance with the relevant traditional law and custom, would otherwise normally attend and benefit from the performance. The National Farmers Federation submit that the interim access right should not exceed the rights currently being exercised. They query how undesirable behaviour would be prevented as the amendments do not express the duty or standard of care required to be exercised by those with statutory access, how a code of conduct would be enforced and how conflict between traditional use and primary production is to be prevented. There is some irony in the fact that the conditional statutory right of access will only apply if a native title claim is lodged. This is the very thing that is concerning pastoralists. In effect, Aboriginal people who have access are being encouraged to lodge native title applications to gain a statutory right of when they may be content with an existing voluntary arrangement. The issues that the National Farmers Federation raises as concerns are precisely the things that are best worked out by agreement. If coexisting native title rights and interests are recognised over pastoral leases by a determination of the court, these are exactly the things that will have to be worked out by negotiation and agreement. This option is available presently under section 21 of the Native Title Act 1993 and will be made more accessible through the indigenous land use agreement provisions in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. The bill introduces a sunset clause for native title and compensation claims. Under the sunset clause, native title claims must be made within six years from the commencement of the amending act-section 13(1 A). No application for compensation is allowed to be made later than six years from either the time when the amendment act commences or the time when the act is done, whichever is later-section 50(2A). The sunset clause provisions are unnecessary and ill-conceived. There is widespread objection to the clause among a range of stakeholders, indigenous and non-indigenous. Native title does not depend on the Native Title Act 1993 for its existence. It is a title recognised by the common law of Australia and enforceable as such. The government is aware of this. Senator Minchin said that the sunset clause 'does not affect the common law right ... to go to state courts' . The government's proposal guarantees complex, expensive and time consuming court actions after six years by preventing native title holders from pursuing their rights under the Native Title Act 1993. A particularly unjust implication of the sunset clause is that it denies the right to negotiate to those Aboriginal native title holders who have not made claims before the sunset date. The Native Title Act 1993 provides for the recognised protection of native title through mediation and negotiation and provides a framework in which developers and miners can establish working relationships with Aboriginal communities. The bill proposes a access return to the quagmire of the common law position before the enactment of the Native Title Act 1993 where Aboriginal people were forced into expensive and protracted court actions to protect their property rights. (Time expired)",145
216,Mr LIEBERMAN,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The comments made on the sunset clause by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) invite me to rebut what he said. He has gravely misunderstood the purpose of the sunset clause and its operation. The sunset clause actually provides a time limit of six years for making an application for a determination of native title under the Native Title Act. This applies to applications covering areas which have not been the subject of any previous approved determination of native title-I emphasise the word 'approved'. The limitation period, therefore, does not apply to applications for a revised determination of native title, but the circumstances in which these applications can be made are restricted by limiting those who may make these applications under subsection 13(4). The limitation period runs from the date that new subsection 13(1A) takes effect. A time limit has also been imposed for making compensation applications for the effect of future acts on native title. That time limit-six years-is from the date that new subsection 50(2A) takes effect or six years from when the act giving rise to the compensation is done, whichever is later. The member for Banks certainly has some misunderstanding surrounding the effect of proposed subsection 13(1 A). I would like to clear that misunderstanding up now. The sunset period only applies in relation to the making of applications under the act-I emphasise 'under the act'. It does not prevent native title claims being made under the common law either before or after the sunset clause. That is a very important point. The sunset clause is an integral part of the government's policy in relation to the native title claim process. Firstly, the sunset clause encourages native title claims to be made within six years of the commencement of the provision. The government believes that the early resolution of native title claims can only be of benefit to native title holders, to the holders of titles granted by the Crown, the governments, the whole community in this country. Secondly, it is not unreasonable to ask native title holders to bring their claims under the act within six years of the commencement of the sunset clause, given that the claims provision of the Native Title Act have been in operation for nearly four years already, with no claims determined at all, sadly, under the Keating failed act, and $83 million of taxpayers' money already expended. Mr Entsch-It is $89 million.",146
217,Mr LIEBERMAN,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am corrected; it is $89 million already expended on legal aid to these poor people who have been made the subject of claims because of the expectations that they derived under the Keating Labor Party Native Title Act which has caused a lot of hardship, concern and unfortunate misunderstanding in the whole of our community. The Native Title Amendment Bi111997 has to address those things. It is our responsibility to draw a line, bring the parties together and provide reasonable provisions to patch up the problems caused by the unsatisfactory operation of the NTA. The other reason why this sunset clause is an important part of the government's policy is that it reflects the government's general policy in relation to native title claims which is to encourage native title claimants to come forward and make their claims under the Native Title Act rather than under the common law itself, which, as the member for Banks acknowledges, creates other problems down the track. If it is seen in that perspective, read fairly, not misrepresented, balanced, and takes into account the history in the last four years, it is a very helpful and reasonable provision which does not take anyone's rights away. After all, four years have gone, there are six years to go; who would be left out in that process?",147
218,Mr GARETH EVANS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I would like to comment on what has been said by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) about the sunset clause. The truth of the matter is that this is a very silly and counterproductive provision. I fully accept what he says-that the sunset clause, as presently drafted, does not exclude common law claims but, if common law claims continue to be able to be made after the period of the sunset clause, you will have a much greater threat, in effect, to the workability of the whole native title system than would be the case if these matters continue to be dealt with purely under statute. The very nature of the common law system is infinitely more cumbrous and undirected, which is why, of course, we got the whole native title legislation in the first placebecause nobody 'Nanted to commit the Australian landscape to that endlessly protracted uncertainty and complexity of a common law claim process. Of course, if you went the extra distance and knocked off common law claims as well, as the National Party is urging us to do, not only do we say that is indefensible in principle but also it would instantly involve the Commonwealth in having to deal with a potentially massive compensation payout claim because of the acquisition of property rights without just terms having been given. The other aspect of it which makes me say it is silly and counterproductive is that it is bound to trigger a lot of claims that might not otherwise have been made if there was not the time pressure associated with this sunset clause being made and clogging the system again with claims that are manifestly unlikely to succeed. It has been acknowledged in a lot of private conversations, even if not publicly, that the sunset clause should be one of the first to go in this legislation, and I am surprised that the member for Indi should be wanting to hang his hat on one of the least defensible provisions of the whole bill. I suspect the real reason that there is a bit of passion in the coalition parties for the sunset clause is that having the right to proceed under the act is inextricably linked with the right to negotiate, because with regard to the right to negotiate, although there is an argument that it is a common law right, its primary foundation",147
219,Mr TUCKEY,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,There's no argument to the contrary.,148
220,Mr GARETH EVANS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"There is an argument and it has not yet been established to the contrary by the High Court. It is basically a right of statutory foundation. The reason it is there is not because of some whim or fancy, as has been alleged by the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), along with his other usual tirades of vulgar abuse; it is there in order to give certainty and predictability the legislation by providing something of genuine benefit to indigenous people because of the constitutional problems of proceeding with a piece of legislation that does not amount to net benefit or constitute a special measure so far as indigenous people are concerned. For all of the constitutional reasons that have been argued in full in the second reading stage and will be again by my colleague the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), I do not want to go into it. I want to say a quick word about the whole question of the right to negotiate, to clearly put my position on the record about this. I, for one, without going into the procedural aspects of the right to negotiate, acknowledge that the right to negotiate the particular threshold test or registration test which triggers a capacity to exercise that right is not something that has worked well under the present legislation. There is no doubt that it was not our intent in 1993 to have an openended capacity to access that right to negotiate, but the way in which the test has been applied by the courts, tribunals and registrar has made it, for all practical purposes, a worthless form of filter. The system, particularly in areas like the eastern goldfields and so on, has been disastrously cluttered as a result of too many claims being registered that simply would not satisfy a reasonable test. So far as the minority report is concerned, the crucial thing is their recommendationand that is something with which I would strongly agree: the registration test should exclude bona fide claimants with reasonable prospects of success in establishing native title from access to the right to negotiate provisions. There is much distance still to go in our consideration of how best to draft the threshold test. It is a matter for argument as to whether the physical connection and test as drafted here is, in fact, unfairly limited. It may be; it may not. There is a case for Father Brennan's suggestion that the proper criterion here, perhaps in addition to the physical connection one as an additional alternative, might be the maintenance of observance of laws and customs so far as is practicable to do so. There is a real to concern about the limitation of abilities to have claims registered where a claim of exclusive possession is adopted in relation to an area where there have been previously non-exclusive possession acts. There are problems of that kind. They are all redressable. The important thing is to get it right. (Time expired)",148
221,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I would like to reply to some things that have been said by individual speakers on the other side. The member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) referred to the category D past acts. The current validation regime provides for Crown-to-Crown grants of freehold which are validated. Category A and Category B are validated and extinguish native title. Category D do not extinguish; they only suppress. The point to be noted is that this applies only to validated acts. It does not apply to grants that were valid in the first place. In respect of those grants, the common law continues to apply and it is only those that the bill seeks to deal with. The member for Murray (Mrs Stone) explained the government position in relation to this when she referred to the subject of confirmation of Crown-to-Crown grants this morning. The provision, 23B, is not intended to catch the acquisition of sovereignty by the Crown over any part of Australia which would fly in the face of Mabo No.2 and the Wik decisions, nor is it intended to catch the simple management of crown land by government. National parks and the reservation of not land generally for a purpose are not intended to be caught. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) seemed to think, in a naive sort of way, that agreements were the way to go. He referred to Yandi, Karijini, Century Zinc-which we accept were made under the act-Macarthur River, which was made before the act and is referred to in section 46, and Murrin Murrin, which I am advised is still subject to negotiation. If he was serious, he would have had a look at the history of agreements in relation to the future act notifications. I am told that in Western Australia alone there have been nearly 11,000 future act notifications. A high proportion were not objected to by native title claimants but 559 were and they involved 845 tenements. Of those, applications have only been made in respect of 172. In looking at the right to negotiate procedure proposals, again the member for Murray provided data on this this morning: 1,910 tenements have been submitted to the RTN procedures; only 148 have been cleared for lodgement of a section 34 agreement and over 1,700 remain outstanding. Looking at agreements other than in Western Australia: there are only two in Queensland, Century Zinc; in New South Wales there is only one, Crescent Head, and four relating to the eastern gas pipeline; and in Victoria there are four, again relating to the eastern gas pipeline. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) made, I think, a paltry contribution in his commentary on the constitutional advice of the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General is the most experienced advocate in constitutional matters in Australia todayMr Gareth Evans-A good hired gun, I know.",148
222,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"hired by a former Attorney-General who happens to be in the House. His formal advice in respect of the bill was a conclusion in these terms: The Parliament should be able to take the recent authority of the Court at face value. Notwithstandment ing this residual uncertainty as to how some may approach these issues, as a matter of principle and authority, it is not open to confine the power to beneficial operation. On present authority the issue is foreclosed by the decision in Western Australia. I would invite the member for Holt and the member for Banks (Mr Melham) to actually carefully read the opinion offered by David Jackson QC and Mr Stephen Gageler. It is an outstanding study which reaches a very similar conclusion to that of the Solicitor General. The subject of jobs was addressed by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), again in a fairly loose and incohesive sort of way. This bill is about responding toa community call to the government to restore certainty to native title processes: Restoration of certainty directly affects jobs. We will have progress on a number of fronts and we will certainly have jobs for Aborigines. (Time expired)",149
223,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"This Native Title Amendment Bill in its current form is of no use to any of the major stakeholders, due to the galloping uncertainty to which it gives rise. The bill is a recipe for uncertainty. It is a blueprint for anyone who wants to halt developments or tie up all interested parties in the courts into the indefinite future. It is providing certainty and workability to nobody. The 1993 legislation was seeking to provide a less complex, more accessible, more cost-effective alternative to the common law remedies. But this bill is going to tum claimants back to the common law. There is general agreement that some aspects of the act require improvement: the Brandy amendments are necessary; workable registration tests ought to be reintroduced following the court decisions reading it down; we should have provision made to address overlapping and multiple native title determination applications; and pastoralists' rights need to be particularised and confirmed. But what do we have here? We have unworkable complexity. We have the governproposing to replace a 127-page act with Judges a 293-page bill and a 385-page explanatory memorandum. As a result, you have had a great deal of public criticism of this bill's complexity, such as that from the National Farmers Federation: The sheer complexity of the legislation ... means that lawyers and farmers will be grappling for clarity for a long time to come. Mr Katter-You just don't understand it.",149
224,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"This is not from me; this is from the National Farmers Federation. The Minerals Council of Australia said: The minerals industry is concerned that the legislative response remains very legalistic and complex, and will encourage .litigation and arbitrated outcomes And from ATSIC: Instead of producing certainty and workability the amendments will result in increased confusion, uncertainty and litigation for years. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) does not understand the bill. I take you to ABC television's 7.30 Report, on which he produced a coloured map of Australia and said: Let me just show your viewers ... this shows 78 per cent of the land mass of Australia-coloured brown on this map. The Labor Party and the Democrats are effectively saying that the Aboriginal people of Australia should have the potential right of veto over further development of 78 per cent of the land mass of Australia The problem with that is that the right to negotiate does not confer a right to prevent mining from proceeding. Even the explanatory memorandum to the bill makes that clear: The right to negotiate was not a veto. So the Prime Minister's statement on the ABC's 7.30 Report was wrong and contradicts even the government's own explanatory memorandum. So the Prime Minister is either ignorant of the bill or trying to mislead the public. There is in fact no great mystery about indigenous land use agreements. They go on around the world all the time in many different settings. Even the Mining Industry Council noted: There are agreements reached with indigenous people all around the world. It is just a standard form of operation. It does not even have to be indigenous people. If we go and operate a mine near a local white community, there are consultations and efforts to take account of their interest. It Dargavel, S. 1. is a standard management practice. Indeed, in places like Canada we have agreements in indigenous areas all the time on the basis that native title rights are fully respected in the law and by government. In Australia, we saw the Cape York land use heads of agreement. I ask members of the government and, in particular, Queensland Premier, Rob Borbidge: what is wrong with the Cape York agreement? What is wrong with the parties getting together and sorting out these issues among themselves, recognising the legitimate interests of each of the parties? Instead, we have what amounts to an unworkable piece of legislation with the prospect of litigation, with the prospect of taxpayers having to foot the bill for the loss of property rights, which indigenous people now clearly have. First the Mabo decision and secondly the Wik decision have made it clear that they do have legally enforceable property rights. If we choose to confiscate those property rights, then they have an entitlement to compensation. That is already clear. Instead, we have an unworkable bill; we have a government which has tried to suppress that information coming forward from the Law Reform Commission and from other parties. It has really been a very shabby and divisive exercise. It will not solve issues of land use in these areas. It will give rise to litigation for years to come and the prospect of all of the parties being worse off. (Time expired)",150

231,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I believe so. Mr Bob Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, there are members outside the chamber who would understand that this a different question. I ask that the bells be rung for four minutes so that they can get into the chamber to cast their vote.",153
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The division is under way. The course has been set. Question so resolved in the negative.,153
233,Mr MELHAM,NOES," Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence, the opposition will be opposing the amendment to be now moved by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) on the voices. We will not be calling a division because we will be dividing on the third reading of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, and that will express our opposition to the amendment being moved by the Attorney-General. Mr Fahey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Prior to the last division a number of members left the chamber. My recollection is that at the conclusion of the second last division you called upon all members to take their seats. I probably got the best part of 150 metres away after leaving the chamber and then returned when the bells rang only to discover that a one-minute bell had been in fact ordered by yourself. About 15 members were precluded from voting at the last division. They were not successive divisions, as I understand it. There was debate between the second last division and the last. About four minutes elapsed and, Mr Deputy Speaker, your call for one-minute bells prevented some 15 members, as I estimate it, from being present and voting. I would like that to be noted, because I believe members were prevented from doing their duty.",153
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! There is no point of order. The honourable member has made his point. There was no debate. The bells were rung for one minute.  Deputy Speaker. I was unfortunately one of the members who was precluded from voting on the last division, with about 15 members of the coalition, including many ministers, because you created the impression that there were not to be successive divisions by saying that members should return to their seats or quickly leave the chamber. I think that is what you said.",153
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Can you come to your point of order?  member for Sturt I was precluded from being able to perform my duties as a member of parliament by not voting with the government on the last division. So I think we should be doing something about it.,153
236,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! I think the matter has been canvassed- Your point has been made. I think members have adequate officers who look after the business on each side of the chamber, and I imagine that members would be aware of what procedures are taking place in the chamber when they come into vote.",153
237,Mr REID,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: understanding order 203A of the standing orders of the House, when successive divisions are taken and there is no intervening debate after the first division, the bells will be rung for one minute only. I put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there was in fact debate and that the bells should have been rung for four minutes. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the same point of order: you have already ruled on this point. You have said there was no debate and the ringing of the bells for one minute was appropriate. If they cannot be in here to vote, then that is their fault, but it is not appropriate to keep taking shonky points of order when you have already ruled on it.",153
238,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"The member has made his point. I ruled and commented on the reasons why I took the decision I did. I suggest that all members, when they come into the chamber, should be aware of the decisions they are voting on. I will leave it at that.

261,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"One of the greatest achievements of the Whitlam Labor government was the establishment of community health centres. In announcing the creation of community health centres in the budget in 1973, the then Treasurer, Frank Crean, stated that they would be 'regionally organised, community based health services, with their emphasis on rehabilitation and preventative rather than curative health measures'. This program was a new approach to health care in Australia which examined for the first time the impact that environmental and social factors have on a person's health. Community health centres were the Whitlam government's response to the 1972 May report of the Interim Committee on Hospitals and Health Services entitled A community health program for Australia. The then Minister for Health, Dr Everingham, stated: The program should provide the required impetus for the establishment of much needed, but often overlooked, community based health services and should encourage communities and regions to examine their own needs and priorities and to express them to the relevant health authorities. Community health centres have traditionally taken a holistic approach to medicine with direct service provision and the wider issues of community development, education, preventive health care and self-help. Because they were administered by and accountable to the community, the centres aimed to empower local communities and individuals and offered them the opportunity to determine their own needs. The Whitlam government recognised that there needed to be a federal approach on the issue of community based medicine. This was in part due to the Labor Party's strong belief in the role that the Commonwealth has to play in these matters. However, it was to a large extent a matter of necessity, given the parlous state of health services in the states after long periods of conservative government in most of them. Regrettably, the Fraser government attempted to sabotage the scheme by handing over community health centres to the states, failing to appreciate why the Commonwealth had taken action in the first place. This has meant that over the years community health centres have fallen victim to the economic rationalist ideologies that have gripped the nation. An emphasis on preventive medicine and community development to help avoid illness is a concept that an economic rationalist has great difficulty comprehending. The idea that money can be spent now to prevent far greater expenditures and social problems in the future just does not fit into the economic rationalist paradigm. Seeing the world as a series of budget bottom lines fails to appreciate the role of community health. There have been, and continue to be, attempts by various state governments to take the community out of community health. In Victoria this June, the Kennett government replaced the elected committees of community health centres with government appointed bodies. In addition, the state government has created a number of regional health networks consisting of the hospitals and other health service providers in a particular region. These networks tender to the government to provide health services. The concepts of competitive tendering and block funding have taken their toll on community health centres. Local community health centres in the area I represent understand that they must cooperate with these networks in the delivery of health services. They are willing to examine the ways to achieve this required cooperation; however, some of the models under consideration threaten the very existence of community health itself. Currently, the five community health centres in the north-eastern region of Melbourne-Eltham, Plenty Valley, Banyule, East Preston and Northcote-have formed an alliance and are considering proposals for their future. One of the proposals, and the preferred option, is for the retention of individual services with the creation of a coordinating body to look at planning issues and service provision issues. Another option is for the complete amalgamation of all five into one---either as part of the local regional health network or with an administrative body of its own. However, such regionalisation of community health would mean that they have a different regional focus and would not have the ability to take into account specific local community needs and interests. This would mean that, if it was under the regional network, the regional network board would run the community health centres with only local advisory committees. However, advisory committees are exactly that-advisory. They have no real power. This model has already been accepted in one network in Victoria. By becoming just another part of the regional network,' the community health centres lose an integral part of the reason for their successthe community involvement. I am concerned that the network or the amalgamation models could be adopted by the alliance of the five north-eastern community health centres. This would be a disaster for the people of the north-eastern region of Melbourne, and the amalgamation/network option should be unconditionally scrapped. Division: Ringing of the Bells",157
262,Mr NAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to inform the House that I was one of the 15-odd members who missed the division earlier this evening, as I had left the House at the end of the division before that and proceeded to committee room IR2. I got all the way to committee room lR2 before the bells started to ring again. If I had been in the House, I would have voted against the amendment that was. being voted on at the time. I just wanted to inform the House that it was a very long time between those divisions and that I got all the way to I R2 before the bells were rung again. When I returned to the House, I tried to explain that as one of the people who wished to make a point of order. The Deputy Speaker in the chair at the time did not recognise me, although he recognised three other people while I was still standing. I then tried to make that explanation before the third reading. I rose at the call of the reading, and the Deputy Speaker at the time did not recognise me then. Western Australian Police Academy",158
263,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to speak tonight on a matter of great importance in the lives of Western Australians. The state government in WA has decided to investigate the benefits of relocating the WA Police Academy, including opportunities to improve the quality of training and resource usage. Western Australia suffers from an unsatisfactory high level of crime of various kinds, and many citizens, especially older citizens, have come to feel captives in their own homes. The WA police force has worked hard within the limited resources that are made available to it but suffers from shortages of manpower relative to the size of the task it faces. A reliable supply of well trained and high quality police men and women is absolutely essential if we are to win the fight against crime in Western Australia. I have recently seen an expression of interest for the colocation of the WA Police Academy with Edith Cowan University and the North Metropolitan College of TAFE. I have read the expression of interest and am very supportive of the concept. I will draw from some of the key parts of that submission to explain the great benefits that the people of Western Australia will no doubt get if the state government adopts this proposal. The location of a high quality police academy alongside two prominent education and training institutions in the heart of Perth's second city will be a source of pride for the police service and the wider community. The sheer size and strength of the ECU-North Metropolitan College partnership will facilitate access to a range of facilities and services that will add enormous value to the operations of the WA police service. ECU is the second largest university in Western Australia, with over 19,000 students enrolled and operating from five major campuses with total assets in excess of $300 third million and an annual operating budget of $150 million. The Joondalup campus has 4,100 students and a capacity to grow to 20,000. The university is a member of the unified national system of Australian universities and its awards are recognised nationally and internationally. Rigorous accreditation procedures are utilised by the university to assure quality and ongoing professional recognition of programs. The North Metropolitan College currently provides vocational education and training services to just over 47,000 students at its three major campuses. The college offers a wide range of programs in business studies, management-including police studies-office technology and so on. For the past 15 years, ECU and the North Metropolitan College have successfully integrated police specific education and training into mainstream university and TAPE programs. The concept of a strategic alliance, where the three partners coexist in a region that has a strong shared vision, will help to establish a reputation both nationally and internationally. It will attract funds, applicants and attention from police and other law enforcement organisations to the region. The strategic alliance can expect to hold policing conferences in shared facilities and attract senior police from all over the southern hemisphere. The key advantages of the WA police service co-locating with ECU and the college in the city of Joondalup can be summarised in four categories: prime location and development opportunities, educational synergies through the strategic alliance, optimisation of infrastructure and capital works development, and community immigration. Joondalup, one of Australia's fastest growing population centres, offers an ideal environment for sustained growth. The location of a police academy in Joondalup will place it in a vibrant city centre with a number of advantages including: easy access to transportation systems for both public and private systems including fast track rail and the Mitchell Freeway-Joondalup is only 26 kilometres from the Perth CBD-competitively priced land with full services and single commercial zoning of the city precinct to allow a multiplicity of use; a high profile image and community recognition; an excellent working environment with new open city planning and business campus precincts; convenience parking; a comprehensive and widening base of businesses, services and amenities; quality building developments; and a thoroughly designed management plan with a vision that balances residential, educational, recreational, business and commercial development. The breadth of activity in a co-located facility will create a nexus between training and research which will counteract training decay, a situation highlighted in the Wood royal commission into the New South Wales police force. The college is the only TAPE in WA to contribute to the nationally accredited Certificate 4 in Policing and the Diploma in Policing by providing manoeuvres in management and cultural interaction. Similarly, ECU is the only WA based university that offers higher education courses in police status. The university also offers postgraduate research and course work in justice studies, forensic psychology, addiction studies and security studies. The centre for police research, located on Joondalup campus, undertakes independent research on matters relating to policing. I have written to the Minister for Police to express my very strong support for this concept. I hope that the minister will give the Joondalup community the opportunity to become involved in this project. I am absolutely convinced that the co-locating of the WA police academy in Joondalup with the ECU and the North Metropolitan College of TAPE is the most sensible option for the state government to follow. It will bring tremendous benefits to the region and because of its obvious advantages will allow us to produce the highest quality police officers for the resources available. All Western Australians will benefit from that. I will give whatever help I can to the partners of the proposed strategic alliance or the state government to make this proposal a reality. Cooked Chicken Meat",158
264,Mr BOB BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to discuss a topic which I find almost an embarrassment to this House and that is the staged stunt today by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). In an attempt to bring on a debate about the chicken industry-they obviously had never read the House of Representatives Practice, and I refer to page 269 under 'Postponement of Notices and Orders of the Day' - on a motion I gave notice of to condemn the former Labor minister for primary industries over his stance on the importation of cooked chicken meat and to look at banning the importation of cooked and raw chicken meat, the one thing they did not realise, by bringing on this attempt to suspend standing orders, is the fact that they needed my agreement to bring the motion on for debate. Without even discussing it with me, without even having the common courtesy to let me know what he was going to do-you never know, I might have supported him-he snuck out while I was in the Main Committee getting ready to debate the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill, which is important to people in my electorate and in his electorate, like the rat that he is because he is not sticking up for the industry.",160
265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Nehl}-No. You will withdraw that.,160
266,Mr BOB BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,Which part-the 'gutter' or the 'rat'?,160
267,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Both.,160
268,Mr BOB BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Okay, I withdraw both. He snuck around, lower than low, trying to slide his way in, but without seeking my assistance on it. I thought he had the interests of the chicken growers in the Hunter-indeed of all Australians-at heart, but the only thing he was after was IS seconds of fame. Let us have a look at his track record. More importantly, let us have a look at his father's track record on the chicken industry. The member for Hunter worked for his father, the former member for Hunter. Let me refer you to debate on 24 November 1992 where in the parliament he said: My co.nstituents are. concerned that Australia may allow Imports of chicken products from Thailand, Denmark, Canada ... Do you know what his response was? His response was: They were able to develop a new vaccine that can be kept without refrigeration in the hottest of tropical conditions and that can be fed to chickens coated on chicken feed. Where was the examination of the science? There was none. That was in 1992. What about in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996? Absolutely nothing. You are an absolute fraud! But it did not stop the Labor members wandering around the electorate and up to the chicken growers, putting their hands out, looking for the dollars, taking their dollars and putting as in the paper saying, 'We will support you.' He is not the only one. The former member for Paterson ran around saying, 'I support the chicken industry.' The only words he raised in this parliament in the time he was here were: It is also the best insurance we have to make sure that chicken exports from Australia can grow ... All he was talking about was exports. Where was the examination of the science? Where was he listening to the chicken growers? I see gutter the member for Hunter has a smirk on his face. I spoke to the Chicken Growers Association today and I spoke to John Wilkinson. I said, 'John, what did you say to the member before the election?' He said, 'I went and saw Eric Fitzgibbon'-the former member for Hunter-'and it took him half an hour to realise that we were not National Textiles, half an hour to realise that we were the chicken growers.' On the second visit to his office, what did they put to him? He just threw a report about AQIS at them and said, 'I haven't got time to read this. You might find it interesting.' That is not sticking up for the chicken industry. That is not defending their rights. The current member for Hunter said in the Maitland Mercury: Chicken growers are not masochists· and I will be surprised if they show any interest in paying $75 to hear John Anderson at a lunch. Let me tell the member for Hunter that there were 92 growers there. That is better than the 12 who turned up at your free public rally. Why? Because they know who has been standing up for them. They know who explored the science. They know who went to Dr Dennis Alexander. They know who listens to them and who brought the evidence to the inquiry in September 1996. What did your mob on the other side do? Nothing; you sat on your backsides. What is the next attempt? The former member for Paterson runs out and distributes a letter to everybody in the Hunter-20,000 letters. He says, 'I'm a good guy. I'm standing up for the industry.' He says in this letter at the bottom: I'll make sure all these letters go directly Minister. And these letters are addressed to the minister. But guess what. At a check today, with 3,000 letters claimed, not one letter has been received by the minister, over a month down the track. They are frauds. All they are doing is building up their database with no concern for the constituents, no concern for the chicken industry, only hoping to build their electoral chances. The people of Paterson and the people of Australia will not accept this fraud. I seek leave to table this letter from Mr Home addressed to Mr Anderson, which he has never received, so that the minister may finally receive one letter. Leave not granted. Cooked Chicken Meat",160
269,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"Hunter) (7.52 p.m.)The member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) is a little excited-and why wouldn'the be? Today he has been exposed as a fraud-as the great misrepresenter of the Hunter. He has come in here and he has chosen to attack my father, the former member for Hunter, who is not here to defend himself, and I refuse to get down into the gutter with him. Mr Bob Baldwin-You mean climb up to me.",161
270,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Nehl)Order! The member for Paterson has had his say and will be quiet.,161
271,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"I will tell the member for Paterson what happened in 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1996. He made reference to 1992, because that is how long Denmark, Thailand and the United States have been seeking to gain access to our market. I will tell the member for Paterson what happened in those years: not one piece of chicken entered this country. That is what happened during 1992Mr Bob Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Hunter is misleading the House with this line that no chicken meat has been imported into Australia. We have been importing it from New Zealand for years.",161
272,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! There to the is no point of order. Resume your seat.,161
273,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"It is true that small amounts of chicken meat have been imported from New Zealand, and I take that point. Obviously, I was referring to the applications from Thailand, Denmark and the United States. And what did the member for Paterson and the current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) tell the industry before the election? They gave them certain assurances, and we have them in writing. They said, 'This nasty Labor government is considering letting chicken meat into this country but we won't have it.' But one month into government, John Anderson, the current minister, was out there carrying the flag for them. He was the greatest advocate of all for the proposition to import chicken meat into this country. Mr Deputy Speaker, 50,000 jobs are currently at risk because of this government's determination to allow the importation of cooked chicken meat into this country. They are the simple facts. In the Hunter, 3,000 people, directly or indirectly, rely on this industry for their livelihood. What is the response of the member for Paterson? Back in the electorate, he is on their side and giving guarantees that he will cross the floor on this issue. What did he do last Friday? He lodged in the Notice Paper a motion rejecting the importation of cooked chicken meat. But as he knows, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as I know, there was not a hope in Hades that that motion would be debated on the floor of this parliament before Christmas this year. This was a political stunt. He was back in the electorate on Friday telling the radio stations that he has lodged this wonderful motion in support of the chicken industry. He knows that this is never going to get a guernsey, but if it does, he is going to cross the floor. Today, we gave him an opportunity to cross the floor and support the chicken growing and processing industries. Do you know what he did? He dogged it. When the industry really needed him, he sold them out, and his only defence tonight is to come in here and attack my father, the former member for Hunter. What a very weak response! Mr Bob Baldwin interjecting",161
274,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order!,162
275,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"I repeat: no chicken meat from Denmark, Thailand or the United States entered this country in 1992, 1993, 1994 or 1996. A media release was issued by the member for Paterson himself this afternoon. What did he tell the Newcastle radio stations and the local newspapers? Mr Bob Baldwin-You are a fraud.",162
276,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! I warn the honourable member for Paterson.,162
277,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"He told them a lie. He told them that there was a very simple reason why he voted against his own motion: he came into the House and he was not sure what he should be voting upon. Mr Bob Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Hunter is misrepresenting me. I did not vote against it; I did not vote.",162
278,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"He came in here on a division. If he had sat on this side with own party, he would be voting against his own motion. So what did he do? He scurried out of the House, very nimbly. I have never seen a big guy move so quickly.",162
279,Mr ANTHONY,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. In previous comments made by the member for Hunter he said that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, was supporting the importation of chicken meat. That is not the case and I would like him to withdraw that.",162

281,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"Kennedy) (7.57 p.m.)Continuing on from where I left off today in the debate, it is very important to bring before the House a schedule/enlarged panel/additional page, form 20, version 1 of the QIDC loans in Queensland. I will quote from this loans document, which you sign when you borrow money from QIDC. At section 10, it reads: 10. DEFAULT 10.1 Events of Default If any of the following events or circumstances occurs, it constitutes an Event of Default: Paragraph (s) reads: ... significant environmental problem of land right claim. Then we move to paragraph (s)(i)(D): (D) a claim is made in respect of actual or alleged land rights . . . This is a very serious document.",162
282,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Is the member for Kennedy speaking about the legislation which has been dealt with this evening?,162
283,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"No, I am raising a new point which I wish to bring before the House.",162
284,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I advise the member that he would be out of order were he to try to do so.,162
285,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, I know exactly the point that you are making. I understand, Mr his Deputy Speaker; I have been around for a long time. The significance of this document is that any pastoral lease owner borrowing money from the biggest agricultural lender in Queensland, the QIDC, will be automatically in default at the discretion of the bank if, in fact, a native title claim is upheld by a court or any other tribunal. For those people who claim that there are not serious ramifications for pastoral lessees on account of the situation that exists, then all I can do is refer them to that document. In addition to that, I raise again the issue of the deedof-grant areas in Queensland. There are some seven million acres-or near enough to it-in Queensland that belong in what are called the deed-of-grant-in-trust areas in Queensland. They were once Aboriginal reserves and missions. In legislation that I passed, the ownership of those areas was vested in the local shire council. They are called community councils; they are councils for the Aboriginal community and are exactly the same as any other shire council in the state of Queensland but with a little more extensive powers. The ownership of that land was vested in those people. In a dreadful piece of legislation which precipitated the worse rioting in Queensland parliamentary history, the incoming Goss government overturned that legislation and vested ownership of that seven million acres effectively in the government.",162
