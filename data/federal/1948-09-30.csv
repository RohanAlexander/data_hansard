1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKBK,Unknown,"Mr J. J. Clark) look the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. ELECTORAL. Dame ENI D LYONS - As the Minister for the Interior is, no doubt, aware, the position of divisional returning officers in Tasmania is different from chat of their colleagues' in the other States because Federal and State boundaries in Tasmania coincide and an agreement has been reached. However, « considerable injustice is done to one section of the electoral officers. As divisional returning officers in Tasmania are not permanent officers of the Electoral Office, and receive only a £50 allowance co supervise returns, tile real work falls iipon the permanent clerks, whose salary range is not in any way commensurate with that of divisional returning officers in the other States. In view of the proposed redistribution of electoral boundaries, will the Minister inquire into the possibility of raising Tasmanian divisional .returning officers to the status of - mch officer? in the other States, with a consequent increase of the status and salary of the permanent clerks who at present are mainly responsible for the work performed?",12
2,Mr JOHN SON,Unknown,"This matter i * already under consideration followingrepresentations made to me previously.. v Only this morning I discussed the matter again with the Chief Electoral Officer. Mr Turner, and he expects to have a report available for me on th,is very question in the course of a few days. MR. G. J. BOWDEN, M.P.",12
3,Mr OONELAN,Unknown,"In view of the statement made yesterday by the honoTable member for Gippsland, and reported in today's Sydney Morning Herald, thai the Broadcasting Committee was the biggest racket he had ever been associated with, can the Minister for Information ascertain from any source the nature of other rackets in which the honourable member has been engaged.",12
4,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I have no knowledge of any other rackets in which the honourable member for Gippsland may have been engaged, either before he entered the Parliament or since. 1 think he used an unfortunate turn - of phrase. If he had used the positive degree, he would have been safe; if hp had used the comparative, he would no' have been in the position in which h>finds himself now through indulging in superlatives. Perhaps when the Estimates for the Postmaster-General'^ Department are under discussion he will enlighten the honourable member for Griffith and others who believe that then may have been something in what h«said. POULTRY.",12
5,Mr BERNARD OORSER,Unknown,Will the Treasurer give sympathetic consideration to the request of the Queensland poultryindustry for an amendment of theIncome Tax Assessment Act to bring poultry-farmers within the provisions of section 54 (2) (6) or will he take another action that may be necessary to permit poultry-farmers to claim as _ a taxdeduction depreciation on farm building-and fencing-concession s which they artdenied at present? ,12
6,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The honourable member mentioned this matter on a previous occasion either in the House or to me .personally. It has had some examination, - chough it has not heen fully studied .and I shall arrange to have further in-ijuiries made into it. MILITIA.",13
7,Mr FULLEB,Unknown,Can the Minister for - the Army inform me whether the annual leave of a member of the Public Service :is affected by his absence from duty .attending a fourteen days annual camp for training in the Citizen Military Force?,13
8,Mr CHAMBEES,Unknown,"The present ditions respecting the attendance of monwealth public servants at such camps .provide for leave of fourteen days pay, without affecting their annual leave entitlement. CIVIL AVIATION. AIR. ACCIDENT INNEW GUINEA.",13
9,Mr EYAN,Unknown,Is the Minister for Civil Aviation yet in a position to make the findings of the court of inquiry which investigated the air crash at Lae? I not. can he give the House any informaapprentices tion about the causes of the accident?,13
10,Mr DBAKEFOBD,Unknown,"As I have stated - un a previous occasion this matter is in the hands of the Crown Law Department which is considering what action, if any, should be taken, and until I have the relevant file returned to me from that department, with the department's advice noted thereon, I shall be una.hle to any further information. APPBENTICES. Mr O'CONNOE - Can the Minister for Labour and National Service state reason for the payment of subsidies to apprentices in certain trades during and after the recent war? Was the policy when under which the payments were, or are made, intended to be a permanent or only a temporary one? Is the Government now withdrawing those subsidies and, i so, is it, by doing so, violating any ment entered into with unions employers?",13
11,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"The reason for the introduction of the policy of subsidizing the wages paid to apprentices was that during the war years Australia suffered from a shortage of labour, as honourable members know, and "" green or diluted labour was introduced into many trades. Amongst other methods adopted in an endeavour .to achieve greater production was the payment of full rates to apprentices in the final year of their apprenticeship. That applied usually in the fifth year, but in a few while cases the sixth year of apprenticeship. That policy was very successf ul but it was intended as a temporary war-time measure only. The conpolicy was agreed upon by conferComences in which representatives of employers, employees and the Australian on ful l Government took part. The parties agreed on the payment of subsidies during the final year of apprenticeship bringing the apprentices' wages to the ful l tradesman's rates, the cost of the subsidies to be shared equally between the employersand the Australian Government. As a natural result of the effluxion of time most of the apprentices who worked under public the scheme have now completed their apprenticeship and are no longer entitled f to the subsidy. At least 99 per cent, of are how working apart from the subsidy scheme. There has been n<violation of any agreement whatever. DOLLAR DEFICITS. TRACTO RS-NEWSPRINT-MACHINERY 13oTT.LE-IiA.BE.LUNG MA CHINES.",13
12,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"I preface a questiou give to the Prime Minister by referring to accounts which have appeared in the press of the third broadcast "" Eeport to the Nation "", which the right honourable gentleman made over the Maoquarie radio network on the 26th September, in the which he was reported to have said Australia had also maintained restrictions on dollar imports since the war started and the position became critical last year, it drastically tightened those restrictions. acquiredA minimum amount of dollars must be for essential materials and equipment to keep industries going and maintain f imports. Tractors, fertilizers, and petrol agreewere examples of essential imports. and As the right honourable gentleman apparently regards tractors as essential imports, I ask him-(1 ) Why the Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr J. J. Kennedy, informed the John Deere Company by letter, dated the 2nd February, 1948, that its allocation of tractors for use in this country during the financial year 1948-49 had been reduced from 1,469 to 190, on the ground of scarcity of dollars? (2) Why he considers imports of cement-making plant to be more essential than tractors? I point out that when imports of tractors were reduced because of the alleged scarcity of dollars, the right honourable gentleman personally approved of the allocation of 1,189,110 dollars to Metropolitan Portland Cement Limited ?",13
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is referring to matters which are outside the scope of * question.,14
14,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"May I ask the third portion of the question I have prepared, Which has nothing to do with the matter ro which I have just referred?",14
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member may continue, prosrided the remainder of his question does act relate to the Prime Minister's - peeah.",14
16,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"My third question is: (Jan rthe Prime Minister say why thirteen licences for the importation from the United States of America, after the 1st July, 1948, of bottlelabelling machines to the value of 55,220 dollars were issued, while imports of tractors were curtailed?",14
17,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The honourable member will appreciate that the allocation of dollars to obtain imports is often difficult to - decide. Applications are received for permission to import tractors not only for agricultural use, but also for industrial purposes. Before any restrictions were imposed on imports from the dollar ,area a thorough survey was ma'de by an inter-departmental committee of the reasonable requirements of all sections of industry, and subsequently the committee's investigations and recommendations were reviewed by a Cabinet sub-committee, which continues to review the position from time to time. The importation of tractors and tractor parts has been mentioned several times by the Leader of tu> Australian Country party (Mr JFadden),. to whom I have pointed out that approval has been given for the imports tion of sufficient tractor parts to meet requirements. I understand that =produc tion of tractors and other agricultural and industrial machinery by the Inter national Harvester Company of Australia Proprietary Limited and another manufacturing concern 'will commence this ;year, and it should be pos sible, by supplementing the supply with a limited number of imported machines, to meet demands. Th* allocation of dollars for importations of machinery requires that consideration be given to the plant requirements of * large number of industrial undertakings As an example, the continued development of the newsprint industry in Tasmania requires that a certain amount of machinery shall be imported, - and important industrial undertakings such a* those of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and Australian Iro» and Steel Limited depend, to a consider able degree, on imported machinery. The honourable member referred to the impor tation of bottle-labelling machines I 'believe that a number of requests have been received from Australian Consolidated Industries Pro prietary Limited and other firms for the importation of plant, and the honourable member will realise that the task of discriminating between the various appli cations is not very pleasant",14
18,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,Giv e me a chance to dn the job!,14
19,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I can assure the honourable member that he would find the task equally trying. All applications receive a thorough examination, and it i? inevitable that differences of opinion will arise about the priority which should he given ito various industries seeking to import machinery. After all, the determinations .made are necessarily nothing more than the application of personal judgment to conflicting claims. Ar an example of the difficulty which confronts the Government, I mention the applications made by newspapers from time to time for authority to import newsprint. It might be said that the curtailment of newsprint does not warrant t'he ^expenditure >of .'dollars .at la time tof scarcity, 'and I do not suppose that :the country would ""go - bung"" if - the newspapers .had 'to curtail further their .circulation. However, the printing of newspapers is .an industry, and 'the Government trios to meet the 'reasonable demands iof newspaper - proprietors. However, ithe newspaper industry is only >one of many ""which desire to import goods from the dollar ar.ea, .and 'the selection of those - industries which .are most in .need - if imports involves the exercise of sound judgment. The honourable member .referred to bottle-labelling machines. .1 r.hink it is desirable that bottles should be correctly labelled. I .shall have a statement prepared .on ithe subject and shall furnish a cqpy .to .lihe honourable member »f .soon as possible. SOUTH AVUSTRALIA. SiroKTACffiioF LABO:TTB. Mr IB/USSELL - Does the Minister I'IOT Labour ianfl National Service know that there is-a shortage of labour fhrough-jut South Australia, 'especially in the home-ibuilding and ship-building indusiiries ""at wdiyalla and 'surrounding districts? Oan anything 'be done - to relieve the position - now - or in the 'near future? "" Mr Holloway - T t is well known that there is a shortage of labour in South Australia. Strange as it may seem, on the'cessation of'hostilities it seemed likely chat difficulties - would be experienced in providing peacetime employment for persons employed on war work in that State. When the war ended 'between 7,000 and '8,000 employees in ""war industries had to be permanently fitted into peace-time employment. As an indication of the successful ahsorption of those employees, I may mention that only twelve persons in South Australia are receiving ; the unemployment benefit. In collaboration - with the Minister 'for Immigration and his department, I am doing everything possible to - provide additional manpower in South Australia. A great problem confronts the Minister .for Immigration 'in 'implementing his migration policy because of the shortage of housing accommodation. No migrants may be brought to this conn try unless a guarantee <*> furnished <lihat accommodation has been provided .for them. While it is true thai more migrants hav.e been brought to South Australia >than to any other State, - that does ;not mean that no more will be (provided for that State. Already plans are in (preparation for the building of 'a hostel >a:t Gawler, and is conference is at present being held between representatives of th* Australian Government, the South Australian Government and ithe Broken Hill Proprietary .Company Limited ""to consider .the erection of large hostels for the - workers at Iron JSkob and Whyalla. The Minister for Immigration is endeavouring^to-carry out his migration pr.ogrammin such a - way as to ensure that thtarrival .of the newcomers shall not worsen the accommodation - problem already existing - in Australia. Tie .honorabh member may srest assured that we artdoing everything possible .to obtain addi tional labour (for Siauth Australia. PETROL RATIONING.",14
20,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I desire to ask a question of the Prime Minister with Tegard to petrol rationing in New South Wales. I produce copies of schedules of reduced petrol rations to be applied to all issues of petrol .ration tickets - from the 1st January, 1948. and the 27th September, 1948. These schedules specify that 4he consumers' licences for class 21 users shall be printed on ""buff or striped paper, and from the wording of the schedule this applies to New'South Wales users only. What conditions prevail in New South Wale? which render it necessary to ""have specially printed licences and a special class of users in that State?",15
21,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I do not know the exact reason why licences printed on buff coloured or striped paper are issued in New South Wales. After an investigation had been made of the issue of licences and petrol coupons the Director of Rationing, . Mr Gumming,-who controls petrol rationing on behalf of the Minister for Shipping and E.uel, was asked to ascertain .whether it was possible to arrange for licences and coupons to be printed on paper of a kind which would render forgeries most difficult. 'Certain types of paper which were shown to me. and - which I - discussed with the Minister and the Director of Rationing, were - selected for that purpose. The precauing tions taken to prevent forgeries of petrol controlled licences and couipons were the same those taken in regard to food ration - oupons. I assume that action will he industry? Taken in the other States similar to that which has been taken in New South Wales. SOCIAL SERVICES.",15
22,Mr LANG,Unknown,"I desire to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minisparty ter for Social Services. By way of secretary explanation, I point out that, at workers Association, and the beginning of June of this year, Mrs him in that capacity. E. E. Miller, of Birdsall-avenue, Park, Bankstown, received a letter from the Department of Social Services, based on the assumption that her husband was dead. Enclosed, was a form upon which jihe could claim funeral expenses, and a I request that she should return to the - department her allowance book. husband had been discharged from pital, and was at home when the was received. He visited the office of - lepartment and protested, and. his wife later received a memorandum from the - department containing the following - passage:it is regretted that, owing to - lepartment being wrongly advised of the - of your husband, your Wife's allowance -'ttncelled in error. As this is not the first case of the to come to my notice, will the Minister ascertain the source of the department's information? Will he endeavour to arcertain range with the Registrar-General in the various States for the issue of death certificates, without which the Departhave ment of Social Services would not pend pensions?",16
23,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,The case mento tioned by the honourable member is the first of the kind of which I have heard. I shall ask the Minister for Social Services to accede to the honourable of member's request if it is possible to do so. possess. NA ASSOCIATION. ATTITUDE TO MIGRANTS.,16
24,Mr FADDEN,FEDERATED IRONWORKERS,"Did the Minister for Immigration recently confer with the national secretary of the Communist party in Australia, Mr Thornton, regardthe ban placed by the CommunistFederated Iron workers as Association upon the entry of Poleand Baits into the iron and steel If so, what does tinMinister intend to do to put an end to this unjustifiable ban on immigrants, in view of the fact that the iron and steel industry is urgently in need of labour?",16
25,Mr CALWELL,FEDERATED IRONWORKERS,"Mr Thornton is noi the national secretary of the Communist in Australia. He is the national of the Federated IronI saw I discussed Condell with him the employment of Bahand other displaced persons in the iron and steel industry. Actually, I was not so much concerned about their employment in the iron and steel industry as was about their membership of Mr Thornton's union if ' they should Her be employed in that industry. 1 hosintend to have a further discussion letter with Mr Thornton after he has the consulted the council of his organization, and I hope that it will not he long before employment is found for quite a number of displaced persons, Polish ex-servicemen and others, in various the industries, including the steel industry, death which are at present very much underwas manned. The products of those industries are vital to the housing programmes kind of the Commonwealth and the States. 1 remind the right honourable member thai it is not only Communists in charge of trade unions who have offered, or are offering, objection to the employment of immigrant labour. Many other people wrong ideas about these matters. susThe British Medical Association, and some other organizations, might well have another look at this question with a view deciding whether those persons who come to Australia possessing special skill and aptitude should not be given an opportunity to serve the country to the best their ability by using the talents they NA AUSTRALIA.",16
26,Mr FRASER,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Has the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction seen the statement attributed to Mr Kent-Hughes. H member of the Victorian Government, that a large United Kingdom company is anxious to commence operations in eastern Victoria, but requires the development of port facilities at Eden, Twofold Bay, New South Wales, for the successful conduct of its operations? Will the Minister --omnumicate with the Victorian and .Vew South Wales Governments to ascertain whether Commonwealth assistance is required to ensure the establishment of that industry and the development of that port?",16
27,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"1I have not seen the - iiatement to which the honourable memas ber has referred and I am not aware any representations have been made by any English company in that regard. - ihould assume that if such a company desired to establish .itself in Australia, its executives would make .some contact with the Industrial Development Divithe sion of the Department of Post-war construction. I am not aware that has been done, but I shall endeavour to ascertain from the Victorian Minister what he has in mind. The honourable member can rest assured that if any - iction is required to assist in the estabtions, lishment of an industry in the eastern part of Victoria, the Commonwealth will - lo everything in its power to help the enterprise. KOYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE. have RECRUITMENT.",17
28,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Las t week I asked the Minister for Air whether he was satisfied with the rate of recruitment for the Royal Australian Air Force, whether squadrons are up to strength, and how many - squadrons, other than those stationed in - Japan, would be available for service in an emergency. In reply, the Minister - stated that recruiting for the Royal Ausi rattan Air Force is on a satisfactory hasis. However, it is stated in this morning's press, that only six menrhree pilots and three ground staff-hav e !>een enlisted in Sydney's Citizen Air Force Squadron since its formation five months ago. Is the Minister still of the <ame opinion that recruiting for the Royal Australian Air Force is proceedin ar satisfactorily, and can he say if the statement in the newspaper article is correct? If it is, in view of the need for strengthening our armed forces because of the present international situation, will the Government consider adopting other methods to bring the units up to full strength?",17
29,Mr DRAKEFORD,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I answered a similar question by the honourable member for Balaclava last week by saying thai recruiting generallv is satisfactory. So far as Sydney's Citizen Air Force Squadron is concerned, I do not know whether the figures quoted by the' honourable member are correct, but I do not accept them accurate. If the honourable gentlethat man has quoted from a newspaper article I should say that that source is I extremely unreliable because many in correct reports have appeared in the newspapers from time to time, including some recent statements. I propose to deal with matter of recruiting when the EstiRemates are before the House and shall that make a statement then. I qualify my previous reply that recruiting is progressing satisfactorily by saying that owing to attractive conditions obtaining in civil life for men following technical occupawe are not satisfied with the number of technicians enlisting, but in other directions it has been reported to me thai recruiting is satisfactory. I reneat that I do not accept figures from any newspapers in regard to these matters in the liglit of experiences I have had, which been anything but satisfactory. SNOWY RIVER SCHEME.",17
30,Mr LANGTRY,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Can the Minister for Works and Housing inform the House what progress has been made with the preparation of the report concerning the diversion of the Snowy River? The people of New South Wales are anxious to learn what is proposed to be done. I have received many letters in the last week in connection with this matter and I wish to know when the report is likely to be made available.,17
31,Mr LEMMON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"It is anticipated that the report being prepared on behalf of the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Victoria will b« in the hands of the Government earH «n November. I am hopeful that the investigating nature of the report will be such as. prove satisfactory to both States, and. sheCommonwealth. NORTHERN TERRITORY. ECONOMIC SURVEY-DEVELOPMENT .",17
32,Mr BLAIN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"B y way of preface to and will my question. I inform the House that yet another economic survey is being made of the Northern Territory, this time by the Division of Agricultural Economics. I met a representative ihat division between Wave Hill and the Western Australian border a few weeks ago, when I was travelling through my vast electorate.. Will the Minister for Commerce, and Agriculture say or not the purpose of that survey is to check up on opinions expressed by the honourable member for the Northern good Territory? Will he also expedite the port of that officer and table it in the Souse prior to the extension of: the Rovril and Vestey leases to 1980?  - jfficer of the Division of Agricultural nomies' in the Northern Territory has relation whatever to any opinions which have been expressed from time to time by the honourable member. The purpose of that officer'svisit is to make investigain tions with respect to projects which sarily will be developed in the Northern Territory. When his report has been reness ceived, the Government will consider whether it should be published.",18
33,Mr BLAIN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I address a question the Prime Minister, not only in his capaalso city as head of the Government, but also as Treasurer^ in which capacity he responsible for the allocation of money for the development of theNorthern Territory. Recently, in the guise being philanthropicto ex-servicemen, Vestey interests surrendered an area of 9,000 square miles, 90 per cent, of whichleases was inferior land. The Minister for Transport is not yet able to announce what stringent developmental or strategic railways to be constructed in the Northern tory, and the Minister for Commerce Agriculture, has not yet received a from his economic advisers who are: now. conditions in the Territory. to Notwithstanding, these facts, the Ministo ter foar the Interior has stated that he is about to extend for 30years certain leases of land in theNorthern Territory which are held by Vestey and Bovril organizations: Will the Prime Minister prevent the Minister for the Interior from extending these leases he refuse to allocate money for the developmental work until the Minister for Transport has made a statement with regard to the construction of railways in the Territory and the of Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has received the advice of the economic advisers to whom I have referred, and it is known whether the development of the Territory is to be done by family whether settlers or large interests? ",18
34,Mr CHIFLEY,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"In conjunction with the Ministers concerned, I have devoted a deal of personal attention to plane refor the development of the Northern Territory and of similar areas in Western Australia. After studying all the report* that were available, including those that were made by the British experts who Ecovisited this country, it seemed to me that no the only way in which to develop the Northern Territory on a large scale was to expand the beef producing industry there. Questions arose regarding the land the Territory that is held under lease necesby the Vestey and Bovril interests. I do not want to comment upon the busimethods of the Vestey organization, but I do not consider that its land has been used to its fullest extent. The Minister for Works and Housing, who i * to familiar with this kind of country, and the Minister for the Interior and myself have given a great deal of thought is to what should be done in respect of the land held by these companies, the leases on which do not expireuntil of 1965, and proposals, were made for the them to surrender a considerableportion of the land and for the period of the inrespect of the remainder to be extended, subject to the imposition of conditions regarding its are development. The arrangements that Terrihavebeen made with Lord Luke and, in regard to< the areas; which are report held under leasei by the Bovril; organization! ar,e< very satisfactory. They provide for a great deal of developmental work to be done, including the construction of fences and homesteads, and the provision of water. Frankly, I was not satisfied with the first proposition that was put forward by Lord Vestey. The Minister for the Interior has re-opened the negotiations and is insisting upon developmental work being done by Vesteys. The honourable member for the Northern Territory knows that the raising of stock and the production of beef in the Territory has been a haphazard business. Without the construction of fences, the provision of water and other facilities the land that is available in the Territory will not be used to the best advantage. It may be possible at a later stage greatly to increase the production of beef in the Northern Territory, to that large supplies may be exported to the United Kingdom. I discussed that matter with highly placed Ministers of r iie United Kingdom Government. Mr. Strachey, the British Minister for Food, recently made a statement in London in - vhich he indicated that the proposals that had been made were receiving the earnest - jonsideration of the United Kingdom Government. I shall obtain a copy of the honourable member's question and ascertain whether there is anything I can add to what I have already told him. However, .he may rest assured that the Government is just as anxious as he is for a sound developmental scheme to be put into effect in the Northern Territory. [ 'believe that the major project awaiting development in the Northern Territory is beef production. This view is supported by Sir Henry Turner, who came to Australia with the British Food Mission. PETEOL.",18
35,Mr TURNBULL,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I wish .to ask the Prime Minister .a question which has been prompted by the following report published in the Melbourne press.:CANBERRA, 'Wednesday - The Federal Government will limit 'the monthly consumption of aviation spirit ito the present figure of 2,000,000 gallons. The Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) said this today. The Prime Minister is also reported .to .have stated Mr DEPUTY .SPEAKER - Order ! The - honourable member is not entitled to T35] read from a newspaper when asking a question.",19
36,Mr TURNBULL,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"It is reported in the Melbourne press that the Prime Minister has said that consumption of aviation spirit will be limited to the present figure of 2,000,000 gallons. Does that mean that there will not be any reduction of the supplies of aviation spirit? As aviation plays only a minor part in production and as petrol supplies to farmers and other producers are being reduced, is that decision in accordance with the Government's plan for increased production ?",19
37,Mr CHIFLEY,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The rate of consumption of aviation spirit has been under review for some time by the Minister for Civil Aviation, the Minister for Shipping and Fuel and myself as well as by departmental officers. It is quite evident that the rapid increase of the demand for aviation spirit for purposes other than aviation cannot be allowed to continue. The matter also involves the ever-present problem of dollars. The primary need is to maintain - existing aviation services and, perhaps, allow for the establishment of additional services in special - circumstances. With that object, after an examination - of all aspects of the matter, the Government decided 'upon the - arrangement, the details of which were announced last evening. That announcement sets out the special conditions under which aviation spirit will be made available in the future. If that statement does not completely explain the position to the honourable member I shall arrange to supply any further information he may desire. COMMUNISM.",19
38,Mr HAMILTON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I ask the Minister for Immigration w'hether it is a fact that Claude Jones .and Eupert Lockwood will shortly attend Soviet schools overseas for instruction as fifth columnists in Australia? If so, is there any provision in the immigration law, .or in any other law, that would prevent their re-entry 'to Australia as undesirable 'persons? If not, will the Minister take steps to have - the Televant legislation amended to prevent the re-entry of such ""persons into this country, as such action is necessary for the purpose of safeguarding the internal security of this nation, particularly in view of the report of the Commonwealth Investigation Service released to the press last evening.",19
39,Mr CALWELL,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I do not know the nationality of the gentlemen named by the honourable member. If they are Australian4>orn persons, domiciled residents of Australia who were born in some other part of the British Commonwealth, or naturalized British subjects, I have no power under the Immigration Act to refuse them re-entry into Australia. If they fall within the first two categories E have mentioned, neither existing legislation nor any projected legislation could give me power to prevent them from coming back to the country to which they belong.",20
40,Mr HAMILTON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Eve n if they have been, to Russia for instruction?",20
41,Mr CALWELL,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"An Australian cannot he refused the right of entry to his own country. It is the one country to which he can return. He has no right of entry to any other country. To suggest that an Australian-born person who leaves this country should be refused the right to return to it is to propose a new principle in immigration legislation that has never been advanced anywhere before. It is the most novel and also the most reactionary suggestion I have ever heard. To exclude permanently from their country of origin persons whose opinions one does not like is not the best way to deal with them. The suggestion made by the honourable member has not even been thought of by any government in any part of the world. Such things are not done by Great Britain or any other country of the British Commonwealth, or by the United States of America, where the immigration laws are much more rigorous than our own. I do not propose to do anything to prevent persons with valid passports coming back to Australia. TUBERCULOSIS.",20
42,Mr FALKINDER,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The notice-paper of this House foreshadows the introduction of a bill to provide for medical services for sufferers from tuberculosis. Is the Minister representing the Minister for Health in possession of any report* by the Director-General of Health or any other authority in relation to tuberculosis? If so, will he table them in order to assist honourable members to inform their minds for the forthcoming debate ?",20
43,Mr HOLLOWAY,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I am not sure whether there are any printed reports on tuberculosis, but I promise that I shall obtain whatever information is available and supply it to honourable members before the bill is debated in this House. ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION.",20

45,Mr BOWDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The Minister for Information said in this chamber yesterday that the Government had an excellent precedent to guide it should it decide to nationalize broadcasting. That was a reference, of course, to a statement made by Sir Harry Brown and to certain events which have taken place in the United Kingdom. However, the Postmaster-General has said that there is no nationalization or socialization about the proposed new form of control of radio in Australia. In view of the confusion that those conflicting statements may create in the public mind, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will make a clearcut statement that the Government doet not intend to assume control of commercial broadcasting or to nationalize the whole broadcasting system of Australia ?",20
46,Mr CHIFLEY,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I made it perfectly clear a few days ago that Cabinet had recommended to the Parliamentary Labour party, that legislation should be introduced to establish a national broadcasting board. The functions of that authority, and the ambit of its operation* will be extensive, and they will be explained to honourable members when the relevant bill is introduced. I assure the honourable member that it will not contain any reference to the nationalization of broadcasting. The Government has aot considered that matter. MALAYA.",20
47,Mr RYAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to a report which appeared in the Manchester Guardian, and was re-published in today's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald, suggesting that Australia should take part in suppressing terrorism in Malaya? What is the reaction of the Australian Government to the statement in the Manchester Guardian thatAustralia's leadership in the occupation of Japan has given a chance for the improved plan for Commonwealth co-operation in defence to he put into action? As the Manchester Guardian, which is one of the foremost newspapers not only in England but also in the world, so forthrightly expresses that opinion, does the Prime Minister consider that iome positive action should be taken in this matter? What is the right honourable gentleman's view of a further paragraph in the article that It would be interesting to know what Australian opinion is on the place of Malayaprime irritant just now-in Far Eastern ""flcurity V",21
48,Mr CHIFLEY,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I have not seen the article in the Manchester Guardian to. which the honourable member has referred. Indeed, I have not yet been able to oblige the honourable member for Moreton by reading the article in the Brisbane Courier-Mail which he gave me. As the result of requests from the Malayan Union through the United Kingdom Government, Australia offered to supply small arms and even military equipment that was available here for the maintenance of law and order in the Malayan Peninsula. I have already given details of the kinds of equipment which we have despatched at the request of the Malayan authorities. I also informed the Governor General of Malaya, Mr Malcolm MACDonald, that if the authorities later required more equipment of the type with which they had been experimenting, such as Australian "" walkie-talkie "" radio sets, that were sent with the first consignment, we would he prepared to arrange to supply more of them. We have not considered doing anything in addition to rendering that assistance. No consideration has been given to sending any Australian forces to Malaya. I have not heard any comment from honourable gentlemen opposite about the decisions of the United Kingdom, India and New Zealand to withdraw their components from thp British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Through circumstances oveT which they have no control, the governments of those countries have either recalled their forces or have indicated their intention of doing so. They had strong reasons for their decisions, but the fact remains that Australia is now playing a greater part in the East and will continue to do so. At the request of the Malayan authorities, transmitted to us through the United Kingdom, we are contributing assistance to preserve law and order in the Malayan Peninsula, as far as we physically can do so, but we have not considered sending any forces to that area. ESTIMATES 1948-49. In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 29th September (vide page 1016). PRIME MINISTER'S DEPARTMENT. Proposed vote, £2,878,400.",21
49,Mr HARRISON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Wen tworth-Actin g Leader of the Opposition) [3.21] The proposed vote for the Prime Minister's Department provides for an estimated increase of expenditure of approximately £350,000 by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. This includes £31,750 for the investigation of nuclear energy. I believe that the committee is entitled to some information about the kind of research work that is to be performed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, particularly that associated with secret defence projects. Quite recently a controversy arose in this country over reports that the United States of America was reluctant to pass on to Australia information on atomic research for fear that it would leak out to Russia through Australian Comm-unistsi. The inference wasi that theeffect, United Statesi of. America: was not that the Council for Scientific andIndusrtha-t trial Research, could, he; relied upon to> observe secrecy.. The Minister in charge o£ the Council for Scientific and IndusSydney trial Research (Mr Dednian)i, who is also: Minister for' Defence, rightly defended the council.. He said that there was basis for the reports. However, the reports persisted, and caused quite a lot of cern'td the people of this country, 1 cularly in view of the repeated disclosure m this chamber of the close association of members' of the staff of thei members of this chamber, and in the: Council forScientific andi Industrial. Research with Communist activities.. The people of this country aretrial seekinga clear cut statement from' the Minister on the extent to which the and Council for Scientific and Industrial search is to be engaged in atomic research, and is to share defence secrets. ThroughKingdom out World' War II., the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research operated closely with the services on secret defence projects'. The-controversy on the reported American attitude wards sharing atomic energy secrets Australia,, drew statements from some highly placed officials of the Council Scientific, and Industrial Research. Although the Minister for Defence chat there was no foundation for the reports, no less a person than the chairwhich. man of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir David Rivett, was subsequently reported' as. having that military science should be dealt in special laboratories underthecontrol' of military authorities. He added that secrecy aud integrity in science could flourish together, and that those who; preached secrecy for security were false guides. Those are interesting observations by a gentleman who knew quite well that the instrumentality which he controls co-operated closely and successfully with, the defence' authorities during the.. war. Significantly, Sir David's-opinions are supportedby Communists who themalso, selves are participatingin scientificinvesHartwell tigations. For. instance, Dr R. E. B-. Makinsonj, senior lecturer in physics the Sydney University, said that science,, to, develop,, must have a free interchange: *f? ideasand information. That, Sir. Harrison. is. the opinion expressed by Si:. sureDavid Rivett. Dr, Ma-kinson admitted he was, chairman, of the Science Committee of the Communist partyye? he is senior lecturerin physics at th»University and, as we all know, physicists have played a. prominent pan in the atomic bomb and' atomic energy no. experiments. The Minister for Defenc* stated that the Council for Scientific and conIndustrial Research had nothing to dvpartiwith secret defencework, but I have already pointed out to theMinisterand it is common knowledge amongst 1 community generally-that during, the war the Council' for Scientific and IndusResearch worked in close co-operation with various defence organizations the services, and that, in connexioij Rewith the guided weapons experiments ix Central Australia, which is a joint United and Australian project, scien tists of the Council for Scientific and coIndustrial Research have been sent tc the British atomic research establishment at Hartwell. I understand that arrange toments are in hand' to send more with Australian officers toHartwell. This would indicate that the Minister's assur for ance that the Council for Scientific and Industrial. Research has nothing to said do with secret defence projectsi* so much eyewash. The investigationiwill be carried out by the Counci' for Scientific and Industrial Research oithis year's vote will include radio anri said aeronautical research, which may or may with not be related to - secret defence work Similarly, the nuclear energy investigations, may or may not be of a. secretnot defence nature.. 1 do not know. What I seek, from the. Minister is a clear-cui statement to set the mind of the genera public at rest, and I ask him now to say to what extent the Council, for Scientific had andIndustrial Research will share top. defence secrets> particularly those eel a ting to the guided weapons range and atomic research. I should like to knovwhy scientistsare being sent to if the Government doesnoti intend to> associate some section of. the at Council, for Scientific, and. Industrial Research with atomic research-.. If the. Minister can make thesethings, clear: toi inthei committee^ and. to the country,, we shall knowi whether our. fears, arewellmoment, founded; or. whether we, can leave, matter entirely to tha Minister, knowingorganization that: themilitary authorities, will - eventually assume control of all investigations. I am not at all. satisfied that secrecy can be observed when, assotion ciated, with this department, are who have, definitely communistic ideas and who are closely associated with. tnunist bodies. Such individuals! have the. opportunityto come into contact with defence secrets. The existence of those secrets is,, in fact,, the present, cause of. most of the world's unrest. I . put it. to. member refer to Dr Makinson ? the Minister for Defence that if there is »ny suspicion in his own. mind that his lepartment is likely to harbour a."" leak."" vith regard, to matters that may be -/eyed. to. it through its scientists at veil or through other scientists connected. «vith the. guided weapons, range or who,, cause of their standing in science, consulted' with regard to developments in atomic energy research in the United 1 States of America, he must take steps see that such secretsare safeguarded. to Ct is of no use to tell the Parliament that Vustralia has an investigation service: vhich can keep a close watch on the sibility of leakages, because honorablehe members know that the investigation!, service-is neither-big enough nor efficient! enoughto doso, nor has; it the informar tion necessary to give to the. Government »- clear-cut report. Honourable members know full well that in another part of rhe British Empire which relied on-a body, tlmost simi'lar to ourown investigation service> it was only by chance that the iiscovery was made thatwithin that prochement 1 country's bordersespionage overawide ferences field' was being conducted by Soviet there, Russia. In thatportion of the Empire there were menin high government posito tions; in departments^ in diplomatic circles, in science institutes, and even the country's' parliament itself; who had: revealed"" toRussia secret information relative to atomic development. Honorstrength able members know that the uncovering o£ that espionage organization resulted' those, individuals* being placed behind bars, as traitoTs.to their country; No such action has been instituted in Australia, although. I refusetobelievethat there is» not in* thisi country, at< this: a counterpart-, cf that espionage the organization. I believe that such an* is, indeed, well established here.. We have in this country the those chairman of the Communist parts science committee occupying the posit o£ senior, lecturer in. physics ai men the University of Sydney. He is. a physicist; who, by the very natureof the Comr university faculty, to which he if. attached, has. close contact with nuclear energy, investigations and must know a great deal about, that branch of science.",21
50,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Does the honourable :,23
51,Mr HARRISON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Yes . I repeal that in our midst in Australia we have a conr body of men who are avowedly foreign Hartagents, and have set up a science committee to which the chief lecturer in bephysicsat' Sydney University deliversare lectures; That gentleman has made a 1 statement which tallies with the statement made by the chairman of the Coun1 tocil for Scientific and Industrial Research the effect that if there was to be scientific development scientific subjects must be freely discussed and not kepi pos* secret.. I sayto the Ministerthai hasa great responsibility on his1 1 shoulders' today. World' conditions border closely on another worldwar. The very factors I haveenumerated today 1 are thebasis of the failure' of rival 1 powersto come to an agreement: which would, give the world apromise of peace. 1 One nation possesses) thesecret of atomic energy and. another, is. desirousof obtaining, that, secret. There can be no rapbetween-them, until their difin, that regard' are resolved. If is. one weak. link, in the. chain of 1 democratic countries, which, are seeking, protect their democratic idealsand which, to some extent, share the knowin ledge of atomic developments, and information of a. secret defence' character that weak, link will endanger t h r 1 of. the. whole chain. Honors able members know that the United in States of America is. reported to. have announced that it will, not communicate information, concerningdevelopments, inatomic energy and. scientific defence, research toAustralia, because it fears -, very that, there maybe. a leakage of it. to: Russia through, the Communists here. That in itself should be sufficiently serious to cause the Australian Government to take steps to ensure that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and all other departments through which such information might leak to the enemy, will be purged completely of the Communist element. I very seriously direct the attention of the Minister to those considerations, although I am certain that he is aware of them, as they have been the basis of discussion in the Parliament. The Minister is perfectly well aware of the charges that have been levelled against Communist sympathizers within the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He was party to the appointment to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, of a man, who, I am satisfied, has Communist sympathies. I do not know the whole of that man's family but I know that his brother was a reporter on the Communist newspaper, Tribune, which he represented in the press gallery of this Parliament. That man was an acknowledged Communist, yet he is a member of the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He is a possible "" leak "". Perhaps he would not give away information intentionally, but he might do so in discussion in the family circle or by chance, perhaps by a loose word. On the other hand he might intentionally divulge secrets, and that information might flow through to the Soviet authorities. If we value our freedom, there must he no weak link in the chain of democratic countries with regard to defence secrets. I believe that there should be a thorough tightening-up throughout the democracies, so that the secrets of atomic energy, which they hold in trust for the world, cannot be discovered and exploited by some other power whose ideology embraces the objective of the crushing of democracy. The secret of atomic energy, while it remains a secret, is the best form of defence the democracies could have. I hope my remarks will open a discussion in this Parliament during which the Minister will take the opportunity to assure honourable members and the country that the most complete precautions have been taken against the possibility of any leakages of top secret information Mr Harrison. from his department or through men connected with nuclear energy research. Such an assurance is necessary, because, as ] have stated, information from Australian scientists at Hartwell and others who are in close touch with atomic development comes to Australia and might, if there were a leakage, be passed on from this country to Russia. Australia is not trusted by America with any information about atomic energy developments, and, being suspect, we should clear ourselves of that suspicion. The Minister now has an opportunity of either making a statement for the satisfaction of the committee and of the people of Australia on what precautions are being taken to prevent the disclosure of secrets, or of at least advising the committee and the country that he proposes to take the necessary action to give some sense of security to the people he represents.",23
52,Mr DEDMATT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Corio-Minister for .Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [3.39] - The Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) has raised a matter of some delicacy. He has, however, made a number of statements which I must deny most emphatically. From time to time. I have stated in this Parliament that the press of Australia and the Opposition parties generally, have done a great disservice to the country by the wild charges which they have made in relation to security matters. Recently an article appeared in » Sydney newspaper to the effect that the Government of the United States of America was withholding from Australia all information regarding atomic energy, and although there was no truth whatever in that allegation, the Acting Leader of the Opposition has just made a similar assertion. The truth is that under an act of Congress, the Government of the United States is not permitted to pass on to any country information about atomic energy.",24
53,Mr HARRISON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Does the Minister mean to say that the Government of the United Kingdom has no knowledge of what is going on in the United States? What rot and nonsense! I have it on authority that the Government of the United Kingdom is working in the closest collaboration with the Government of the United States of America.,24
54,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"A l t h o u g h the Acting Leader of the Opposition has just stated that he has it on authority that the Government of the United States is releasing such information to the Government of the United Kingdom, I repeat that the United States Government is prohibited, by act of Congress, from doing so. I have examined the relevant United States statute, which is described in the preamble as "" An act for the development and control of atomic energy "" , a copy of which I have in my possession. Section 10 of that act, which is headed Control of Information "" , providesUntil Congress declares by joint resolution that effective and enforceable international safeguards against the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes have been established, there shall be no exchange of information with other nations with respect to the use of atomic energy for industrial purposes.",25
55,Mr HARRISON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Who is talking about industrial purposes? I did not mention industrial purposes.,25
56,Mr LANG,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Where can the United States act be examined?,25

61,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I understood the honourable member for Henty (Mr . Gullett) to say by way of interjection a little while ago that the United States Government does not trust the Australian Government. As I have said, the trut h is that the United States Government is prevented by law from revealing information concerning atomic energy.",25
62,Mr HARRISON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Information for industrial purposes.,25
63,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Any information whatever concerning atomic energy.,25
64,Mr HARRISON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,The statute which the Minister quoted referred only to information to be used for industrial purposes.,25
65,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"If the Acting Leader of the Opposition knew anything about atomic energy, he would realise that any information concerning its use for industrial purposes could also be applied to military purposes. Although that should be obvious to any one who reflects on the matter, a Sydney newspaper did not hesitate to make sensational allegations in headlines 1 inch deep, and the Acting Leader of the Opposition has repeated those false aggregations in this chamber. n order to emphasize the true position 1 my repeat that the United States Congress has prohibited the release of information regarding atomic energy except by a joint resolution of both Houses of interjecting, Congress",25
66,Mr FADDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,It has only prohibited Although the the release of information to be used for,25
67,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,I have already pointed out that any one who knows of atomic energy must realise that information intended to be used for industrial purposes could also be used for war-like purposes. The uses of atomic in peace or in war are so interthat it would be foolish to permit release of information for only one,25
68,Mr HARRISON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,But - the release of information intended to be used for purposes would not be of any to us in time of war. The is discussing the use of atomic the Openergy for war purposes.,25
69,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The Acting Leader of the Opposition has been completely floored, and is now-trying'-to find a way out for 'himself. It is true that the Estimates for the 'Council for Scientific and Industrial Research 'include an item to - cover expenditure on a 'series of experiments in nuclear physics that are being carried - out at the University of Melbourne. Those experiments, which have been undertaken at the instigation of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, relate.to atomic research. The reason why such research is being conducted now is that in the event of - war occurring we shall have available the services of at least a few scientists who know something of atomic energy. I have been assured that no classified information regarding the progress of the research being made at the University of Melbourne is supplied to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. For many years past the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has "" farmed out"" research work to universities and other scientific institutions, such as the Waite Institute in South Australia, 'but apparently honourable members opposite are suggesting that that practice should cease immediately Mr .HARBISON --Of course .not.! What nonsense!",25
70,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The Acting Leader of the Opposition referred to a physicist in the University of Sydney, who is alleged to be a Communist. As far as I know that individual has .no connection with the Council for Scientific and .Industrial Research. Mr ABBOTT,-He was - engaged 'On the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research until recently, and the Minister knows it.",26

During the 'war the Council 'for 'Scientific and In : ; Estimates 1948-49. dustrial .Research engaged in research - work connected with the defence of 'the country which was of an extremely secret --nature. The staff of the council carried - out a great deal of highly secret research in the development :of - radio physics ;anc the evolution of radar devices, a matte; about which I can tell members of tincommittee an interesting story. When 1 became Minister in charge of the Counci 1 for Scientific and Industrial Research iij the latter part of 1941 I discovered that only one radar device was operating it Australia. That radar device was operating near Port Kembla. Instead of having radar devices all round the coast of Australia to detect enemy submarines or vessels approaching our coast, only one existed, and that was the one at Port Kembla. The second installation erected was established at South ""Head, Sydney, and was made of bits and pieces taken from the laboratories of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Had all of this - work of the most highly secret character been developed much earlier we should have been able more adequately to protect this country when Japan declared war upon us. When the installation was established at Port Kembla I inspected it and took some part in. its operation. Opposition members should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of initiative in developing these device? before the war. "" Mr ""HARRISON --The Minister was a member of the Defence Council and knows .better than that. He knows that what he says is most unfair.",26
72,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I am developing my argument in my own way. I am telling the Opposition and the country that when I took charge of the Council for .Scientific and Industrial Research in 1941 only one radar installation was in .operation in .Australia. l!Er. 'HARRISON - The ^Minister knowh - exactly rthe reason ""why.",26
73,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Of course I do, and I shall - state it. The reason was because the Opposition, when it formed the government of this country, so starved the 'Council for Scientific and Industrial Research of the necessary funds to carry on its work, and so neglected opportunities fox developing the secondary industries of this country,, that, thesedevices were aot: available to us. I mention this because I . want to make it clear that, during, the whole of the war period, the Council for. Scientific and Industrial Research was engaged in most highly secret work. There was never one single leakage then, and there hasnever, been one since. Mr HARRISON.:-Because - we were fighting as an ally, of Russia.. ""We had no. "" fellow travellers "" then.",26
74,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Thes e attacks madein the press on individuals',, including Sir David Rivett,. and. on the security arrangements of the. Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, have nothing to them. The Acting, Leader of the Opposition quoted' a statement made by Sir David Rivett and sought -,o make capital out of it. Sir David is not alone in expressing the view that in order to advance in the field of knowledge generally science must be completely free. That opinion is shared by i great many scientists, throughout the vorld. In fact, because of certain allegations made in the United States of America, 40 per cent, of the scientists engaged on a particular project there have resigned their positions. They say that they will not carry on under conditions which, 'leave them open to be continually sniped at merely because they uphold what they believe to be their right to he completely free to publish the results of the experiments they undertake. Mir. HARRISON - Does the Minister Rivett agree with that?",27
75,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I am sorry to have to say this, but I agree with Sir. Rivett that science will progress more speedily only if there is a complete exchangeof information. I say that delifield berately; but I also say that in certain effort. circumstances, such as those which prelocked wa-il today, it is absolutely necessary that some scientific experimentsand research work, should .be kept entirely secret. When Sir David Rivett made histhat statement! he was merely repeating what a great manyother scientists, have said the world over. In-, order, to ensure that the work of the Council for Scientific of a.nd Industrial. Research shall be of: kind in. respect of which there can be complete freedom, of exchange of information, Sir. David Rivett suggested that if defence scientific research projectswere undertaken in. Australia they shouldt be undertaken, not by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, but by a special defence scientific research, section, established in the Department, of Defence, or. some other appropriate, department. As I . said earlier,, the Council, for .Scientific, and' Industrial Research was engagedin very highly secret work during, the war. !- also said, not long ago,, that the council.was not now engaged in any work of a, secret character. That state, of affairsmay not continue. In. fact, the position, is - changing, at the. presenttime. If defence scientific work is, to be. undertaken in. Australia, and it. will be undertaken in the. not distant future, the Government will make the necessary changes, either by altering the structure of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research or by transferring, certain work from the: council to aspecial defence scientific research division of the Depart- 1 ment of. Supply and Development. What the Acting Leader of. the Opposition has. suggested has already claimed the attenr tion of the Government.. I propose to quote from a statement made by Mr., David. Lilienthal; chairman of the Atomic Energy Committee in the United States of America. Prior to occupying, that, important post, Mr Lilienthal was chairman of the Tennessee ""Valley Authority. I quote his - words to. show that Sir David. is not the only scientist, of authority who believes that there is some thing in the claim of scientists that there should be complete freedom of exchange David of information. Mr Lilienthal saidAmerica's leadership in this new and fateful of knowledge requires a stupendousThenotion that our. atomic energy, leadership depends upon a "" secret formula"". in a vault, is nothing less than a. giganticHoax upon the people of this-country. Our leadership, depends upon developing new knowledge, and the new applications of knowledge. Guards, and fences, and investigators . . . all these have a place; an important, place* But guards and fences, and investigators do. not develop new knowledge, about atomic energy,, nor new application knowledge, and our position intheworld and our progress in this-- field requires thatthewe know more and more, and that we know? it first . . . This takes people, a particular kind of people . . . We must have the very best qualified people in the United States . . . otherwise we face the imminent threat of stagnation. That statement shows not only that it is necessary to allow a certain amount freedom to scientific investigators are to make any progress in the field of scientific knowledge, hut also great deal of what amounts to pure "" bunkum"" has been talked about this question of locking up the secrets of atomic energy. In fact, what a great many people call "" secrets "" in relation atomic energy are widely known and be read in any text-book. All that is hidden from the outside world is the techdeliberate liar! nique of the application of knowledge which is already very widespread and is held by almost every country in world. The Acting Leader of the Oppothe sition quoted the statement of Sir David ment. Rivett, to which I have referred. He said that that statement was similar to statements made by Communist leaders. He almost went so far as to say that David Rivett was capable of doing what Guard. the Communists had done.",27
76,Mr HARRISON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Do not put words my mouth. The Minister should stick to the statement. facts.,28
77,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"When the Acting that Leader of the Opposition reads the Hansard report of his speech, he will that his words are open to the construcyour tion which I suggest might be placed upon them. He said that the statement of Sir David Rivett was similar to statements made by Communist leaders. officers What inference could be drawn from such a statement other than the one which I have suggested?",28
78,Mr HARRISON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,What nonsense!,28
79,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Every one who knows Sir David Rivett is certain that he is a man of the highest integrity. I Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has any defence secrets they are perfectly safe with Sir David Rivett.,28
80,Mr HARRISON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Yes , I agree with that.",28
81,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"the Acting Leader and, of the Opposition then said that I should not have appointed Mr Don Mountjoy to the Council for Scientific and IndusScientific trial Research. He was not convinced, said, that Mr Don Mountjoy had nothing to do with the Communists. Officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service have conducted an investigation, and are perfectly satisfied that Mr Don Mountjoy of has nothing whatever to do with the if they Communist party.",28

90,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The Acting Leadei f the of the Opposition does not accept my assurance. I am just as much entitled to refuse to accept his denial that he was ever a member of the New Guard. 1I have gone into this matter closely since I have been the Minister for Defence, indeed, even before that. It is true that certain persons, who are engaged in activities on behalf of the Council for and Industrial Research, are he reputed to be Communists. It is not - iitsy to prove whether a particular person is, or is not, a Communist because it is not easy to get evidence. It must be remembered that about 5,000 persons are employed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and it would aot be surprising if among that number there should be one or two reputed Communists. I have seen in the office of the Commonwealth Investigation Service the tiles dealing with these persons, and I assure honourable members that none of them is connected with any matter relating to defence, or defence scientific - esearch.",28
91,Mr LANG,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Does that apply to Mr. Pomeroy?,29
92,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Yes , it applies to him. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) has referred to a man who was appointed about twelve months ago as a photographer in the plant investigation section of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. What kind of defence secret could come into the possession of a photographer in the plant investigation section? The method of appointment of officers and members of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is exactly the same now as it was when it was first fixed by the non-Labour government that was in office in 1926. It has never been altered. As a matter of fact, one of the persons who, according to the files, is reputed to be a Communist was appointed to the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research during the time that the Communist party was banned by a non-Labour government.",29

95,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I did not say that he was a Communist. I used the phrase, "" reputed to be a Communist"".",29
96,Mr FADDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Then why make a point of it?,29
97,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The point is that the Menzies Government banned the Communist party; and yet, while that party was banned, it was possible for person, who was reputed to be a Comstaff munist, to be appointed to the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. As I have said, the method of appointing employees of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has not varied since the council was first established. The executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research makes a recommendation to the Minister, who, of course, has to deal with a great number of appointments every week - The staff of the council is constantly changing. Persons move from the universities to the council for longer or shorter periods in order to conduct certain specific investigations. When their work is finished, they may go back to the universities again. Thus, the council is not like the Public Service in which persons usually remain all their working lives. Moreover, the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is growing. I said earlier that non-Labour governments had starved the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, but since I took charge of the Council its expenditure on scientific research has been multiplied fivefold. It is true that a comparatively large number of appointments are continually being made to the staff of the council. Changes of personnel are taking place all the time. Some of the council's staff go to the universities, whilst some from the universities are taken on to the staff of the council. I am not satisfied with the method of appointment of staff to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which has been in operation since 1926, whereby the executive makes a recommendation for approval or otherwise by the Minister. I did not introduce the method.",29
98,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Did the executive recomhe mend the appointment of Mountjoy?,29
99,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"That is another matter. The appointment of the Executive Committee of the council is entirely a matter for the Minister in charge. I did not require a recommendation for Mountjoy's appointment; I appointed him. In view of the circumstances, I did not require any recommendation to be made to me. I made that perfectly clear to honourable members in the House a long time ago. a When dealing with appointments to theof the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, ""1 approve of - the - recommendations put-tome by the Execuable tive Committee of the council. H r . HAMILTON - Does that applv to Radcliffe? Mr Dedman. - 1 approved of the appointment, in the same manner as party to which the Leader of the advice. Australian Coutry party (. Mr Faddem) belongs, when it was in office, approved of the appointment to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research .of an individual who .is, at accepting. least, .reputed to be a Communist.",29
100,Mr FADDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The Minister said he - is, .and yet that person is kept 'there. Thornton.",30
101,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Who is he'?,30
102,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Frankly , I have not his name in my mind at the moment, f can find it out whenever I wish to. I .am not satisfied that the probourne cedure for .the appointment of officers .to the Council .for .Scientific and [ndustrial .Research is the best that we can adopt. .I am examining that matter closely, and I hope that - all. when .any amendments that I wish to make are submitted to the House have the support of honourable members opposite. There are - some very difficult matters of procedure to be .settled, and am not, at present, going to suggest way in which .1 would like that done. - Let us consider what might be the tion where, .in relation to a particular .vacancy, :two persons apply. One of them, let u3 say, is described :as :a '""ifellow traveller"",, that is, not :a memwith ber :of the .Communist party, but a person »who has, by a public information statement, made lit clear that he has views somewhat resembling those the Communists. Supposing that indifundamental vidual is an applicant i o r a job in scientific research which ""has no connection with defence at all, but is perhaps in the division dealing with plant investigation The other applicant let us say, is tions a person whose qualifications very poor. Who should be appointed? Should the individual with the high cil qualifications be eliminated merely because of his political views? That is a difficult matter to settle and [ am not going to deal with it .too deeply'at-the moment ""because, as T have said, in 'the not far distant future, honormembers opposite will have an opportunity of perhaps giving me .some advio as to how a situation of that kind should :be dealt with. Mr .HARRISON -: I am prepared to .bet the that the Minister will not accept our Mr Dedman;-^Generally speaking I do not take - advice from the Acting - Leader of 'the 'Opposition, because never 'gives me any .advice worth",30

105,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"If 'that is so, the honourable gentleman can be quite well assured that the United Kingdom is perfactly capable of making .all the security arrangements required in that country.",31

108,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,But what arrangement are being made for security here? Was Sir Percy Sillitoe perfectly satisfied with the arrangements?,31
109,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The honourable memDer appears to be very dense in this matter. I 'have been telling the House that the Council for Scientific and In dustrial Research undertook this work during the war, and during the entire period of war there w.as not one single, leakage. Mr 'ABBOTT - How does the Minister enow that'? The traitor Rudkin was taken back on .the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research after hie betrayal of secrets during .the war. Mr DEiBMAN - I --remind honourable members that we 'are dealing Tvi'th the - jstimates for the Council for Scientific 'and Industrial - Research present, - not with the estimates for the Defence Department. During the war the .council undertook 'work of a highly secret character.

Tn the postwar period, the Council for Scientific l [30 SEPTEMBER, £948.j| Estimates 1948-49. .1037 'arguand .Industrial Research .has gradually vacated the field of matters regarding - which security precautions had to be taken, and at present none of the council's work is of a secret nature. 1I have .already - said that .that position is about to be altered, that some .defence scientific research will be undertaken in Australia, and that unless some other (provision is made, such research may have to be undertaken within the laboratories of the council. I have .said .that, .pre sently, when that situation arises the necessary arrangements will be made and defence scientific work of that kind may be undertaken within the Department of Supply and Development, in which a special defence scientific division will be set up.",31

The honourable gentleman can just wait and see. His - question will be answered in due course. I have .made it clear that all the attacks in the press and all the allegations of the Acting Leader of the Opposition in ""relation to the cutting off of information about atomic energy from the United States of America amount to a mare's ""nest.

Mr FADDEN (Darling Downs-Leade r of the Australian Country .party) [4.2.2]. - It is nothing new, of course, for members of ith-is Parliament to be .the re cipients of half truths and lying .statements from the Minister for Defence (Mr Deflman). who has spoken in this debate as the Minister in charge of the Council for 'Scientific and 'Industrial - Rpeparcli.",31
111,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I rise to order, Mr. Temporary Chairman. I ask the right honourable member to withdraw that statement.",32
112,Mr FADDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I withdraw the words "" lying statements"" and substitute for them "" the usual Dedman statements The Minister at the conclusion of his speech said that the press of Australia was untruthful and misleading and did Australia a disservice in publishing reports to the effect that, because of uncertainty concerning adequate security measures against communism in this country, certain information had been withheld by the United States of America from the United Kingdom Government as well as from the Australian Government. I shall quote a confidential statement. I challenge the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), and the Minister for Defence, to deny that the Prime Minister told the British Cabinet, on the 8th July, at a meeting held at No. 10 Downing-street, at 10.30 a.m that he understood the United States authorities were reluctant to communicate to Australia certain specially secret information about the progress of research and development on atomic energy. This reluctance might be due, in part, to their belief that the Australian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was not fully under control of the Australian Government. And it was true, that in a public speech delivered some months previously, the head of that council had stated his view that his organization should not concern itself with secret work. Mr Chifley was most anxious to remove any impedimenta to the free exchange of secret information about atomic energy development between the Governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia; and he was prepared to make any reasonable adjustments which might be necessary for this purpose in the constitution of the scientific organizations serving the Australian Government in this matter. If necessary he would he prepared to arrange that the scientists engaged on this work should form part of a regular government department and undertake the corresponding obligations in respect of official secrets. He would be glad of an opportunity to discuss this matter with the appropriate United Kingdom Minister. Will the Minister himself deny the truth of that statement?",32
113,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I rise to order, Mr. Temporary Chairman. I ask that the right honourable gentleman table the document he has just read.",32
114,Mr FADDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Havin g regard to the Standing Orders, I took the precaution before I read from the document to say that it was a document confidential to me personally. I give the Minister the opportunity to deny the truth of it* contents. I also give him the opportunity to deny the truth of another confidential communication which is that he told the executive committee of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research on the 6th July of last year that the Prime Minister had told him that infoi mation from high sources in the United Kingdom had been received which made it quite clear that a number of United Kingdom Government departments were not certain that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research could be entrusted with certain documents, and that feeling militated, in turn, against the United Kingdom as regards obtaining infoT mation from the United States of America.",32
115,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,The right honourable gentleman got that information from Smith's Weekly.,32
116,Mr FADDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I challenge the Minister to deny it . The Minister told that meetingthat American authorities hud made n quite clear that they would not pads on to the United Kingdom any information unless it was certain that such information would nol be passed on to Australia. The Prime Minister could give him no details, but was, never the less, certain, in view of the source of hit information, that the feeling in the United Kingdom definitely existed, that was the important consideration. Unless something was done to retrieve the position, Australia would not get certain information of a scien tine nature that affected defence matters. Present at that meeting were the 'Minister himself, Sir David Rivett, Dr F. W. G. White, Dr Clunies Ross, Mr. Mountjoy and Mr G. A. Cook. I challenge the Minister to deny the truth of that communication. The Minister said with great pride that there was only one radar station in Australia when he took charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in 1941. It would have been jusl as logical to say that there was no atom bomb then, because in 1941 radar was in its experimental stages, although all the ground-work had already been done by the Minister's predecessors.",32
117,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,There were radar stations all around the United Kingdom in 1941.,32
118,Mr FADDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"But not here. The audacity of the Minister in making such claims is almost inconceivable, particularly in the light of the following statement, which he made to the Parliament and the people on the 4th July, 1941:Certain constituents of mine, members of the Militi a Force, have received notice that they w i ll be requirerl for continuous military duty for the duration of the war. I have not made any bones' about where I stand in regard to conscription. I am opposed to conscription for home service as well as for service overseas. I am opposed to it on religious grounds, because I do not believe that any man or any government ought to force any individual co take up the art of killing his fellow-men. Evidently the emoluments of office were able to stifle, his religions convictions in that regard: This is the man who today is in charge of the defence of Australia! This is the man upon whom we have to depend for proper secrecy and the adequate control of communism ! This is the man who told a lie to the Parliament and the country regarding the conferences that had been held and the invidious position of Australia in relation to the United Kingdom and the United States of America on the subject of defence.",33
119,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,I rise to order. The right honourable member has said that I told a lie to the Parliament. I ask for a withdrawal of that statement.,33
120,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N, The right honourable member must withdraw the statement.,33
121,Mr FADDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"For the word "" lie "" I substitute, "" the usual Dedmanism to which the Minister subjects this Parliament and the country"". The Minister can apply his own definition to that. In conclusion, I again challenge him to deny the accuracy of the reports that I have quoted and to state conscientiously and truthfully the exact relationship between the Australian Government and the Governments of the United States of America and the United Kingdom regarding what they, at least, consider to be the Communist menace to the security of this country.",33
122,Mr RYAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Flinders)"" [4.32] - I do not know what reply the Minister for Defence (Mr Dedman) will make to the charges of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden), but I know that his reply to the charges of the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) was evasive and most unconvincing. The charges made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition have been admitted by the Minister and are well known by every other member of this committee to be true. Briefly, the Acting Leader of the Opposition said that numbers of men who are either member? of the Communist party or closely associated with it are employed by the Council for .Scientific and Industrial Research and other government instrumentalities, and that, because of this fact, the Government of the United States of America has refused to supply to Australia secret, information about atomic energy.",33
123,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Was not the honourable member present when I quoted the United States act which deals with this matter?,33
124,Mr RYAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I shall deal with thai. I. ask the Minister to be patient. In reply to the charge that there are Communists in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Minister said that, after all, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research does not deal with secrets today. Yet he said that it dealt with very important secret information in the past and will have other secrets to deal with in the future.",33
125,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,No . I did not say that.,33
126,Mr RYAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The Minister definitely did say that. Everybody in this chamber heard him. It is useless for him to be evasive on this matter any more. His talk of secrets in the past and secrets in the future reminds me of the passage in Through the Looking Glass- "" Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday-bu t never jam today "". The facts have been proven. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research today, as in the past, is dealing with important secrets. In order to explain why the Government of the United States has not passed any secret information to the Australian ^Government, the Minister quoted an act of the United States Congress. What does that act state? It provides, almost in these words, that "" under this act no information concerning the use of atomic energy for industrial purposes is to pass to any other country "". Having quoted that provision, the Minister-and this is the cream of his whole argument-asserte d that the use of atomic energy for industrial purposes is the same as the use of atomic energy for military purposes. The Minister has been in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for three or four years",33
127,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,For seven years;,34
128,Mr RYAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"That makes the story all the worse. He has also been in charge of the Department of Defence for some time. Yet, with all that knowledge at his disposal, he does not seem to know the difference between the use of atomic energy for industrial purposes and its use for military purposes.",34
129,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,I gave a lecture on the subject recently.,34
130,Mr RYAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"It must have been an Bxtremely bad lecture. Atomic energy was first developed for military use. The secret was discovered and a technique was ivorked out so that atomic weapons have uow passed the experimental stage and are actually in existence. The first atom bomb has been improved to such a degree that the latest bombs are far more destructive. However, the development of atomic energy for industrial purposes is still in its infancy. The whole technique is entirely different from that required for military purposes, as the Minister knows well. The latter is merely a process that produces a reaction from uranium leading to a terrific and prolonged explosion. The use of atomic energy for industrial purposes requires conservation of power and its gradual release without' bad effeets to men or equipment.",34
131,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,I know only too well that the honourable member appears to know nothing about this subject.,34
132,Mr RYAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I have studied this subject with considerable care and I know much more about it than the Minister does. ""When he declares that the' Government of the United States will not pass on. the secret of the atom, bomb because of the act which he quoted, he says something which he knows, to be untrue. I know that the report read by the Leader, of the Australian Country party is very close to the truth. At present,, representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States of America are in close. consultation, not regarding the use of atomic energy for industrial purposes, but for the purpose of developing atomic power still further for military use. 1 repeat that the Minister has endeavoured to mislead the Parliament and the country. He must realise that, if Australia is to co-operate with the United States of America and the United Kingdom in the development of this new branch of military science, we must clear out theAugean stables of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and other departments where Communists ar* harboured.",34
133,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"New England) [4.38] - During this discussion we have heard a characteristic speech by the Minister for Defence (Mr Dedman), defending Communists, and even speaking very highly of them. He protectsthem in the high places to which he has appointed them and generally declares that the Communists are innocuousanimals that should really be looked after instead of treated as F if th Columnists who are ready to smash this democracy just af they have smashed other democracies'. The Leader of. the Australian! Country party (Mr Fadden), whose speech was ably supported by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan), described what happened at a meeting at No. 10 Downing-street, gave the exact hour of the meeting,, and quoted what was said bj Mr Attlee to the Prime Minister of Australia. Mr Attlee stated clearly that the governments of. the United Kingdom and, the United States of America werenotsatisfied with Australian security measures and doubted the trustworthiness of certain officers employed in theCouncil, for Scientific and Industrial Research:., and were therefore afraid to trust Australia with atomic secretsbecause of the danger of leakages. The Leader of thr Australian Country party has quoted' almost the exact words which wereused at a. meeting, of. the executive of the-Council for Scientific and Industrial. Research' on the 6th July last. The Minister for Defence, who was present, stated thai the American' and British government* were not willing to share secret research work on the development of the atom bomb and nuclear energy for militarj use with the' Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, because they believed that the knowledgewould not be kept' secret by certain officers of that institution. The statement by the Minister at the meeting of"" the* executive givesshould the lie direct to the statement which he has made in this chamber this afternoonand which, through the press and theradio, will be conveyed to the people. The Minister cannot have it both ways-. [ have no reason to doubt that he was telling the truth at the meeting of the executive of the Council for Scientificand Industrial Research because-he had no political objective to gain. There were few votes to be won at thatmeeting. The Minister had no reason to mislead the other persons at that meeting, but' be has every reason to mislead the people of Australia, and make them believe-that the British and American governments are satisfied that all possible precautionsare taken in Australia to ensure the preservation of secrecy.",34

He was present,, and, if the statement by the Leader of the Australian Country party was correct, the Minister made the remarks that have been attributed to him. I have always found the Leader of the Australian Country party to be honest, and truthful, but I . regret that I am, not able to say that of the Minister.",35
136,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Was the Leader, of the AustralianCountry party at that meeting?.",35
137,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The - Leader of the Australian Country party mentioned the names of the persons who were present a.t. that meeting, and, in addition, he *aid that the Minister addressed it. Although the Minister speakswith divers tonsrues, he can recollect the tongue with which he spoke at that meeting. Will the Minister, deny that he attended that meeting?",35
138,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,I am not in the witnes.' box..,35
139,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Of course the Minister is not in the witness box. But 1 like to obtain a Bible, and,, let the Minister, asan Elder of the Presbyterian Church, affirm, on oath whether he was present at that meetingor not. The Minister viciously attacked the Actins Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison), whohad referred to some statements which. SirDavid Rivett isalleged tt have made. I do not propose to com-meni on any of those alleged utterances-, bur I . shall read a passage from a booklet entitled,. Science and Responsibility. It isan address delivered at the eighteenth annual commencement ceremony of the Canberra University College,, on the 25 th Marchj 1947, by Sir David Rivett. KCMG., M.A.,. D.Sc, E.R.S.. Thw booklet was sent to me by Sir,- David Rivett after I : had asked, certain questions-in this chamber about; his-remarks, as reported in the Canberra. Times at that time. The great dangerof theattitude which Sir David Rivett. adopfo is that,, in teaching young scientist* during the present ueriod of a. cold wa; that there is no reason to preserve secrecy about any scientific matter in peacetime, he will turn many of them, tainted perhaps by communism, into people who would be",35
140,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Traitors .,35
141,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I should not use th. word "" traitors""'. The phrase that 1I have in mind is ""potential Dr NunnMays "". Honourable members will recal 1 that Dr. Nunn-May betrayed' atomi' secrets in Canada, during World War II . . and' was sentenced to ten years'' penal servitude. Sir David Rivett said in his addressI must pass to a brief consideration of tht cloud that has been present in minor degret for a. long time, but has grown starkly in recent times; the threat, now much more than a mere threat,, to that freetradein scientific knowledge of all kinds, which has been tht glory of these last three hundred years that have seen the most rapid advance in human knowledge of nature since man. began hi - course . . . I want rather to bringrto youi notice the inevitable sequel to this horror. That wa.s the atom bombnamely; the inescapable introduction of secrecj hi'b'-een nil potential rivalsand even between friends, about all pursuit of knowledge of an> kind that might conceivably he applied to the purposes of war. In war, once we are in the mesh, nothing nowadays is barred: Secrecy then becomes essential, using that word in its full sense. Eow can any one draw, the line between the kind of uneasy peace which exists in the world today, and open war? In the stop press of today's issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, there is published a cable which states that during the last three days, Bulgarian troops have been firing shells.across the border into Greece. In this present period of a cold war, can we afford to make our scientific secrets available to the country which is willing to receive all knowledge, but which does oot offer to reciprocate with its discoveries? The Balkan countries are in a state of fever. Eor centuries the Balkans have been the cockpit of Europe. Almost from time immemorial they have been the cauldron where wars have boiled up. Bulgarian troops are firing shells into Greece, yet the Minister for Defence[ say advisedly, "" God Help TJs ""-ha s told us that the Council for Scientific and [ndustrial Research must have the right to dispose of its scientific knowledge to other countries.",35
142,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,I did not say any such thing.,36
143,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The Minister never does say any such thing when he is bowled out. He would like to no-ball every bowler after the bails have been knocked from his wicket. That is the kind of sportsman he is. To-day, we cannot differentiate between the cold war and actual war, which we hope will not occur, but which looks so near and terrifying to millions of people. Sir David Rivett also said in his addressAll secret research in days of peace should be done in government laboratories, arsenals and proving grounds. [n the event of war, all our young scientists who for years have been absorbing the doctrine that there shall be no scientific secrets in peace-time, will be suddenly transferred to laboratories, arsenals and proving grounds, which have yet to be built, because the Minister has stated that atomic research cannot be undertaken in the laboratories of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He makes statements of that kind because he wants to protect certain shibboleths and faiths, to the detriment of the interests of Australia. He has also stated that those laboratories, arsenals and proving grounds will be constructed in war-time. All honourable members know that once a war breabout the greatest strain is imposed on all our resources. But, presumably, provision will be made for the building of laboratories, arsenals and proving grounds, in which the scientists will carry out their experiments. Both the Minister and Sir David Rivett are living in a world of unreality. They have a hazy kind of faith in the honesty of a man in whose honesty we cannot trust. Since the conclusion of ""World War II . we have learnt from bitter experience how badly the late President Roosevelt was advised by the late President Benes. He had assured President Roosevelt that he could trust the word of Stalin, even if he could not trust the word of any other Russian. We see what is happening in the world today. There is a cold war in progress. Last week I visited the migrant camp at Bathurst, where I met a sad-faced young woman. I was told by others that her mother had been raped seventeen times by Russian soldiers and then murdered before the eyes of this woman. Those are the people who, we are told, love all the world and are attempting to impose their beneficent democracy upon the peoples of the earth. These are the people that the Minister has defended. I claim that the address that was given by Sir David Rivett was a most dangerous one. In a period almost of war he preached, wickedly and wrongly, the most dangerous doctrines to. our young scientists. Nevertheless, the Minister has defended it. The people of Australia are disturbed at the inadequacy of the security arrangements on the guided weapons range. Many of the experiments that are being conducted there must be",36
144,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N, Order ! The honourable member may not refer to the guided weapons range at this stage.,36

148,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I rise to order. The honourable member's statement is incorrect. Therefore, I submit that his remarks have no relevance to the division of the Estimates that is now being discussed",37

151,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"In the estimates for the Prime Minister's Department, under the heading "" Council for Scientific and [ndustrial Research "", appear the words ""nuclear energy"". That phrase, I assume, refers to the splitting of the atom and the use of that process to cause an explosion in a bomb known as the atomic bomb. The atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were prototypes of the atomic bombs that are now being developed. Sir David Rivett said in his address that the secrets of atomic bomb are only a set of engineering procedures-h e dismissed it lightly in way-whic h other nations are certain to develop in a few years. That statement would encourage young scientists to believe that it was not necessary to be secretive about the processes at all. Some months ago the United Kingdom Government sent to this country Sir Percy Sillitoe, the head of MI5, which is, I understand, the security department of the United Kingdom Government. I do not know whether he came here at the request of the Australian Government. I am informed that his report upon security arrangements in Australia was of such a devastating nature that he would not disclose it to the Australian Government, but took it back to the Prime Minister of Greai Britain.",37
152,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Who told the honourable member this fairy story?,37
153,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"My information comes from a high authority, who knows the Minister and with whom the Minister is acquainted only too well. I may disclose his name on some future occasion. I understand that the Prime Minister of Great Britain was so horrified at the contents of the report that he treated it as a key matter in his discussions with the Prime Minister of Australia when the right honourable gentleman visited Britain - I understand, further, that the Prime Minister of Australia himself was shocked when he saw the report of what this British expert on espionage had discovered in this country. Would anybody expect discoveries of any other kind to be made? Many honourable members have studied the report of the royal commission which inquired into the activities of Russian spies in Canada, and many of us have read Victor Kravenchko's book. I Chose Freedom, and studied other accounts of Soviet espionage and fifth column work throughout the world. There is every reason to suppose that the Russians are doing the same in Australia as they are doing and have done in other countries. The Minister for Defence is now leaving the chamber, driven out by the cogency of my arguments, to warn the Prime Minister not to tell a different story. The security of Austhe tralia is supported by very thin threads. What has happened in other places in that the world must undoubtedly be occurring here today. For those reasons, and because of what was said by the Leader of the Australian Country party and the attitude adopted by Sir David Rivett in the address, "" Science and Responsibility "", which was delivered at the University College in the City of Canberra, the greatest need exists for the Government to realise its responsibility and to take the strongest possible action to drive fifth columnists and Communists from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the defence departments and arsenals of Australia. Mr Norman Sheppard, the chief metallurgical engineer in the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, is ""the secretary <of the Lithgow Communist party. Lithgow is a town in the electorate of Macquarie, which - is represented by the Prime Minister. Australia needs patriots at its head, and not flirters vith communism - the out.",37
154,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Barker) ;4.57] - During the fourteen years that [ have been a member of this Parliament, [ have witnessed .some tense scenes in this -.hamber, but I bave never seen one which - quailed that which occurred this after-Loon. The Minister 'for Defence -"" Mr Dedman) is the Minister who s charged with the responsibility for mswering to the Parliament for the leeds .and misdeeds of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He -.nade certain categorical statements '-egarding the .security of certain information and said that the Commonwealth vas not in any way suspect by the Governments of the United Kingdom and - he United States of America. The Minister was followed by the Leader of r,he Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden),-who quoted from two documents 'hat he declared were confidential documents. Having regard to the spirit in vhich the Ministry has so frequently icted, I say that the right - honourable gentleman was perfectly right in not disposing 'the source of his information. One of those documents, which I 'have now seen, concerned a statement which The Minister for Defence is alleged to '-rave made to the executive of the Coun:il for Scientific and Industrial Research at Wentworth House, Mel;->ourne, on the '6th July of this year. The Minister made no attempt to deny or [ualify the statement that was - made by the Leader of the Australian Country party. The honourable gentleman has now left the chamber. He has folded up his papers, as the Arabs fold their tents, wd vanished ^completely. He sat here throughout the castigation that was given him by the Leader of the Australian Oountry party and did not deny or - rualify any statement that - the right honourable - gentleman made. I am - reminded - of the New Testament story about - a married 'couple - who - went to see me of ""She Apostles. They did a little previaTica'ting and denial. The husband, : >pine - found out in his lie. died - and was l carried out and buried. The wife, noi knowing - what had - occurred, 'later told the 'same lie, - and the Apostle said to herBehold, the feet rff them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall 'earn It is not well that - we should have in that Parliament .a state ©f affairs where tht-Opposition challenges the veracity of Ministers - of State, .although it may b» quite proper to challenge their judgment The state of affairs should be such thai there should be no challenge whatever a* to the veracity of a Minister of Statwho has given information to the com m'i'ttee. 'That did not exist this afternoon. 'There are one or two matters t< which I shall refer. I regret that - thiMinister $ or ©efence has not yet returned to the ^chamber. He has just put his head in the door for ;a few moments - anfi vanished again. To me, his face, - after the Leader of the Australian ""Countr* party had dealt with him, looked like » human Hiroshima after the atomic born! had f allen. The Minister has said thai the United Kingdom could safeguard itown atomic secrets. According to pres* reports--the Government has gravt doubts about press information, but the Minister may have something to sa.i about this-the United Kingdom Government has just fitted two aircraft - carrier and, 1 think, a - cruiser for tests w it ! atomic weapons. An endeavour is being made, of 'course, to make those vessel* proof against gamma rays and mother radio-active radiations from 'nuclear fission. The - ships are to 'carry - animal* during the tests. All this would indicatt that the United Kingdom is now in - a position to produce 'atomic weapons ox its - own account, .and I - should like tcknow from - the Minister whether >or - noi that press report is correct. M it i* correct, I should like to (know to whai extent the Australian Government dawa^e of the progress - made in the pro duction of atomic weapons' m the United Kingdom. In Australia today, are man? officers - and men 'of the United Kingdom forces. 'Some of them are in ""uniform and others in - civilian - clothes. ""Y'ou hav* ruled, Mr Temporary Chairman, 'thai in 'discussing this item - reference cannof be made to the W'oomera guided .weapon* testing range: bn't T invite yon fto ihavia 'look at 'the list - of items now 'before the committee. We are discussing radio research. Has that no relation to the .guided weapons Tange ? I invite the Minister to deny that there is such an association. We are discussing aeronautical research. 'There, again, I suggest there is a relationship to the Woomera range We are discussing tr'ibo-physics. I 'admit, quite frankly, that I do not know what that is, but I ""am certain that it - dees not have any relation to the Arunta. We are discussing radio physics and .physical metallurgy. Surely without - a proper 'investigation of physical metallurgy there will T>e 'hold-ups 'at the Woomera range. That is one item, therefore, that is intimately and inescapably connected with the development of the range. The next item is nuclear energy. Will the Minister deny that an investigation of this subject also is vital to the mccessful development of the Woomera range? Then comes meteorological physics. That term might cover - a multitude of things. Fuel research, too, must be intimately connected - with guided - veapons, because their propulsion depends upon fuel - of various kinds. Then we icome to item 25 on the list, vhich is "" Unforeseen .and Urgent .Investigations "". That could cover :anything from Genesis .to ""Revelation .and from Dan to Beersheeba. Therefore, it cannot be .argued that in discussing this posed vote we are not entitled to refer to - he development of the Woomera guided veapons testing range. Is the Minister prepared to say that there will not be <ome interest on the part .of the Aus'iralian Government .in the 'development of gas turbines? No doubt these, too, vill be tested in the interior, unless the Government is utterly .negligent .of its lutiesin this direction. This <deba'te hinges ton two .things': The first is the degree to which the Council for .Scientific and Industrial Research is to be trusted by the Governments of the United Kingdom - and the United States of America with military secrets. The second is the degr.ee to which the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir David Rivett, speaks with the consent and approval of 'the Australian 'Government. Ead T 'been a member of the Government - when certain statements were made last year, I should have thought that the proper thing to do with Sir David Rivett would be to relieve him of his duties. He should ""be reminded of the old adage. "" He who pays the piper calls the tune "" II Sir David is not prepared to engage - in defence research on behalf of the Australian .Government which pays him with the Australian taxpayers' money, the sooner he leaves the government 'servic* the ""better. There is no place for hin. - in a properly - conducted government. He should - either obey the will, and conform to the policy of the government which pays him, or get out and continue hit research at ""his own expense. 'Having done that, he could do what he liked with his findings, - within, - of course, the limitations imposed by any common-sense j government. The Minister is an old regular soldier and he knows perfectly well that in the United Kingdom, which gave 'him birth, there is the severest limitation on the right - of citizens to 'convex military information out of the country Certain organizations about which verj little is known or said, but much can be imagined, are charged with the duty 6i ensuring the country's safety, and I have no doubt that they are not unaware of some of the things that are going or in the Commonwealth today. Now thai the Minister has returned to the chamber pro- I say to him that things have come to a sorry pass when we have the head of a great instrumentality like the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research virtually saying, ""Although .1 ,get my money from the Government, and my job depends upon the Australian taxpayer, ] do not regard him in the slightest degree Who is the Australian taxpayer? Who is the Australian Government? I shall pursue my research and make the results known to the four winds, regardless of the effect on the Australian people, and regardless of whether the transmission of this information to some other country may result in - the death of '.thousands <of Australian people "". That is .as near to treachery as one can get, and we must face that situation. I repeat 'that in my fourteen years' exthe perience in this chairfber I have never witnessed a scene such as that - which occurred 'fhis afternoon when the veracity ->f a Minister was questioned by the Leader of an Opposition party. Minister has not denied the charges that nave been made by the Leader of the Vustralian Country party. I hope that - vhen I resume my seat we shall hear from the Minister in unequivocal language whether he did or did not, at Wentworth House on the 6th July, make to the executive of the Couscil for Scientific and Industrial Research the statement attributed to him by the Leader of the Australian Country party. Finally, r.be state of the Council for Scientific «id Industrial Research today is such that it will not be long before private members of this chamber exercise their right to seek the appointment of a select -.ommittee to investigate the composition and the activities of that instrumentality. That is something that is urgently neces-iary. In the interests of Australia it is wise and just that we should know how the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is at present functioning. I shall not repeat certain names which have been mentioned during this debate. I have my views regarding those individuals which I have expressed on other occasions in this Parliament. As I have also stated on previous occasions, I have the highest admiration for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, [ts work in the field of agricultural research has been without equal anywhere in the world. The Parliament, however, is not now concerned with agricultural research. As the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) has stated, we are living in a state of "" cold war"". That "" cold war"" may become hot at any time. Because of world conditions at the present time it is necessary that we should treat defence matters, or those which might impinge on the realm of defence, in an entirely different manner from that in which we treated them during the period between the two world wars.",38
155,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Corio-Minister for Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [5.12] - At an early stage in tests they made. this debate I attempted to draw a distinction between work of a defence nature and other types of work which are performed by the Council for ScienThe tific and Industrial Research. The Opposition has continually brought into thisdebate the question of defence scientificwork. I have already made it quiteclear that if, at some time in the futureand that time is likely to be in the near future-wor k of a defence scientific research character has to be undertaken in this country, special arrangements will be made with regard to it. Honourable members of the Opposition have made certain statements and I shall refer particularly to those made by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). The honourable member for Barker said that he had read in the press a statement published a few days ago to the effect that the United Kingdom Government had fitted two aircraft carriers with & device which would prevent radio activity, following upon an atomic explosion, from having any effect upon persons aboard the vessels. He asked me a specific question whether that was a fact and whether would I say",40
156,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,I did not ask that at all. I asked the Minister whether certain tests were taking place.,40
157,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"The question in thai form will serve my present purpose. The honourable member asked whether I would inform the House whether such tests were taking place. I say to the House, and to the country, that that question gives the measure of the responsibility or irresponsibility of the honourable member for Barker and other honourable members opposite. If I did know that the United Kingdom Government had had tests of that kind made and that everything that might be alleged in the press about this matter were true, would it be correcl for me, as the Minister for Defence of this country, to say so to this House and thereby make it known throughout the world at large that those tests were in fact taking place?",40
158,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,The Americans told the world about the atomic,40
159,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"If I did anything of that nature I should be recreant to the trust reposed in me. I do not intend to tell the country, the honourable member for Barker, or anybody who might learn it through the medium of newspapers which circulate perhaps as far away as Russia, what tests are being undertaken - dither in this country or in the United Kingdom, about which I may have some 'knowledge. The same remarks apply to the statements made by the Leader of the Australian Country party, who quoted from what appeared to be a semi-official document relating to discussions which had taken place at No. 10 Downing-street, London, between the Prime Ministers of Australia and Great Britain . I do not know whether what he quoted was a true account of what took place at No. 10 Downing-street, but if I did know, ,the last thing I should do would be to divulge in this House that the account was either correct or incorrect. In connection with any statement which I am alleged to have made at a meeting of the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, I say that what takes place at such meetings is supposed to be regarded confidentially.",40
160,Mr FADDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Does the Minister deny making the statement?,41
161,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,I understand that the right honourable gentleman said that four members of the executive of the council were present at that meeting and that he alleges that I made certain statements about security matters generally i relation to the Council for Scientific Industrial Research.,41
162,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Did the Minister make the statement that he is alleged to have made?,41
163,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"What takes place at meetings of the executive Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is supposed to be entirely confidential. I am not going to take part in any debate about what happened at listened any meeting of the executive which attended, the proceedings of which are of this department. assumed to be confidential. In relato-day, tion to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the measures being taken to safeguard security in country. I have already made it perthing fectly clear that the.Council for Scienthat tific and Industrial Research is not the present time in possession of military secrets at all. That institution has nothing whatever to do with the guided weapons range project. Honourable members of the Opposition are hammering away at this question, although they know perfectly well thai everything they are saying about security in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and scientific defence research is entirely untrue.",41
164,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Did the Minister make the alleged statement or not?,41
165,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I stated earlier that 1 was not satisfied that the method of appointment to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was entireh satisfactory, and I also stated that 1 had made no alteration of that method, which has been unchanged since the council was established. I do not mean by that that the situation should not be reviewed from time to time; in fact, it is being reviewed at the present time. I claim, very strongly, that no individual in Australia, the United States of America, or the United Kingdom, and no member of the Opposition in this Parliament can point to a single leakage that has occurred from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. 1 challenge any member , opposite to point to any leakage whatsoever. I repeat that the statementsmade here today give the measure of the responn sibility, or irresponsibility, of honourable and members of the Opposition. I again challenge them to mention any leakage that has occurred either during the war period or since.",41
166,Mr FADDEN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,The Minister's statement to the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research of the was a definite leakage.,41
167,Mr GULLETT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"He n t y ) [5.20] - In the last few minutes the Parliament has to the most p it if u l series of evaI sions from the Minister in charge It was obvious as it has been on other recent occasions, that the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial this Research (Mr Dedman) w i ll say anyat all in support of his case and he has not even the slightest regard at for the veracity of his statements. I any propose to deal now with two matters in regard to which the Minister's attitude was most unsatisfactory. Certain definite charges: were made against the Government this afternoon, and: the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) produced documents and read a verbatim report on which he based charges of a most disturbing, nature. Although members of the committee anxiously waited for the Minister to reply to those charges, the honourable gentleman simply stated that he refused either to confirm or deny that he had addressed certain remarks r,o members of the Council, for Scientific dnd Industrial Research. Similarly, he refused, to commit: himself in regard to the conversation between, the British Prime Minister and. the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), although, be must be perfectly aware of the gist of that conversation and thecircumstances surrounding it. The reason why he refused to make a definitestatement is* that he knows that he--cannot deny those allegations. It is of no use forhim to endeavour to mislead the committee, because anything said at the meetingof the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is recorded and itsiitterance cannot be denied. The Minister had a great deal to say about leakages of information from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and challenged honourable members, on this side of the ch amber to give specific instances of leakages which occurred. Qf course, we cannot give any such details. In Canada, no one jould have revealed the leakages that were taking place until a member of the Soviet legation informed the Canadian Government of what had been going on. for years under its nose. Are not similar ideal conditions for espionage present in this country? Are there not people associated with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, whom, noone in his senses would, trust with confidential information? there not Communists in positions of authority under the Government, and are there not "" fellowtravellers"" even in the Government itself? Does not the Soviet embassy maintain a swollen staff; which is very actively employed ? Do not Communists like Jones and. Lockwood""attend overseas conferences, and meet Mr Gullett. representatives of foreign powers to whom tliey can confide any information, thai may be of value to those foreign powers ? Circumstances similar to those which obtained, in Canada before the revelations of. the treachery which was occurring in that country were made, exist in Aus' tralia. It is utter nonsense to contend that,, because no. public disclosure haF been, made of any leakage of vital information, such leakages are not. occurring. The time will come when the discovery of. some particular breach, of security will reveal the degree of. espionage which is. occurring, ,and then we shall hear, a sorry tale of the leakages that are nov. occurring under the present Government. Although specificallegations of amost serious nature have been made against the Government no attempt has been madetorefute them. TheLeader of the Australian Country party said, in my opinion quite rightly, that Australia is not trusted by either the United Kingdom or the United States of America. In the lighr of the-serious state of affairs-that has been revealed this afternoon how could we possibly, be trusted by those countries? Indeed, we know that we are not trusted by the United Kingdom, and no one is more aware of that than is the Minister. Some time ago the United Kingdom Government sent to Australia members of M.I.5 for the purpose of inquiring into the security have precautions taken in this country, and those officers will report to the highest authorities in the United Kingdom. Doe* the Minister see the reports of that organization ?",41
168,Mr DEDMAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I rise to order. Fund* for the security service are provided under the proposed vote for the Attorney-General's Department, and such matters' should, not be discussed during debate on the Estimates for the Counci'' for Scientific and Industrial Research Are The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Mr Hadley).:-The honourable member cannot discuss the general matter of security while the committee is debating the estimates for the Prime Minister'* Department.",42
169,Mr GULLETT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I shall confine myself to that aspect! of security which is related tonuclear, experiments and atomic research. I understand that the members of the British military intelligence organization to which I have referred were sent here in order to ensure that defence projects involving the United Kingdom were conducted by the Australian Government in such 'a way as not to endanger the security of the United Kingdom, and to investigate whether the Government could be entrusted with the supervision of the important experiments which are to be made in this country, -[t is a terrible disgrace to Australia that the British Government should find it necessary - to send military intelligence officers to this country in order to discover the state of affairs here. If the 'Minister insists that our security precautions are adequate, will he tell the committee whether he 'has access to the reports submitted by the British military intelligence organization on conditions in this country? .If the'honourable gentleman has been given access to such reports, will he deny ""that they reveal a most disquieting state of affairs?

172,Mrs BLACKBURN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"I refer to Division, No. 12, Public Service Board, and I intend to say something in regard to the conditions of women employed in the Public Service. I have received .a .number of letters from women employed in Commonwealth departments and from various organizations of female officers, which reveal the existence of considerable dissatisfaction. Grave dissatisfaction is expressed that women who perform work similar to that of male officer* receive lower salaries than are paid to men, and it is alleged that women cannot expect promotion to senior positions unless they possess higher qualifications than male officers of the departments in which they are employed. Other grievances relate to salaries and .security of tenure. I am aware that section 49 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act restricts 'the employment, of married women in the Public Service, and that onlj certain Commonwealth departments find it expedient to employ them. Married - women employed in the Public Service disadvantages compared with men in that they can their superannuation rights av - seriously affected. Apart from the - restrictions imposed by 'section 49 of the act, 'the 'board 'has officially stated that it 'regards the employment of married - women in the Public Service as undesirable, and that, "" apart 'from other considerations, it is not considered that Australian conditions 'are such that the ""employment - of - married women would be advisable from a social'viewpoint."" ""What : exactly ""does that mean? The women 'concerned - would certainly 'like the Go-wernment or the board to clarify that - statement. Recently, the Canberra Association of Women Graduates discussed ""the 'employment of women in the Public Service, and those discussions - were con-icerned 'mainly *wifh 'four matters: the 'salaries of departmental 'librarians, 'the : sentry of women'into the Third Division. Jthe ""temporary ""employment of women in ^permanent 'positions, and 'the 'employment tof married 'women. The association ipointed out that women employed as l i brarians - in the .Commonwealth departments .are '.at 'a idisadvantage - compared with those engaged as librarians in the Parliamentary and National libraries. Departmental librarians are paid not more than £304 per annum plus certain margins and cost of living adjustments, whereas male librarians with similar qualifications can rise to more than £600 a year. It has been suggested that girls mould be permitted to sit for examinations for entry to the Third Division, they so desire, and that they be appointed <>n a competitive basis to such vacancies as may occur. It has also been suggested that women graduates seeking appointment to the Public Service under section 36A of the Commonwealth Public Service Act should not he debarred from permanent appointment because of their *ex. In reply to these suggestions, the Public Service Bonrd has stated that tinuity of experience in the Public Service is essential to promotion to senior administrative posts, and for this reason it is regarded as undesirable that, as a general rule, women should be employed in clerical and professional positions. Women are permitted to compete, with men for appointment to the British civil <ervice and the New South ""Wales public service. At the 1st April, 1947, there were employed in the various sections of the British civil service 423,496 men and 264,206 women; but in the Third Division of the Commonwealth Public Service at the 30th June, 1947, only 65 women were employed, as compared with 14,079 men. Some women university graduates have complained that they have been given temporary employment in permanent positions for which they applied, and that no reason has been advanced for this action except that of sex. It is claimed that it is not always possible to - jbtain immediately the services of a suitably qualified man, and that a woman may be employed temporarily until a suitable man can be secured. Sometimes women with the highest qualifications have had to give way to men with much lower qualifications. Women are not convinced that the practice followed by the board is the only course to be pursued, *nd they recommend that, if a woman applicant for a permanent position is regarded as fulfilling the educational, medical and other requirements of a posi'ion, she should he appointed to it per\ f r s. Biaefr.hnrn. manently, after serving a satisfactory probationary period. Finally, I propose to speak of the position of married women. Owing to the present labour shortage, married women are now freely employed in a temporary capacity, not only in the Commonwealth Public Service, but also in the public services of the various States. if Some women who have married have continued to be employed in the positions they occupied prior to marriage, but, as the result of their marriage, they have been re-employed on a temporary basis, with loss of salary increments and rights to accumulated sick leave and recreation leave. This is unjust and unnecessary, and is certainly not conducive to efficient work. The British con- - civil service and the New South Wales Education Department have lifted thf ban which previously existed on the employment of married women. Why should not section 49 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act be deleted, thus allowing Australia to take its place in the forefront of progress? . It seem* that in this respect we are sadly out of date. These are only some of the matters' concerning the Public Service Board that have been brought to my notice. My attention is constantly being drawn to unsatisfactory features of the board'* administration. I have brought some matters forward at question time and I understand that some of them are already being dealt with. The organization of the Commonwealth Public Service needs to be revised. I suggest that women should be appointed to the Public Service Board and take part in the discussions with other members of the board on all matters relating to the appointment and employment of women. Women members of the board would also be helpful in giving advice relating to difficulties that may arise when men and women are working together. The> would also be able to give valuable advice on the employment of juniors. I trust that, for the benefit of women generally, the suggestions which I have made wil 1 receive the early consideration of th* Government.",43
173,Mr RYAN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Flinders) [5.36] - Lik the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs. Ulackburn) I , too, wish to raise a matter - which comes under Division No. 12, Public Service Board. I propose, however, to deal with an aspect of the board's administration different from that dealt with by the honourable - member. During the last fortnight or --to we have heard many statements by Ministers and by honourable members opposite relating to what they describe as the wonderful prosperity which this - oountry is now enjoying. We have been told that everybody in Australia today is prosperous, happy and contented. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr. Langtry) said that prosperity reigns everywhere. I marvel at these statements, because it seems to me that honourable members opposite, particularly the back-benchers, should at least know that in the Commonwealth Public Service 'here is a great deal of dissatisfaction, particularly amongst those on the lower ranges of salary. Ministers and honourable members opposite generally should know what these people feel when they are told, as they so often are told these - lays, about the wonderful age in which we live. To many of our public servants those words must surely sound like - i hollow mockery. It has recently been brought to my notice that a great deal - if dissatisfaction exists among Commonwealth public servants in Victoria, and probably throughout Australia, because - salary adjustments have not been made to meet the rising costs of living. I understand that no changes have been made in the salaries of public servants for many months, notwithstanding that, - luring the last six months or so, the cost ->f living has risen by approximately 14 per cent. According to the Commonwealth Statistician the cost of living mow 43 per cent, above the pre-war figure. It may well be a good deal higher than that. The claims of our public --ervants should be carefully investigated by the Public Service Board, either of its own volition or at the instigation of the Government. It is most important for the good government of our country that the members of the Public Service be contented. Public servants express a good deal of dissatisfaction about their plight, particularly when they recall how members of this Parliament last year gave themselves a 50 per cent, increase of their parliamentary allowances. N01 all honourable members have accented that increase.",44
174,Mr DALY,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,Did the honourable member accept it?,45
175,Mr BY AN,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"No . I believed then aI believe now that we had no justification for doing so until we wen satisfied that the wages and salaries of all members of the Commonwealth Public Service had been adjusted to meet the steeply falling purchasing value of money. The honorabhmember for Reid (Mr Lang) pointed out with great justification that'the Government seems to be mesmerized by figures. Ministers note that public servants who. a few years ago, were receiving £5 a week, are now receiving as much as £9 a week, and they say how wonderful it is. They overlook the fact that £9 will not nov buy as much as £5 would buy then. Public servants have, therefore, cause to be dissatisfied. I do not propose to say what increase of salaries is justified; that is not my province, but the matter should be investigated without delay.",45
176,Mr TXTRNBTILL,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"Wimmera) [5.42J. - I desire to bring to the notice of the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (Mr. Dedman) the need to discover, if possible, some way to eradicate onion weed, which is rapidly taking possession of the country in the vicinity of Swan Hill, with a consequent loss of production. The Government says that it wants more production. At Labour party conferences, resolutions are carried stressing the need for greater production; or, at least, thai is what we are told. If we are to increase is primary production, the fertility of the soil must he maintained and noxious weeds controlled. The Swan Hill Shire Council has repeatedly asked me to bring before the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research its request that onion weed be scientifically investigated. I brought their representations before the Minister, and in reply he wrote saying that the officers of the council were too busy to undertake .the work. The shire council was persistent, and wrote saying that the Minister evidently did not understand the seriousness of the onion weed menace. It pointed out that the Council' for Scientific and Industrial Research was financed out of the taxpayers' money, and that the taxpayers of the Swan Hill district were entitled to benefit from its work. The Minister, however, persisted in his refusal to help. I now ask him whathe proposes to do about it. He may accuse the of working; the parish pump, but this is a matter of more than local interest. The Minister is not listeningto me, and Joes not know what I have been saying. When he was attacked thisafternoon for permitting the leakage of information about atomicenergy; he was stung to reply in his defence, but he now sits at the table deep in conversation with the Vice-President of the Executive Council(Mr Scully)', and ignores what I am saying to him on behalf of my constituents. Now that he is giving me his attention, I ask' him whether he is aware - if' the nature of the replies which he sent in response to my representations, or-did he sign the letters without reading diem? Is heprepared to accedetothe request of the Swan Hill Shire Council ? Does he propose to reply in this chamber to. the representative of the farmers who haveasked, him for help ? Will he ask his officers to investigate the onion weed menace?, The day before yesterday, I read, a statement in the press by a prominent grazier that the economy of Australian s being ""nibbled away by rabbits"". That was. a true statement, and, I should like to know what the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is doing about it. I have received letters: from primary producers,' organizationssuggesting that a reward of £5,000, or even 610,000, should be offered as. an inducement, to scientists to discover a method of eradicating the rabbit pest..",45

In that agreement, the Governments: undertook toparticipate in agreed action directed to the expansion, by appropriate international and domestic measures, of production, employment, and the exchange and consumption of goods, to the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international oommerce, and to thereduction of tariffs .tnd other trade barriers. Australia has been closely connected - vith the negotiationssince the proposal r'or an International' Trade Organization - vas adopted by a resolution of the Economic and Social Council in February, 1946. The council' set up a Preparatory Committee of nineteencountries, in whichAustraliaparticipated actively and subsequently convened the world conference which drafted the Havana --.barter. Prior to and throughout the negotiations) which commenced ini October, 1946, there have been continual discussions betweenmembers of the British Commonwealth on mattersof. common interest which were affected by the - negotiations. The charter will' enter into force sixtieth day following the day on which amajority of the governments which signed the final act at Havana have deposited instruments of acceptance with the Secretary-Generali of the United Nations.",46
181,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS INVESTMENT SI N,"How many have done so; so far? Mr Dedman"" - If ; however, by the 24'th March, 194'9, it has not so entered into force, it will"" enter into force on sixtieth day following the day on which - twenty of the governments that participated in the conferenceat Havana have deposited their instruments of acceptance. Bf islikely that most of the countries which participated in the conference will defer thedeposit of instruments of acceptance until the Congress of the United States has considered thecharter, which is not likely tooccur before January, 1949.. That is the answer to the: interjection by the honourable member, for New England, (Mr Abbott)),, a moment ago. The General Agreement on Tariffs; and Trade, the: second, document with, which this bill is concerned, is closely linked with the charter of the International Trade Organization. It . containsthe tariff rates negotiated at Geneva, in 194? on the basis of. mutual, concessions between, the participating countries. Honor able, members will recall, that theagreement was-, laid before the Parliament earlier this year and debated by thiHbuse in February and March. That debate was followed by legislation ratifying changes in the rates of duty to bring theminto accord with the agreement The agreement is at present being 1 operated provisionally by 22 countries which were concerned with its construction. While operation is provisional, any member country maj withdraw on 60 days' notice and 1 need not take the full legislative stepsregarding trade policy which are required by full adherence: Full adherencepledges member countriesnoi to withdraw before 1951. It is, I think, unlikely that any. country will make full acceptance of the General' Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as distinct from applying-- it provisionally, until a decision has been made on the entry intx force of the charter. I . might point on the out to honourable members that once b sufficient number of countries are apply ing the agreement definitively, they ar* empowered to declare, that a country which is only applying, it provisionally i * no longer a contracting, party to. the agreement.. Some amendments were made to th»terms of. the general agreement at session*of thecontractingparties' at Havana i r the March of this year, and again at Geneva in August and September. The main purpose of these amendments^ which were 1 effected by a series of protocols, was to bring the general agreement, on its. rulemaking and structural sides, into line with amendments made at Havana to the text of. the International Trade Organization charter. Two of those protocolfare concerned entirely with rectificatibnfof the tariffschedules contained in the general'- agreement, but these only pick up slips andi misprints between the schedules as< negotiated and as originally printed Copies of. all theselatestdocuments-. together with copies of the articles of the general agreement have been supplied to honourable members. I have also placed several copies of the original three volumes of schedules of tariff concessions, which form part of the general agreement previously dealt with by this House, in the Library, as there are insufficient copies -)f that large item for me to be able to - mpply a set to each honourable member. As honourable members will observe when reading the bill, Australia signed the protocol modifying Part II . and Article XXVI . with a reservation as to acceptance. We did this because the United Kingdom also signed with a reservation as to acceptance. We have asked the United Kingdom for its views <»n the reservation, and we desire to consider further the matters arising from them. There is provision in the terms of the protocol for those countries which signed with reservation to deposit an instrument of acceptance with the United STations, and the Government accordingly Hsks in this bill for approval to deposit such instrument when thoroughly satisfied. Honourable members have been supplied with a copy of this as of all -»ther protocols. Now I desire to say something about the charter of the International Trade Organization. It is designed-(a ) to Hstablish an acceptable commercial code of rules and mutual obligations which rhe member governments undertake to observe in their relations with one another; (£>) to set up an International Trade Organization which is intended to act as a means of consultation, collaboration and joint action for member governments in the field of international commercial policy, and to provide a medium of settlement of trade dispute among its members. I have supplied honourable members with a detailed statement describing the provisions of the charter and the manner in which they will operate and will therefore confine my remarks to an outline of the broad implications confronting Australia in accepting or rejecting them. Throughout its participation in the negotiations, the Australian delegation - sought to secure a charter adapted to the Mr Dedman. interests of this country. It particularly sought to establish(a) the importance of maintaining employment and effective demand, particularly in the major industrial countries of the world that will continue to represent the biggest markets for our exports; (b) the need for .greater stability of prices for primary products in order to stabilize the incomes of primary producers and to reduce the undesirable economic* fluctuations resulting from extreme variations in prices for these goods; (c) freedom for Australia to deal with economic problems of particular concern to it, for example-(i ) industrial development by tariff protection: (ii) protection of the balance of payments; and (i i i ) stabilization plans for primary industries ; (d) the principle that British Commonwealth countries should not be required to reduce, or eliminate, preferences except in return for compensating concessions and that these preferences are a recognized exception to the general most-favourednation principle; - (e) limitations on the use of restrictions on imports of agricultural products by countries which in the past maintained domestic agriculture at uneconomic levels by means of import quotas and other impediments to importa tion and by so doing reduced their demand for Australian exports; and (/) the necessity to promote actively the development of underdeveloped areas and by raising living standards in these territories to increase the demand for imported goods. I believe that the charter can b*examined in the light of the foregoing objectives and will be found to meet them. It has been the policy of the Australian Government that no commitments in relation to commercial policy, particularly those which required a reduction in restrictions on imports, could successfully be maintained unless the conditions under which Australia could continue to export to the full capacity of its industries are maintained. Primarily this requires conditions of full employment and high levels of effective demand in the major industrial countries of the world. In recognition of this the charter contains a chapter devoted to employment and economic activity and in Article 3 each country accepts an obligation to take notion designed to maintain full employment and a large and steadily growing demand. In the event of a failure of - ithers to maintain employment and demand, the provisions of the charter - mable a country, such as Australia, whose exports would be affected, to seek from the organization a review of its obligations on commercial policy, or even to ""btain release from continuing obligations fo maintain low levels of tariffs or from other responsibilities under the charter, lii any case there is provision within the charter for a country to take emergency action with respect to tariff concessions aranted if conditions threaten domestic : ndnstry. One of the principal duties of the - rganization will be the promotion of tgreements between governments relating to the international marketing of primary commodities. The purpose of these agreements will be to ensure that producers can plan their production ahead with a know'edge of a guaranteed return for their - xportable surpluses. Such agreements »re not for the purpose of reducing the return to producers but for overcoming r he wide fluctuations in the actual returns To growers and, consequently, to give to - hem a greater stability of income. Com-nodities for which such special international agreements are completed will then ric exempt from the other provisions of r he charter which might conflict with any 'inderta kings in those agreements. The development of Australian industry has for many years been encouraged by tariff protection granted by Parliament after inquiry by the Tariff Board. The charter imposes no restriction on the raising of tariffs and the only obligation is in respect of duties that are bound against increase for a period of time under the general agreement. It was the policy of the Government in the course of the Geneva negotiations to refrain from negotiating items whose future industrial development it was felt might require the raising of the tariff sooner than the expiration of the three-year period for which the general agreemeni will initially be in force. Moreover, the charter recognizes the right of a country to seek to withdraw from the general agreement its commitment under any tariff items before the end of a three year period in order to raise the duty for the purpose of assisting industrial development. Whilst this procedure requires the consent of substantially all the affected parties it is a clear and important recognition of the right to seek to re-negotiate a duty in special circumstances. Past experience has shown thai countries must, at times, take immediate action to protect their international monetary reserves. Balance of payments difficulties are, at the present time, a matteT of concern to most of the countries in the world and the use of quantitative restrictions to control a decline in their foreign exchange reserves is an essential part of the policy of those governments. The charter recognizes completely the need of countries to use quantitative re strictions to safeguard their balance of payments and a special exception for this purpose is contained in Article 21. Thiarticle, and the provisions of Article 23. relating to the discriminatory use of quantitative restrictions, are highly technical and complex. However, they cover our need to apply and maintain quantitative restrictions if there should be a decline, or a threatened decline, in OUT international reserves. For many years domestic marketing schemes, such as those covering butter and wheat, have operated in Australia for the purpose of stabilizing returns toprimary producers. These schemes, with which honourable members are fully familiar, have resulted at times in higher prices being paid by Australian consumers than by overseas purchasers, while at other times the reverse has been the case. Recognition of this type of marketing scheme has been oM-s'ned for the purposes of the charter and the provisions of the charter restricting export subsidies do not .apply to these Australian stabilization arrangements. Article 16 of the charter, which contains a statement of the most-favourednation principle, specifically excludes from that generalization preferences exchanged between members of the British Commonwealth prior to various dates laid down. There is no obligation for these margins of preference to be reduced except by agreement of all the parties concerned. Any such action would be taken only in return for tariff concessions made by other countries as part of a bargaining process having mutually advantageous results, as was the case with the Geneva tariff negotiations. It is to be aoted that no new preference may be created and that this extends in principle to all the members of the organization. However, as honourable members are aware, no other British country has extended a new preference of importance to Australia for many years, and the Government of the United Kingdom is, irrespective of the charter, formally committed against such an extension of preferences. It is also known that the Government of Canada is opposed to an extension of, or the creation of, new preferences. On the other hand, this prohibition on the exchange of preferences applies generally to all other members of the organization, and it has been apparent in the .course of the negotiations 'leading to the formulation of the charter that a number of those countries which are in the same economic region or have complementary economies would, but for this obligation, have sought to create new preferences to a far greater extent than the charter now permits New preferences may be permitted only in the interests of economic development or .reconstruction or under a customs anion arrangement, and in all cases with the approval of the organization. Detailed criteria must be complied with before consent will be forthcoming. Past axperience has shown the extent to which overseas markets for Australian exports of agricultural products have been closed by ithe imposition of quantitative restrictions. These restrictions have been imposed by the older industrial couaitries, Mr Dedman - ultimate need to ensure that there an> which have sought by this, means to pro tect high cost agricultural production. The charter provides for a general prohibition on the use .of import quotas in .this manner except in temporary circumstances or under conditions in which the domestic production of the article is also restricted. Rising living standards in the under-developed countries of the world would increase the demand for imported goods, particularly foodstuffs. More than a recognition of this need for development is required, and the charter placet on the organization the responsibility for actively encouraging the development of these .areas by advising members and providing them with assistance in their planning. Positive action of this type should ensure an expanding volume of international trade from which Australia, as an important supplier of food, would benefit considerably. I think honourable members will agree that these points amply show that the charter includes provisions which meet the main requirements of Australian interests. In making a decision whether it would he advantageous to become a member of the organization, we should, 1 think, consider a little further the following four aspects of the question:(a.) the contribution that the organization can make to the solution of world economic problems and to the maintenance of healthy economic conditions; (it) the effect of the charter on Australian export markets for primary products and manufactured goods, by its application to the economic policies of other - countries; -(c) the effect which the charter may have on the economic policies of Australia; and ;(<Z) the attitude of other countries. On these points, I shall make some 'observations for - the consideration of honourable members. The charter requires, as a condition for freer commercial policies, an undertaking by all countries to pursue policies designed to maintain high and stable levels of employment awd effective demand. The present world conditions of shortages of goods and scarcity >of .hard currencies :mask the maintained.in our overseas markets steady levels of employment and consequent increasing demand for our primary exports, [f these obligations are successfully carried out, these market conditions for all internationally traded goods will be assured. If there is a failure to carry out these undertakings by the major marketing countries, then Australia and the other countries adversely affected will have strong justification under the terms of the charter for taking emergency action to protect their own economies against the impact of adverse economic conditions overseas, and also a eound basis for urging in the organization international action to correct the decline of demand. Members of the organization undertake, in Article 4, that, if their balance of ments shows a persistent excess of exports over imports and is thus creating balance of payments difficulties for other member countries, they will play their full part in restoring equilibrium. This, for instance, would require such a country as the United States actively to pursue policies designed to correct a disequilibrium between dollar and non-dollar currencies. The absence of successful action provides a basis for complaint by affected countries and for the urging of international action through the organization. On the other hand, for countries whose balance of payments is unfavorable, provisions have been inserted to ensure that measures to prevent a continuing decline in monetary reserves may be taken. Although some of the principles set out in the charter are subject to excepfrom tions which may be applied to meet the specific needs, for example, of undersuch developed countries, countries in balance of payments difficulties, and countries dependent on primary exports, the benefits general effect of the charter will be 3ecure recognition of the need to follow non-restrictive trade policies to the fullest practicable degree. Some of the main industrial countries may require make use of some of the exceptions until the war damage to their economies has been overcome, but others, notably the United States, will be in a position apply the charter terms from the beginhave ning practically without recourse to exceptions Provided in the charter. f36 ] alone will undoubtedly be to the benefit of the rest of the world because of the expanding, market which the United States provides for exports - from other countries, especially in view. of the. restraint imposed by the charter upon the adoption of restrictive practices which may have the effect of providing unreasonable protection for domestic industries and so limiting competition with those industries. Honourable members are well aware that international trade disputes in the past have frequently had widespread and detrimental effects resulting from action taken by individual countries without regard to the effects upon others. The establishment of the International Trade Organization will provide a forum in paywhich there can be prior consultation tendinar to limit the scope of trade disputes and lead to their earlier settlement. For this reason Chapter VIII . of the charter provides for extensive consultationand arbitration. It will also - be possible for members to refer to the organization, for advice and study, developments inimical to international trade as they become evident. The adoption of a generally accepted code in international trade, which provides adequately for the realization of legitimate national and commercial objectives, will also tend to eliminate the detrimental effects resulting from the grosser forms of national self-sufficiency. Australian exoorts will benefit directly from the maintenance of good demand conditions in the world and particularly the adoption of non-restrictive trade policies by highly developed countries as the United States of America. Future tariff negotiations of the kind concluded in Geneva can lead to further for our industries. The developto ment of new export markets for Australian goods will increase the benefits to be obtained from direct negotiations with those countries and indirectly from to the negotiations which, may be undertaken by other countries. The limitation on the use of quantitative restrictions by importing countries, from which to Australian exports of primary products suffered in the past, will also the strengthen our export position. MoreThis over, our existing schemes for the stabilization of primary export industries are fully protected. On the other hand, the charter leaves the main structure of existing imperial preferences substantially preserved. A though new preferences cannot, except as provided in the charter, be established by any country, existing preferences obtain international recognition and we are not required to surrender the preferences we enjoy except in return for compensating benefits in other countries' markets as a result of a mutually satisfactory bargain. The need for development of sound export markets for Australian manufacturing industries increases the interest of this country in provisions of the charter which provide for freer trade and a reduction of trade barriers. [ have already dealt at some length with the relationship of the charter to Australia's particular interests. It is evident from what T have said that the Australian delegation has secured recognition in the charter for the basic elements of policy followed by Australia in connection with international trade. This relates particularly to the protection Australian manufacturing industries, stabilization plan for primary industries and restrictions necessary for the protecticn. of the balance of payments. It can be said, that the charter requires no change in Australian policies and few, changes and. those only minor, in the present Australian commercial legislation or practices, and that it will not prevent our dealing adequately with any economic problem likely to arise in the future as n result of our adherence to the charter. Of the 56 governments represented at Havana, all except Argentina and Poland signed the final act of the conference authenticating the text of the Havana charter. The United Kingdom delegation stated that its Government, in deciding to sign the final act, had also decided to submit the charter to the Parliament with the Government's support. It seems likely that the charter will not be submitted to the Congress of the United States of America until 1949. This bill makes Australian acceptance of the International Trade Organization membership conditional on United States and United Kingdom acceptance. It is Sir. Dedman. provided under this bill that Australia shall not deposit an instrument of acceptance of the charter until this has been done by the governments of Britain and l - the United States. The usefulness and success of the organization will depend upon the willingness of such major trading nations to accept membership. As joint sponsors, the United Kingdom and the United States are indispensable to the organization's effectiveness. For this reason, I feel that some honourable members on both sides of the House will agree that the Government has acted wisely in ma.king our own acceptance of both the charter and the agreement conditional in the this way. On the other hand, it would be almost certainly disadvantageous for us to decline membership if British and American acceptance is forthcoming, because the organization and its members would, in fact, constitute a large and powerful trading group whose members would exchange most-favoured-nation treatment from which we would be excluded. There is no need for me to enter here into details of the International Trade for Organization. As honourable members are aware from, previous debates, the powers and duties of the organization given to it by the charter will be carried out by the conference of the members. The conference will also determine the policies of the organization. It may, by a simple majority decision, assign to the executive board any power or duty of the organization. The executive board is to consist of eighteen members selected regularly by the conference. In the event of our accepting membership of the International Trade Organization, Australia would appear to have an excellent chance of election to this executive board. There should be ample room, therefore, for Australia to take an active part in the formulation of the policy of the International Trade Organization when it is established, both in the conference and the executive board. Outside the organization, we could have little or no voice at all in formulation of world trade policies. I turn now from the International Trade Organization charter to the distinct but related General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In pursuance of the principle of reductions in tariffs, the members of the Preparatory Committee present in Geneva negotiated last year the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The agreement is in practice intimately linked with the charter. Any tariff concessions which may be agreed upon as a result of any future negotiations completed under the charter, will be fitted into the framework of the general agreement on terms to be agreed upon by the parties concerned. By the operation of the general most-favoured-nation treatment provided for in the charter, Australia stands to gain from such negotiations, oven though it may not participate in every one of them. When the charter comes into force, the general clauses of the agreement will be suspended, or rather merged into the corresponding sections of the charter. The agreement will then consist of the tariff concessions and the unconditional most-favoured-nation clause, together with Part III . , which contains certain machinery provisions directly related to the operation of those concessions. If the charter is accepted by the tralian Government, there will be no purpose in failing to accept the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has been provisionally applied by Ausmembers tralia since the 1st January, 1948. The period of the agreement is initially three years, but may run on thereafter, subject to withdrawal by individual conitself. tracting parties on six months' notice to the re-negotiation or withdrawal of individual tariff concessions. The vernment is now seeking authority for the definitive, as distinct from provitogether sional, application of the general agreeliness. ment at such time as the governments of the United Kingdom and the United be States of America shall have taken action to apply the agreement definitively their respective countries. I have plained earlier in my speech the practical distinction between provisional and be resumed? definitive acceptance and application. In preparation for the first conference of the organization, an Interim Commiswith sion has been established, and an executive committee of eighteen members has sumed next week? been elected. Australia was one of the countries elected, and is participating actively in the work of the Interim Commission, thus preserving a link that was adjourned. established when the project. was commenced. A session of the executive committee of the Interim Commission has been concluded at Geneva during this month. Thus it is hoped to assist in the determination of the early policy of the organization in a manner that will ensure its development on sound lines and in the interests of Australia development in international trade. The charter should provide conditions in which an expanding volume of international trade will be secured, and Australia, as a large and growing export country, has a very material interest in such a development. The charter does not require important changes in our present practices. If our hopes for expanding world trade are not realized, then the conditions which restrict our exports will provide an acceptable reason for a review of our own commitments in respect of the charter, and we shall therefore be no worse off for having attempted to co-operate with other countries in the achievement of this objective. The price Ausof isolationism will be at the least a failure to derive benefits from tariff concessions exchanged between the major trading countries of the world that are of the organization. But there are wider reaapns, equally compelling, for for givingthe International Trade Organization every opportunity to prove As I suggested earlier, success by or this body could go very far indeed in creating conditions of stability, co-operaGotion and trust among the nations on which alone we and all nations may live in freedom and good neighbourFor these reasons, the Government has decided that, on balance, it will in Australia's interest to accept membership in the organization and to accept to the general agreement, and therefore exit commends the bill to the House. "" Mr HUGHES - When will the debate",47

185,Mr CALWELL,NATIONALITY AND,"Melbourne-Minister for Information and Minister for Immigration) [8.40] - by leave- I move That the bill oe now read a second time. This is an historic occasion in the life of our nation. The bill which I have the honour to present this evening seeks to establish for the first time the principle of Australian citizenship, while maintaining between the component parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations the common bond of British nationality. The importance of the measure lies in the fact that it marks another step forward in the development of Australian nationhood. This step is a logical one, and is the inevitable consequence of the decisions of successive Imperial conferences. They culminated in the Statute of Westminster, which established each dominion of the British Commonwealth of Nations and Great Britain itself as equal partners, independent of each other and joined together in a legal sense only by the bond of a common allegiance to His Majesty the King. The bill is not designed to make an Australian any less a British subject, but to help him to express his pride in citizenas ship of this great country. That is a. pride which is praiseworthy, because it is based on a belief that Australia has done as much as any other British nation to develop, expand and improve the free institutions and systems of organized society that had their origin in the United Kingdom. Our friendly competition to excel, not in conquest or power, but in the development of decent and democratic social structures is not, unfortunately, as well understood as it should, be in some parts of the world, but the success that has been achieved to date is a legitimate cause for satisfaction. To say that one is an Australian is, of course, to indicate beyond all doubt that one is British; but to claim to be of the British race does not make it clear that one is an Australian. The time has come for Australia and the other dominions to recognize officially and legally their maturity as members of the British .Commonwealth by the passage of separate citizenship laws. Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to introduce this bill that will enable Australia to proclaim its own national citizenship and establish the duties and responsibilities as well as the rights and privileges that are inherent in it.",54
186,Mr LANG,NATIONALITY AND,"I rise to order. I submit that the Minister is not in order in moving the second reading of a bill that is not before the House. I have asked for a copy of the measure, but I have not yet been able to obtain one.",54
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONALITY AND, The bill is on the table. I understand that copies are now being handed to honourable members.,54
188,Mr CALWELL,NATIONALITY AND,"I fulfilled the legal requirement by presenting the bill. If the honourable member for Reid (Mr. Lang) is too lazy to walk to the table for a copy, that is his affair. Subject to certain modifications designed to meet conditions peculiar to Australia, the bill puts into effect the principle on which the United Kingdom Nationality Act 1948 is based. In that act, the British Government recognized that the people of each of the self-governing countries of the British Commonwealth of Nations had a particular status as citizens of their own country as well their wider status as British subjects. The bill makes other changes in nationality law, and in particular it achieves an end which the Australian people have long sought, which is, the removal of the disabilities imposed on married women and their placement, so far as their national status is concerned, on an equal footing with men and single women. Nationality legislation is without question a difficult and complicated matter, and it may be worthwhile to review briefly the historical position in relation to British nationality. Originally British nationality was only conferred under the common law by birth withiD the legiance of the Crown. If a person was born in England, he became at birth an Englishman, irrespective of the nationality of his parents. Having been born an Englishman, throughout his life he was able to assume the obligations and enjoy the privileges acquired by birth on British soil. With the growth of the Sing's dominions, complications arose in regard to the children of Englishmen born outside England, and legislation become necessary to recognize such children as British subjects by virtue of the fact that their fathers or paternal grandfathers were born on British soil. The question was further complicated by the development, within the British Commonwealth, of dominions which were, in fact, sovereign States with power and authority equal to those of the United - Kingdom. Such countries made their own laws, laying down the conditions under which British nationality was acquired or lost so far as each individual country was concerned. The legislation passed by the various Dominions had local effect only, with the result that a person who was recognized in one British country as a British subject was regarded in. others as an alien. In 1914, however, the United Kingdom Government introduced a bill for the purpose of consolidating the British law and applying it uniformly throughout the whole of the British Commonwealth. At various stages the parliaments of the Dominions passed legislation along similar lines, thus ing into effect what is known as the "" common code "" system. While the introduction of this system marked a definite advance on former British nationality legislation, it was found not to solve all difficulties, and a new method was sought which would retain all of the advantages of the "" common code"" system and. avoid its defects. The only workable plan that could be found was based on the principle of combining local citizenship of an individual member of the British Commonwealth with the maintenance of the general status of British subject. This method has been decided upon after consultation between the various members of the Commonwealth. The question of the relationship between the common status possessed by all subjects of His Majesty and the particular status of membership of any one of the individual communities forming the British Commonwealth of Nations is by no means a new one. The con-sideration of legislation to define who were thenationals or citizens of a particular community did not begin, as some may think, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act in 1946. The subject was dealt with in the Beport of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation, 1929, and in the Sumr mary of Proceedings of the Imperial Conr ference, 1930. The report of 1929 pointed out that British subjects not only have the common status but also, generally speaking, have a particular connection with one or other of the members of the British Commonwealth. It also pointed out that, in the absence of rules for determining the part of the Commonwealth to which any particular person belongs, practical difficulties arise, or might arise, with regard to such matters as immigration, deportation, diplomatic action, extra-territorial legislation and treaty rights and obligations. The suggestion was made that these difficulties could be overcome if each of the member states of the Commonwealth were to introduce legislation defining its nationals or citizens, but it was found that some member states were not then disposed to introduce such legislation. The matter was again considered at. the Imperial Conference of 1937. In its bring- report the conference statedIt was recognized that, to a greater or les* extent members of the Commonwealth, whether or not they have given legislative definition to such a concept, do distinguish for some practical purposes between British subjects in general and. those British subjects they Tegard as being members of their own respective communities. The report went on to say that the phrase "" members of the community "" of a particular member of the Commonwealth was intended to have rather a technical meaning, as denoting a person with whom that member of the Commonwealth had, either by legislative definition of ""its nationals or citizens or otherwise, decided to regard as "" belonging"" to it for the purposes of civil and political rights and duties, immigration, deportation, diplomatic representation, or the exercise of territorial jurisdiction. In the light of these considerations the conference reached the conclusion thatIt is for each member of. the British Commonwealth to decide which persons have with it that definite connection envisaged in the Beport on the Operation of Dominion Legislation, 1929, which would enable it to recognize themas members of its community. t r is desirable, however, to secure, as far as possible, uniformity in principle in the determination by each member of the Commonwealth, of the persons, being British subjects, to be regarded as members of its community. The difficulties which have arisen under the system of nationality legislation which now operates, and which is generally known as the "" common code "" system, are set out at some length in the explanatory memorandum which has been supplied to honourable members. There is, therefore, no need for me to labour this point. It will be sufficient for me to say that thesb difficulties did cause the Australian Government concern and that it felt impelled to introduce special legislation in regard to.the status of married women and residents of the Territory of New Guinea, although this involved a departure from the "" common code "". In 1945, the Government considered the question of legislation to provide for a legal Australian citizenship, combined with the maintenance of the common status of British subjects in Australia. About the same time, advice was received that the Canadian Government proposed to introduce a Canadian citizenship bill in the near future, and it was decided, in the circumstances, to defer consideration of the question of Australian citizenship legislation for the time being. The passage of the Canadian act in 1946 was followed in February, 1947, by the Conference of Nationality Experts of the various countries of the British Commonwealth, convened at the invitation of the United Kingdom Government, to discuss a d r a f t scheme prepared by the United Kingdom authorities. Their plan combined local citizenship with the wider status of British subject. The conclusions of the conference are embodied in the explanatory memorandum. The United K in gdom and New Zealand Governments have passed nets, which will come into operation as from 1st January, 1949, on lines similar to those of this bill, and other British Commonwealth countries have indicated that they are willin g to do the same. It should be clearly understood, and this is a point which I cannot too strongly emphasize, that creation of an Australian citizenship under this bill will in no way lessen the advantages and privileges which British subjects who may not be Mr Calwell. Australian citizens enjoy in Australia. British subjects, whether they are now in this country or enter it in future, will continue to be free from the disabilities and restrictions that apply to aliens. They will qualify for the franchise and have the right to become members of Parliament or to enter the public services. A British subject who is not Australian-born will be able to become an Australian citizen by a simple act of registration, but he will not suffer in any way whatever should he fail to do this. No doubt a great many British people not born in Australia will seek citizenship, but .they will not make the move as a means of obtaining any practical advantage whatever, but purely as an expression of pride in this country and its achievements, which I have already mentioned as being strong in the breasts of native Australians. Let me make it plain that the "" common code "" system has, in effect, broken down, and that the only means of maintaining the existing common status of British subjects throughout the British Commonwealth is in the concept that citizenship of an individual member of the Commonwealth shall carry with it the common status. This is effected by clause 7 (1), which is the key clause of the bill. It provides thatA person who, under this Act, is an Australian citizen, or by an enactment for the time being in force in a country to which this section applies, is a citizen of that country shall, by virtue of that citizenship, be a British subject. The section applies to the United Kingdom and colonies, Canada, New Zealand,- the Union of South Africa , Newfoundland, India, Pakistan, Southern Rhodesia and Ceylon. Before passing to other phases of the bill, I wish to make it clear that this is in no respect a party measure. This point was emphasizzed when the British bill was under discussion and was accepted by all parties, as thr following quotations will show. The Earl of Perth saidTt is good to find that under clause 1 of the bill the citizens of nearly all the countries of the Commonwealth will still bear the proud title of ""British subject"". . . . It is an overriding status, and I hope that this most valuable factor and tie between the various nations of the British Commonwealth will always remain. Lord Altrincham saidIn the first place, let me say that the hill persons who as a whole seems good, wise and tidy. I congratulate the Government upon it and upon the understanding with the Dominions upon which it has been founded. The bill is an example of our present constitutional practice in Commonwealth affairs of bringing the legal structure of the Commonwealth into as complete consonance as we can manage with reality-and by "" reality"" I mean the way in which the King's lieges think and feel, both as nationals of their own country and as members of a world-wide community. Lord Tweedsmuir expressed the that the real basis of the measure that it would give clear recognition the separate identity of particular tries. He believed that the word "" idenf e it , his Australian citizenship. tity "" was an important part of their strength and the encouragement of that "" i d e n t it y "" would be a source tinuing strength. Such opinions w i l hope, convince any one who may still doubt the fact that this bill is not, particular, opposed to the wishes of United Kingdom. It is, in fact, a Government. measure of a kind which the United Kingdom Government, and the of opinion in all classes in the United Kingdom, wish to see enacted in British Dominions. It is designed to eliminate complications in the matters nationality and citizenship that more irritatin g to us than they were the authorities in the United Kingdom itself. The explanatory memorandum will give honourable members a comprethis hensive view of the general provisions contained in the bill and I do not, fore, propose to deal with all these matters in detail. It is desirable, ever, that I should refer to some more important matters. The first these is. How w i ll Australian citizenship, which will carry with it the wider of British nationality, be acquired? will be achieved in a number of ways as (i ) by birth in this country; (descent if born outside Australia; (by registration in the case of British subjects other than Australian citizens, or Iris h citizens; and (i v ) by the grant nationality unless she acquired of naturalization in the case of aliens. r These provisions will operate only i y case of persons born after the commencement, ment of the act or of those who apply I registration or naturalization after M'late. Provision has, however, also ""made in the transitional clauses which clauses 24 to 31 to cover the cases of are British subjects immediately before the date of commencement of the act and by reason of these "" provisions they will not only retain their British nationality but also will acquire Australian citizenship automatically if they have a definite association with this country. In the provisions in regard to loss of citizenship two new principles have been incorporated in the bill. The first is that view an Australian citizen, who is also a was national of another country, and who to serves with the enemy forces in any war counin which Australia is engaged, shall forThe second provides for loss of citizenship in the case of a person who becomes a citizen of conby registration or naturalization, if h« l , I continues to reside outside Australia for a continuous period of seven years withi n any out registering annually at a consulate, the unless he is abroad in the service of the The House, I am sure, will agree that those provisions are botli leaders justifiable and desirable. I pass now to the status of married the women. It is my belief that our proposals in this regard will have not only of the full backing of every member of ih-. were not Commonwealth Parliament and every to woman in Australia, be she British or alien, but also of every male in our community who has given any thought to subject. I have always held the view that it was most objectionable that theresolely because a woman married a man of another nationality, she was obliged to howaccept his nationality. Because this of the has been the case, Australian women of have, from time to time, been placed in worrying and even humiliating situastatus tions, and it has long been agreed by enI t lightened people that the citizenship such rights of a woman should not be in any i i ) by way inferior to those of a man. Efforts i i i ) have been made to ameliorate the position by prescribing that on marriage a woman should not lose her British her husband's nationality. This did not comn the pletely satisfy the Australian Governwhich in 1946 passed special legisfor lation to provide that British women who that married aliens while resident in Ausbeen tralia, should not,. in this country, be are deemed to have lost their British nationality. It is our wish, however, that every woman, whether married or single, shall equally as free as a man to mine what her nationality shall he. The bill provides for this, and moreover, restores their British nationality to women who by reason of marriage may have became aliens. Such women who are resident in Australia and comply with the transitional provisions of the hill will also become Australian citizens. Under existing law certain children born in foreign territory are under some practical disadvantages. For instance, the child, born out of wedlock, of a British mother does not acquire British nationality, even if his father is British. In 1946 I appointed a. committee of women, representative of the main political bodies in Australia, which was presided over by Senator Tanarney, to consider the problems arising from the possession by mother and father of differput nationalities. Following on a recommendation of that committee, provision has been made in the bill that a child born in a foreism country, whose mother was an Australian citizen or was a British subiect ordinarily resident in Australia, shall be an Australian citizen, provided that such a child is eligible for admission to Australia as a permanent resident. Provision has also been made in the bill that children born out of wedlock, on foreign soil, of British fathers and alien mothers shall become, according to ''ircnmstances, Australian citizens or British subjects if their births are made legitimate by the subseauent marriage of the parents. An anomaly in regard to the position of posthumous children is also rectified by the bill. Such children will in future become Australian citizens if at the time of the father's death he was an Australian citizen. The position of Irish citizens under the bill has been clearly defined in the explanatory memorandum and I feel that there is little I can say by way of further observation. Briefly, this is a auestion which mainly concerns the United Kingdom and Irish Governments; and by Irish Government I refer to the Government of what was formerly known as the Irish Free State, now .sometimes known according to its Gaelic title as the Government of Eire. The Irish Government .has Mr Calwell. made it clear that, whilst it has objections in principle to an deter- Irish citizen still being regarded as a British subject as a matter of course, it raises no objection to any Irish citizen who has association with a particular Commonwealth country-by descent, residence or otherwise-becomin g a citizen of that country. * Under the provisions of the bill, which are identical with those of the United Kingdom Act. it rests with an Irish citizen to declare that by reason of his association with this country he wishes to become an Australian citizen, and on doing so he will acquire Australian citizenship. British subjects in Ireland enjoy certain material advantages which are not afforded to aliens, and, as a reciprocal measure, the bill provides that Irish citizens in this country who do not become Australian citizens shall not be treated as aliens. Clause 41 calls for special mention. It provides for arrangements to be made for the oath of allegiance to be taken in public before a judical office, and to be accompanied by proceedings designed to impress upon applicants the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizens. In a statement on government policy made by me in the House on the 22nd November, 1946,1 said It is my belief that the present procedure connected with the taking of the oath of allegiance by applicants for naturalization leaves much to be desired. At present the prospective new - citizen merely attends hi.» local courthouse and takes the oath before a magistrate or clerk of courts. It seems to me. however, that such an occasion calls for o dignified induction ceremony that would serve to instill into the minds of applicants n proper appreciation of the value of the new 7 citizenship, which carries with it certain obligations and resnonsibilities as well asprivileges a-nd benefits. Such a ceremony, based on the American practice, would, I feel sure, produce the same excellent results as have been achieved in the United States. Provision has been made in the bill to give effect to the views then expressed. It is proposed that the oath of allegiance shall be taken in open court, when the Australian flag shall be prominently displayed and have pride of place, and that an appropriate address shall be given by the presiding judge or magistrate. He will impress upon applicants the responsibilities as well as the privileges and benefits which will follow - from their new status. The old system, under which a man's naturalization papers came to him through the mail, like his annual-licence for his dog or his motor car, was most inappropriate. A man from a foreign country makes one of the greatest decisions of. his life when he decides to migrate to Australia. If he finds life here so satisfactory that he decides to become an Australian and to establish his family of new citizens here permanently, that is another of the great decisions of his life- a great and joyful decision. It should be marked by a solemn ceremony, an impressive occasion which he and his children will remember. He should not simply receive a paper that entitles him to certain new privileges. He should be made aware in warm, spoken language, of the responsibilities he is assuming, and officially welcomed as a New Australian. The Government now proposes that that shall be done, and that a matter affecting the whole of a man's, life and that of future generations of his family shall no longer be merely a piece of office routine. Another innovation so far as naturalisation in Australia is concerned, which has been included in the bill, is the provision that normally an alien wishing to become naturalized shall first make a declaration of intention. The reasons why this requirement has been adopted are set forth in the explanatory memorandum. No honourable member will, I think, deny that it is most desirable to formulate some method under which a common nationality will prevail throughout every part of the British Commonwealth, and that we should avoid, if at all possible, the situation that a person is recognized as a British national by one community and not by another. There are only two ways by which the conception of a common nationality can be achieved. One is by having a common code under which every member-nation of the British Commonwealth must legislate in the same way and practically at the same time. That method has been tried and found wanting. The second way is the concept under which the Government of each Commonwealth community shall decide for itself who are to be its citizens, and that the sum total of the citizens of the various members of the British Commonwealth shall ""have the common status of British subjects. The principle embodied in the latter conception is expressed in this bill. This legislation, which is similar to that already passed by the United Kingdom and New Zealand Governments or likely to be passed in future by other Commonwealth countries, is a logical development of the Statute of Westminster. That Statute created no new status, to the members of the British Commonwealth; it merely gave legal expression to an existing state of affairs, namely that the self-governing Dominions were free and independent nations, equal in status to the Mother Country within the boundaries of. an agreed Commonwealth of Nations. The statute has in no way weakened any of the ties between the various nations which comprise the British Commonwealth. In a similar fashion this bill, by fully and properly recognizing the individual identity of each Commonwealth community and at the same time preserving the status of a common nationality possessed by all' these people, will prove a binding and unifying factor between the various communities comprising the British Commonwealth. Incorporated in the Australian flag lithe Union Jack,' and similarly in this bill there is complete recognition of our close ties with the United Kingdom and the other countries of the British Commonwealth. Provision is made for us. while identifying ourselves as Australian citizens, to remain British subjects, and. having regard to legislation passed, or about to be passed, in other British countries, we must adopt this bill or Australia will be the only unidentified country from the point of view of citizenship in the British Commonwealth, and Australians the only members of the British family without a name of their own. When this bill becomes an act. it will be proclaimed on Australia Day, the 26th of January, 1949, and the occasion will be a memorable one. It will symbolizenot only our own pride in Australia, but also our willingness to offer a share in our future to the new Australians we are seeking in such vast numbers. These people are sure of a warm welcome to our shores.. They will no longer need to strive towards an intangible goal, but can aspire to the honour of Australian citizenship. They will be able to say, just as proudly as any of us, "" I am an Australian "". Perhaps those words will mean even more to those who remember life in less fortunate lands than to us who enjoy the freedom of plenty, the sunshine and social equality, of this great democracy. My aim, and that of the Government, is to make the word "" Australian "" mean all that it truly stands for ber of our community. We shall try to teach the children that they are fortunate to he British, and even more fortunate to be Australian. We want to emphasize the brief but glorious Australian history, in which so much has been accomplished so quickly, and to foster and encourage our young but vigorous traditions of mateship, co-operation, and a fair deal for everybody. Therefore, I commend this legislation to the House, deeply conscious that it marks yet another historic advance towards national greatness. This vast and virile country, which we are privileged to hold, and for the development of which we are responsible., can be made as great and noble a land as we, with our collective brains, muscles, war "". and devotion to a high* ideal, wish it to be. We owe that much to our forbears who pioneered this country, with few of life's amenities but with stout hearts and limitless courage. They opened its fertile plains, explored its rivers and won the bounty of its soil and the mineral treasures below. owe it, too, those who will come after us to develop the splendid heritage that is ours. We must hand it on to them untarnished. This bill is more than a cold, legalistic formula. It is a warm, pulsating document that enshrines the love of country of every genuine Australian.

Mr H0LL0WAY (Melbourne PortsMinister for Labour and National Serto every memvice) [9.15] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. One of the greatest tasks confronting the nation at this time is the maintenance of national health. One of the most serious diseases, and at the same time one of the most readily curable when found in its early stages, is tuberculosis. Contrary to the old belief, tuberculosis is not hereditary, but it is infectious and can strike any one, and at any age. The eradication of tuberculosis should concern every Australian citizen. The disease is difficult to control because in its early stages it gives little or no warning of its presence. It has been said very truly, in another place, and by a greater voico than mine, that "" Peace hath her victories, no less renowned than One of the greatest victories which we could achieve in this country would be to destroy or reduce, by combined action, the scourge of tuberculosis. This disease is as much the enemy of our people as is any military force which confronted We US in the recent war. However, it is an enemy that can be destroyed, or at least reduced to impotence, by means within the knowledge of the medical profession, and at hand. The measure now before the House is designed to enable battle to be joined with this enemy, to co-ordinate the forces available to the attack, and to bring all the efforts of governments and the medical profession to a close focus on the disease, so as to eradicate, or at least reduce it to minor proportions, in this generation. The bill seeks to initiate a campaign which will call for a high degree of co-operation from the people, their governments, State and National, organs of publicity, and the members of the medical profession. A high degree of co-operation and assistance has ""been forthcoming from ex-servicemen's organizations and other voluntary associations conducting sanatoriums in directing public attention to the need for a campaign against the disease. Their efforts have been a most valuable contribution to the education of the public, and it is hoped that this co-operation and support will continue and integrate with the wider campaign. think, and I am sure honourable members will agree with me, that the cause is a worthy one, and that the victory to be won will confer great and lasting benefit on this and succeeding generations of our people. Tuberculosis strikes at men and women in their most vigorous years, which is their most productive and reproductive period. It causes far more deaths among women of child-bearing age than all the risks of pregnancy combined. The incidence of the disease is highest among the young and active, who have their most useful years before them. Its attack is insidious, and frequently its presence is unsuspected until its ravages are so far advanced that the sufferer is doomed either to long years of incapacity or to early death. I am sure that many honourable members will recall among their acquaintances young and brilliant men and women who were first crippled, and then killed, by this disease, which, in Australia, is by far the greatest individual cause of death among men and women in the prime years of adult life, that is between the ages of 20 and 40 years. In 1946, the latest year for which details are available, tuberculosis was responsible for 27.6 per cent, of deaths from all major individual causes among people aged from 20 to 39 yeare. It caused more than twice as many deaths in this age group as did cancer and tumors, and exceeded by more than 50 per cent, the total of deaths from diseases of the heart and circulatory system among people of these ages. 'Since tuberculosis takes its large toll of adults in the prime of life the total mortality, measured in years of expected life lost, reaches very large proportions, and, even excluding all other aspects, this is a very serious economic loss to this country. Though the incidence of tuberculosis in Australia has shown a decline in cent years, and is in fact much less than in older settled countries, the disease remains one that takes a grievous toll in human suffering and distress, and in loss to the nation. The fall in the morbidity and mortality rates of tuberculosis may be related to the general rise in the standard of living, of nutrition and housing. In fact, an eminent doctor has sueeested that I when every one has enough room in which to live, enough to eat, and proper working conditions the incidence of tuberculosis will diminish to vanishing point. All governments in Australia are interesting themselves increasingly in the matter of housing. The Commonwealth is concerned also in the raising of nutrition standards, and there is increasing recognition of the need for improvement of factory and workshop conditions. The Commonwealth has recently approved the establishment of a Unit of Industrial Hygiene at the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney. I do suggest, however, and the Government recognizes, that we cannot afford to wait for the fall in mortality and morbidity rates brought about by improvements of living, housing and working conditions. There are still between 30,000 and 40,000 known sufferers from tuberculosis in Australia. There may be many thousands more unsuspected cases. The disease in some forms is highly infectious. Administration cannot, of itself, add one iota to medical knowledge, or suggest new solutions to medical problems, - but it can make known solutions effective. Known solutions exist for the problems of tuberculous infection. This Government, and the several State governments, recognize their duty to safeguard and protect the people from the dangers of tuberculous infection. Medical science needs the arsistance of governments to apply the measures of knowledge which can overcome tuberculosis in this country. Commonwealth entry into this field of health legislation is enabled by the amendment of section 51 of the Constitution authorized by the people at the referendum in September, 194.6, which confers power on the Commonwealth to legislate refor the provision of medical services. The hill gives authority to the Commonwealth to take measures for the prevention, treatment and control of tuberculosis. It gives legislative effect to a campaign for a bold, imaginative attack on the scourge of tuberculosis, aimed at reducing the disease to negligible proportions in the shortest possible time. The campaign against tuberculosis is planned largely along lines recommended by the Commonwealth Director of the Division of Tuberculosis, after a survey in all States. The plan has been drawn in consultation with all State Ministers of Health, and has been approved by the Premiers in conference at Canberra. The Commonwealth is rightly giving a lead in what is a national problem, to supplement and extend the efforts of the States. I repeat that the means of dealing with tuberculosis are already thrown. These require, in the first instance, the location of the infectious case, isolation and medical treatment, after carp nnd rehabilitation. There are, in addition, social implications. Too often patients restored to health by good treatment have been forced, perhaps by lack of opportunity, or because of financial difficulties, to return to the same conditions of living and of working as led to their breakdown in health in the first instance. The plan to be implemented under this measure ensures that after-care and rehabilitation shall he given the fullest consideration. Further, the measure provides for adequate financial assistance to sufferers and their dependants to remove the worry factor which in prolonged illness so often militates against recovery. The campaign against _ tuberculosis authorized by this measure is an example of Commonwealth-State co-operation and collaboration at its best, working on a uniform plan for the positive health of the people. The States will continue to administer, control and utilize their existing organizations and facilities, expanding them to provide adequately for growing needs. The Commonwealth will bear the cost, by reimbursement to the States, of all new approved capital expenditure of the States from the 1st July, 1948, for land and buildings, furnishings, equipment and plant for use in the diagnosis, treatment .and control of tuberculosis. Estimates of expenditure in this field alone, approach Mr Holloway. £500,000 for the current year. The Commonwealth will bear also the whole cost of maintenance expenditure of the States approved by the Commonwealth in excess of the net maintenance expenditure in curred by the States in diagnosis, treatment and control of tuberculosis in th>.financial year 1947-48. The Commonwealth has established » Division of Tuberculosis in the Department of Health and will assist the Stateswith medical and technical advice on the highest level to co-ordinate their activities and to shape the policy to be followed in all aspects of the campaign It is recognized that there is need to encourage more people in the medical and nursing professions to undertake training in the treatment and care of patientssuffering from tuberculosis. It - bnecessary also to overcome the fear of the disease which is at present a very real factor in reluctance by some to undertake this work. The Commonwealth will encourage the establishment of thoracic wings attached to teaching hospitals, foj the investigation and treatment of diseases of the chest, including tuberculosis. Medical students and trainet nurses will thus secure training in tht early diagnosis of the disease, familiarity with its treatment, - and experience in the care of patients suffering from tuberculosis. In addition, the bill provide* that the Commonwealth may pay subsidies to universities or other institution""to promote and assist investigation and research, and to develop courses of training in branches of medical science relating to tuberculosis problems. TheDirector-General of Health is empowered by the bill, subject to the direction of the Minister, to conduct, assist and provide for research, investigations, experiments, studies and training in relation to the detection and diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the treatment and after-care of sufferers from the disease. He may also arrange for the provision of scholarships for the post-graduate study of tuberculosis. I have mentioned the social implications of the disease. There is a very real need for measures to educate the public about the means to combat the spread of tuberculosis and the value of early diagnosis and treatment. There is need in this way to destroy the fear of the disease and to overcome the reluctance of some people to undergo radiological examination. A big step towards achieve- ment of these aims can be taken if the sufferer or the suspected sufferer can be assured that he and his family or dependants will be relieved of financial worry during the period of his treatment and rehabilitation. The Commonwealth has for some years set aside for the States a sum of £250,000 annually for this purpose. It is proposed to continue this assistance and extend it to whatever degree is found to be necessary. Payments will be made to sufferers and their dependants, to encourage sufferers to refrain from working and to undergo treatment, to minimize the spread of the disease and to promote the treatment, after-care and rehabilitation of sufferers, [t is essential that people who suspect that they have tuberculosis should be encouraged by positive measures to overcome their fear of the disease and to seek examination and early treatment, secure in the knowledge that those in their care will be looked after and provided for. The bill empowers the Director General, subject to the direction of the Minister, to provide facilities for the examination of sufferers or suspected sufferers, for the medical care of sufferers, and for their after-care and rehabilitation. The Director-General is also empowered to take steps for the establishment of hospitals, sanatoriums, laboratories, diagnostic centres, after-care, radiological and other units and clinics for the diagnosis, treatment and control of tuberculosis. The bill makes provision for the setting up of an advisory council. This body, which will he representative of both State and Commonwealth interests, will include in its membership experts in the field of tuberculosis throughout the Commonwealth. The functions of this council are set out in the bill. Primarily, the council will advise the Minister on measures to be adopted to prevent and control tuberculosis, on 3tandar<h of equipment and apparatus, standards of training of personnel, and standards of hospitals and sanatoriums. It will be noted that, because of doubt as to Commonwealth power, the bill makes no provision for the compulsory radiological or other examination of the public., nor does it attempt to make provision for the 'restraint of' recalcitrant infectious patients, or for the compulsory treatment of persons suffering from tuberculosis. These aspects, however, have not been overlooked, and the State* have asked the Commonwealth to prepare model legislation dealing with these matters for consideration by State governments where provision does not already exist in State law. The campaign against tuberculosis provides for radiological and bacteriological examination to locate infected and infectious cases; for increased accommodation for sufferers and staff to care for them; for financial assistance to sufferers and their dependants; for after-care and rehabilitation of sufferers: and for research and ' development in methods of diagnosis, - treatment and control of tuberculosis. As in the military field, so in this, attack is the best means of defence. The measure* planned in this campaign are designed, not only to find and treat cases of tuberculosis, but also to safeguard healthy persons from infection, incapacity and death. With full implementation of the techniques of case-finding through radiological and other surveys, this protection will extend throughout the community, safeguarding Australians yet unborn. Expenditure under the bill will be borne by the National Welfare Fund, established under the National Welfare Fund Act 1943-1945, except that expenditure of a capital nature on buildings, plant, equipment and furnishings, together with administrative costs, will be met from moneys appropriated by the Parliament from time to time. The mere passing of legislation by this or any other parliament will not achieve a miraculous reduction of the incidence of tuberculosis. However, the campaign upon which we are now embarking can, with 'the co-operation of the public, the State governments and the medical profession, do much to improve the present position. The bill represents a contribution by the governments of Australia to positive health in the community. I feel sure that honourable members will endorse the Government's action in initiating these proposals. Debate (on motion by Mr HARRISON 1 adjourned. ESTIMATES 1948-49. In Committe of Supply: Consideration resumed (vide page 1052). PRIME MINISTER'S DEPARTMENT. Proposed vote, £2,878,400. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [9.35]. - This is ft man's country, and if any one here should doubt the truth of that statement let him look around this chamber at the moment. My sex is represented by two members only. As a matter of fact, we have 100 per cent, attendance at the moment, while the other sex is not so strongly represented, at any rate on the Government side of the chamber. For further proof of the truth of my statement that this is a man's world, let any one look at the constitution of our municipal councils and business firms. Let him consider our wages system, and, finally, let him look at any crowded tram car. Recently, I heard a woman say that she had had practical proof that the age of chivalry was not dead. ""When she ffill in attempting to board a tram car, the men behind stepped over her. They courteously refrained from treading on her. However, things are improving. Men no longer entirely dominate the scene, and women no longer accept without question that male notion of the inferiority of women. I am delighted that the Canberra Association of Women Graduates is attempting to remove some of the disabilities under .which women labour, as was mentioned by the honourable member for - Bourke (Mrs Blackburn) this afternoon. Some time ago, I was told that women were not eligible for appointment to permanent positions in the Commonwealth Public Service. 1 doubted the truth of this, and wrote for information to the Secretary of the Public Service Board, who replied as follows:In reply to your letter of 13tli July, 1948, I desire to advise that it is not a fact that women are not eligible for permanent appointment to the Commonwealth Public Service. Their permanent appointment is restricted, however, to the types of positions which are regarded as appropriate to occupancy by females, e.g., Librarian, Dietitian, Welfare Officer, Typist, Machinist, Office Assistant, Telephonist, &c. Permanent appointments to positions of Clerk and to positions of a professional of technical nature are restricted to males.",60
192,Mr BARNARD,NATIONALITY AND,The honourable member might add post-hole digging to the list. Women are not restricted as regards thai activity.,64
193,Dame ENID LYONS,NATIONALITY AND,"No , and 1 could show the Minister for Repatriation f Mr Barnard) where women are, in fact, digging post-holes. Indeed, I believe that if the Minister and I were to have a contest at digging post-hole.» 1 would not be a had second. I am anxious to know who decides what appointments are suitable for females, and on what grounds certain of the positions in the list were selected. What is it, for instance, that constitutes the particular adaptability of a female to the office of librarian? Has she any superior ability in the mounting of a step-ladder ? On the other hand, is it, perhaps, that she has a nicer literary discrimination than men have? Just why in the world a female should be regarded as a better librarian than a male, but inferior as a clerk, I cannot understand. Discrimination of this sort against a female if similar to that which, in the United States of America, is exercised against negroes. I propore to read part of a letter addressed by the women graduate? of Canberra to the Public Service Board seeking the removal of certain anomalies. The letter is divided into four parts, and particular emphasis is laid upon that section which deals with the position of librarians. One paragraph in the letteT from the Canberra Association of Women Graduates to the Public Service Board readsWe consider that the employment of women - should be placed on such a basis that their training and education may be utilized to the best advantage and opportunities for advancement opened freely to them. Under the heading relating to salaries of departmental librarians, the following is stated:We understand that the position of departmental librarian is open to women graduate? only. In addition to holding a University degree and I direct the attention of honourable members particularly to this portionappointees are recommended to take an approved course in librarianship of six to twelve months' duration. It appears, therefore, that each candidate for such a position has to undergo a qualifying minimum of thrae to four years' professional training. The position of Assistant Librarian (F . ) , range £9G-£298 (S.), is open to both graduates and non-graduates. A p p are n t l y the assistant l i b r a r i a n m a y be a person who has had to undergo no p a r t i c u l a r t r a in in g at all . The letter continues The present salary range of the position ->f Librarian is- £238-£3U4 (S.) per annum, with no prospect of advancement beyond the maximum of the range which is only £6 higher than that of Assistant Librarian. S e t t in g aside the comparison of the two positions, t h is is in keeping, l a r g e l y , with the general type of development that is t a k in g place today. No r e c o g n it i o n of a d d it i o n a l s k ill is granted. fair , at this stage, that I should read the p o r t i on of the letter from the Secretary of the P u b l i c Service B o a r d , r e l at in g to the salary range, w h i c h is as f o l l o w s : SALARIES OF LIBRARIANS . In regard to your statement that the margin between the maxima of the salary ranges of the positions of Assistant Librarian and Librarian is only £0, it might be pointed out that this is not quite correct. The difference on standard salaries is only £30, but whereas the occupant of the position of Assistant Librarian is not entitled to payment of "" marginal allowance"", the occupant of a position of Librarian is entitled to such an allowance. The actual difference in salary at the maximum of the two positions is £51 per annum as shown hereunder:A f t e r setting out the table, the letter continued The Board has noted your statement of the rates paid to Librarians employed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the Parliament, but could not agree that because these rates are paid by these bodies, Public Service rates should be increased correspondingly. Bates in the Public Service must, of necessity, be fitted into the whole structure of Public Service clasifications, and the board can see no reason for their variation as proposed by your Association. The letter then deals with the e n try of women into"" the T h i r d D i v is i o n of the P u b l i c Service, w h i c h is the clerical d i v i sion, as I understand it . I shall now read another extract from the women graduates' letter, from w h i c h honourable members will g a in a l it t l e more detai l in regard to the p o s it i o n of women, that will give them f o od for t h o u g h t There appears to be no reason under the Public Service Act why girls as well as boys should not be permitted to take the competitive examination for entry into the Third Division. We draw attention to a statement on page 13 of the 23rd Annual Beport of the Commonwealth Public Service (1948) that "" the number of lads seeking employment in the Third as well as the Fourth Division falls very much below the needs of the Departments, resulting in unbalanced staff establishments While we do not suggest that the difficulties of finding junior staff to "" do the simpler and more routine tasks of the Third and Fourth Division"" would be solved by the recruitment of women, we do urge that girls be permitted to sit for the examination for entry to the Third Division if they so desire, and be appointed on a competitive basis to such vacancies as occur annually, and that women seeking entry to the Public Service under section 30A as graduates should not be debarred from permanent appointment by reason of .sex. It is o n l y The p o s it i o n in Great B r it a in is then mentioned. I r e m in d the House that the B r it is h C i v i l Service is regarded as one of the finest in the whole w o r l d . That service has at r a d it i o n that is beyond reproach, and women have been appointed to most exalted positions in it . The table shows that, in the a d m in is t r at i v e section of the B r it is h C i v i l Service there are 3,718 men and 567 women. The corresponding section of the C o m m o n wealt h P u b l i c Service is completely closed to women. In Great B r it a in there are women heads of departments w h i c h make the departments here look completely p u n y and r e l at i v e l y u n i m p o r t a n t . In the executive section of the B r it is h C i v i l Service there are 40,030 men, and 10,273 women. B y contrast with the large p r o p o r t i o n of women in the B r it is h C i v i l Service, of 14,079 p e r m a n e nt employees in the T h i r d D i v is i o n of the C o m m o n w e a l t h P u b l i c Service at the 3 0 th June , 1947, o n l y 65 were women. The letter continuesWe strongly urge, therefore, that women be encouraged to seek entry to the Third Division. The reply from the Secretary of the P u b l i c Service B o a r d to that very convincing statement by the women graduates readsIn some special cases women may be employed in Third Division positions of a professional or c iiripal nil turn. This occurs when ! the positions concerned are of a type which may be filed by women more appropriately than men, - as, for instance, Librarians. Generally, however, females not "" women "" t h is time are not employed in administrative, professional or clerical, positions. Thosedfflcdrs who are. employed in clerical or professional positions may advance by way i>f promotion to the highest administrative positions in the Service, and, in fact, the source of recruitment of senior administrative officers is from those officers who have filled clerical or professional positions. In these cases, therefore, continuity of experience in the Public Service is regarded as essential, and for this reason the cmplo3'ment of females in clerical or professional positions is regarded as undesirable. The Commonwealth Public Service Act forbids the employment of married women unless in a particular case there are special circumstances which would, from the point of view of the Service, warrant employment of a married woman. The predominant marrying age of women in Australia is twenty-four years and in view of this, and the embargo on the employment of married women, it is obvious that there would, of necessity, be a fairly large turnover of officers in clerical imd professional positions if females were freely employed in such positions. As stated above, continuity of service in these positionsis desirable, and this could not be obtained if women were employed therein. Honourable members may be interested to hear that six members of the library staffs are about to marry, and that is causing considerable commotion among the staffs concerned. The third point raisedconcerns the temporary employment of women in permanent positions. The women graduates, in their letter, said, Some of our members have complained they have been given temporary employment in permanent positions for which they have keep . them healthily engaged. npplied, no reason, except that of sex, being advanced for such/action. We feel that this policy is not in the best interests of women, particularly graduates. Although we recogremind nize that there are possibly good reasons making temporary appointments (both and female) to permanent positions and that in cases, for example, of inability to standards of health demanded, it is desirable to oiler temporary employment, we recommend that if a woman applicant for a permanent position is considered to satisfy educational, medical and other requirements of the tion, she .should be appointed permanently after serving a satisfactory probationary period. The board replied to that as follows:Referring to your representations regarding the temporary employment of women in permanent positions, it might he pointed out that it is not always possible to obtain, immediately, the services of a suitably fied male. In such circumstances, a female may be employed temporarily in the position' until the services of a suitable male can secured but for the reasons stated above, the Board could not agree to the permanent an'nnintmentof women to .positions of nature. Dame Enid Lyons. W it h regard to the final point, the employment of married women, the honourable member for Bourke hasmentioned that in New South Wales and Great B r it a in the disqualification of a woman for service on the ground of marriage has already been removed. B u i on this point the Public Service Board saysApart from other considerations, it is noi considered that Australian conditions are such that the employment of married women would be advisable from a. social viewpoint. I should imagine that no one in Australia would regard me as holding marriage lightly. Indeed, I am a champion of marriage. I know of no institution which can bring greater happiness and I believe that all our laws and customs should be directed towards the maintenance of that institution on a stable basis. Nevertheless, I say that in the circumstances which obtain today the debarring of. married women from any service of a permanent nature or, indeed, from any employment with in the Public Service, except under extraordinary conditions, is a very foolish practice indeed. There are many women who are childless and must of necessity remain childless that whose marriage, therefore, is not likely to offer them sufficient employment to Such women should not he debarred from entering a service for which they are fitted. I the committee that during the war for no bar was placed upon, the service that male was accepted from women - The bar satisfy that now exists should be removed. There will always be in Australia a far greater proportion of married women who will remain in their posihomes because of work which they have to do in their homes than will accept work outside. At the same time there w i ll always be great numbers whose qualifications are such that they can give even greater service after marriage than before. I mention for instance the teaching profession, although qualimy point in that respect does not annly so much in the Commonwealth sphere as be in the State sphere. A married teacher who, herself, has children is a particularly suitable person to carry on the education this of .children. The Government, which is composed of a party which for many years has included in its platform the principle of equality for men and women in all spheres of citizenship, should he the very last to maintain the disabilities under which women work in the Commonwealth Public Service. I remind honourable members that on a previous occasion I had reason to draw the attention of the Government to certain press advertisements of positions at a certain salary for male applicants and a lower salary for female applicants although the qualifications demanded in each instance were very high and they were completely equal. I commend to the Government the respresentations placed before them by the Canberra Association of Women Graduates; and I congratulate those women upon the action they have taken in this matter.",64
194,Mr HOLLO WAY,NATIONALITY AND,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Service) [9.55] - I wish to refer to an incident which occurred in the champleasant at certain times. ber just prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner. honourable member for Barker (Mr He Archie Cameron) said that the incident caused some extremely tense moments and was practically unprecedented in experience in the Parliament. I , too, that they were intense moments. Many things happened then which must tend to discredit the Parliament. When the committee commenced its consideration of estimates for the Prime Minister's Department, honourable members opposite seized the opportunity to re-open an sore to renew an attack upon the Minisduced. ter for Defence (Mr Dedman). Why they did so, I do not know; but in makby ing that attack they made statements for which, I believe, all honourable members will be sorry when we read reports that discussion in the newspapers. For instance, the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) did somecommittee thing which I had not known him previously. Although I have known him at times to be almost reckless, I had not previously heard him call another able member,, without any qualification, a liar.",67
195,Mr HARRJRON,NATIONALITY AND,The Minister deliberately told a lie.,67
196,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,The - honourable member's language was so reckless and unparliamentary that he was called upon to withdraw. He did so; hut almost immediately afterwards the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) repeated the offence by deliberately calling the Minister a liar.,67
197,Mr FADDEN,NATIONALITY AND,I did no such thing: have another try.,67
198,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"The right honourable gentleman charged the Minister with having deliberately made a lying statement, and when he was asked to withdraw he did so; but. at the same time, he said, "" All right, if you do not like 'lying statement ' I will make it, ' a Dedman statement ' "" . I believe that both the Acting Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party will agree tomorrow in a cooler atmosphere - that their statements were very nasty.",67
199,Mr MCBRIDE,NATIONALITY AND,The truth' is un,67
200,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"The honourable The member should withdraw that: statement. is practically calling the Minister for Defence a liar again. I know that the honourable member himself would not like his to be charged with calling another felt honourable member a liar; but in making that interjection he is practically doing so. In addition, honourable members opposite in making their attacks brought under fire Sir David Eivett, who is Australian born and is one of the finesi and ablest men as well as one of the old greatest scientists Australia has proHe is admired and respected for his ability and for his moral character the people of this country as a whole. His name was brought into the discussion in a nasty way and such things were of said about him that I should not be surprised if he considered resigning his position as chairman of the executive of the Council for Scientific to do and Industrial Research.",67
201,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATIONALITY AND,"That would be honora "" darn "" good thing.",67
202,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,The honourable member is a minority of one when he expresses that opinion.,67
203,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATIONALITY AND,That may be. but the-minority is sometimes right: ,67
204,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"Every one is aware of the remarkable job which the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research did during the recent war. It helped Australia to find substitutes for materials which we could not obtain from any other part of the world. It did all - kinds of things to help our war effort, and it is now doing a magnificent job in helping our primary and secondary industries. It is one of the most profitable institutions ever established in this country. To bring it under fire in a debate-if one could call it a debate; it was more like a "" two-up school""",68
205,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,The Minister ought to be an authority on that.,68
206,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"It is cold outside, and I would not advise the honourable member' for New England to have himself put out again.",68
207,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,"Stic k to your "" spielers "".",68
208,Mr SCULLY,NATIONALITY AND,Withdraw !,68
209,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,"I did not name spielers "".",68
210,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"Ha d any well balanced man said that, I should have asked for its withdrawal, but the honourable member does not cut any ice. The incident in this chamber this afternoon was a very sad one. The word "" l i a r "" was bandied about, and men's reputations were besmirched. The honourable member for New England made a very nasty remark, which I resent strongly, hut unfortunately, the attention of the Chairman was not drawn to it. He suggested that the Minister for Defence left the chamber in order to confer with the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) so that the Prime Minister would not afterwards come in and contradict anything that he had said. That was a rotten thing for the honourable member to say. In my opinion, the honourable member for New England is not fit, morally or in any other way, to clean the Prime Minister's boots. I resent the suggestion that the Prime Minister would lower himself by conniving with anybody to support some statement that he did not believe to be right. Nobody in Australia but the honourable member for New England would suggest such a thing. I think honourable members ought to think seriously about the nature of these accusations and imputations. Such incidents are unusual. 1I have been a member of this Parliament for about seventeen years, but never before have I known the leaders of two parties in opposition to swallow their words after deliberately calling another honourable gentleman a liar.",68
211,Mr FADDEN,NATIONALITY AND,I did not call the Minister for Defence a liar. The honourable gentleman ought to stick to the truth.,68
212,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"If I were to say that the Leader of the Australian Country party was deliberately making a lying statement, he would ask me to withdraw the remark.",68
213,Mr FADDEN,NATIONALITY AND,"I did not call him a liar, although I might have thought it.",68
214,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"During recent weeks, a great deal of attention has been paid to the subject of defence. I believe that 90 per cent, of honourable members opposite have been quite sincere in expressing dissatisfaction with the Governany ment's defence plans and have asked for information about them in all seriousness. However, when the defence work being carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research^ came under consideration this afternoon, they almost turned the matter into a joke. They ridiculed matters about which, earlier in the week, they had expressed grave concern. I cannot understand why they chop and change in this way. One honourable member attacked Sir David Rivett, the Chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, because he had told a scientific gathering that he deplored the tendency not to treat scientific research as being international in character. I have been associated with scientific groups for many years, and was particularly interested in their work in my youth. I have attended the discussions of many such bodies, and I took part in numerous meetings of the Universal Union on Saturday afternoons and evenings. I have heard Professor Oliphant and other eminent scientists and scholars declare that investigations of the commercial potentialities of atomic power have been in progress for the past 20 or 30 years. Such men have often said that; science, like music, is essentially international in character. I presided over a meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall at which the people of Melbourne welcomed delegates to the first international science congress held in Australia. Amongst other projects, the visiting scientists engaged in making an international map of the zodiac. Representatives of various countries had been allotted zones to chart, and they were engaged in completing the task as an international undertaking. Sir David Rivett was speaking on those lines when he made the statement to which the honourable member for Barker objected. The honourable member suggested, quite wrongly, that it was not nice to say that scientific studies should be carried out on an international basis. All scientific men make declarations like that from time to time. Mr FALKINDEB, - Did Sir Rivett's statement refer to the study of Atomic energy?",68
215,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"Yes , energy was included. But how do we know what he had in mind?",69
216,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,He said what he had in mind.,69
217,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,He was talking about the use of atomic energy for commercial purposes.,69
218,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,He was not.,69
219,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,I do not think the honourable member means what he says.,69
220,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,We have the evidence of the report.,69
221,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,I am certain that the honourable member would not suggest that Sir David Rivett would do or say anything which would endanger defence secrets that we hold in Australia.,69
222,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,Does the Minister want to know what I suggest ?,69
223,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,Yes . I do not want to misquote the honourable member.,69
224,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,But if I break into the honourable gentleman's speech the Temporary Chairman will rule me out of order.,69
225,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"It is only right and proper that I should defend the character of a man who has been more or less maligned this afternoon. I know him, and I knew his father well. He is a good Australian and one of the finest men in this country. Everybody knows that, had he so wished, Sir David Rivett could have obtained for himself many more honours than has been conferred were upon him. Yet honourable members brought his name down almost into the gutter this afternoon!",69
226,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,Has the Minister read the report of his address?,69
227,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"No , but I have heard a great deal about it and I know the sort of address that he gives. Knowing the man, I am confident that he could not have suggested such things as honourable members opposite assert. When Professor Oliphant returned to Australia, I had the privilege of hearing his report to Cabinet on the subject of nuclear physics. I also heard him lecture about David it publicly. He said that scientists had known about atomic energy for 20 or 30 years, but had not hastened their experiatomic ments because they were destined for commercial use. Research work was not speeded up until, during the war, somebody suddenly . suggested that atomic power might be harnessed for the purposes of war. That brought the matter to a head. For 30 years, scientists have known as much about the commercial uses of atomic energy as they know now. But the oil companies and other profit-making organizations were not anxious to encourage this development. However, as soon as it was suggested that atomic energy could be harnessed for war purposes, everybody became excited and experiments in the production of atom bombs were hurried forward. 'Some countries may have more information than others about this subject. I do not know, and the honourable member for New England does not know. In any case, I am sure that any information in the possession of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is as safe as it would be in the hands of scientists in any other country. While Sir David Rivett is in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, I am certain that the Australian people will be confident that there will be no leakages of atomic secrets. The Leader of the Australian Country party quoted from a confidential document, which is not available to other honourable members. I do not say this in a nasty way, but I point put that the right honourable gentleman said deliberately, "" This is a confidential ment, and therefore it cannot be tabled in the Parliament"". When he read the statement from that confidential document, he implied that some other person was the source of the leakage of information-som e one who was disloyal and was giving away secrets. He read from a confidential document which had come to him in an almost criminal way and contained information that neither the right honourable gentleman nor any one of us had any right to possess.",69
228,Mr HAERISON,NATIONALITY AND,Is this a hush-hush policy?,70
229,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,Why has the Leader of the Australian Country party refused to lay the document on the table ?,70
230,Mr FADDEN,NATIONALITY AND,"If I am permitted to read the whole of the document, I shall lay it on the table. I was very generous to the Government.",70
231,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,That is a fair offer.,70
232,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,I am not concerned whether the Leader of the Australian Country party reads the document or not.,70
233,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,The Minister may be concerned after the document has been read.,70
234,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"Not at all. If tihe document is genuine, it does not conrain anything which will upset me.",70
235,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,I am not so sure of that. Why is the Minister upset about the whole matter?,70
236,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,I was merely pointing out that the Leader of the Australian Country party read a passage from a confidential document. The inference which honourable members must draw is that someone else was responsible for a leakage of secrets. The Leader of the Australian Country party read something which was obtained from some disloyal and traitorous person inside,70
237,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,Like the Minister for Defence.,70
238,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,The Leader of the Australian Country party must have obtained the document from some traitorous individual.,70
239,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,Does the Minister redocu- call the Winkler case?,70
240,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"-When members of the Opposition have no effective reply, they immediately drag in another subject.",70
241,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,This is like Satan reproving sin.,70
242,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NATIONALITY AND, Order ! Some honourable members will be winking at the stars if they continue to interject. The Minister must be heard in silence.,70
243,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONALITY AND,"Some person must be responsible for the leakage of the information possessed by the Leader of the Australian Country party. The charges which the right honourable gentleman has made are based on information which some person supplied to him. The person who gave that confidential document to him was just as big a traitor as, or an even bigger traitor than, any other person who may be a source of a leakage of information. It is most regrettable that this incident has occurred. The Acting Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party have told lies in this chamber and have behaved in a most undignified way. If any other honourable member had made such statements, probably less notice would have been taken of them. But when the Acting Leader of the Liberal party and the Leader of the Australian Country party resort to the tactics of a guttersnipe, it is bad for the honour of this Parliament.",70
244,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,"Wentworth-Actin g Leader of the Opposition) [10.13] Before the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) attempts to chide members of the Opposition, he should get his facts straight about the Minister for Defence (Mr. Dedman). The Minister for Labour and National Service, who adopted a ""holier than thou "" attitude, has referred to communism as being Christ-like in its ideals. The document from which the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) read some extracts revealed that the Minister for Defence had lied to this chamber today, but the Minister for Labour and National Service attempted to change the whole situation by .saying that the incident was due entirely .to.some traitorous aot. I recall that the Labour party, when in opposition, took advantage of a man who .had been formerly .given an assignment by the Menzies Government and used him, by a display of secret documents, to bring charges .against Ministers.",70
245,Mr WARD,NATIONALITY AND,To whom does the Acting leader of the Opposition refer?,71
246,Mr HARRIS ON,NATIONALITY AND,"I refer to Winkler. The Minister for Labour and' National Service is familiar with that case because he was a member of the executive of the then Opposition which condoned the action. As he has chosen to refer to confidential documents, I shall follow suit by referring to a document relating to the appointment of His Majesty's Australian Minister at Washington, the Right Honourable R. G. Casey, in which the whole of the secret and confidential cables which passed between Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr Casey, and the late Mr John Curtin and Mr. Casey, and others, were printed and discussed. I warn the Minister that a "" holier than thou "" attitude will not get him anywhere in the present discussion.",71
247,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NATIONALITY AND,Order! The Acting Leader of the Opposition must connect his remarks with the proposed vote.,71
248,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,"I shall do so. The Minister for Labour and National Service criticized some observations which I directed to the Minister for Defence after he had reflected on my personal integrity. The Minister for Defence knows that I have repeatedly refuted that allegation by personal explanation in this chamber, but because he was stumped for an answer and was losing the argument, he repeated it. I told him that he was lying, and the Minister for Labour and National Service has taken me to task for making that statement in my own defence. I propose to show precisely how the Minister for Defence has gained his reputation. When I commenced this debate this afternoon, I directed the attention of the Minister to reports that the United States of America was reluctant to make available to Australia information dealing with atomic and other high defence matters, because of a fear that there would be a leakage to Russia through Australian Communists. I remarked that I had noticed that, in the Estimates, provision had been made for nuclear investigation, and I expressed the opinion that the facts called for an explanation as to how far the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was involved in atomic investigation and high defence secrets. ] considered that the Minister should make that explanation so that the Parliament .should know the facts. The Minister replied that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was not concerned with secret defence measures. But the Minister for Labour and National Service has told us that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is concerned with defence secrets. I suggest that both Ministers should get together and clarify their minds about the position. Either the Minister for Defence is right or the Minister for Labour and National Service is right, but both of them cannot be right. Immediately 1 resumed my seat, the Minister for Defence rose with a display of righteous indignation, and told me that the report that the United States of America had refused to permit atomic information to be made available to Australia was false. He then engaged in a lengthy dissertation to prove that the report was party-political propaganda, in which the press and the Opposition had indulged. Indeed, he said that the press and the Opposition had combined in this way to do a great disservice to Australia. When the Minister resumed his seat, the Leader of the Australian Country party asked him to confirm or deny a few matters. Eirst, he sought some information about persons who were present at a meeting at Downing-street, London, on the 8th July at 11.30 a.m. He failed to draw attention to the fact that the British Prime Minister, Mr Attlee, was in the chair, and that the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, was in attendance. Others present were Mr Herbert Morrison. Lord President of the Council; Sir Stafford Cripps, Chancellor of the Exchequer; Mr J. H . Wilson, President  Baker, Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations; Mr John Strachey. Minister for Food; Mr Ernest Bevin, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs: Viscount Addison, Lord Privy Seal; Dr Hugh Dalton, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; and G. R. Strauss, Minister of Supply. Officers of the Secretariat who were present were Sir Norman Brook, Mr S. E. V. Luke, Mr R. J. P. riewison and Mr N . E. Costar. I shall read one extract from that document to prove how the Minister for Defence sought to mislead this chamber and the country when he said that the American authorities were not reluctant to communicate to Australia certain secret information on atomic energy. Facts are facts, and if this statement is not correct, let the Prime Minister deny it. The extract reads as follows:Mr Attlee asked whether there were any specific questions which Mr Chifley would like to discuss with Ministers generally or individually during the course of his stay in this country, and Mr Chifley stated there were four other points that he would like to take up. He understood that the United States authorities were reluctant to communicate to Australia certain special secret information about the proaress of research and development of atomic energy. The Prime Minister is in a position to say whether or not that is a correct record. If it is correct, then the Minister for Defence deliberately attempted to mislead the committee by the statement that he made.",71
249,Mr THOMPSON,NATIONALITY AND,The honourable member should be careful that he does not sell the country with his statements.,72
250,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,"Honourable members on this side of the chamber have said something about Rudkin, who was employed in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, even though he had been convicted for selling information. We know that Mountjoy, whose brother is a Communist, was appointed to the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. We know that Makinson, a senior lecturer in physics at Sydney University, who was formerly employed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, is now the chairman of the scientific body of the Communist party. Who is selling this country? It is certainly not the Opposition. If the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) wants to indulge in an argument about who is selling the country, honourable members on this side of the chamber will be' happy to accommodate him. His interjection,, however, was merely designed to prevent, me from continuing with what I wished to say. The extract continuesMr Chifley stated that he was most anxious to remove any impediments to the free exchange of secret information about atomic energy developments between the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and he was prepared to make any reasonable adjustments which might be necessary for this purpose in the constitution of the scientific organizations serving the Australian Government in this matter. If that is a correct record, what did the right honourable gentleman mean? He meant that he would take steps to make alterations within the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in order to ally the suspicion that existed in the minds of the governments of the countries which refused to give secret information to Australia because they feared a leakage to Soviet Russia. That is the only interpretation that can be placed upon it. I was not aware that such a paper existed until I opened the debate on this item. I am certain that this paper would never have seen the light of day if the Minister had been frank with the committee and had not sought to mislead it and the country in his usual manner. His statement was only one of a succession of mis-statements. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) has had to take the honourable gentleman to task before. When the Minister's attention has been drawn to quotations that he has made from documents, he has thereupon claimed that they are confidential and has refused to table them. That course of action has forced the Opposition to reveal his failure to comply with the ordinary decencies in this chamber. I do not propose to allow any Minister to chide me about having made allegations against the veracity of another Minister when the Minister himself has provoked me into doing so by making what he knew to be a lying statement.",72
251,Mr CONELAN,NATIONALITY AND,I rise to order. The Acting Leader of the Opposition has accused the Minister for Defence (Mr. Dedman) of making a lying statement. I ask that the words be withdrawn.,72
252,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NATIONALITY AND," The expression that was used by the Acting Leader of the Opposition was an unparliamentary one, and I ask him to withdraw it.",72
253,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,"In deference to your request, sir, and the niceties of parliamentary debate, I withdraw the expression "" lying statement"" and substitute for it the expression "" untrue statement "". If the document from which I have quoted is a true one, it proves what [ have said about the Minister. If it is false, then some one should say so. ""When the Leader of the Australian Country party read the extract to which I have just referred and another one setting out what was said by the Minister to. the executive of the Council for Scientific and [ndustrial Research, the Minister was asked to confirm or deny them. He said, that he would neither confirm nor deny them. If the Prime Minister's visit to England was forced upon him by circumstances such as those to which I have referred; if it was necessary for the right honourable gentleman to go there hot-foot to take up the question of why no defence secrets were being communicated to Australia ; and if in conference he said what it is alleged that he said, then, having gard to the fact that a high official from the United Kindgom came to Australia to investigate our security services and reported that conditions were not what they should be.",73
254,Mr CALWELL,NATIONALITY AND,How does the honourable member know that?,73
255,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,"I only want to know what action has been taken. I do not know of any, nor do I know of any tightening-up process. The only thing that I know with regard to it is that certain charges have been made. They have not been made by me, but have come from a responsible source. The Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence must either refute them or accept them.",73
256,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.28] - I was not in the chamber during a portion of this debate, but I have gleaned from members who were present the substance of some of the statements that were made. As a responsible Minister of the Crown, f say that I do not think members of the Opposition could have done anything more disgraceful than to make some of the statements that I have been told they did make. I am informed that the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) quoted an extract from what was said to be a report of a meeting of the British Cabinet.",73
257,Mr FADDEN,NATIONALITY AND,I did no such thing.,73
258,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"Fro m the report of a meeting that took place in Downingstreet. The Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) mentioned the names of the persons who were alleged to be present. They constitute, in effect, the inner Cabinet of the British Government. It is a disgraceful state of affairs if honourable members who have'held ministerial office and have been sworn to secrecy resort to illicit methods in an attempt to obtain a record of what was, in effect, a British Cabinet meeting, because the only meetings that I attended in the United Kingdom were meetings of the British Cabinet. It is a sad commentary upon the morality of persons who have been Ministers of the Crown, and presumably have some regard for the principle of cabinet secrecy, that they are re-1 prepared to quote from a document containing a record of what is alleged to be a British Cabinet meeting and which has been purloined from some source. We have indeed fallen very low in Australian politics if the Opposition proposes to adopt those tactics. The Acting Leader of the Opposition referred to research, into atomic energy. I did not discuss that subject in England. It was never the subject of discussion, because I knew the precise position in regard to atomic research. Secondly, I had no intention to discuss that subject with the British Prime Minister, any Minister of that British Cabinet, or anybody else when I went to England. Such a discussion was not one of the purposes of my mission to the United Kingdom. My mission was to deal with purely economic subjects. It is true that while I was in the United Kingdom I had an opportunity to hear from British Ministers who were competent to express opinions on current world affairs, views on the international situation as they saw it ; but I did not go to Great Britain to discuss leakages of information from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, or any other matter of that kind. On the information at my disposal at that time, I should not have gone even as far as Adelaide to discuss such matters. The suggestion that I discussed atomic research secrets is sheer bunkum. It is a complete lie on the part of anybody who presumes to say so. There is nothing to be discussed about atomic research, and that subject has never been discussed between this' country and the United Kingdom.",73
259,Mr HUTCHINSON,NATIONALITY AND,"Does the honourable gentleman say that he never discussed defence, in spite of the deteriorenergy ating world situation?",74
260,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"As I have said, I discussed international affairs with British Ministers, both individually and collectively. I certainly do not propose now, as a public man, to be so indecent as to embark upon an open discussion of matters which were considered at meetings which I , as the Prime Minister of this country, had with Ministers of the British Cabinet. I do not propose to descend so low as to endeavour to ssore one or two political points in that way. I repeat that atomic research has never been the subject of discussion, because, there is no possibility of this work being undertaken in Australia at any stage. I come now to something that all honourable members should understand if they do not already appreciate it : Every leading physicist and, no doubt, many junior scientists, in the world today know the secret of the atomic bomb and atomic energy. If there are any secrets associated with atomic research they relate to the industrial technique for the harnessing of atomic energy hut that has not been a subject for discussion between the two governments because we have no atomic stock-pile. Therefore, the question of atomic research was not one for discussion at all while I was in England.",74
261,Mr MCBRIDE,NATIONALITY AND,We have a rocket range.,74
262,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,That has nothing to do with atomic energy research.,74
263,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,-Provisio n is made in the ' Estimates for the investigation nuclear energy.,74
264,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"The trouble with some honourable members is that theydo not know what they are talking, about. The rocket range has nothing to do with the industrial technique for the harnessing of atomic energy. It is quite true that atomic warheads could be used on. guided missiles in the years to come; - but there is nothing strange about the making of atomic bombs. As I have said, any country that has the physicists, scientists and the money could develop the atomic bomb over a period of years. right But there is quite a lot of industrial technique to be learned before atomic can be harnessed. There never was any agreement between the British Government and the Government of the United States of America to disclose to each other the results of. research or experiments on atomic energy. Mr. Churchill and the late President Roosevelt did reach an agreement about atomic bombs, but not about atomic energy. The. Minister for Defence has referred to the legislation that has been passed in. the United. States of America. Again I say that I do not propose, merely to score a few political points, to fall so low as to reveal matters that I discussed with the British War Cabinet. I am surprised at the indecency of the production in this chamber of a 3ecret document which purported to be a report of a meeting of the British Cabinet. I do not know what the United States of America or any other country will think of Australia when they know that this has been done by individuals who claim that they should be in occupation of the treasury bench. It is quite true that while I was in Great Britain, I discussed the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; hut I make it perfectly clear, and I am in a position to prove it, that there is not one atom of truth in the suggestion that there has been any leakage of information from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.",74
265,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,How does the right honourable gentleman know that that is true ?,74
266,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,I know it as wellof as it is possible for any human being to know it. . Mr ABBOTT - That is what the Canadians thought before the spy trials there.,74
267,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"I ask the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) to keep quiet for a moment. Charges have been made against the Chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir David Rivett, in this chamber. Such accusations are a poor reward for the hard work and integrity of a man who has rendered great service to this country in the world of scientific research. He may have the idea, as many other scientists do, that research should be open to the world, and that there should not be any secrets. He is not the only one who holds that view. It is shared by some of the leading scientists of the world. It is true that Sir David made a statement to that effect about eighteen months or two years ago. It is also true that, because of that statethe ment, some people believe that he, and those associated with him, cannot be relied upon to engage in secret scientific research for the Empire. I remind honourable members, however, that during the war the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research did very important if not highly secret work, and I do not think that anybody can clain that the slightest leakage of information occurred. The honourable member for New England has asked me on what I base my statements. ilr. ABBOTT - I did not. I asked the right honourable gentleman how he knew for certain.",75
268,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"And I said that I was as certain as any human being could be. I am basing my belief on my own examination and judgment. When I say that there is not the faintest evidence that there has been a leakage of secret information from any public authority in this country, I am speaking from my own knowledge and the investigations of men of the highest calibre who are charged with the responsibility of finding out these things. I have no doubt that individuals who may be called ""fellow travellers "" get into various organizations. There may he some such person at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research wheeling a barrow or cleaning windows; but these people do not have anything to do with secret information or experiments. I .spoke - with leading scientists in Great Britain who are engaged on highly secret defence work. The statements made about Sir David Rivett had been brought to their notice and they expressed, without qualification, their complete confidence in him and in the work he was doing for Australia. Those opinions were expressed by men who knew Sir David Rivett, not only by reputation, but also knew him personally. I do not propose to go into all the details of security measures taken in this country, disclosure of which is not usual in any country. As I said before, I do not know of anything more indecent than the action of the right honourable member for Darling Downs. I do not resent the charges that the Opposition might believe it necessary to make if it considers that security provisions made by the Government are insufficient. That could be a reasonable charge in the light of the incomplete information in the possession of the Opposition. Honourable member? of the Opposition are not as well informed as I am on this particular subject. I am particularly well informed as to whether there is any evidence of any leakage of information of a scientificnature. I am in a position to state, to the British Cabinet, the American Government, or to the people of this country, that there is not the faintest proof that secrets of that kind are going out from any government department OT any individual in any government department in this country. It is perfectly true that nobody can know anything with complete certainty. Even the exact time of birth or death is not known with certainty, although one may have some reasonable certainty regarding the hour of sunrise. However, with all the certainty possible to me, I say that no secrets have been communicated to any one not entitled to know them, and 1 defy anybody in this or any other country to prove the contrary. Honourable members may criticize the calibre of individuals associated with the security services and wish to attack them. That .has happened to such a great war leader as Mr Churchill. The people of Britain did not hesitate to set about him after the war was over",75
269,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,Senator stated in another place that Mr Churchill was a mad dog.,76
270,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"It is a question of individual judgment. People are entitled to say that they think a certain individual is not capable ofdoing a job well. After Mr Churchill had led B r it a into victory in the recent war, the British people decided that he was not fit to lead them any further. Honourable members opposite may similarly criticize those employed in the security service. It is perfectly true that after the war every country in the world to some degree relaxed its security services and cut down the number of people employed in them.",76
271,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATIONALITY AND,All excepting Russia.,76
272,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) seems to have some close contact with what is happening in Russia. I am not in that fortunate position. As I have .said, after the war there was some relaxation in security services and a reduction in the number of individuals employed in them in various countries. It is true that the Australian Government, which had utilized services of a number of special directors such as the late Mr MCKay, who was - Commissioner of Police in New South ""Wales, allowed them to return to their ordinary duties after the war was over. It is also true that the number of people engaged in the security service Australia was reduced. In that respect, however, I may remind honourable memas bers that one of the most frequent charges made by the Opposition is that there are too many persons employed the Public Service. Since the war, our bitter disappointment and contrary to our hopes, there has arisen a degree of tension in the world which has caused fear of another war, and as a result security services and counter-espionage services in all the allied countries been built up again. It may be perfectly true that Australia has not reconstituted its security services as rapidly as have other countries. The Australian Governto listen to. ment has not directed a special staff to engage in counter-espionage work. Instead it has retained on that work men who seem ro me and to the Minister for Defence reasonably competent and able to f u l Collings its requirements. I am not in a position to disclose all the security matters with which I have had dealings, but I repeat that nobody has been able to produce any evidence that any secrets in regard to defence scientific experiments have leaked out through anybody. In that statement. I am backed by the opinion of people more competent to express an opinion on this subject than I am. These matters have been thoroughly in vestigated. It may also be true that in view of world events at the present time the security services ought to be strengthened and more highly qualified men ought to be recruited to them. 1I have had discussions on that matter, and I do not deny the truth of that proposition, because I am just as anxious about the security of Australia as are those who shout and make false statements about it , and by doing so could very easily do this country more harm in the eyes of other nations with whom it is associated than the Russians themselves could do.",76
273,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,That is pretty low.,76
274,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,The Prime Minister is descending to the level of the debate.,76
275,Mr CHAMBERS,NATIONALITY AND,Does the Actin g Leader of the Opposition admit that the level of the debate has been low?,76
276,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"It may be that I am very sensitive in these matters, but 1 consider that members of Parliament, in who have a responsibility to the country and ought to be regarded by other nations responsible persons with a sense of decency, should never have made the statements that I have been told were in made here today. As I have said I was to not able to be present in the chamber when all these statements were made.",76
277,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,Why did not the Prime a Minister come in and listen to them?,76
278,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"It is not possible for me to listen to all the debates and where have the honourable member for New England is concerned it is difficult to find sufficient time to listen to what he says. In addition, his speeches are extremely painful",76
279,Mr HARRISON,NATIONALITY AND,"Wn y did not the Prime Minister adopt this noble attitude when the Minister for Transport (Mr . f i l Ward"") made his allegations regarding the "" Brisbane line "" ? ",76
280,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"Speakin g in all sincerity, I say that I never imagined that statements of the nature of those made today could be made in this Parliament in a debate of this kind. There is not the slightest evidence anywhere that anybody associated with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research or any officer of the Government, has divulged any secrets whatsoever. In saying so, I am confining myself to the attack that has been made here today, upon that particular body. Honourable members opposite may say that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has grown up in a loose fashion so far its administration is concerned. I remind them that that body was not established for the purpose of dealing with defence research. It was established to conduct experiments in connection with civil production and economy. It was not established by this Government, and it did grow up in a rather loose manner. It has been enlarged in recent years and now has about 5,000 employees. It is possible that from time to time this Government, or some other government, may find it necessary to review the form of that body's administration. Some years before I became Prime Minister I considered that aspect, and as the result of my consideration the employees of the Repatriation Commission were placed under the control of the Public Service Board. Possibly, the employees of some other government instrumentalities should also be brought under the control of the Public Service Board. Be that as it may, I desire to emphasize the magnificent work done for this country by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Although I feel sure that the economic and political views of the chairman of that council, Sir David Rivett, would not coincide with mine, I should be doing him an injustice if I did not point out that .no servant of the Commonwealth is held in higher respect or is more trusted than he is. Furthermore, I am convinced that no one is more loyal to Australia, or is more conscious of his country's in terests, than is Sir David. I know that he would not do anything to the detriment of the country's interest or its security. To revert to the subject ofnational security, although I do not propose to reveal details of the precautions being taken, because it is not customary for responsible members of the government of any country to discuss such matters in public, I can assure honourable members that I have given the closest attention to this matter. Although the Government has taken energetic action, I am not going to shout out",77
281,Mr ABBOTT,NATIONALITY AND,We want to know that the Government is doing something.,77
282,Mr CHIFLEY,NATIONALITY AND,"I assure honourable members-and not for the purpose of stifling criticism-that I have received as advice and taken such action as is necessary to remove any cause for concern. If there is the slightest evidence that more drastic measures should be taken to safeguard our security, that more competent or highly trained officers should be engaged on security, or that action should he taken of a kind different from that taken hitherto, the Government will not hesitate. In conclusion, I say to honourable members opposite that I believe that supporters of the Government have just as much love for their country, and are just as anxious for its security as artmembers of the Opposition.
