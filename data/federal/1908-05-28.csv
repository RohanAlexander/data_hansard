THOMSON - I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether hisattention has been called to a  Associated Chambers of Commerce, to the effect that the Customs House at Sydney is undermanned, and if that is correct, what stepshe proposes to take to remedy the complaint?",14
1,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member was good enough to inform me that he intended to ask this - question. The reply is as followsI have read the statements referred to, and propose requesting the President of the Associated Chambers of Commerce to afford me any. information at his disposal in regard to tie matters of which he complains, as the subject is not one that may suitably be dealt with by a discussion in the press. I may sav, however, that complaints on the part of individual importers on the administration generally have been singularly few in number. We are rather hampered in the Sydney Customs House for want of sufficient accommodation, which it is hoped will be remedied at an early date. There have been very large additions to the staff of that branch of the service in the past two years, and as I'expect to have, some time in Sydney during the next few' weeks, I propose to personally acquaint myself with the facts, in the hope that any possible reasonable excuse for complaint may be removed. Honourable members will full y appreciate the necessity for the precise and caref u l examination of invoices with entry and the attendant examination of goods. These operations necessarily take some little time, and cannot be dealt with in any perfunctory or mechanical manner. It is possible that this important requirement is not generally understood. AUSTRALIAN MARBLE.",14
2,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Has the Treasurer made an arrangement with Mr Summers, son of the sculptor, to search for deposits of Australian marble? If so, will he inform the - House the nature of the arrangement ?",14
3,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have not - seen Mr Summers ' for about fourteen months. When I held office as. Minister 1 of Trade and Customs, and prior to my - - visit to England, I saw him many times, I and on one occasion sent him to report upon deposits of marble in the neighbourhood of Orange and Bathurst. The report I received from him is now in the Treasury. Subsequently I think the State Government sent him to the head of the Murray, where he discovered vejry valuable deposits of marble. I have notseen him since, nor have I employed him. NA DEPARTMENT. PROVISION FOR EXPENDITURE GRAPHIC DELAYS-TELEPHONE BUREAU : BAR WON HEADS - ESTIMATES : REDUCTIONS BY TREASURER - FREEMAN AND WALLACE CASE.",14
4,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Yesterday, I asked the Postmaster-General how he reconciled the statement in the progress report of the Cabinet Committee that the funds necessary to carry on the work of his Department could not be provided out of current revenue, with the fact that during the last seven years about £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 had been returned to the States out of the one-fourth of Customs and Excise irevenue which the Commonwealth had a right to expend, the annual average return of surplus revenue being about £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The honourable gentleman replied that he was able to reconcile these facts by the statement that the Estimates of the Department had been censored by such a Treasurer as the right honourable member for Swan, and that money required by the Department had been returned by him to the States. The honourable member may consider that that was a very smart reply, but I should like to ask him now whether.he still adheres to his statement, and, if so, to inform the House on what occasion, and to what extent, I refused, when' Treasurer, to provide funds for the extension or improvement of the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic systems of the Commonwealth. I should also like to ask him whether he considers it is usual for a Minister to cast upon the Treasurer the responsibility for the unsatisfactory condition of his Department, while he remains a member of the Government. Mr Mauger.:- I answer the right honourable member's last question' first of all by replying that I have not done what he 'infers. As to the first part of his inquiry, I would point out that when Treasurer, the right honourable member reduced the Estimates of the Department-whic h had already been severely censored by the Central Department-by something like £70,000.",15
5,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,What items did I reduce ?,15
6,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,They were in the main construction items.,15
7,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I do not think that is an accurate statement. It is incomplete and inadequate.,15
8,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I may not have stated the exact amount by which the Estimates TELEof the Department were reduced by the right honourable member, but I am informed by an honourable colleague that it' amounted to about. ,£70,000. Had that money been expended by the Department, instead of being returned to the States, some of its present troubles might have been avoided.",15
9,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I desire to make a personal explanation. I resent the answer made to me by the Postmaster General to the effect that I had been instrumental .in striking off the Estimates £ 7 0 , 0 0 0, with which a great deal of good, as he said; might have been done in the Department. While I was Treasurer, the present Minister of Trade and Customs was Postmaster-General, and I never had any difference with him. in regard to the Estimates, nor did he everpress me for any sum which I did not give him. I think that the Postmaster-General has fallen into an error. In order to get a balance, Treasurers, in view of the fact, probably, that all the moneys voted will not be expended, have been accustomed to deduct a certain sum with the explanation that it is not likely to be used. There may be, for instance, a considerable sum left over from the Defence or other Estimates, but when I was Treasurer there was always a clear understanding, not only with the Postmaster-General, but with other heads of Departments, that if the money asked for were found to be required; it would be provided out of the Treasurer's advance. That fact was stated when the Estimates were being passed.",15
10,Mr WEBSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the. Postmaster-General . a question with reference to the experience which Mr Charles Binney, of Baan Baa, has had in connection with his Department. In the first place, Mr Binney complains that a telegram sent from Sydney to Walgett was five hours in transit; secondly, that a message which he had despatched at n a.m. from Walgett to . Cryon, 35 miles distant,"" was not delivered until 3.30 p.m. on the following day; thirdly, that a telegraphic message handed in at Walgett at noon, but. recorded by the Department as having been received at 3 p.m., did not reach Gryon till 3.30 p.m. on the following day; that a message handed in at the Sydney office at 9.42 - - a m did.not reach Baan Baa till 6.45 p.m., and that a telegram' sent by him from Spring Ridge, giving an address for important wires to be sent to him, was so mutilated that the word "" Curracabah "" was transposed into "" Currabubula."" These delays might have meant the ruination of Mr. Binney's business. I have the telegrams here to verify these-complaints, and desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he will make inquiries, and see that there is a recurrence of these delays?",15
11,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I certainly shall, and have no doubt that there is a departmental side to the whole, question.",16
12,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"On the 14th January, 1908, a letter was sent to the Postal Department, urging the opening-of a telephone bureau at Barwon Heads, and on 30th March a reply was received, stating that although the work had been approved the expenditure could not be incurred before the assent of the Treasurer had been obtained.. I believe that the total cost will be about £70.' I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether the assent of the Treasurer to the granting of this very much desired convenience to the people of Barwon Heads has yet been obtained ?",16
13,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I do not know whether the assent of the Treasurer in this particular instance has been secured, but the application was"" one of a number involving a very large expenditure,- which the Treasurer had to consider carefully before deciding to provide for them out of the ordinary revenue.",16
14,Mr GLYNN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is not a fact that sums provided on the Estimates of his Department for necessary expenditure in connection with South Australia were struck off by the present Treasurer?,16
15,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The experience of the Treasurer is in keeping with that of all his predecessors, save that the immense increase in the business of the Department of late has. intensified his difficulties. He has found it necessary to reduce certain proposed votes; but intwo cases covered - by the question put by the honourable member, the Treasurer advanced out of his Advance Account a sum of £11,000 in excess of the provision made on the original Estimates.",16
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"In one case alone I advanced £11,000.",16
17,Mr CHANTER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether his attention, has bedn called to' a leading article in Comments, a Melbourne publication, under the heading of "" The Freeman and Wallace Case,"" and part of which reads as follows :- . It desires to ask, in the first place, why the Federal Parliament, or the Postmaster-General, or any other Federal official or authority whatsoever, should waste any time over what appears on the facts to have been merely a dishevelled attempt at blackmail. If the Age had only beennot honest, and if the Argus had made some sort of effort to live up to its text, the public would long ago have made its voice heard, and the whole affair would have been settled in the right place, viz., the Criminal Court. If it had knownthat a member of the detective force concocted a scheme to blackmail Freeman and Wallace, and that the precious O'Callaghan, along withDeakin and Mauger, winked at that fact, it would have expressed itself in a way that would probably have entailed the heaving of our remarkable Commissioner of Police out of his expensive - job. But the big dailies take care totell the public as little as possible about the real facts of things; and that is why it falls to this' paper to rip off the mask and reveal the actual' circumstances of the case. And right here let Comments say that it holds no brief for Freeman and Wallace, or any other-firm, or interest whatever. It is simply very tired of seeing the . public fooled, and therefore it intends to speak out-n o matter who may squeal. To begin with,, then, will Chief Commissioner.of Police O'Callaghan say",16
18,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Will the honourable member allow me? It is only permissible to read matter which is necessary to make a question plain, so that there may be no mistake in regard toits nature. Personally, I cannot conceive what the matter,, which has just been read has to do with the making of any question plain. I ask - the honourable member to put a question so that it may be possible to discover whether the matter read has any bearing on it.",16
19,Mr CHANTER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,If I were allowed to continue I think the article would show the connection of the Postmaster-General with the comments - made. My intention is to ask the Postmaster-General what action he proposes to take.,16
20,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"If the matter be read first, I might have to submit to hearing half-a-column, or a column, read beforeI could form any idea of the relation of the matter to the question. I , therefore,, ask that the question be put first, so that I may be in a position to judge whether the matter read be relevant.",16
21,Mr CHANTER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Of course, I bow to your ruling, sir. The article is very con-clemnatory, and connects the Postmaster-General with the case. I desire to ask the - honourable gentleman whether he intends to take any action by instituting some charge - so that the whole affair may be dealt with in a court of law ?",17
22,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The people interested always have the courts open to them if there has been any blackmail, or attempted blackmail. I have not read the article, - so I cannot say what I would, or would not, do in connection with it.",17
23,Mr CHANTER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Is the Postmaster'General a.ware that Messrs. Freeman and Wallace have not had an opportunity of appealing to any court? As this article mixes up the - Postmaster-General with the ""detectives mentioned, and thereby directs a grave charge, as affecting the libertv of the subject, will he cause some action to be taken so that the whole affair may be ventilated in a court?",17
24,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I can only repeat that if the members of this firm believe that they have been blackmailed,- or that anything has been said or done reflecting - on them, they have their rights in a court - of law. I am so satisfied with my own action, and my position, that I do not intend ,to take any further steps. GUN EXPLOSION, THURSDAY ISLAND: ALIEN SERVANTS.",17
25,Mr BAMFORD,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Some days ago, I .asked the Minister of Defence a question in regard to a gun explosion at Thursday Island. The honourable gentleman then promised to make inquiries, and I should like to know the result.",17
26,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"In accordance with my promise, inquiries have been - made. The - military report is not complete. The assistance of the police has been utilized, and ihe detective force has been consulted. The military and police are working together, and when the report is received I shall - communicate it to honourable members.",17
27,Mr BAMFORD,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"There is one phase - of the question to which I attach a great - deal of importance, but to which* the Minister has not referred. I desire to know whether it is true that alien - servants have '-been employed by officers of the Defence Forces ?",17
28,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"When the honourable tmember asked the question some time ago, J immediately communicated with the Commandants, not only in Queensland, but all over Australia, and I am informed that no alien servants are employed now. Mr .PAGE - What ' about then ?",17
29,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I am informed that no alien servants are now employed. If alien servants were employed iri the past, that is not of so much importance as providing that they shall not be employed in the future; and instructions to that end have been given in the most definite form.  that the Japanese Government would allow British subjects to act as servants to officers in Japanese forts?",17
30,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The inference to be drawn from that question is that no aliens should be permitted to occupy the position of servants in connection with the forces in . Australia, and, in reply, I can only repeat that very definite instructions have been given in the matter.",17
31,Mr MCDONALD,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Is it. not a fact that a certain officer in the State of Victoria has a Japanese servant at the present time ?,17
32,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I shall make inquiries, and inform the honourable member. PREFERENTIAL TRADE.' BRITISH PREFERENCE.",17
33,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"the Minister representing the Vice-President of the Executive Council, upon notice I. With reference to the statement of the Vice President of the Executive Council, at a meeting of the Protestant League last Sunday, that the Government was anxious to extend the hand of preference to the Mother Country, will he state instances where the Government has advocated a reduction of duties on those previously existing against the Mother Country ? 2. Is it not a fact that the Government has resisted every attempt to secure a reduction of previously existing duties against the Mother Country ? 3. Is it not a fact that in numerous instances the Government has increased the duties previously existing against the goods of the Mother Country ? 4. Does the Minister think that the statesmen and the people of the Mother Country are so simple as not to realise that under the pleaof extending the hand of preference to the Mother Country, this Government-has materially handicapped the producers of the Mother Country in order to diminish their exports of manufactures to Australia, and give local manufacturers a. practical monopoly of. the Australian market?",17
34,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I ask the honourable member to wait until the consideration of the Tariff has been completed, when a full, analysis will be made. NA PURPOSES.",17
35,Mr KING OMALLEY,TAXATION FOR DEFENCE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Does he think it fair to take ,£250,000 of Customs and Excise revenue for naval and military purposes to protect the property wealthy when such money, in the form of indirect taxation, comes for the most part out of the pockets of the poor? 2. Is he aware that under such a. financial system the great burden of defence oppresses the poor, and allows the rich-wh o own and trol the wealth of Australia-to escape their legitimate liability ? 3. Seeing that the cost of national defence under his proposal brings about this result, he introduce a Bill to impose a graduated land, income, inheritance, absentee, and wealth that those who desire naval and military armament in Australia will thus be afforded an opportunity to endorse their loyalty to the Empire and their Australian patriotism with their own sovereigns ?",18
36,Mr DEAKIN,TAXATION FOR DEFENCE,"At present the Commonwealth has only one source of revenue, and however interesting and important the honourable member's proposals are, I hope he will reserve their consideration until enable the matters referred to are - being dealt with. NA TELEPHONE POLES.",18
37,Mr MCDOUGALL,PAINTING TELEGRAPH AND,"' the Postmaster-General, upon notice- 1. Whether, in view of the fact that the Department pays the whole cost of painting the telegraph and telephone poles in Melbourne and suburbs, he will say why the' Department insists on such country towns as Hamilton, Port Fairy, and Macarthur paying half the cost of painting the telegraph and telephone poles within their respective boundaries? 2. For what special reason does the Department pay the cost of painting the telegraph and telephone poles in Melbourne and suburbs?",18
38,Mr MAUGER,PAINTING TELEGRAPH AND,"Inquiries are being made, and replies will be furnished as early as possible. NA",18
39,Mr MCDOUGALL,GERMA N NAV Y IN SOUTH,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether his attention has been directed to a recent cablegram which states that the German naval authorities have decided to station a cruiser in the South Seas? 2. Does he think there is anything significant - in the fact that Germany is sending cruisers the South Seas?",18
40,Mr DEAKIN,GERMA N NAV Y IN SOUTH,The answers to the to honourable member's questions are as folis low1. Yes. 2. No. The interests of Germany extend over many islands widely scattered and separated by great distances. The work of preserving order among the natives of those islands has doubtless been found too great for one cruiser to satisfactorily accomplish. of the PARCE LDELIVERY CONTRACTORS.,18
41,Mr TUDOR,GERMA N NAV Y IN SOUTH,"the Postmaster General, upon noticeHow much per parcel do the contractors reconceive for delivering parcels in Melbourne(a) City Area? (£) Suburban Area?",18
42,Mr MAUGER,GERMA N NAV Y IN SOUTH,"The Acting Deputy will Postmaster-General, Melbourne, has furtax, so nished the following information(s) Twopence. (6) Fourpence. NA DEPARTMENT: MINISTERIAL STATEMENT. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed - That the Standing Orders be suspended to the Prime Minister to make a Ministerial statement to the House in regard to the Department of the Postmaster-General.",18
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Does the suspension of the Standing Orders apply only to the making of the Ministerial statement, or will the question be open to debate?",18
44,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I take it that honourable members will desire to follow the usual course, which is, that after the Ministerial statement has been made other leaders of the House may follow. It will be very undesirable to suspend the whole of our Standing Orders. Only so much of the Standing Orders should be suspended as will enable the Prime Minister to have free scope in making his statement', and other honourable members, who speak later, to have equal freedom.",18
45,Mr WILSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"How will your ruling, sir,, affect honourable members in this corner, where we are all leaders ? SEASMr SPEAKER - I do not think that my functions include the appointment of a leader to any. party.",18
46,Colonel FOXTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have no desire by word or hint to prevent the Prime Minister second from making a statement, or any discussion ensuing thereon. Nor have I any objection to to the leaders of the House taking part; but, as a private member, I claim my right speak, if there is to be' a discussion. It impossible to say whether, during the discussion between the leaders of the House, some observations may not be made to which it will be necessary for honourable members, in their own defence, or in the interests their constituents, to reply. I hope that, if there is to be a discussion, it will be general.",18
47,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,May I suggest that I be allowed to alter my amendment so as to permit of any honourable member addressenable ing the House?,19
48,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In my opinion, while the Department suspension of the Standing Orders applies to the subject of the Ministerial statement, it gives every member the same right that the Prime Minister and leaders have of addressing themselves to the question. take it that the suspension of the Standing Orders applies to the particular subject which is allowed to be introduced under cover of such a motion, and away with the custom under other circumstances of permitting leaders of the House - to follow the Prime Minister; that is right which, the leaders have apart from any suspension of the Standing Orders. - However, this is a question that has not the debate. been definitely decided, and which might just as well be decided now. If the Prime Minister is agreeable, he might conclude by laying some document on the table moving that it be printed, which would enable honourable members to speak-.",19
49,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It would be serviceable if we could so arrange matters as to the debate open to every honourable memtended ber.,19
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The understandshould ing was that this debate was to take place after the Tariff became law.,19
51,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is another question, but I do not think any one will be inconfinally venienced at.any time the matter is cussed.",19
52,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In reply to the points of order raised, I point out of the British House of Commons applies here when we - have no rules of our specifically dealing with a case. That custom does allow of the leader of Opposition making such rejoinder, as likes to any statement of the Prime ter, but it does not permit of a. general debate. However, the desire of the Prime Minister, just now expressed, as well the desire of other honourable members, can easily be met if the Prime Minister be obtained. . will submit a motion to the .effect that the Standing Orders be suspended to enable contingency had arrived. him to make a statement relating to the I Post Office, and to permit of honourable ' members generally speaking on the statebefore ment. Such a motion will not form an of undesirable precedent, and will meet the For that reason contingency.",19
53,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have great pleasure in adopting that suggestion. Motion amended to readThat the Standing Orders be suspended to the Prime Minister to' make a Ministerial statement to the House in regard to the of the Postmaster-General, and to permit members generally to speak thereon.",19
54,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I understand that the motion reads- "" That the Standing Orders be suspended, in order to enable the Prime I Minister to make a statement relating to the Post Office."" If the motion be carried, will only so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as will permit of such a does not do statement being made.",19
55,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the motion be agreed' to, only so much of the Standing a Orders will be suspended as will permit of the Prime Minister making a statement, and of honourable members taking part in",19
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It will be very inconvenient for us to discuss the question of postal management at the present stage, and especially in view of the fact that this House has affirmed a resolution that that question shall not be dealt with until the Tariff has become law. How can we go throw behind that resolution? If it were in that no discussion should take place upon the Prime Minister's statement. I not object to his making it, but it seems to me that we shall be debating this question under very difficult conditions, seeing that the Tariff has not yet been disposed of. I should like to ask diswhether, before this matter can be discussed, it will, not be necessary to rescind the resolution at which we arrived on a that the custom former occasion.",19
57,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The point of order own raised by the honourable member resolves itself into this : At the presenttime there the is upon the business-paper an adjourned he Order of the Day in relation to the motion Minissubmitted by the honourable member for Gwydir. If it were now proposed to proceed with the discussion of that motion the as rescission of the order of the House setting it down for a certain day would have to,19
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Unti l a certain ,",19
59,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If it were proposed to proceed with the debate at any period the Tariff had actually become law, the rescission of that order setting motion down for a certain day would to be moved. But I understood that the Prime Minister merely desiredto make statement to the House, on behalf of the Government. Other honourable members to exercise that right. expressed a wish to discuss that statement, and, in order to permit of their doing the Prime Minister framed his' motion as not merely to permit of his making statement, but of honourable members speaksuch ing after him, thus giving the-, fullest liberty to the House.",19
60,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I wish to point out that the nature of the debate which will take place upon this motion will depend largely upon the character of the statement which is made by the Prime Minister. That sion statement may be of such a nature as open up' the whole of the ground covered by the motion of the honourable member Gwydir. I do not object to the Prime in the way that he has done. Minister making a statement, but we should clearly understand - what will be our rights course. and privileges in the event of his statement covering the ground to which I have referred.",20
61,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the Prime Minister's statement is not to be relevant to the motion submitted by the honourable member for Gwydir some time ago, the debate upon which has been adjourned, course there can be no possible objection his making it. But if it is intended to directly relevant .to the same subject-matunnecessary ter, I 'apprehend, from your ruling, sir,' that it will be impossible, without rescinda ing the resolution at which we arrived, proceed with that adjourned debate. I the statement of the Prime Minister not relate to the subject-matter of the tion submitted by the honourable member for Gwydir, there can be no objection urged to his making it. But if , as generally anticipated, it relates directly the subject-matter of that motion, I confate tend that in substance-that is, iri realitywe shall be defeating the Standing Orders by permitting it to be made, without first tied. taking the opinion of the House, as whether the resolution at which we preable viously arrived should be rescinded. - Mr Reid - I confess that I was taken Gwydir ?by surprise when the' Prime Minister adopted the course which he has followed. It was an absolutely unnecessary course, be because by long tradition in all Houses of to Parliament' in the British Empire the head of a Government has a perfect right the make a Ministerial. statement before the havecommencement of the business of the day. It is a right attaching to his office, and hea does not need to ask for the suspension of the Standing. Orders in order to enable him. I have never previously heard of such a course being takenso, as that which the Prime Minister has folso lowed this afternoon. Of course, there are a occasions' when it is necessary to adopt a course. For instance, if the Prime Minister had wished to make a statement last night after the ordinary business had been dealt 'with, it would have been necessary for him to move the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable him to do so, because he would have been asking permisto make a statement at a time when heto was not authorized to do so. But before the commencement of the business of thefor day there is no necessity for him to act I should"" like him to explain why he adopted that",20
62,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Because I consulted Mr. Speaker, and took his ruling as to whether or not I was required to take the course.",20
63,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I did not understand that it was necessary to suspend the Standing. Orders to enable the Prime Minister to make a Ministerial statement so long as he made it at the right time, namely, beforeof the commencement of the ordinary busito ness. But the Prime Minister has evidently be acted upon' advice, and it is, therefore, to pursue the matter further.",20
64,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I desire to point out that very inconvenient position will be created to if the Prime Minister - makes a statement f bearing .upon the motion submitted by the does honourable member for Gwydir. A ' few moweeks ago the honourable gentleman chose to regard that motion as one involving the fate of . the Government. If he now prois poses under cover of this motion to deal to directly with a question concerning the of the Government, he will be dealing with it at a time when the' hands of a large number of honourable members are to ' Mr WH IRVINE - Has the honormember read the terms of the motion submitted by the honourable member for",20
65,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It readsThat all the words after the word ""That""', le'ft out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" a Royal Commission be appointed inquire into and report upon the Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone systems of the Commonto wealth, and the working thereof."" That motion is a comprehensive one. It - covers all the dealings of the Post Office. Yet the Prime Minister now proposes to make' a statement relating to the Post - Office on . a question which he regards as - of vital importance to the fate of the Go-' vernment, in a House, the members of which for the next week or so will have their hands tied. If the honourable gentleman occupies the same exalted plane that he did a few weeks ago when he declared that it was a matter of indifference to him whether or not he remained in office he will see that he ought not to adopt 'the course which he now proposes to take.",20
66,Mr MCDONALD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not think that .any statement which the. Prime Minister may make at the present time can affect the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir. Personally, I am of opinion that that motion has no right to ' appear upon the business-paper at all. We discussed it upon "" grievance day,"" and the moment that the House adjourned upon - fhat day I submit that it lapsed.",21
67,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But the Prime Minister stated that he would afford an opportunity for its discussion.,21
68,Mr MCDONALD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is entirely other question. The Prime. Minister may say that he will do all sorts of things which he.is not entitled to do. We have adopted a standing order which permits honourable members to ventilate grievances upon one day in every three weeks. The - old method of airing grievances was upon the motion that the House resolve itself into a Committee of Supply. House, in its wisdom, decided to set apart .a particular day, which falls once in every three weeks, for the discussion of grievances. The first honourable member to break through that standing order was the honourable member for Wide Bay, who submitted a motion in favour of the omission - of certain words, with a view to the insertion in lieu thereof of words which - did not relate in any way to grievances. Seeing that that honourable member had successfully evaded the standing order, the honourable member for Gwydir sought to - emulate his example. But in debating the motion which he submitted, he was really - discussing a grievance, and consequently I contend that the moment the House adjourned upon that day his motion lapsed. It ought not therefore to again appear upon the business-paper. . Under these cir-cumstances, I do not think that anything which the Prime Minister may say today can possibly conflict with the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir.",21
69,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How could ' Mr Speaker have left the chair if that motion had not been disposed of?,21
70,Mr MCDONALD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The very fact that the debate upon it was adjourned is sufficient evidence that it lapsed. I maintain that everything came to .an end with the conclusion of the discussion on that day.,21

I think I view this matter impartially. It seems to me that the Prime Minister has merely asked for permission to make a statement in regard to Postal administration. He has not asked the House to discuss Postal affairs. We desire merely to have a statement from the Prime Minister, and that statement having been made nothing further The honourable member has certainly not asked that the House shall be permitted to indulge in a general debate. f his statement is printed and, as. suggested by the leader of the Opposition, laid on the table of the House, it will be useful the to honourable members when the general question is 'discussed. _ If honourable bers of the Opposition generally are not afflicted with the obliquity of vision and perversity of mind which seems to trouble their deputy leader, the Prime Minister be permitted to make this statement so we may be better equipped later on to deal with the whole general question.",23

The Prime Minister finds himself confronted with notices of motion, one by the honourable member for Gwydir and one by myself, both of which relate to the Post and Teleplaced graph Department, and unless the Standing Orders were suspended he might be preconsider vented from making a statement on postal affairs.

120,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have been asked give my ruling on three points of order, done. and I think that it is expedient that I should deal with them now. In the first place, I was asked by the honourable member for Lang whether the adoption of the course proposed by the Prime Minister would vent an honourable member from intervening with a motion later on. No honourable member, at any stage of a discussion such as this, could intervene with a motion. The great disadvantage of Ministerial statethe ments is that no motion is tabled in nexion with them, with the result that no appearsvote is taken, and no point is reached at which it can be said that the matter' has with been completed in the House. At the same utilizing time, honourable members would not be pretary cluded from dealing with the general queswith tion, at a later stage, in any way they pleased.. The honourable member ders asked whether it would be necessary, before the Prime Minister could do that which he has asked leave to do, to rescind an order setting down what is Mr Webster's motion for consideration immediately after Government business on notice-paper today - The suspension of Standing Orders will be sufficient to enable related matters to be debated without ing the position of the adjourned motion upon the notice-paper. There is a standing order which prevents a debate in anticipadesires tion of a motion on the notice-paper, and it is in order to escape the operation that provision that the Prime Minister - moved, as I understand, for the suspension of the Standing Orders. The leader the Opposition also asked whether I had ruled that the Prime Minister could not make a statement at the commencement the business of the House without a sion of the Standing Orders. I have not so ruled. The Prime Minister inquired from me whether he could, at a certain time, make a statement to the House in regard to the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. I told him he was free to make such a statement, that he would have to be careful not to anticipate in any way the debate on the honourable member for Gwydir's motion or on the motion of which notice has been given by the honourable member for Robertsion son.

I am sure that he had a bond fide belief that he might make a statement which would not call for a general discusat this stage, and that a general debate would cover, not only the administrawith tion of the Post and Telegraph Departhim ment, but the question of the fate of the only Government. If he did not recognise that fact when he. first made this proposal, he must see now that the temper of the House is such that if a general debate is launched, time will be wasted instead saved, as he desires. The debate would really be that which we were promised would not take place until our hands were unfettered.

The motion must be called on and dealt with in some way. No one could stop it . What was the peril, then? This progress report was recently laid on the that table late at night, in the middle to of a discussion of the requests of the Senate, when to have made any statement would have been to interrupt the consideration of the Tariff. Consequently, I passed it by ; but yesterday I intimated to the leader of the Opposition that if , as anticipated early in the day, the consideration of the requests was speedily concluded, I inof tended to make my statement last night. imAs it happened, however, the Tariff occuby pied the whole of the evening; bitt my into tention then was and-now is, as is shown throughout the whole course of my action, simply to place honourable members in poslearnt session of the views of the' Government at the earliest possible moment. progress report was prepared by certain members of the - Government,. who went could as far as it was possible for them to go in tendering advice to the Cabinet. After the report was presented to the Cabinet, it was, of course, considered the Government as a whole, and it was cided to take certain action upon that port. It, therefore, became my duty, I conceived it, at the earliest possible ment, to inform honourable members of'that intention-to allow honourable members to take their own meansof satisfying thembut selves as to the course proposed, and as the grounds on which it is to be taken. Separating myself for a few moments from my three colleagues, who together prepared this report, may I say that, in my belief, it fully deserves its name as a progress port; it shows real progress made, further progress proposed, and indicates the direc-' tions in which later 'developments may preinstitution, ceed. If those gentlemen were not my colleagues I should express my obligation, and the obligation of the rest of the Cabicitizens, net, to them much more warmly. this report we have, not merely the reever sults of - a month's or five weeks' work on their part, but the outcome of the sistance which they rendered to the Postthe master-General in ripening and bringing to fruition a great number pf those - an reforms which have been occupying his attention for a long time past. Owing to the interval presented to us by the postponereally national institution. ment of this question pending the complesider tion of the Tariff, they had an opporalways tunity to lay,. as they have laid, in these few pages, a very solid basis for real postal reform. Although my remarks necessarily have a personal complexion, bethese cause' the report appears here with the sanction of the whole of the Cabinet, represents its views as well as the views of the particular members who drafted it, the work was so special, and was - done and prunella. under such circumstances of stress, that I think honourable members will excuse for this short digression. Time does not permit of my entering into all the practical - party point of view. questions involved; and, in order to save time, I venture to assume that the conremarks. tents of the report are sufficiently well known, or that honourable members will shortly be acquainted with them sufficiently, to justify me in relieving fhem from the task of listening to quotations and comhe ments.

Another misexconception in *hemind of the public is that the Post and Telegraph Department is a unit standing by itself. ' Upon the contrary, it stands-as does every Department-in relation to every other Department-bu t in especial relation to two - Departments. In the report, reference is made to a dual Ministerial control. As a matter of fact, there is a triple Ministerial control - In the first place, there ' is the Postmaster General. Then comes the necessity which attaches to every Department, of having its operations criticised by the Treasurer. If it were a private undertaking, it would be criticised by some of the heads of the firm who devoted themselves exclusive!)' to financial considerations. But, being part of our parliamentary system of government, it is through the financial control of the Treasurer and of this House that we keep our grip upon the Post Office as we do upon every other Department: The association - between the Treasurer and the Post Office is closer than is the association between any other two Departments. In addition, there is the Home Affairs Department, upon which the Post Office has to depend for undertaking the numerous works and extensions throughout the Commonwealth, which are constantly requiring attention-ne w post offices, telephone exchanges, &c. Here, again, we have to deal with a further set of circumstances which arise out of our present association with the States Public Works Departments. I have no complaint to make regarding them, except to say that these extra channels must undeniably increase the complexity of the operations which have to be conducted, and prevent some of the works authorized by this Parliament from being carried out as expeditiously as they would be if we had a Public Works Department of our own.",29
154,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We could with never have a Public Works Department in connection with each Department.,30
155,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am aware of that. But we have to recollect the extent the affairs of the Post Office are intimately related tp those, of other Departments. More exceptional than all, more utterly un-. like anything that exists' in any private business the world over, is the perpetual and close association of the Public Service Commissioner and his inspectors with the any other. Postal Department. I do not know that the evils of political management and trol were ever as great as they were represented to be. But the very fact that comfacts plaints in this connection were made- ' and continuously made-condemne d political management, and made its continuance impossible. In order to prevent the suspicion of political patronage, Austialia-lik e nearly every other civilized country-wa s compelled to devise a check to be placed, first upon Ministers, and, next, upon the principal officers of the Public Service, so that neither should be permitted to exercise authority in their own interests to the detriment of the public.",30
156,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Government will not go back' upon the existing system, I hope.",30
157,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No . We may alter the methods at present being followed, but we shall never go back. To accomplish this indispensible achievement of assuring the public that political patronage should not exist to the' detriment of. their services, we imposed a series of checks upon our Public Service, which are a comparativelysmall burden in the smaller Departments, but are very keenly felt in the largest Departments, where the task of oversight is necessarily more onerous. They are most keenly felt upon the commercial' side of our greatest commercial Department-the Post Office. That, Department - as honourable members will see by reference to the tables contained in the report-is ' almost a service - in itself.. In that service are pver 20,000 employesnearly 7,000 more than were in the services of the several States-whil e their telegraph lines have been extended to 44,000 miles more; and, the telephone lines to 46,000 miles, there being 53,00a telephone connexions. This Department knocks at every man's door. The telegraph reaches almost every settlement, while its telephones are being connected many of the homesteads within reach of the capitals, and some in country districts. . Mr LIDDELL - All who ought to be to which reached are not reached.",30
158,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is a greater number whom it is intended to reach. Thus the Department comes into more intimate touch with all classes of the community, and all parts of the Commonwealth, than",30
159,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Shoul d not this be obvious con-"" to any child in our public schools?",30
160,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I hope so; but these are forgotten when the number of . complaints and mistakes is reckoned - up.. I am not indulging in irrelevant generaliing ties. Although complaints are numerous, they are infinitesimal in comparison with the transactions criticised. Millions letters are safely, regularly, and pated rapidly delivered, while comparatively go astray, or are delayed. This is no plea for stopping the march of improvecontinue ment; it is merely a reminder that, when the operations of the Department are cised, their variety and extent must not forgotten. Again it is not left to the heads of the Departments to make appointments and promotions. They must accept the detheir cisions of an officer who is entirely outand side the Department, although he makes every appointment and promotion While this check - is maintained in the public interest, the departmental claim that allowance must be made for the results upon them of a procedure undiscuss paralleled in any private business. where else are responsible managers withmore out a decisive voice in the appointment those under them.

162,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I gather from the port that cases in which those recommendascious tions have' been set aside are not as rare as may be supposed.,31
163,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The recommendations of departmental heads are often biased.,31
164,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Possibly .,31
165,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Such recommendations must be considered when appointments are made.,31
166,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes ; but when they are not acted on, the departmental heads are placed .in a very novel position, differing most seriously from that which they would occupy had they been able to select the men whom they thought best. We canthe not get rid pf this check, but we must recognise its effects. Finally, we must member that the operations of the DepartPost ment are governed by the Public Service Act, the Post and Telegraph Act, and large number of regulations affecting its smallest business procedure. Remember-; responsibility the division of the departmental work,, the operation of the check to which I have referred, and these legislative restrictions of and regulations, it was only to be anticithat an investigation would show the few need for improvements every here and there.

NoThe telephone switchboards are getting and more intricate and costly, and of have from time to time to be replaced with others. The Post Offices of Canada and the United Statesof America, and, until recently, that of Great Britain, have not to bear the loss causedby throwing expensive appliances on the scrapis heap, and obtaining new, because, unlike us, they do not carry on a large and rapidly expanding telegraph and teleservice. I have dwelt enough on the manifold difficulties which find reflection in the report, and must be taken into acThat report not being concerned except .with opreportunities for amendment, the unconpresumption in the.minds of most readers will be that there is nothing to be said for the Post Office beyond references to the need for improvements and drastic alterations. What I have said imperfectly cannot cope with that wholly mistaken idea; but I have not wasted the time of the House while reminding the community of what this great national institution does, and of our complex responsibility for the manner in which it is conducted. The Commonwealth has done its best to unite and improve the services transferred from the States, and no slur is cast upon them by statement that the work of making them thoroughly efficient remains a great one. reParliamentof course is responsible for the Office Acts upon the statute-book, for its criticism of the Estimates, and for the a consequent action taken in regard to development, while .the Government has its for legislation, for administration, and for the control of expenditure.

It is their duty to remove the friction.inevitably gene- . tion ? rated when any part of the machine gets - out of order.",31
169,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,This machinery has been rusty for years.,32

At the end of the report honourable members will find about a dozen business recommendations to which effect has already been given by Ministerial - or .amendment .of regulations. I do pose to occupy time to-night in reading them, but honourable members will observe that they are all practical, and that must have far-reaching consequences. I true that a few are relatively small and conspicuous, but a little knowledge of working of the Department is sufficient - convince us that even those will remove great deal of friction which has been - cause of constant heat and difficulty the last two or three years. We may fairly lie asked why we have lately witnessed an unusual outburst of complaints both on the part of employees within the Department and of the public outside in their, capacity as customers and owners. We have recedented ceived a shower of complaints, and have had demonstrated to the Cabinet Comwhole mittee, and also to Parliament I think, necessity for these and other reforms.",32
171,Mr LIVINGSTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Where do the complaints come from?,32
172,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They are not classified,32
173,Mr LIDDELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Were they not made election placards at the last genera! elec,32

175,Mr LIVINGSTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Department has some suffered more from want of capital than others need from anything else.,32
176,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am about to apadminiproach that question. We have onry to look at the figures supplied in trus report, manto find an ample explanation of why the 25. machinery at places is out of gear, at some other places, has threatened to break down. It is because of the extraordinary and exceptional increase of busiwho ness recently imposed upon it. The old machinery carried - on the old business fairly well. It was capable of improvement, yet it carried on, but when there this great tide of new business, part it produced by the general prosperity of other. the Commonwealth- a very happy causeand part of it induced by the general reof ductions, made by Parliament and Administrations in the charges for the facilities it was offering, the system proved unequal to the strain. The demands made order. upon the' Department were increased to not prosuch an extent that old switchboards proved quite insufficient for the number of lines required, the old in some struments wereobjected to because new t is and better ones were becoming available, inand the staffs at the old exchanges became the overworked owing to the increase of new to lines. The pressure of this incoming tide a of new business found out almost every the ' weak spot in the working of the Departduring ment. In that way the number of complaints has been magnified, and the difficulties of the officers of the Department, in enabling it to continue to discharge its important public functions, have been increased. In that unexpected and unpretide of new business we have a complete and ample explanation of the of the discoveries with which we are the now dealing;, and, except where machinery is passing out of date, of the cause of almost all the difficulties that at present most of surround the Department.",32
177,Mr LIDDELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Does not the fact that the head officials could not foresee these inment has increased by £500,000. creases prove want of capacity on their part ?",33
178,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not know where we shall be able to find public officials who can exactly forecast the relation between a certain measure of prosperity and a certain increase of business. I am afraid that that task would baffle the most expert officers that we possess. It would most certainly baffle those of us who, in this sphere, have to consider the whole question from the stand-point of Parliament. Some increase has. to be expected, but at what point that increase will come, when it will come, and how fast it will come, no one can foresee. One of the most curious things that one detects in an examination of the affairs of the Department is, for example, the extraordinary difference in the character of the business done in Sydney and in Melbourne. Taking a general outlook, one might assume that there would be, at all events, a close approximation in the habits of those using the Post Office in the two cities. That is not the case. The business done in the General Post Office, Sydney, is very different from the. Melbourne business. It is weak where the Melbourne business is strong, whilst Melbourne business is weak where' Sydney business is strong. The officers in Sydney know what the business is there, and the officials in the Melbourne office are familiar with the business here, with the result that the public do not suffer; yet, when we seek to provide in' advance for public wants, we are met by curious contrasts in the habits of people doing business with the Post Office in two. of our principal cities not a thousand miles apart. The expansion of the business of. the Department is shown in this report. I am able to add one line to the figures, on page 16, in the table relating to the increase of expenditure in each financial year. It cannot be said that there has been a steady increase, because, as the second column shows, the expenditure,, although it has steadily gone up, has increased in a different ratio.' But it may be worth remembering that, whilst in 1906-7, the total expenditure of the Department, including new works and buildings, was under ,£3,000,000, this House has most liberally voted, for the same purpose, for the present financial year, only ^3JOOO short of .£3,500,000. That is to say,' during the financial year just closing, the expenditure authorized on the DepartThe earlier percentages of this increase range up to 61 per cent - the increase for 1906-7. The increased expenditure this year has been 17.93, just short of 18 per cent. The remarkable increase in busi-' ness, and the demands of the public on the post-office, have produced most generous grants.",33
179,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What is the ratio of the increase in expenditure, as compared with the increase of revenue?",33
180,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is shown in another part of the table, but the figures for last year are not given.",33
181,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Since last year the revenue has increased by only 6 per cent.,33
182,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"As against an increase of 10 per cent, for the year before, and of 7 per cent, for the preceding year.",33
183,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am not quite sure of my figures, but I shall look them up. . - Mr DEAKIN - Before leaving thisquestion of the possibility of forecasting the expansion of business, may I remind* honourable members that when the toll telephone system was introduced, all our critics predicted failure; every one said' that the public would not respond, and"" that the effect of it would be to check the growth of the telephone business.",33
184,Mr LIDDELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Did not that forecast come from the newspaper offices, and big. business houses, rather than from the general public?",33
185,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"A number of deputations, which, I presume, echoed, as deputations often do, the opinions of the newspapers, also waited on the Minister.  cf Defence was Acting Postmaster-General, he was waited on by a big deputation of citizens of Brisbane, who asked that thetolt system should not be introduced.",33
186,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Chamber s of Commerce passed resolutions in opposition to it ; public meetings condemned it, and newspapers were filled with denunciations of the proposal, which, it was said, would check, the growth of the telephone system. . Instead of doing so, it has operated as a most remarkable stimulus, and a great number of the difficulties with which the management of the telephone branch is now. confronted, are due to the extra public demand for telephones under the toll system-.",33
187,Mr THOMAS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,When are the Government going to bring all under that system ? A lot of wealthy people are still under the flat-rate system.,34
188,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Many are still under it, but some have chosen to change to the toll system. The applications for telephone connexions, under the new system, are four times as great as under the old.

189,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I find that the increase in the revenue of the Department this year, as compared with last year, is 5.6 - per cent., whilst the increase of expenditure, if we allow for one-tenth of the additions and new works, is 11.5 per cent.",34
190,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I took into account all the expenditure on new works now made available. It represents money that' Parliament has voted, and I am looking at the question just now from the stand-point of parliamentary liberality. *",34
191,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Then this does not represent the whole expenditure ?,34
192,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We cannot say until the end of June what the actual expenditure for this financial year will be. There aresure to be large savings. we place a finger upon the cause of the complaints and difficulties fhat have arisen in connection .with the Post and Telegraph Department, Irecur once more, for another purpose, to the distinction to be drawn between the Ministerial responsibility of the Government and the responsibility of Parliament. When the proposal for a Royal Commission was submitted by the honourable member for Gwydir- a proposal which I am not going to discuss in the slightest degree, even inferentially-Minister s met it by saying that to their knowledge the pressure of new business had disclosed to them certain weak joints in the Post Office armour, which they themselves, within their administrative powers, had sufficient authority to remedy; in regard to a great many of the leakages, they could stop the leaks, and they could re-adjust the plates of the 'armour, so that sundry joints should no longer remain weak. The position the Government took was that their obligation as a Government was to accomplish this work first, it being within reach of their hands and in the line of their direct responsibility. It was their clear duty, before any Royal Commission was appointed, to do as much as was possible, with the powers they possessed, so that little or nothing would remain in merely administrative work to be done or decided for them.",34
193,Mr WEBSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Hear , hear.",34
194,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,".I am glad that the honourable member most concerned admits that this is how our casewas put. We submitted to the House that we could not be relieved of that responsibility, and that, if a Royal Commission were appointed just at the time when this work was being done, the result might be to postpone it ; and that though a Royal Commission would relieve us of responsibility, it would not permit the public to obtain promptly the services they rightly desire. A Commission is always a great relief to any Government for the time it lasts. It affords a very convenient interregnum in most cases. As I have said, I do not propose to discuss the merits of the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir, even indirectly. But this report-wit h its record' of those reforms actually made, and its concluding five proposals for reform which the Government intend to submit to Parliament-represent s When our discharge of our duty - to the fullest extent that has been possible in the time at our disposal.

I quote the report of the speech of the Postmembers master-General on page 1.0416 of Hansard, where he practically commences his to the honourable member for GwydirThe Government tire not opposing the ment of a Royal Commission at this stage because they entertain the faintest objection to the fullest inquiry into both the work the officers of the Postal Department and into mentary government. its administration.

Nothing could be more emphatic than that as to the intention of the Go1 vernment, and nothing could be more conenstitutional than the attitude of the Governof ment in regard to the proposal. I mightcall attenltion to the fact that in the Mother Country, within'the last few years, there been quite a succession of Select Com- mittees appointed to inquire into the adto ministration of the British Post Office. These Committees were mostly, if not all, we appointed on the nomination of Ministers who adopted this means of assisting themselves in the work of administration; and from this is not a new principle. Honourable will recollect those passages in Todd, with which I have recently been rereply freshing my memory, in which he points out that Royal Commissions are nowadays directly helpful to Ministers, appointare recognised as a part of our governmental machinery, and are rendering inof valuable service in the working of parliaThese are strong statements; and the frequency of their apcomplication may be gauged from the fact that Campbell-Bannerman Government, when it took office recently, appointed no than sixseparate Commissions - in the first year of its existence.",35
206,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Did the BritishGovernment pay any respect to the recommendations of those Commissions?,36
207,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,My knowledge of British politics is not ample enough to enable me to say. Their neglect is but one of their obvious disabilities.,36
208,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Our own experience is that the Government do not pay respect to the - recommendations of Royal Commissions ,36
209,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The British Government do not appoint Royal Commissions at the point of the bayonet.,36
210,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes ; even that has lieen done. I found, to my surprise, on looking through Todd, that a British Gor vernment has appointed Royal Commissions on a resolution of the House, against which the Government voted, and on which they were defeated-Todd , Vol. II . , page 94, note s . Mr Reid - But what was the subject of inquiry?",36
211,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,-Was it a Commission to inquire into the Government's - own administration ?,36
212,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I refer to Todd. There is no .doubt that not' only will the appointment of a Royal Commission in this - case be perfectly regular, but such bodies of inquiry are of inestimable service in the working of parliamentary government, are directly helpful to Ministers, and a recognised part of the Government machinery. Todd lays down the several restrictions which should .be imposed on them. One of these precisely justifies the ground which we took when the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir was tabled, namely, that the motion ought not to be adopted so far as or while it implied .an evasion of Ministerial responsibility. Until the Government had themselves coped - with the difficulties in the Department to the utmost extent of their power, we were not justified in consenting to the ment of a Royal Commission. But when we had made a searching investigationhad marshalled the facts, and shown every point to which attention had been directed, - stating them without selection or restriction-whe n we had. given honourable members an opportunity of examining the results of the whole of' the inquiries which had been made--when , in point of fact, we had accepted full responsibility in so far as it could be made operative then and there-the n and not until then, it became legitimate for us to accept the proposal the appointment of a Royal Commission.",36
213,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Hear , hear !",36
214,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Government have not only fulfilled their, responsibilities as an Administration, but we have qualified ourselves, and are qualifying ourselves, to prepare the scope of the Royal Commission's inquiry in such a manner as shall direct attention, in the first instance, to the most, important and most grave of the questions requiring to be dealt with. When a Royal Commission is appointed, it is very undesirable that it should be launched on what may be called a merely roving commission. It is much better, as far as possible, to focus attention upon the known difficulties discovered by a careful study of the Department from within', and a classification of the complaints from without; such service the Government will be presently able to render when it appoints the Commission. At the same time, I hold that a Royal Commission is a. body of such dignity and authority that it would be improper to lock any door in its face, saying, "" Behind that door you shall not look or inquire."" It is the duty of the Government to indicate where the services of the Royal Commission will be most valuable to the public and to the Department.",36
215,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is it intended to limit the Royal Commission entirely to the postal service ?,36
216,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"To the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services-the whole of the group of services under the Postmaster-General.",36
217,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,No other Department?,36
218,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No other Department, except in its relation to the Post Office; The inquiry to which the honourable member for Fremantle has referred was made in America in regard to every Department.",36
219,Mr HEDGES,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And so should the proappoint- posed Royal Commission here.,36
220,Mr GROOM,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In America, it was a departmental inquiry by departmental officers.",36
221,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We have no other Department, the difficulties of which resemble those of the Post Office. The Post Office, with its allied services, is, though a branch of the Public Service, in ' many respects apart, and is brought into association with the public and other Departments in a different manner from its fellow Departments. Consequently, the proposed Commission will be directed in the way I have infor dicated. As I have said, we are continuing the inquiries ""which the Cabinet Committee commenced. The Minister is pursuing his investigations as he has done consistently from the first; and we hope to direct the Commission, as, indeed, the report itself indicates, on certain special lines, with which the Cabinet itself cannot hope to deal. Todd makes an allusion to the fact that, in later' times, it has been found impossible for Ministers to sustain their whole burden of responsibility for the general, conduct of parliamentary and other business, and during the same period to pursue and complete inquiries involving departmental examination and extended studies of particular issues of magnitude. He points out that the growing tendency in the Mother Country is to increase the use of Select Committees and Royal Commissions for these purposes. To that I have ^already incidentally alluded. At this stage I wish to interpolate a small table which does not appear in the Committee's report, with a view to showing the increases which have taken place in Post Office business between 1901 and 1906. Since then, there has been a. very great further expansion. The table' is as followsMoney Orders ... ... 21 p. c. Postal Notes ... ... 76 p. c. .. Postal Articles ... ... 32 p. c. Telegraph ... ... 2^ p. c. ... 30 p. c. Telephone Exchanges ... - ... 112 p. c. Telephone Lines .. - .;. 119 p. c.'",36
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But the total increase during the five years averages only 5| per cent.,37
223,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not know how the honourable member arrives at that conclusion. It does not apply to telephones or postal notes.,37
224,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What is crease in the number of employees during that period?,37
225,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In 1901 the employees numbered less than 16,000, and in 1007 more than 22,000! In other words, there has been an increase in the number of hands of 6,700-a n increase of more than 40 per cent.",37
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is a large increase.,37
227,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Then there is an additional increase of 15 per cent, for the current year.  increase 55 per cent. ?",37
228,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Includin g this year.,37
229,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Takin g the variousservices of the Department, .the increase in the number of employees is in vastly greater ratio than is the increase in the revenue returned.",37
230,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"So it must continue to be if we are to ,have any regard to the _ telephone service, now extending so rapidly. '",37
231,Mr LIDDELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Has the expansion of that service injured the telegraph service in any way?,37
232,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It has made its development slower in certain respects - When 1 diverged, I was alluding to the various problems with which the Cabinet have been unable to grapple through want of time and opportunity. Perhaps it will be best for me to commence with the most general question of complaints. These are still coming in, and we are not in a position to say how far they cover serious or slight grievances. Probably those affecting the employees will make the least demand upon the time of those charged with conducting this inquiry. The case for the employees, so. far as they are asking for an alteration in the Public Service Act - and regulations, and for a Value. Number. different method for the trial of offences, .. - however important these may be to them,, - can be set out by their representatives with.. - out occupying any considerable amount of time. To find a solution' of this problem, which will be acceptable ' to the House, may be extremely difficult, but its statement ought not to occupy very long. Then there is the question of.the extension of services in country districts. Although there are wide divergencies in Australia, still the conditions 'obtaining in outlving parts very closely resemble each other, and in this connection, even, . an elaboration the in- of .the evidence how those services can be best and most economically extended, ought not to take long.",37
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,No answer can be given to a question of that sort which will' apply to all time.,37
234,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But an answer can begiven which will apply for a. certain number of years. The evidence which will heforthcoming upon this matter-althoug h nodoubt it will vary with localities-need ' not. be great in mass. The difficultiescan be easily stated-the real diffi- culty will be how to solve them. But I come now to two questions which involve very complex issues, and whichv will require most careful consideration. These are the precise financial provisions that ought to be adopted, and the question of the re-organization of the Department having special regard to the proposals made by - theSecretary of the Postmaster-General's Department, and toy the Public Service Commissioner. . They suggest-the one directly; and the other indirectly-that some limitation of political control should be introduced into the Department. The question of the financial policy to be preferred in connection with - the Department, was brought before this House in the early years, of Federation, when Sir George Turner, as Treasurer of the Barton Government, submitted his proposal to continue the old State practice of borrowing money to carry out what might fairly be described as reproductive works. Amongst other things, this report calls attention to the fact that when we took over the telegraph and telephone services from the States, a number of them were far behind the time, and f e l l far short of the then requirements of the public, whilst a good deal of their machinery was out of - date. Sir George Turner, hesitating to make a stronger advance, submitted proposals to .meet these deficiencies by the old method of borrowing, which I think had been followed in every State. That proposal was-deliberately rejected-by this Parliament, which resolved that expenditure upon the Post Office must be defrayed out of revenue. Since then, large sums have been voted by Parliament from year to vear, in order to permit of the construction of reproductive works which, prior to Federation, were paid for out of loan moneys.",37
235,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Does not the Prime Minister think that some estimate of the cost of those works should be made, and attributed to annual expenditure? .",38
236,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Certainly , they require to be clearly distinguished. Our new services are continuously growing, particularly the telephone service, which is becoming a necessity of modern life, and the capacity. of which is only yet dimly perceived. There are those who speak with authority who tell us that we are not far from the time when these great States will find it possible to connect by telephone all their centres-eve n those of relatively small importance. This means expensive equipment, expensive switch-boards, and .expensive instruments, as well as a great increase in the annual amount paid to employees.",38
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It means nothing immediately.,38
238,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It does. To-day the demand for telephones is not, being met, and the demands for switch-boards, even in our principal offices are not nearly supplied. We are overwhelmed with demands for greater facilities, the total cost of which has been set down by departmental heads at over £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually for three years - a sum of more than £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Whether that estimate is an adequate one, we are not in a position to say. But if we do accept the view that this expenditure is necessary, and that the Commonwealth, in discharging its obligations to its customers, must face it , Ave shall have the problem which was submitted by Sir George Turner brought forward again in a new form, i doubt whether there are any honourable members here who would support a return to the old borrowing policy, even for carrying out reproductive works. But we might consider the question whether we ought not to put at the disposal of the Post Office, such - a sum as the British Post Office has found necessary for its operations, conducted in that country by means of a system of terminable annuities. Under that system, the money is being, so to speak, repaid from one source as fast as 0 it is being expended in another ",38
239,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is only one way of borrowing.,38
240,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"But it is borrowing a sum which, if Parliament is consistent, does not increase its total. Mr W. H. IRVINE - It is borrowing with a regular sinking fund.",38
241,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"U n d e r that system, the indebtedness never becomes greater, the money being repaid as fast as it is spent.",38
242,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The system has been tried in Australia, and in practice that did not prove to be the case.",38
243,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The system has existed a long time in the Mother Country.,38
244,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Can any analogy be instituted between the two countries in the matter of their rapiditv of expansion?,38
245,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No . Our problem is entirely different. We have to make precedents for ourselves, and no analogy can be instituted between a small country like Great Britain, with its largepopulation, and a large country like Australia, with its extremely small and scattered population.",38
246,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is more difficult here.,38
247,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes . Nevertheless we must face the situation. Can we increase our expenditure out of revenue sufficiently to keep pace with demands for necessary, but costly services, or can we invent some .system which will enable Parliament to finance reproductive works, or a certain proportion of their cost, and yet avoid the evils and risks of borrowing discovered by the experience of the States?",39
248,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We cannot d r a w on the future without borrowing in some way.,39
249,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If we provide for repayments within fixed periods, with adequate sinking funds, we can have at hand each year aconsiderable sum for necessary expenditure.",39
250,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What the honourable gentleman proposes is to borrow, but to provide proper sinking funds?",39
251,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes . The Cabinet has glanced at several aspects of this problem, but has not had time to find a solution. Were the approaching recess to be of the usual duration, were it like those which ordinarily follow a session such as this, to last for live or six months",39
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What is the usual recess of the Commonwealth Parliament? I do not know.,39
253,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I admit that there is not a usual recess, though when the right honourable member for East Svdney was in power, we had a recess of over six months. Mr 'REID - There should be a settled course of business, and a regular recess.",39
254,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I agree with the right honourable member. Were such a recess in piospect, we should have an opportunity of dealing with this problem, which must be examined in the light of expert criticism, and after the careful scrutiny, of departmental practice, so'that proposals for expenditure may not be made a cloak for departmental. extravagance. Having discovered that a certain sum is needed for expenditure on reproductive works, the financial position would require consideration, and it can properly be referred to the body which the Government proposes to create. I may mention here a matter involving a considerable outlay in quite another direction-the questions affecting the employees under division' VII . , alluded to in paragraph 96, sub-paragraph 2. The report recommends-and the proposal has the sanction of the Public Service Commissioner, so that it can be put into force at once-that one of the chief sources of dissatisfaction among the employees in the general division, who comprise by far the most numerous class, could be removed by providing long service increments. Promotions amongst these men are very few, and occur only at long intervals, and it is suggested that for good and f a it h f u l service two long service increments should be given to all really deserving officers in this grade,. bringing their incomes, when they reach maturity, to £ 1 5 0 per annum, even without promotion. I think that Parliament will consider that proposal reasonable and moderate. It is just to the public, which finds the money, and fair to those who, having been in the service a large number of years, cannot seek other employment. Their duties, although almost mechanical, are highly responsible, since, they are entrusted with the delivery of letters and packets affecting in a thousand and one ways the business and other transactions of our citizens. This is one of the most important recommendations in the report, and shows the advantage of bringing together those concerned, and inducing the final consideration or a long-standing grievance. The other grave question, with which the Cabinet could not grapple without a long recess, concerns the questions associated with organization. The Post Office, although a Government Department, is essentially in all its branches a commercial institution. It earns its vast revenues by means of the smallest payments, and con. cerns the maximum number of persons affected by any Department. Its organization-the conduct of its business needing adequate supervision-is a great, problem, whose difficulty will increase as the number of the employees grows and the demand upon its services extends. The uses to which the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services are put today are,, we are assured, but small in comparison with those to which they will be put in the future. How then can efficiency be best secured ? A suggestion made in this connection has been that Commissioners be appointed analogous to the Railways Commissioners of the States.",39
255,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,This Department differs from the Railways.,39
256,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There are great possibilities in the appointment of Commissioners, and, when the inquiry commenced, I expected to - receive evidence' which would materially strengthen my inclinations in this direction. But I found, when the subject was carefully examined, first that there is no precedent for the introduction of such a system in connection with post office administration anywhere, and next my - attention was drawn to the great difference between the powers conferred on their different sets of Commissioners by the Railways Acts of the States. viously, too, the business of the Railways differs from that of the Post Office. It is largely technical. Most of the railway employees belong to the General Division, and are skilled men, the clerical class being small in comparison. Themen are concentrated along fixed lines, and perform a definite and precise service. But in the Post Office one.is confronted, not only with problems such as those arising in railway management, but also with many others totally different in different branches, while the employees, mainly clerical, are scattered over the whole Commonwealth-here , there, and everywhere.",39
257,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,A great deal of the work of the Post Office is technical.,40
258,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I admit that.. considering this matter, it is important to begin by examining the various Railways Acts to ascertain how their provisions could be applied to our circumstances. It is plain that the system of Western Australia, under which authority is vested first in the Minister and then in the Commissioner, though most like that of South Australia, differs from it , and is widelv apart from those of. Victoria and New South Wales, where the powers of the Commissioners the largest. Which precedent to follow, and how much of any particular scheme adopt, becomes a complex question.",40
259,Mr JH CATTS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Criticis m upon gotion vernment by Commissioners should be dicovers rected largely to the Acts under which any construction. particular Commissioners are appointed.,40
260,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is difficult tangle from the experience of the States precedents which it would be desirable for the Commonwealth to follow. more, the public is apt to be misled most grievously if it supposes that the so-called ""independent"" Commissioners are in any sense independent. Let us consider, first, in regard to mail contracts. their position in regard to finance.. A Trea-surer must cut his coat according to his cloth; the expenditure of any one year must be determined largely by its revenue. Parliament's control of finance is lute, even in regard to the Railways whose management has been delegated to Commisof sioners. It votes certain sums, and in many on subjects elating to them. instances determines the particular application of the expenditure. If finance is government and government is finance, the so called independent Railways Commissioners are absolutely under the control of the Parliaments and Governments of the States. Their operations cannot be Ob- carried on without the consent of the Parliaments to which they are . subject. Similarly, any Commissioners appointed tr> administer the Post and Telegraph Department would be subject, . in matters of .finance, to parliamentary control. The Treasury control is now being complained of as if the Treasurer always had either an inexhaustible purse or a fixed income. Criticisms, too, often owe all their point to the facts that are suppressed'.",40
261,Mr HEDGES,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Furthermore , the Railways are not all controlled by any' one head.",40
262,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It would be a bad look-out for remote districts if they were.,40
263,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Let us consider, next, questions concerned with construction. The In making of railways is absolutely in - the hands of the State Parliaments, and be-' yond the control of the Railways Commissioners - If we are to apply this precedent to the Post Office, if the Commissioners are to have nothing to say with regard to extensions of telephone lines, telegraph wires, - or mail services, their powers will be very limited.",40
264,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"They might as are well put up the sign "" To let.""",40
265,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not say that; but to do not Jet us be misled into believing that the word ""Commissioners,"" in.relato the railway services of the States, independent control' of finance or Mr HENRY WiLLis --They have full to disencontrol. of the administration.",40
266,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I want .to show how . small that is' relatively. Before coming to Furtherwhat is sometimes called maintenance, might I point to the exact parallel between the railways and the Post Office at present in the procedure followed in this House Every mail contract of any importance, and particularly an oversea mail contract, is specially dealt with by Parliament, and deaft with, so to speak, absolutely outside the' Post absoand Telegraph Department. The advice of its officers is received just as the advice officers of other Departments is received, But this Parliament keeps absolute control directly - over all large mail services,- and indirectly over all others. . ",40
267,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am showing that the parallel between the Post Office and the Railways is complete, and that this control would not be affected by placing the Department under Commissioners. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The will be decreased by the appointment of these Commissioners, since we shall have to pay big salaries.",41
268,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"As to revenue, in most, if not all of the States, the rates and charges that may be made on the railways are fixed by regulations that require Ministerial approval, and must be gazetted. Thus, the income of the Railways is also under directparliamentary control.",41
269,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The appointment of Commissioners simply means finding more billets for outside roosters. Mr © EAKIN - I do not take that view ; but want to come to the real question at issue. I am pointing out the existing restrictions in connection with railway services under the direction of Commissioners. The pay of State railway employees, their rights of appeal, and the terms of their promotion, are also fixed byStatutes. Where they, are not, they are fully defined by regulations under Ministerial control. In all these matters, there- fore, the Railways Commissioners from independent.",41

272,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No ; but they are not always approved. The Victorian Act suggestions, has been f r u it f u l specifically reserves to the Government power to lay down a policy which the Railways Commissioners are obliged to low. The Government are also vested with authority to require the Commissioners furnish a scheme to meet the needs of particular policy, and if such a scheme not forthcoming, or an unsatisfactory is presented, the Ministry may lay down.a scheme for .itself.",41
273,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Provide d the Treasuggestion sury supplies the money to give effect that scheme.,41
274,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Exactly . give these illustrations possibly because for more than seven years having had no association with State politics, the relatively small area to which the Railways Commissioners are restricted, and the slightextent to which the familiar term ""independent Commissioners,"" may be properly applied to them, had passed from my mind. When we .were met with the suggestion that Commissioners might be found useful in connection with this Department, revenue we proceeded to make inquiries, and, so far as we could ascertain, Commissioners could be useful only under the same restrictions imposed in connection with State railways, and perhaps some others which it would be necessary to impose, because of the peculiar character of the work done by this Department. In point of fact, the Committee have touched the right key-npte m suggesting the desirableness of further inquiry as to whether a useful function might not be found - for Commissioners in this Department, if it is to be foundat all, in dealing with the workof the present central office, on a somewhat different plan. The title of ""Commissioners"" may or may not be conferred upon such officers.",41
275,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Is not the honourable gentleman anticipating the work of the proposed Royal Commission?..,41
276,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"T am trying to show that this great problem has only been approached, to a certain extent, by the Ministry, and that it remains for a future Royal Commission to deal with it.",41
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is all set out are far in the report. Why belabour it ,41
278,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is not. When this rereport came before the Cabinet, we had to take into consideration the paragraph in which the Committee expressed its views on this particular subject, and the House is entitled to know to what extentthe consideration; given by the Cabinet to these - Those who the' do me the honour of reading my speech will realise that this problem is not to be folsettled, as many might have thought, without making full inquiry into the particular to functions allotted to the Railways Coma missioners'. Before making such an examibe nation, I should have been inclined to proone nounce much more dogmatically upon the limits of their functions than I am upon this question. The only point at which the seemed to us to touch the problem to at once was in connection with . the present central - office. That office is central, since it receives communications from all I am led to parts of the Commonwealth, and sends directions and instructions to officers all over Australia. The adoption of the proposals made in this report, for altering the mentary channels to and from it which have been followed, will save weeks, of time. It will enable work to be done without delay.",41
279,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is a wonder that this discovery was not made before, since it all appears so simple.",42
280,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Simila r changes have been going on from time to time - These are the last relics of the systems of six different States which' have been taken _ over, and have to be adapted to new contain, ditions. _",42
281,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Did the three Ministers make the discovery ?,42
282,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Thei r attention was called to the necessity for some of these changes, and they found .that others desirable. W",42
283,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,All this was well known-.,42
284,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"This is what has happractical pened in the United States. There, as we were recently reminded, a Commission was appointed to inquire into the business methods of the Government Departments, and, as the result of its report, many provements have been made. I dare that the desirability of making some of these alterations has been recognised; hut officers have had. to wait for the portunity to make them. Returning to the question of the appointment sioners. I would point out that the tary to the Post Office under the Post and Telegraph Act is the chief officer of Department, and is endowed with special powers. But he is tied fast to the Seat of Government, and overwhelmed consideration with mountains of correspondence. consequence is that, although we have fortunate in having as the occupant of office a gentleman of high character, great ability, and long experience, he has been called upon to deal with all the new blems ofFederation with no guide, but that of his past personal experience and branch.. now of correspondence ",42
285,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He has tied up the to the Department? Deputy Postmasters-General fairly tight.,42
286,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"-They have been given a great deal more authority than most them have used. They have-some ground for pointing out, however, that this is to the fact that this being a central liament, its members ""demand to be supendowed plied, and supplied promptly, with inforcalled mation of every transaction relating to the Department throughout the Commondocuwealth, and that consequently everything that transpires has to be registered in the - central office. If the work of decentralization is not yet complete that may. be in part due to this fact and to the possibilities of the new system not having been grasped. It may also be because' here, as in England, a great part of the time of our chief officers is taken up in replying to inquiries in Parliament or some of the the bodies appointed by it. Mr Austin Chamberlain, Postmaster-General ot Great Bri'said recently that a third of the time - _ of his principal officers was occu'pied in preparing answers to questions in the House of Commons, which relatively are much less frequent? and searching than they are here, and apply to a very small were area as compared with Australia. When e call to mind these facts we must recognise what a heavy burden is imposed on the central office. It seemed to us that a question for inquiry and discussion is whether the central office cannot be remodelled in such a way as to make it a more effective means of co-operation with the Ministry and Parliament.

These officers would full y examine, as well as conduct, the work of the Department, quite irrespective of complaints, but, at the - same time, would be able to deal with complaints, and to settle many minor ones on the spot.

That is a question we found ourselves unable to decide, but it seemed to promise a f r u it f u l field for inquiry. have occupied more time than I intended, but when one comes to close grips with this Department, one sees its great opportunities. We have been at close grips with it, - almost without intermission, for four or five weeks, and are better equipped than we werefor dealing with the broad general question. I think that I must at least have satisfied honourable members opposite that there was not the faintest tinge of party motive in my proposal to put this statement before Parliament. There is nothing; in it that will deflect any censure that they may choose to pass upon us now or when the honourable member ""for Gwydir's motion comes up for - consideration. It has contained nothing aggressive.. Had we been fortunate enough to dispose of the Tariff to-night, and the honourable member's motion had come on tomorrow morning, I should have at once risen, and made this speech, adding certain other matter relating to the particular proposal, which is not called for now.",42
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The member would have said more.,43
290,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I should have added something more, but should have said' all that I have said to-night, by way of assisting the House to understand the attitude of the Government, and what our - proposals are.",43

292,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No ; the only opportunity I had of presenting it was while the Tariff was under consideration here; otherwise, I should have made the. statement then. Precedence was given to 'the Tariff, and this is the firstopportunity I have had of making a statement. Although I did not propose to discuss the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir, I have not been able altogether to avoid references to it or to the motion of the honourable member for Robertson. I have not, however, dealt directly with either of these proposals; but if the Standing Orders had not been suspended, the honourable member for Robertson would have been perfectly right in taking the objection that I was unintentionally cutting into his ground - ",43

298,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We have to find our . own experience and make our own precedents, exceptfor expert officers in the technical branches of the service. The Government must take the responsibility of selecting the members of the Commission, although, of course, we shall be pleased to be in touch with every part of the House and hear any representations that may be made. As I have said, the Commission will honourable be as definite in terms as we can make it in regard to the subjects I have mentioned, and, perhaps, one or two others, which are still under consideration and examination -. The Royal Commission - will, therefore, start with a clear direction, so far as the Government can give one, aided by the officers of the Department, to the. points which can be most profitably investigated. The order of procedure and methods must necessarily be left with the members of the Commission; but the Government will be able to give the direction I - have indicated, and also .be ready to proceed from time to time with any proposals upon which it will be necessary to seek legislative authority. The Government propose, also, to keep in touch with the Royal Commission as far as possible, to carry out small reforms as they may be discovered to be necessary. Of course,-the Government will take the Commission into its confidence so far as it can in orderthat we may avoid the risks which attend, or have attended, Royal Commissions in the past. The scattering of their operations and their extension over an unconsciously long period of time, owing to their first dealing with one aspect of the inquiry and then another without concluding either at the time, often occasions delay in carrying out changes which appear to be of advantage to the public. I have already alluded to the fact that Royal Commissions form a necessary pail of modern Governments of our type; and I should have added,' at the same time, that such Commissions are open to special dangers, as we have already discovered. To go no further, we have had instances in the States of Royal Commissions operating as a real block to any advance: we have seen large c sums'spent upon inconsiderable returns, and large volumes of evidence acquired which have ultimately proved of comparatively small value.",43
299,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And we have seen the recommendations of Royal Commissions disregarded !,44
300,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We have seen such recommendations repeatedly disregarded. I am not blind to the disadvantages of Royal Commissions; and these we were bound to consider when confronted by the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir. With the help of the report of the Cabinet Committee, and of the suggestions and proposals which have been made, we hope to have a business-like Royal Commission, working in and through the Department, in order to get into closer touch with public affairs, to remove any legitimate gnevances, to insure from the employees their whole-hearted support in return for the generous consideration paid to them, and so that public confidence may be restored to a great national institution which plays so large a part in our life. It is about to play a larger part. There are measures to come before the House shortly of great importance to Australia, in which the Post Office will discharge a most importantfunction. There are other measures, which we more or less foresee, that will add to the usefulness of the Department as a great public agency. Consequently, at a time when we are not only rushed with new business in our* existing services, but when there is the prospect of enlarged functions, the evidence which has been accumulated by my-colleagues in this Report, set forth in sentences which make no pretension to polish, but which have been compressed as much as possible",44
301,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What do I understand the Prime Minister tomean when he speaks of the Royal Commission "" working in and through "" the Postal Department?",44
302,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"E very such Commission must work in the Department regarding which it is making' inquiries; and by "" through the Department "" I mean the recommending and carrying out from time - to time of reforms which, though they may be comparatively small, are, I am informed, amongst the most immediately useful. When any reform of the kind is necessary and practical, the Royal Commission will not, I am sure, hesitate to work through the Department, without waiting until a long report is presented containing everything at once. In short^ the idea is to have progress reports, in order that certain reforms may be carried out as their necessity becomes evident.",44
303,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,-The Royal Commission may become permanent.,44
304,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the Royal Commission can justify itself, it may well become permanent; but, judging by what we know of such questions, I see no reason why the whole inquiry should not be disposed of shortly after this year. It could riot be disposed of this year, owing to the time which will be taken up by parliamentary duties. If it is necessary to visit outlying paxts of the Commonwealth, there would only be the forthcoming short recess in which to dothat work. There will, however, be a. longer recess next year; and I think the Royal Commission might finish its labours before the meeting of Parliament next year.",44
305,Mr HEDGES,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What is the Prime Minister's intention in regard to the progress reports ? Does he propose to lay them before the House for consideration?,44
306,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"When the reports refer ' to purely administrative matters, the Government .will deal with them, but when they go beyond that point, they will be laid before the House in connection with legislation. Mr WI'SE - Will the - personnel of the Royal Commission be purely political?",44
307,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am asked whether the members of the Royal Commission will be selected from the members of both Houses. I am not able to answer the question absolutely; but, so far as I can judge, having looked into a number of suggestions for the appointment of outside persons, have found none which would justify the cost involved. Mr KING 'O'MALLEY - We have the best business men in the country in this House.",44
308,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We desire the best business advice and suggestions, and we can get them in evidence; but we wish the report to be governed by the recollection of good the fact with which I commence and conis clude, namely, that the Post Office is a sire to fritter away. national institution, and, while we keep vigilant eye on its operations from financial point of view, nothing will sacrificed to that governing consideration.",45

But if the Prime ister desired to dull the edge of the dissatisfaction with the working of this great Department either in this House in the country, he will undoubtedly fail accomplish hispurpose. The most comFederal plete and crushing proof of the bad ministration of this Department is to found in the official document which laid upon the table of the House two ago. That document is supposed to sent the conclusions which were arrived by three Ministers as the result of a liminary survey of the working of this Department. In so far as those conclu* sions are confessions of bad administraby tion, we may accept them implicitly, cause they are confessions made by the Ministers themselves, including the ter at the head of the Postal Department. Upon a former occasion the Prime Minister endeavoured to show nor his colleagues are responsible for the condition of the Post and Telegraph [414]- 2 partment. Surely he presumes too much I upon the complaisance of honourable members when he thinks that we are so ignorant of 'the first principles of the system of government under which we live.

That is the main-cause of all the troubles which afflict it- a of a proper supply of money to cope with its growing emergencies. Instead of treatciently ing the Department in a patriotic and cious way, and upon the lines so beautifully described by the Prime Minister, instead of carrying out the ideas which he so easily expresses, a policy of absolute starvation has been applied to this great Department when its revenue has been increasing leaps and bounds.",45

There has been a perception of it in rhetoric, but no perception of it has been, evidenced by the adoption of business methods. How do business men prepare for increased business ? Ministers are seventh. helpless enough to say, as if it were a of misfortune, that the increased business has arisen from cheapening the facilities provided by the Department. Does that conclusion require .the exercise of any genius of statesmanship? Could not an ordinary shopkeeper in the streets of bourne come to the conclusion if he cheapened facilities with a view to increase his trade, a common-sense preable caution would be to prepare for the increased results that were expected to the flow from that policy ? It is a cheap to sort of statesmanship with which we in Australia are apparently to be contentthat when measures are framed for the distinct purpose of increasing the volume of want business of the Postal Department, the ordinary precautions of preparing to effideal with that increased business sagaare to be neglected.

Men of ordinary' business foresight would have provided for this increase.",46
325,Mr STORRER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Ha d Ministers done so, the Opposition would have charged them master-General. with extravagance.",47
326,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member's lo see it. interjections are generally sensible, but this is not. Paragraph 10 says thatThe want of adequate working space in Mail Branch has been recognised by the management for some time. It has been known to every man connected with the Department that, during the last two years at any rate, the want of space in the Sydney and Melbourne offices has made it - impossible to properly transact business. - Is it enough for Ministers to us that work cannot be done for want of space? Cannot the energy and abilityto say nothing of the rhetoric and poetryof the Prime Minister find useful vent grappling with practical business difficulwrong. ties ? There is plenty of space to be got, if the Ministers are prepared to pay for Why should this great Department be starved and demoralized until its adminisdisappeared. tration arrives at a state of chaos? The Prime Minister spoke of its business knocking at every door in Australia. His poetry may knock at every door in Australia, but certainly not his successful administration of business affairs; thathas not knocked at any door. Paragraph n contains a connext paragraphfession that the hardest-worked men in Department, the letter carriers of the city system of Sydney, have been suffering under a grievance for twelve yearsIn regard to the representations that the beats of the city letter-carriers in Sydney have not been re-arranged for the past twelve yearsWe know the growth of Sydney. That is a fact which might have pierced the dense comprehension of even.a Cabinet Minister; it is notorious to every other brain possessform ing the remotest knowledge of that cityand that the work is too heavy for the staff, the Postmaster-General has now directed that the strain should be relieved. In the most rapidly-growing capital of Australia men have been overworked for a period of twelve years-, and, after the honourable member for Gwydir, and others, have knocked repeatedly at the Ministerial door, the Postmaster-General has "" now "" directed that an antiquated system, affecting the delivery of letters to a population of 500,000 persons, shall be reformed. It could not be thought of before. The strain is to be relievedby the employment of temporary carriers. What a brilliant idea has come to the Post",47
327,Mr WATKINS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,He was the first man,47
328,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That shows' how blind his predecessors must have been. Were I in office, the honourable, member would not be the talking of the misdeeds of my predecessor. He would consider that his public duty required him to criticise the way in which the Department was being managed at the present time. Is not that the practical question which we have to consider? Why should my honourable friend. desire to divert attention from the main point? Surely tell Ministers are not endeavouring to shirk their responsibility in connection with the position of these letter carriers ?",47
329,Mr WATKINS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I agree with the right in honourable gentleman that things have been,47

333,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Public Service Commissioner is responsible, in that instance.",47
334,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Surely the Department has some power of initiative, and .does not hide behind the Public Service Commissioner? Its heads have the right to make recommendations. Still, I do not wish to discuss any matter which Parliament has placed under another authority, and I am obliged to the honourable member for South Sydney for the interruption. Coming to paragraph 14, we find thatThe Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, and other officers, state that three-fourths of the trouble in his State is due to want of funds to provide staffs and facilities asked for. The officer at the head of the New South Wales branch of this great Department knocks loudly at the Ministerial door, stating that his staff is not sufficient,' and asking for additional assistance; but the methods of Ministers are not worthy of a national Department. They are not equal to those of an enlightened business concern).",47
335,Mr HUGHES,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The attitude of the Premier of New South Wales does not favour increased expenditure.,48
336,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Mone y has been saved to the Governments of the States.,48
337,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Is that something of which we should approve? We are concerned now, not with the demands of the States, but with the administration of the Post Office.",48
338,Mr HUGHES,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I quite admit that.,48
339,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Paragrap h 16 contains a gross reflection on members of ParliamentThe Chief Officers admit that the powers vested in them are ample, but it is evident that the use of. these powers is largely nullified, owing to the frequency with which members of the public, through their representatives in Parliament, urge that matters which have been locally decided be reviewed by the Minister .and the Central Administration. That is a curious sort of complaint. Surely it is part of the duties of the representatives of the people to bring forward matters of this kind. The complaint in this Ministerial minute of a tired feeling' because it is done, is evidence of a state of things necessitating thorough inquiry. In paragraph 17 it is stated thatThe Secretary to the Postmaster-General's Department even goes so far as to say that there can be no approach to effective decentralization ""while the Department' js subject to political control under which every matter, however small, is liable to be brought under the immediate and personal no^ce of the Minister. In paragraph 20, we are told that It is practicable to greatly simplify the procedure followed under the Public Service Act and Regulations, and to increase the spending power of the Chief Officers in the States, to enable minor repairs to buildings to be more expeditiously, carried out. The investigation of a Ministerial Committee was not necessary to ascertain that fact. The regulations can be altered by Ministerial authority.",48
340,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Why did not the right honourable gentleman read the following paragraph, which says that it will be done immediately ?",48
341,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Exactly . I am obliged to the honourable member. Everything is now marked '' immediate.'',48
342,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But the right honourable gentleman forgot to say so.,48
343,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No . My complaint is that what should have been attended to sooner is to be attended to only now. One of the most extraordinary confessions of ineptitude which a Government could make was made when this Government showed that it thought that these troubles could be dealt with by a Ministerial sub-Committee. The ignorance of Ministers cannot be proved more clearly than by the way in which they proposed to deal with this gigantic Department, which certainly condemns them as men of no business capacity. In paragraph 44, we are told thatThe evidence of the Public Service Commissioner and the principal officers of the Postmaster-General's Department indicates that the cumbrous and costly procedure for 'dealing with offences of officers prescribed under section 46 of the Public Service Act renders the maintenance of discipline within the Service a matter of great difficulty. Surely the maintenance of discipline in such a service is of vital importance. It would have been simple enough, if there is a provision in the Act which imperils and destroys this discipline, to bring down an Amending Bill of one clause to remove it. Ministers confess that discipline has been impossible in an army of 20,000 men, and yet have not proposed to introduce legislation to make it possible. Paragraph 49 reveals one of the worse features of the Post Office muddle. Ministers, in assuming office, take on themselves the obligation, to stand, as the Prime Minister says, four-square, and ought not to endeavour to minimize their responsibilitiesby reflecting on a colleague. What sort cf code of Ministerial honour is observed by a Minister who endeavours to escape from his responsibility when trouble arises h connection with the administration of his Department, by publicly imputing that a colleague is the culprit-that it is owing to his colleague's parsimony that he is unable to conduct his Department with efficiency ? That is a most undesirable precedent to' establish in the public life of this country. Yet it is carried to an extreme to which I invite the attention of - honourable members. In appendix D to the progress report of the Cabinet Committee, the Go-, vernment absolutely point the finger of censure at the Treasurer. In that appendix we have a return showing to the shilling and the penny the amount which the Treasurer refused to grant to his colleague the Postmaster-General.",48
344,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Surely not.,49
345,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes . That appendix consists of a statement showing the staff asked for, the staff provided on the Estimates, and the reductions made during the last three years. In paragraph 49, it is stated that- ' The amount applied forin respect of the present financial year- . was considerably reduced by the Treasury in the Estimates in Chief. And appendix D shows the way-in which that reduction was made. Listen to the excuses which these Ministers offer. They talk in their poetic perorations about the administration of this' national Department in a broad spirit, without reference to the revenue received. But what does this paragraph showThe amount applied for was considerably reduced by the Treasury in the Estimates in Chief. For what reason? To promote the efficiency of the Department?",49
346,Mr STORRER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What Treasurer this?,49
347,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member's friend, the present Treasurer.",49
348,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No ; my cessor, the right honourable member for Swan.",49
349,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Then another old colleague is now ,to be thrown over. What a rjity it is that the Postmaster-General, when speaking on the occasion of the Sydney harbour picnic, was not good enough to state that it was the right honourable member for Swan/ and not the present Treasurer who was responsible for these reductions..",49
350,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have said that the speeches made on that occasion were riot reported.,49
351,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I did not prepare the Estimates.,49
352,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I am sure that the right honourable member did not. The master-General cannot be even commonly fair to the right honourable member for Swan. Honourable members know that the Estimates for 1907-8 were submitted by the present Treasurer on the night that he laid before the House the Tariff that we have been considering for months. Let the Minister be commonly fair to a former colleague.,49
353,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They were not prepared by the present Treasurer.,49
354,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Did not the present Treasurer-before submitting those Estimates to Parliament go carefully through them? I do not think he would be so mean as to make such a. statement. Whatever his faults are, he is not a crawler of that sort. The fact is that the present Treasurer submitted these Estimates to Parliament. At a time when the Department was disabled,"" and a source of universal dissatisfactiona!: a time when its employees' were cruelly overworked, the Postmaster-General asked that provision be made for an increase of hands, and the number he asked for, according to appendix D , was reduced by the Treasurer by no less than 545. The Department pointed out the trouble that it was in - I think that it wanted 1,100 additional hands-and the Treasurer, who is not generally so parsimonious, reduced the legitimate requirements of the Department in order to save £ 4 8 , 0 0 0. Honourable members will see that these statements by Ministers are the strongest condemnation they could offer to this House and the country of their deliberate mismanagement and starving of the Post and Telegraph Department at a time when it was clamourdid in r for an increased number of hands in t order to overcome its troubles. This is an extraordinary revelation to make. prede- Mr CARR - Does not the Public Service Commissioner deal with the question of the number of hands to be employed?

355,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And the Public Service Commissioner recommended that the number be cut down in. view of a possible drought.,49
356,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Public Service Commissioner is now offered up as the scapegoat. This is an extraordinary state of things. Surely if Ministers are impeded in the administration of'their Departments Postby the Public Service Commissioner, they can introduce an amending Act to rid them of that state of affairs. Are we to accept this lame excuse? ' If the Public Service Act gives the Commissioner too much power, alter it ; do not attack him.",49
357,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Are not the Estimates considered by the Cabinet? ,50
358,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Postmaster-General submitted these items to the Cabinet - of which he is a member, and that Cabinet and not the Public Service Commissioner cut them down. That being so, surely Ministers, cannot now turn round and say, "" Oh, the Public Service Commissioner was our obstacle."" I draw the attention of honourable members to paragraphs 52 and S3In addition to the amounts asked for on - Additional Estimates 1907-8 for the requireknights ments of that financial year, it was deemed in paragraph 54advisable, owing to the approach of the next financial year, to ask for a sum of ^304,435 for special works which .were urgently and provision for which would, in ordinarycircumstances, have been made on the Estimates for 190S-9, so that the work of carrying them out could be greatly facilitated by the formal preliminary steps of inviting tenders for the material and their construction, in anticipation of the amounts being passed by Parliament. The Treasurer, however, intimated the impossibility of this being done Why was it impossible? If more money I did that.. was required wh\ did not the Government submit Additional Estimates? What was member did. d6ne the other day when the urgency of the situation was at last realized by Ministers submitted Additional Estimates it. providing - for an appropriation of many thousands of pounds.

374,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Postmaster-General should remember that .in this case he cannot quote a sergeant of police for his authority. And may I suggest that it shows a very imperfect conception of the position of Ministers to forget that will the Estimates of Expenditure are always' revised by the Cabinet sitting collectively? I believe I am correct in taking, that view of the present Cabinet; but I am sure I am right in regard to other Cabinets, in saying that every Estimate of Expenditure is considered by the Cabinet in conjunction with the Ministers more immediately concerned. The Postmaster General was sitting at the Cabinet table : to tell his colleagues, as against the Treasurer, - that these men were absolutely required/, and to appeal to them to prevent the Treasurer crippling the Department. This singling out of one Minister as against another in the matter of culpability is. I think, an unusual and deplorable circumstance in public life.",50
375,Mr WATKINS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,All the Ministries have been guilty since 1905.,51

377,Mr WATKINS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Hear , hear; but why blame the present Ministers for the sins of past Ministers?",51

380,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Yes ; but in some cases it lives in an undiscovered country, while in others it is brought to light every day. I am happy to say that as regards my relations in public life, neither friends nor foes can say that I have been distinguished by bringing up the past in any series of attacks.",51
381,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The right honourable member brought up tthe police sergeant just now !,51
382,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not look on that as an occurrence of venerable antiquity, but as one in the official life of a present Minister ; the honourable gentleman cannot cut himself up into daily compartments of responsibility. In paragraph 54 of the report, we readIn the Additional Estimates 1907-8 the amount asked for by the Deputy Postmasters-General for staff contingencies . and new works amounting to ,£224,019 was reduced by £55.588. These works were absolutely necessary; but the expenditure was reduced in a fashion that might demoralize the Department in a thousand different ways. The Ministry have acted in a sort of cheeseparing fashion, in view of pressing public requirements, which are urged by the officials themselves; and yet the Government come before us now and enunciate such beautiful sentiments as those expressed ""by the Prime Minister this afternoon. Paragraph 57 is as follows.No delays in carrying out large works (buildings, renewals, maintenance, & c ) , under the control of the Department of Home Affairs, apart from those due to want of funds, are complained of by the chief officers of the Postmaster-General's Department, but there are difficulties and delays in dealing with minor repairs. .All the chief officers indict Ministers for starving the Department and preventing them doing their duty properly. It is only Ministers who can submit Estimates to Parliament; and if those who are at the May 1 head of the branches are denied the means of insuring good administration, it is rather unfair that they should be blamed. How can the officials carry on this great concern to the satisfaction of the public, if the sinews of war are denied them ?",51
383,Mr HUGHES,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Treasurer says that he had no more money. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Hear , hear!",51
384,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"And he says that now. In paragraph 76, we read- It was therefore impossible to commence many of the. works required to meet the public demands or improve the existing services. Then paragraph 81 is as f o l l o w s Under the system by which the funds for such works are provided by annual votes which must not be anticipated, and of which the balances, if any, cannot be carried forward into succeeding, years, it is impossible satisfactorily to carry out a comprehensive scheme of telegraphic or telephonic development. Here is an obstacle; and why? Because there is something in an Audit Act which prevents moneys voted in one year being spent ins future years.",51
385,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"This Government do not spend £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 without authoritv, as the right honourable member did.",51
386,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Treasurer cannot, I think, say that this House has ever refused any demand he has made for money for the purpose of putting the Post Office in a state of .efficiency; and it is mean to try to shift the responsibility for starving Department on to honourable members.",51
387,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member for North Sydney blamed me for introducing Estimates which we're, large.",52
388,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If honourable members will turn to appendix F, they will find a return referring to telegraphs and phones, and showing the amounts asked by each State during the last three years,"" and the amounts provided. In the last columns, which deal with the present it will be seen that the amount asked for was £337,467, while the amount provided was only £209,688. There is no difficulty in realizing how the officials have been prevented fromtreating their employees justlv. and providing proper facilities the public; and surely no Royal Commis-' sion is required to ascertain this one of trouble in the Department. I now demotion sire to turn from the report, which I gard as one of the most damning indictpresentative ments by Ministers of their own neglect, competence, and deliberate mismanagewas ment, and to deal with a position which was referred to by the Prime Minister. There arises here a very important constihundreds tutional point, upon which, however, I no desire to dwell, and shall only touch briefly. The Prime Minister enunciated the doctrine today that the motion of honourable member for Gwydir really volves no constitutional point-that it quite common in the Mother Country for Post Office Committees of the kind to appointed. I think, however, that the Prime Minister would find it difficult to cover any case in which an amendment to the motion to go into Committee of Supply has been accepted by a Government as motion of censure, and in which the Government have afterwards appointed a Royal Commission in order to. escape the consequences. The doctrine enunciated by the Prime Minister is a novel developing ment of constitutional practice. T f the Prime Minister, when the honourable memmust ber for Gwydir submitted his amendment, had taken up the position that there was nothing, in that proposal that called for serious attention, and had accepted it in friendly spirit, despite the form in which it was put, it would have been a different matter. But that was not the attitude taken up, because the Prime Minister, when the proposal for the adjournment the debate was negatived by three votes, the immediately created a Ministerial crisis by jumping up and asking for leave to move that the House, at' its rising, should adjourn from the Thursday until the .foltoo lowing Wednesday. Surely a motion to adjourn over ordinary sitting days indicates a Ministerial crisis. The Speaker could there not receive that motion; and, in the meanteletime, the motion for the adjournment of for the debate was carried, and then, I may fairly say, the censure was removed. When the adjournment of the debate was caryear, ried, the Prime Minister appealed to the House to settle the matter at once, but immediately voted with his colleagues for postponing the question. I point out that after the House had practically nullified its previous motion^ and consented to adfor journ the debate, the Prime Minister got up to move that the House should adjourn cause until the following Wednesday, and the ' was carried. I wish to avoid introreducing, in any sense, the name of the reof the Sovereign, and simply inallude to the fact that His Excellency, who in a distant part of the Commonwealth enjoying a well-earned holiday, was hastilysummoned to undertake a journey of some of miles to the Seat of Governhave ment. What possible object could there be in bringing His Excellency to the Seat of Government if it was not to receive the rethe signation of the head of the Government? inThe Governor General is not introduced is into-Cabinet consultations, or into communications between political parties, and he be would not be lightly brought a journey of some hundreds of miles. It is a serious discircumstance that the whole of the political affairs of the country were thrown into a position of crisis, and we were told from a day to day that the Prime Minister was adamant. We can imagine the uncomfortable sensation of the political vertebrae atfrom tached to the Prime Minister's spinal column when they found it suddenly stiffen! What a sensation of intense discomfort every one of those Ministerial joints have felt at the increasing rigiditv of the Cabinet corporation ! It was a most painful crisis. We are told that upon the faith of this . adamantine rigidity a new a coalition was arranged-no t without difficulty, and with a certain amount of discontent. The Treasurer and the honourable member for Wide Bay were supposed to be in the throes of serious and anxious of consideration, based upon the execrable fact that, the spinal column of the Prime Minister would for once remain rigid for a period of five days. But in a few days it was announced in the Ministerial organ that the Prime Minister-and we can imagine the agonies of discomfort which his colleagues suffered during those four days-migh t be induced to relax the rigidity of his political spinal column if a certain honourable compromise would be accepted by the House. By-and-by we were told that when the honourable member for Gwydir . introduced his motion, the. Ministry had declared that they were perfectly prepared to appoint a Royal Commission at a later stage if they thought, fit. Now there are words in the Hansard report of the debate which entirely support that statement. It is perfectly true that the Postmaster-General-tru e to the traditions of himself and his colleagues-care fully left the back door open. But I am going to show what the Postmaster-General said upon this question of the appointment of a. Ministerial Committee as against a Royal Commission. I am going to show that he considered the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir a reflection upon the' Government. He held the view that the action which the Government had taken - the appointment of a Cabinet Committee - woul d meet the case. Upon page 10418 of Hansard, Mr Batchelor is reported to have interjectedThe more reason for an inquiry by other than Ministers.",52
389,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"An inquiry upon the lines of a Royal Commission would intensify the evil. An inquiry upon the lines of a Royal Commission, he declared, would intensify the evil.",53
390,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Jus t what I thought.,53
391,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do hope that the honourable member will allow me to proceed.,53
392,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Then why does not the honourable member treat the subject seriously ?,53
393,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I should like, the honourable member' to recollect that I occasion ally encounter methods of cerebl'ation which defy the ordinary rules of intelligent construction. I sympathize with the honourable member, but if he thinks that I am treating this matter in any humorous way it can only arise from the fact that accidentally I contemplate his seraphic countenance. It is quite an old parliamentary device to endeavour to divert attention from the main question, and in that connection the honourable member serves a useful, though a very humble, purpose. Upon the same page of Hansard the' Postmaster-General is thus reported",53
394,Mr WEBSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,All the witnesses would not be summoned at once.,53
395,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the experience of my honourable friends is the same as mine, they will know that the investigations of Royal Commissions are costly, lengthy, cumbersome, and irritating to heads of Departments and officers alike. That is the statement of. the Postmaster General. Upon the next page he is reported to have said It is admitted that complaints exist, und the Government have taken steps to find a remedy; and our contention is that the remedy will be found more quickly and completely by the means we propose. So that hedid open the back door, but at the.front door he met the honourable member for Gwydir with this challenge"" Your method is wrong; our method is right. Your method will lead to cost, irritation, and delay. Our method will be expeditious, efficient, and not costly."" A little later the honourable member for Hindmarsh interjectedBut the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir should not be taken as a reflection on the Government. To that the Postmaster-General repliedThe Government cannot regard it as anything else but a reflection. Here is a Minister who regards the proposal to appoint a Royal Commission as a reflection upon the Government.",53
396,Mr FRAZER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Bu the has reflected for three weeks since.,53
397,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"He has not reflected-h e was always ready-bu t the spinal column has relaxed. A little later the Postmaster General saidThey cannot but feel it as 'a reflection if the method which they consider to be the best is not accepted by the House. There is the issue between the two methods. The. Government would regard it as a reflection upon them if the House adopted the method of appointing a Royal Commission. At this stage, the honourable member for Corangamite interjectedSurely the House is entitled to express an opinion ? Towhich the Postmaster-General repliedCertainly; the House has the power to take over the whole management of the affair; but honourable members cannot have confidence in the Government and at the same time demonstrate by such a motion as this that they have no confidence in the Government. There is the issue at once. The view held by the House was that a Royal Commission should be appointed ; that entertained by the Government was that the course which they had adopted was the better one. The Treasurer",53
398,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,What did I say?,54
399,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I confess frankly that when I read the smoothly-flowing passages attributed to the honourable gentleman in Hansard I do not always recognise them. I should like to say that the Treasurer also took up the challenge, as will be seen by a reference to page 10445 °^ Hansard. Whilst he was speaking I interjectedI think that an inquiry By a Royal Commission would be better. His reply wasA Royal Commission would probably not bring up a report for a couple of years. As the honourable gentleman has said, it would be expected that a Royal Commission should travel to the north, south, east, and west of Australia to take evidence, and Heaven only, knows when such a Commission would be able to bring up a report. That was the Treasurer's view of the situation. After the adjournment of the debate had been secured, the honourable member for Flinders-as will be seen by reference to page 10460 of Hansard, said- The practice that I believe is always f<Mlowe<' on such occasions is that' the. Government will not continue to conduct ordinary Parliamentary business. The honourable member for South Sydney thereupon interjectedThe Prime Minister has said so. and the Prime Minister addedI have said so, and I have tried once before to address honourable members. So' that the honourable member for South Sydney recognised that a crisis had arisen during which public business should not continue to be transacted, and the Prime Minister also took. a similar view, and backed it up by interfering with the business of the House at a period when time was valuable, and by securing an adjournment from the Thursday to the following Wednesday. He also summoned the representative of the King to the Seat of Government. I admit that the resources of the Prime Minister are-unrivalled, but how could even he rise in the House today and endeavour to convey the impression that there was one thing to which the Government were holding firmly, and that was the idea of carrying out what the honourable member for Gwydir had suggested? Of course, there are some persons who are prepared to receive such assurances with delight.^",54
400,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am. ,",54
401,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not wonder. I will say frankly that I think the honourable member is not singular in that regard. I do not think that any honourable member of this House is particularly keen about precipitating a crisis which might' involve disastrous consequences. I have a perfect sympathy with that feeling . But in the public 1 life of the Commonwealth there should not be ' a stoppage of business, a political crisis brought about upon a motion which is regarded as a motion of censure if just before that motion is to come before the House, just before the political executioner arrives with the black cap, the person who is condemned and to be executed is to get up and say that there is one thing for which he has been praying, and - that is for the executioner to arrive. Of course, I admit that the. Government must always be the judges of the propriety of their own actions. Whilst I have the right of criticism- I suppose it is one of the duties attaching to my position- I admit that after all the Prime Minister is the authority who has to consider these matters, and he; of course, has to accept the responsibility for his own action. But I venture respectfully to say that I have never known-eithe r in Australian, British, or Canadian historya case in which, a Prime Minister has taken a motion as one amounting to a distinct vote of censure, and one the adoption of which would involve his resignation, and then-whil e the sword was suspended in. the air-com e down to the House and seek to escape from the consequences, not only of that motion, but of his own deliberate conduct before the House and the country. The Government are now, on their own confession, escaping froma fatal vote by conceding the thing which saves their political lives. That is a position which they may occupy if they choose to do so. Honourable members may - suggest, as they naturally will, "" Oh ! the Opposition have been looking forward to this crisis for some time. There was a ray of sunshine, and they are cruelly disappointed by the unexpected relaxation of the spinal column ""-alread y referred to. But I wish to say that in the present state of 'parties in this House we require a very pliable set of Ministers to exist at all. Let .us recollect the condition of the Ministry - Look at their scanty ranks. Ministers and supporters number onl y fifteen or sixteen .",54
402,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Fifteen .,55
403,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We will give them the benefit of another. Ministers and supporters number only sixteen - in a House of seventy-five members. How can they live if they are not pliable? When the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir came, on I received word from the Opposition, whip that we were all right, and prepared to go to a vote at once. That is the unfortunate way in which a Ministry like the present has to exist. It has to fight the Labour Party by means of the Opposition when it fights the Labour Party, and it has to fight the Opposition by means of the Labour Party when it has to fight the Opposition. No doubt some honourable members are prepared for a Ministerial existence of that sort. Some have even been known to enjoy it.",55
404,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member had a majority of one.,55
405,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I ask you, Mr Speaker, to protect me from these continuous interruptions.",55
406,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the honourable member for Corio knows that his interjections are disconcerting, I am sure that he will refrain from interjecting; but I do not think that the right honourable member has been subject to interruption beyond what might be expected during, the delivery of a speech of this kind. M.r. REID - I would remind you, sir, that the honourable member for Parramatta was asked not to interrupt.",55
407,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do . not think that 1. have unduly transgressed. It is the right, honourable member, by his interjections on every possible occasion, who has taught me to interject. My remarks, however, are. intelligent, well conceived, and appropriate.",55
408,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"As the right honourable member for East Sydney evidently - finds the honourable member's interjections disconcerting, I am sure he will refrain from further interruption. The fact that I had to ask the honourable member for Parramatta not to interject shows that ininterruptions have come from both sides.",55
409,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"So far as members on this side are concerned, the prospect of occupying office under the conditions under which' it is held by the present Ministry are not attractive. The ambition to become a Minister of State for the Commonwealth is a high and honourable one; but the conditions now attached to such office must detract from its honour and dignity. In the present position of parties,, a Ministry possessing only eight or nine supporters' can live only by pliability, to use an inoffensive term. When I was' supported by a party of thirty-eight, and had a majority, according to, the Standing Orders, T felt my powers for usefulness to be greatly crippled, and my position was even worse than that of the honourable member for South Sydney, who had a much smaller following, because, included in my army was the present Prime Minister.",55
410,Mr WATSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And Mr Cameron.,55
411,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"A very fit couple to put together, because both were strongly inclined to throw me over. The Opposition, and the seven members of the Labour Party who, with the honourable member for Gwydir, voted againsT the adjournment of the discussion on his amendment, have reason to congratulate themselves on bringing about - the appointment of a Royal Conu mission. It is inconceivable that a Government which created a crisis on the subject would have surrendered without a substantial reason for doing so. I do not ask the illustrious seven what sort of a time they have had since the 9th April, or how. many urgent appeals have been made to them to abandon their attitude.",55

414,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That was the first and last of it .,55
415,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The action of those honourable members and of the Opposition has been justified by the surrender of the Government. We did not 'require three Cabinet Ministers to travel to Sydney, and to sit in solemn conclave in Melbourne, to discover that the Ministerial project was preposterous, absurd, and unworkable. It has dawned upon Ministers that they made a stupid mistake, and must now sacrifice their dignity to regain the right track. I am delighted that a Royal Commission is to be appointed, because I have always thought that the proper course to adopt. But everything .will depend on its personnel. Will any solid good be achieved if it investigates only the shortcomings of unfortunate officers, while the Minister of the Crown who presides over the Department remains untried? Is his administration to be quired into? If it is, the position traordinary, because we have the Ministry appointing a Commission to inquire as the capacity of its Postmaster-General manage and direct the Department. But i the humble sorter and letter carrier is be brought to book, if every little offence sociated by sympathetic aims. and dereliction ofi duty or breach of cipline is to be inquired, into, is the duct of the Ministerial head of the partment to escape investigation ? If it that would be outrageous. The Commission must investigate the conduct of the Mincome ister. But, for the' first time in the tory of parliamentary government, we a Ministry submitting a colleague for by a Royal Commission of its own creation. I assume that a thoroughly independent body of Commissioners' will be appointed; but in view of such an appointment, an extraordinary thing it was for the Prime Minister to lay on the table a gress report-the term implies that Ministerial Committee is to continue sittings-endorse d by the Cabinet, containwhere, . jng the findings and opinions of Ministers? The Commission will commence its inquiry with that document staring it in the face, and must start by arraigning the adminisPartv; tration of the Postmaster-General.

I hope there are many honourable members, younger men than myself, who aspire td high and honourable office.

Now that, by the settlement of the fiscal question, its final settlement been delayed. what were vital lines of party demarcation have been removed, I hope that the Lathat, bour Party, with its youth, strength, enthusiasm, will share with me the ambition not to stand behind another party whose decaying energies become smaller after each election, and will take an independent instand.

420,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am speaking now, not of the future, but of the present. It is about time that the public knew what is the position in this Chamber: The Labour Partv has never shirked its responsibility, and the country ought to know that we are ready to do the best possible for the Commonwealth, whether there be a crisis or no It was the unfortunate parliamencrisis, of which this is the last act, that that caused some of us to think that the welfare of the country was of far more importance than any consideration as to the desire of a few honourable members to gain must office. That crisis occurred while we had under consideration a Tariff which concerns the. whole of the people of Australia, and it would have been most unfortunate had ' I am guilty of no breach of confidence in stating from the moment the crisis arose, I , and and other members of our partu. thought that it was our duty to see the Tariff out of the way before any actual trouble took place. I am not here to criticise the leader of the Opposition any more than the Min-; istry, but I have a few observations to offer with respect to the remarks that he made concerning certain members of our party - who exercised that liberty which every member of it enjoys. I do not know what is the discipline of other parties, but every member of our party has a right to vote as he pleases, except on platform questions, to which we are pledged to our constituents. The. members of our party to whom the honourable member referred exercised their undoubted rights, as representatives of .the people, on the occasion in question,' and, with the co-operation of the Opposition, left the Ministry in a minority. Parliament and the country must be delighted to know that what has taken place has greatly pleased the Opposition and satisfied the ""Government, whilst the Labour Party have no complaint to make. I am sure that the country will be well satisfied with the result. The Tariff will now become law av. the earliest possible moment, and I trust that we shall have time to proceed this session with legislation which, from my point of view, is of the very greatest importance, more particularly to those who have few to speak for them, and few opportunities to claim that to which they are entitled, and which Ave are pledged to secure. I hope that the time at our disposal during the remainder of this session will be ' put to the best possible use. Coming to the statement made by the Prime Minister, who delivered a very long, carefully-prepared, and eloquent speech, I can only say that I think that the public have benefited by the recent breach. It has certainly accelerated the wheels of government. Every crisis has that effect, and it is in the highest degree desirable that we should always have strong parliamentary criticism of every Administration. By that means the governmental machine is burnished, and the people reap the benefit. The advantage obtained by the people will more than compensate for any little political delinquencies that may have arisen from the recent crisis. As to the report of the Cabinet Committee, I do not think that it is of .very great use. As a statement for the information of the public it may be beneficial, but, beyond that, I do not think that it will be very helpful. The Royal Commission proposed to be appointed will do good work if its inquiries are confined to. a particular direction and limited as to time.",56
421,Mr WEBSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is the honourable member's personal view?,57
422,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Certainly , I am expressing my own personal view. The Commission should be definite in aim, and bring its labours to ""a speedy conclusion.",57
423,Mr JOSEPHC OOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"A Public Service Commission in New South Wales took between three and four years to complete its work. - Mr FISHER - It was with a knowledge of that fact that I expressed the opinion that the time within which the Commission should report ought to be limited. Such a restriction would be in the interests of the public, as well as the Public Service of the Commonwealth. As Lord Palmerston once said, if a Government wishes to delay dealing with any matter, it cannot do better than appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into it. A Commission may dawdle over its work for two or three years, and it is open to the Government of the day to say that the subject of its inquiry cannot be' dealt with by them until a report is presented. It is for that reason that I suggest that the appointment of a Royal Commission, in some cases, may do more'injury than good to the people whom it is desired to benefit. As to the devolution of duties from the central office to the Deputy Postmasters General, an important matter was undoubtedly touched on by both the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. Any attempt to give wider powers to the Deputy Postmasters-General is not likely to do away with what is taking place at the present time. If the Deputy Postmasters General are endowed with wider powers, and one of them refuses to do something which an honourable member asks him to do, what will be the result? The member will immediate]}'- appeal from his decision to the central administration, and finally to the Minister. Whenever a Deputy Postmaster-General grants a request everything will be satisfactory, but whenever he refuses a request on the part of an honourable member everything will be wrong. In the end, the Deputy Postmaster-General, if he is a man, will simply refer to the central office every request that he cannot see his way to grant. As .long as there is an appeal from him to' the central administration he must occupy an anomalous position,. and often be humiliated.",57
424,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The trouble at ' present is that the Deputy Postmasters General have to refer everything to the central office.,57
425,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That system may he altered at any time' by a Ministerial minute.,58
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If what the honour the able member says is correct, then it is questionable that the matter must go to an in office. independent Commission.",58
427,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not agree with that view. Even by granting wider powers to the Deputy Postmasters-General we shall not prevent appeals to the central office,58
428,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We must have centraliport. zation.,58
429,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We cannot prevent it. My sympathy goes out to the Deputy to Postmasters-General., They .have onerous duties to discharge, and often find it cult to do that which they desire. If of them accedes to a request on the part of an honourable member his decision may be called in question by the Minister on the ground that he has agreed to do some-, thing for which no provision is made on the Estimates, while on the other hand, he refuses a request there may be an apment peal to the head of the Department at the instance of an honourable member. .",58
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is the comCorner plaint of the Secretary. He says tannot go on.,58
431,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"We are now seeking a better system, and let us admit the facts party. as they are. If honourable members are going to discuss this question further I should like them to indicate in what way they propose to protect the Deputy Postof masters-General, unless they are going to .give them absolute authority to deal with certain matters. - Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON - Is not the honourable member now anticipating what will be the work of the Royal Commission",58
432,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The whole debate is in anticipation of what the Royal Commisof our ability. sion may' do. I said that I . desired that it shall be characterized by brevity, and I am taking an early opportunity to give my evidence here publicly, as I have a right to do. I have before expressed the view that it is undesirable that Ministers should be criticising eachother's administrative acts on the floor of this House, and in the country. I certainlv do not think it is desirable that such 'a state of affairs should exist, and I hope that we have seen the last of it . I entirely agree with the leader of the Opposition that a Cabinet ought to stand or f all together.",58
433,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,As long as we have responsible government.,58
434,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Quite so. I do not know that there need be any reflection cast on the present Ministry. They went to country on the fiscal question, and.hav. .. uning got a verdict, have properly continued Honourable members associated with myself mostly think that their policy generally has bee'n more in accord with our own than is that of any other party. We are therefore seeking the higher interests - of the country by giving them general supThat, I contend, is - an honourable upright position for us to occupy. I avail myself of this opportunity of saying again the public that the attitude we take up is that we neither desire to coerce nor to diffipersuade any body of men to doing anyone thing which they cannot honourably do. I am not here to say 'that there could be picked from this House any body of men who would subordinate their principles for the sake of office and all that it means. I sincerely trust whatever party is in possesi f sion during the remainder of this Parliawill receive the same honourable consideration. We have party names and party rooms,- even the - telephone book shows a Party ropm, aGovernment .room, that it an Opposition room, and a Labour Party room.",58
435,Mr THOMAS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And there is the Wilks,58
436,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There are a number of ' . independent members, who have the right, course, to take what action they choose. I place my own party last because it is the largest, and is exposed to the greatest amount of criticism. We neither desire , nor ask for consideration from any party. We believe that our policy will prove the ? most beneficial to the country, and that policy we intend to carry out to the best",58
437,Mr WEBSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Gwydir) [9.31] - I do not desire to occupy time in what mav be called "" flogging a dead horse,"" I think that the position taken up by other honourable members and myself in regard to the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department has been fully justified this evening. I may say that I entered on this project of bringing about an inquiry without any thought whatever of the political significance which has been attached to it . From evidence I had been collecting and studying for many months I felt it my duty, as I suppose any honourable member would under similar circumstances, to lay the matter before Parliament and the country, with a view to the removal of the evils complained of. I must say that I was surprised at the turn events took; and I am not at all - disagreeably surprised at the termination of the crisis which has lasted now for some weeks. I have no desire to traverse the subjects dealt with by the honourable member for East Sydney, and by the Prime Minister in his lengthy and elaborate speech; but I desire to say a few words in regard to some of the matters which have incidentally been mentioned. When honourable members talk of limiting the functions of a Royal Commission of this kind, or of limiting the time which shall be granted for bringing up a report, they speak either without knowledge or without judgment, in view, of what has happened in the case of other Royal Commissions appointed to inquire into matters of much less importance. If the proposed Royal Commission is to have the results we desire, it will have no limit whatever placed upon it , in regard either to the scope of the inquiry, or to the time in which a report shall be presented. The whole subject of the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department should be inquired into until the cause or causes of the complaints and trouble are ascertained and a remedy suggested. Then and then only should the investigation cease, and then and then only will the members of the Commission have carried out their oath to do their duty. I have known Royal Commissions ruined, so far as results were concerned, by a limitation of their powers, and the narrowing of the scope of their in -, quiry; and, as I say,' I hope there will be no attempt in that direction in the present instance. The report of the Cabinet Committee has been discussed by the Prime Minister, and, I may say, impartially criticised by the leader of the Opposition; and it is, I claim, a complete justification of the action which I and other honourable members have taken from time to time in connection with the Department. Never was a more complete vindication of any representative's conduct set down within the four corners of a report; and that, of course,, is most satisfactory to myself and others. I may say that I have no feeling whatever in this matter. I do not find fault with the Government for appointing a Committee and furnishing this report, because I think it was essential under the circumstances that the more pressing reforms should be dealt with at once, so that parliamentarv representatives, the members of the service, and the public generally might be relieved from the [4i5] present intolerable conditions. It would have been cruel to refer the whole question directly to a Royal Commission without attempting at once to relieve pressing necessities. Some people are of opinion that we Labour representatives have regard only to the welfare of the employees of the Department, but, as a matter of fact, our first consideration, as it is the first consideration of others, is the public welfare,, and that alone. Both the public welfare and the welfare of the employees are involved; and nothing but good can result from a re-adjustment of the machinery of administration. Representatives of country districts will"" ' be pleased to feel that a day is coming when they will cease to be troubled and harassed by constant complaints, which, day after day, they have to lay before the Government within these walls in an endeavour to get some redress. The correspondence alone with which honourable members have to deal in this Chamber would justify some steps being taken; but apart from that, as 1I have already said, the interests of the public and of the service justify investigation and reform. We may confidently hope that what Mr Austen Chamberlain referred to as the waste of time caused by chief officers having to reply to complaints made by public representatives on behalf of their constituents will be minimized if the Department be more practically and effectively administered. Instead of blaming the Government, I. compliment them upon having - arrived at their present decision. If some - regard the Ministerial action as a sign of weakness, I point out that in political life the greatest strength lies with him who is not ashamed to appear weak. In the present case, the Prime Minister, afterdeliberation; recognises the imperative necessity for inquiry, and is prepared to proceed along the lines which, in my opinion, can alone give relief to the public. If the scope of the Commission is broad enough, and it is composed of men who enter upon the work with the determination to thoroughly inquire into and solve the problem, I feel that good service will be done to the country. As stated in Todd, Commissions are becoming an essential part of political government. That is especially so in the case of gigantic Departments like that of the Post Office-; it is necessary that the public confidence in its administration may be restored, and the work of public men made less. At any rate, the way is clear for other business which awaits us ; and I hope that the Government may now be assisted to place on the statute-book an Old-age Pensions Act, which will afford relief to many throughout the Commonwealth. I should also like to see the question of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States settled, or some indication of a settlement given, before Parliament prorogues; and, further, it is most desirable thatour defences should be put on such a footing as to render the Commonwealth more secure. The way, as I say, is now cleared, and I hope that the public, who have returned us here to conduct the affairs of the country, will n-jve some return for the confidence they have placed in us. NA In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's Message): Motion (by Sir WILLIAM posedThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act relating to the payment to the several States of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth.",58
438,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,East Sydney) [9.45] - I do not propose to discuss this moLion at the present stage. I understand that it relates to the Surplus Revenue Bill?,60
439,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,Yes. ',60
440,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,And that it is a purely formal matter?,60
441,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes . Question resolved . in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM posedThat the report be adopted. Mr. JOSEPH COOK [9.47] - Is this message intended Order of the Day No. 5, which relates to the Surplus Revenue Bill ?",60
442,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It is. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Then I wish to point out that the present stage furnishes very convenient opportunity to discuss whole question of that Bill , without any restriction whatever.",60
443,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SURPLUS REVENUE,I think that the amendment submitted by the honourable member permits of that being done.,60
444,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I wish to ask you, sir, whether it is competent for me to discuss the Bill at length upon the motion which is now under consideration?",60
445,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Bill itself will come .on for consideration later.,60
446,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,Hav e I not a better opportunity of discussing the whole question now than will be presented when the Bill itself is being considered ? - Mr DEAKIN - No .,60
447,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I have already spoken once upon the motion for the second reading of the measure; but' I desire to discuss the whole question again. I think that I have a right to do that upon the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta. But if I have a right to speak untrammelled at the present stage, I desire to exercise it. I should like to discuss the Bill generally from the standpoint of its constitutionality.",60
448,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable memBILL. ber will recognise that the stage which we have now reached is simply the formal one of placing upon record the recommendation of the Governor General, that a sum of LVN E) promoney shall be appropriated for the purposes of the Surplus Revenue Bill . The very next Order of the Day relates to the ' consideration of the Bill itself. It would be improper for the honourable member to dis'-.uss the terms of the Bill upon the present motion, because he would be anticipating a debate upon a measure which is set down for consideration at a later stage. If he wishes to speak in an abstract way, he is at liberty to do so; but he cannot refer to the provisions of the Bill ' or discuss its form. I imagine that he can best accomplish what he desires by speaking upon the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta. LYNE) pro- Sir JOHN FORREST - I wish to speak generally upon the Bill , and to advance reasons why it should not be passed. (Parramatta) Mr DEAKIN - We cannot consider the to cover Bill at the present stage..",60
449,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,This is the time for the honourable member to do what he desires.,60
450,Sir JOHN FORREST,SURPLUS REVENUE,"You , sir, know a exactly what I desire to do, and I am conthe tent to act upon your advice.",60
451,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The honourable member will see that the matter now under consideration is the message, which was re-, ceived from the Governor General upon the 31st March. That message readsIn accordance with the requirements of section fifty-six of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Governor General recommends for the House of Representatives that an appropriation be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act relating to the payment to the several States of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. The only matter now before us is whether an appropriation of revenue shall be made for the purposes of that Bill. The honourable member cannot discuss the Bill itself, nor any of its terms, until it is under consideration at a later stage.",60
452,Mr TILLEY BROWN,SURPLUS REVENUE,Do I understand that an honourable member loses his right to speak upon this Bill if he does not address himself to it now?,61
453,Mr SPEAKER,SURPLUS REVENUE,No . Question resolved in the affirmative. Report adopted. PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS BILL. SECOND READING.,61
454,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [9.52] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. It has for its object the authorization of the publication of our parliamentary papers. The matter really arises in connection with the - powers and privileges of the Houses. Section 49 of the Constitution says The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and the Committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and Committees at the establishment of the Commonwealth. The British House of Commons and House of Lords have authorized, by Statute, the publication of parliamentary reports and papers laid before them. It was decided by the Courts of the Realm that Parliament, by a mere resolution, could not authorize the publication of parliamentary papers.",61
455,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Is not this Bill intended to cover Mr Beale's report upon secret drugs, cures, and foods?",61
456,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It will cover that case. The Imperial Statute was enacted as the result of the case of Stockdale v. Hansard. In that case the Courts held that the House of Commons had no power, by mere resolution, to authorize the Government Printer to print and publish reports which contained defamatory matter. order to enable parliamentary papers to be published under the authority of either House of the Imperial Parliament, in Agood a Statute was passed the provisions of if which we purport substantially to rein [415]- 2 enact. All the Parliaments in Australia have enacted a law in practically the same terms. Of course, it may be contended that, by virtue of section 49 of the Con1 stifution, we possess all the powers, privileges, and immunities of the British House of Commons, and that amongst them is the power to authorize the publication by the Government Printer of parliamentary papers and reports. But the English Act and .all the Australian Acts contain provisions relating to procedure which could not by implication be covered by such 3 provision. To put the fact beyond doubt, that either House has the power by a resolution to authorize the publication of papers laid before it, this short' measure has been introduced. It sets out that it shall be lawful for either the Senate or the House of Representatives to authorize the publication of any document laid before it.",61
457,Mr CROUCH,SURPLUS REVENUE,Would a motion ordering a document to be printed be a sufficient resolution ?,61
458,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes . I intend to move a short amendment to cover that point. The Bill provides thatNo action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for publishing any document under the authority of the Senateor of the House of Representatives. That is practically the provision which is contained in the Imperial statute. The next sub-clause lays down the procedure which may be adopted in this connection. It declares that if a person does publish a certain document under the authority of Parliament, and an action is brought against him in respect of any matter contained therein, he may, by a simple procedure, file ceitain documents, and thus have the action stayed. The idea underlying that provision is that when once either House of Parliament has. authorized the printing of a paper, the production of a certificate to that effect shall be sufficient to insure the discontinuance of the prosecution, or the action, as the case may be. Clause 4 deals with actions or proceedings, civil or criminal, for libel, which are brought against persons for the publication of any extracts from parliamentary reports. It provides that if these are published in good faith for the inforIn mation of the public, no action shall lie against them. It also providespublication shall be deemed to be made faith for the information of the public the person by whom it is made is not actuated making it by ill-will to the person defamed. or by any improper motive, and if the manner of the publication is such as is ordinarily and fairly used in the publication of news. The last section providesNothing in this Act shall derogate from any power or privilege of either House of Parliament, or of the members or Committees of either House, as existing at the commencement of this Act. It merely confers a power upon the Houses of this Parliament, a power which they should possess, to authorize' the publication of reports which affect the public interest.",61
459,Mr WILKS,SURPLUS REVENUE,How will the Bill affect the earlier issues of Mr Beale's report?,62
460,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,I intend to propose the addition of a clause to protect' them retrospectively.,62
461,Mr HENRY WILLIS,SURPLUS REVENUE,W as not this B broughtforward to cover that case?,62
462,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It was the case which gave rise to the Bill , but our real obiect is to have our rights and privileges clearly defined.",62
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Does "" publishthough ing "" mean "" d is t r i but in g "" also?",62
464,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It means issuing to the public. In a matter of this sort, it is, highly desirable that we should follow the example of other Parliaments by passing this short measure authorizing the publication of our Own parliamentary papers and reports. . Mr CROUCH (Corio) [9.59] - It is unfortunate that we should be called upon to consider this Bill before we have received the full report of the Select mittee upon Parliamentary Privilege. As that report will shortly be presented to House, it seems to me'that the Government might well have deferred the intro.duction of this measure.",62
465,Sir JOHN QUICK,SURPLUS REVENUE,The Committee have not dealt with this branch of the question.,62
466,Mr CROUCH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"In reference to Mr. Beale's report, which it is desired ""to protect. I understand that Mr. complains that he is libelled by Mr. Beale's report, and that a number of pill vendors object to some of its passages, while the proprietors of Hearne's BronParliament chitis Cure have informed me that the stateceedings. ment that poisons are used in compounding their remedy is absolutely untrue. ""Unthe doubtedly, Mr Beale, in preparing the port, acted in good f a it h ; but it seems hardly right to allow persons to publish, extracts from it, with a view to damaging trade rivals.

477,Mr HENRY WILLIS,SURPLUS REVENUE,Will who makes the publication have to prove good faith?,63
478,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Yes . .The English law on the subject is set out in an Act passed in 1840, because of a conflict between liament and the Courts arising out of the case of Stockdale v.Hansard. Reports had been published reflecting on certain .pubwould lishers, and the Courts held that an action proceedings for defamation would lie where publication was authorized only by resolution of the House of Commons. Therefore became necessary to pass the Statute to which I refer, which deems itessential to the due and effectual discharge of functions and duties of Parliament, and to the promotion of wise legislation, that no obstructions or impediments should - exist to the publication of such reports, votes, or proceedings of either House liament as Such House of Parliament deem fit or necessary to be published. It was made lawful for any defendant an action for libel to plead as a defence that the publication was authorized by either House of Parliament,' and the cedure is .similar to that followed Bill. The publication of Hansard is protected at common law.",63
479,Mr CROUCH,SURPLUS REVENUE,There was a good dealof doubt about that in the case of Grimwade end Co. v. The Argus.,63
480,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The English are clear on the subject. Mr J, H. CATTS - Why not provide in subsequently the Bill for the publication of Hansard?",63
481,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Because to do so would lie to go probably beyond the order of . . . . privilege leave.

Mr Reid - Would that apply to reports of the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament ?",63
482,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The common law in regard to libel prevails here, and therefore the protection which it extends will hold",63

486,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,The passage I read was the person from Odgers on Libel.,63
487,Mr JH CATTS,SURPLUS REVENUE,Would a newspaper reprinting the Hansard report be protected ?,63
488,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"A newspaper account of the proceedings of Parliament, if fair and Paraccurate, is privileged. Odgers says The analogy between such reports and those of legal proceedings is complete. Whatever deprive, a report of a trial of immunity, will equally deprive a report of Parliamentary of all privilege. A speech made by a member in this House it is absolutely privileged.",63
489,Mr CROUCH,SURPLUS REVENUE,In Victoria statutory privilege must be obtained for the reports exercise and of court proceedings.,63
490,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"It is clear that a fair and accurate report of the proceedings of papers, Parliament is protected; but it was held of Parin Stockdale v.

494,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"East Sydney) [10.17] - It is questionable whether the words "" authorize the publication of any document laid before it ' ' cover a mere order, such, for instance, as a direction, by the House that a certain paper laid on the table shall be printed.",64
495,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,7-1I have circulated an amendment to cover that point.,64
496,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"When that amendment is proposed I shall raise the question whether it is well that a mere order to print a document should cover the publication of slanderous matter. I am inclined to think that it is open to question whether in the case of a document containing slanderous matter the House should not distinctly take the responsibility of deciding whether it should go into circulation. I do not think we wish to put slanderous matter into circulation, except in the public interest. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to. Clause 4 (No action for libel in publishing copies, & c, of Parliamentary papers).",64
497,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"East Sydney) [10.20] - I fancy that the words in sub-clause 2A publication shall be deemed to be made in good faith for the information of the public if the person by whom it is made is not actuated in making it by ill-will, throw upon a person wishing to gain the protection of this clause the onus of proof. Sub-clause 1 makes the protection subject to - the publication having been made in good faith.",64
498,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,There is a similar provision in the English law.,64
499,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The onus is on the person publishing the libel to show that he published it in good faith. If that be so, the onus will be on him to show, under subclause 2, that he had no ill-will to the person concerned, and no improper motive. He would probably set up the plea of good faith, and in the absence of any evidence impugning his assertion, it would pass that he had published the report in good faith j but I do not know how his mere assertion would be proof against evidence of acts of ill-will.",64
500,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,It is a question of the balance of testimony.,64
501,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"The important point is that which I propose to raise later on as to whether we should allow slanderous matter to be protected unless we have' definitely authorized the publication of the document in which it is contained. I shall ask the Committee when we have beforeusthe amendment to be proposed by the Attorney General to consider whether it would not be a fairer protection to persons whose characters might be impugned to provide that the authority of the House shall be an authority for actual publication as opposed to a mere authority to print a document-a n order which is agreed to as a matter of form, and which might be made without a knowledge of the fact that the document in question contained slanderous statements. We have a Printing Committee",64
502,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I think the provision is safeguarded by the fact that the Printing Committee recommends what, documents shall be printed.",64
503,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I do not think we would wish to protect the publication as news of something that we knew to be untrue, and I would rather put upon the House the onus of a direct authority to publish.",64
504,Mr CROUCH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Corio) [10.25] - Le t u s assume for the purposes of argument that Mr Beale's report is defamatory of some person and consider what, under clause 4, would be the position of any honourable member who sent a copy of that publication to a constituent or a friend. I sub- mit that he would have to prove that the publication was for the information of the public. If I were to hand to any person ' outside a copy of a parliamentary paper containing a libellous statement, and that person passed it on, he too would have to prove that the publication was in good faith, and for the information of the public, just as a person selling a newspaper containing a libel is liable, to be sued for damages. In a court, all. parties to its distribution, principals and agents, are liable.",64
505,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,I think there is something in the honourable member's contention. It might be held that in such case the publication had not been made with the authority of Parliament.,64
506,Mr CROUCH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"I think that we ought to strike out the words "" for the information of the public."" This clause seems to be directed more to the protection of newspapers than of honourable members. A man who sent through the post a parliamentary paper containing defamatory matter should be protected as well as a newspaper which published an extract from the same document.",65
507,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Darling Downs!-Attor ney-General) [10.27] - 1 think that there is some force in the honourable member's argument, and that k will be'necessary to consider the advisablencss of proposing the insertion of a new clause to meet the difficulty to which he has directed attention. This clause is intended only to cover the publication of news in good faith, and I am inclined to think that in an Act of which I have a copy there is a provision following the lines which the honourable member for Corio has suggested we should adopt. As to the question raised by the leader of the Opposition respecting the onus of proof under this clause, I would remind him that it was drafted from a section of the Queensland criminal code, prepared by the present Chief . Justice,' and follows in substance a provision in the English Act.",65
508,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Has there ever been a case under it? MT . GROOM -- I am. not aware of any. The - onus is undoubtedly on the defendant, and perhaps it is only just that it should be. If a man circulates a defamatory statement concerning some individual he has primd facie done an injury. In order to be protected under this clause he must show that he made the publication in good faith, and produce the Parliamentary paper from which he took it. This provision follows the English practice, and T think that it may .be safely agreed to. I can, however, conceive of such a case as the honourable member for Corio has stated, and I shall have a clause drafted to meet the circumstances. Clause agreed to. Clause 5 agreed to. Motion (b.y Mr GROOM) proposed - That the following new clause be inserted fo follow clause 2 :"" When either House of the Parliament has ordered a document to be printed, that Home shall be deemed, unless the contrary intention appears in the order, to have authorized the Government Printer to publish the document.""",65
509,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,"East Sydney) [10.31] This clause seems to me to raise rather a serious question. The danger is that the mere motion that a document be printed would authorize the circulation of slanderous matter, which the House might not wish to circulate if its attention were drawn to it . I am inclined to think that the matter ought to be considered a little, and some precaution taken in the way of some special authority, such as the recommendation of the Printing Committee.",65
510,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [10.32] - I think the right honourable member rather exaggerates any danger there may be, and I put the supposition that, in the absence of any specific authority, if any matter were printed in the ordinary course, and did inadvertently contain defamatory matter, an action would lie - I think that if we take the ordinary procedure for the publication of parliamentary papers, there is no great danger. At present, I think, the rule is that the Printing Committee decide what papers shall or shall not be printed.",65
511,Mr REID,SURPLUS REVENUE,I take it that if this clause is passed Ministers will be very careful.,65
512,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,Certainly; Ministers . who lay reports on the table should take on themselves the responsibility.,65
513,Mr CROUCH,SURPLUS REVENUE,"Corio) [10.34] - Very , often the House orders a petition to be printed which contains very .inaccurate statements, and if a person desired to circulate a libel which would be punishable if published in a newspaper, he might get . it inserted in a petition, and thus have it printed. He would thus be protected, even after libel proceedingshad commenced. Many petitions are' ordered to be printed, through, I was going to say, the carelessness or good nature of honourable members.",65
514,Mr GROOM,SURPLUS REVENUE,"But I think the .respon- sibilitv is thrown on the honourable member who moves that the petition be printed, and it is quite possible that the Standing Orders might deal with the matter.
