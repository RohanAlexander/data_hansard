1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Abbott, and read a first time - provides certain transitional arrangements Second Reading",13
2,Mr ABBOTT,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (9.31 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to give effect transfer of responsibility for the University of Canberra from the Commonwealth to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and to amend the Maritime College Act 1978. The transfer of the University of Canberra from Commonwealth to ACT jurisdiction was first proposed by the University of Canberra. The university considers that its future is bound up with the growth and development of the ACT, since the university is a key provider of professional education and advice in education and research. The transfer will bring the university closer to ACT activities such as infrastructure and land development, health education and the ACT school system. The Commonwealth and the ACT governments agree that there will be considerable benefits to the university and the Canberra community in the university being more closely identified with the city. The university's comprehensive undergraduate teaching programs and expanding presence in graduate education, research and international education services are of great importance to the continued economic and cultural life of the city. There are strong mutual benefits to be obtained from facilitating collaboration between the university and territory government agencies, businesses and community organisations. In order to facilitate the transfer, this bill: - amends the University of Canberra Act 1989 (the act) where appropriate and necessary prior to the conversion so that the act will reflect the change of jurisdiction; - amends the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 to make the act an ACT enactment; - provides consequential amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973; and in relation to preservation of the rights and accrued entitlements of University officers and staff. The Commonwealth government is transferring the act with its existing framework intact. Any changes to it are appropriately made by the ACT Legislative Assembly after the to the transfer is made. However, any employee rights of coverage under Commonwealth occupational health and safety, industrial or administrative law for incidents occurring prior to the transfer day will continue. Coverage for incidents occurring after the transfer day will be determined according to the law of the territory. This bill also amends the Maritime College Act 1978 to provide the council of the Australian Maritime College with the power to make statutes for or in relation to the regulation or control of traffic or parking. Currently, parking spaces at the Australian Maritime College are being used by others to the detriment of the college staff and students. The act is amended to allow the college to enforce car parking regulations. I commend the bill to the House and I present a signed copy of the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. NA Public Accounts Committee Report",13
3,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following reportReport 35i-Advisory report on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill i996. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
4,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill had its genesis in a recommendation from a previous report of the Joint Public Accounts Committee in the previous parliament. That report was tabled in November 1995. I believe that the government had adequate opportunity, if it wanted to, to adopt the recommendations of that report. It did not so do. It was left to this government upon election to adopt the principle of the charter of budget honesty. In adopting that principle, it then embodied the principle in the legislation of this bill. In budget speech on 20 August 1996, the Treasurer said: Before its election defeat on 2 March, the previous Government maintained that the budget would now be in underlying balance. The truth nearly $10 billion to the contrary. The reason why this charter of budget honesty is being introduced and given effect is so that no other government will ever be placed in that position again. As I said in my speech on this bill in this House, I did not believe that this bill ought to be referred to the JCPA; but the Senate in its wisdom so did and we reported. As honourable members are aware, the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill was referred to the JCPA on 3 March for tabling today. As a consequence of this tight deadline, the committee held only one public hearing, taking evidence from the stakeholders in the public sector and from peak representative groups in the private sector. Those groups which were unable to attend managed to make submissions within our tight timetable. The committee supports the framework in the bill as it implements mechanisms for improving the accountability and transparency of government fiscal policy objectives, strategies and outcomes. The JCPA believes that the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is another element in the improvement of the overall fiscal accountability framework. Transparency is the essence of such a framework, and this bill legislates for the provision of regular published reports so that the public may be better informed. Mr Speaker, it should be noted that there is no opposition to this bill as such in the House. The opposition has been supportive of the need for such a charter as was indicated during the second reading debate in this House. Although for 13 years they did not adopt one, they support the adoption by this government. It is very simple to support these measures in opposition, but it is another thing to have the intestinal fortitude to introduce them and to give them effect when in government. During its review of the bill, the committee the encountered widespread general support and very little criticism. However, there are several important aspects which I wish to draw to the parliament's attention. Schedule 1, clauses 12(3), 16(3), 19(2) and was 24(3): while the committee applauds the requirement for fiscal reports to be prepared in accordance with recognised external reporting standards, the committee believes firmly that the reasons for any deviations from those standards should be fully explained in the reports. Schedule 1, clauses 12(4), 16(5) and 24(5): although the committee recognises the need to suppress information of a confidential commercial or national security nature, it believes that a statement providing a general description of the information being suppressed and its aggregate amount should be included in the reports. Schedule 1, clauses 13, 17, 28 and 32: the committee is pleased that the fiscal reports being legislated by this bill provide an approximation of whole-of-government reporting. However, the above named clauses enable Commonwealth agencies to withhold information. Where this occurs, then a statement showing the effect of this omission and its aggregate amount should be included in the reports. Schedule 1, clause 22: the committee notes that a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report is to be released within 10 days of the issue of the writ for a general election. Given that a writ can be delayed up to 10 days after the dissolution of parliament, the committee believes that it would be more sensible to have the pre-election reports released within 10 days of the dissolution of parliament. My final point, Mr Speaker, is to seek the agreement of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to include a review component in the schedule of the bill so that the full reporting process can be assessed after the next election. I am confident that our report reflects the concerns of the parliament. The JCPA looks forward to receiving the government's response to report 351.",14
5,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am glad to be here today as Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for the presentation of report 351, An Advisory Report on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996. I concur with most of what the chair of the committee, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), has said with regard to this legislation and this report. It certainly has the support of the opposition. I might say that in some of the discussions we had at the committee there was not always that high level of agreement. However, I think the report we have come down with is quite a modest but important contribution to the consideration of the bill. A number of issues around this legislation which were mentioned by the chair, and some others that were not, need to be looked at with respect to its operation. I will briefly mention some of those in the short time that I have. Certainly it is true that the comments regarding the bill that came before the committee either from witnesses or, in some respects, in submissions were generally positive. I think generally there was strong support out there. However, there is certainly a question as to just how this bill work, and certainly some concerns were expressed at the hearings regarding the detail of that in practice. The consultation process around this particular piece of legislation and the consideration of it by the committee was quite short. In the circumstances we only had submissions open for, I think, a matter of days because of the very tight time line placed on the committee by the motion through the Senate. As I understand the position of the government, they need this legislation through during this session. I think that has limited the capacity of many individuals and groups to go through the detail of how the operation of the bill will occur and what the circumstances will be of the actual utilisation of this legislation in the future. Having said that, certainly there is an expectation publicly that this legislation is not only a good thing but that it will lead to a material change. I am not so sure about the material change aspect. As the chair mentioned, this is a bill more suited for opposition than for government, but certainly in my position I hope for significant change. But I remain to be convinced. A number of issues were raised regarding this bill, and a number of them were covered by the chair of the committee, but I would like to pick up on a couple of comments. This legislation is largely a codification of existing practice. There are some improvements, and I commend those improvements, but it is largely a codification of existing practice. I think the circumstances were summed up best, from my point of view, by Professor Marc Robinson who made a submission to the inquiry. He said: No legislation can compel fiscal responsibility ... The most positive view of the Bill is that it is merely the latest in a long series of incremental improvements in fiscal reporting requirements. What it does is largely build on what the previous government had done over some 13 years. It makes some improvements but, with respect to some of those improvements such as intergenerational reporting and the pre-election statements, we will have to see how they work in operation versus the question of will actually what the expectations are. Another issue which came up during the inquiry is the question of forecasts made by Treasury particularly but also in general terms regarding the private sector. The thing about the forecasting of economic indicators and projections is that it is crucial in terms of the political debate, not only in terms of budgetary implications with respect to actual judgments being made and produced by government and by departments as being where we are really going on a financial basis, but also in terms of the expectations of what will occur in the future. A comment was made by the Secretary of Treasury on this issue, which I quote: ... it is in the nature of forecasts that they always be wrong and we have to do our best to minimise those errors. Obviously that statement is self-evident, but I do not think it is a statement which is really understood in the broader situation of the media and the public. Quite often, things do go off the rails but it is not on the basis of some form of chicanery, as is suggested on occasions by some. It is more in terms of the fact that the detail that is there is not sufficient and the circumstances change.",15
6,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,No more black holes.,16
7,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMITTEES,"We have just had a recent black hole from the current Treasurer (Mr CosteIlo)-which maybe gives an example of that, I do not know. Another issue I would raise briefly is the question of the signing off by the secretaries to the Treasury or Finance with respect to economic and fiscal reports produced by the government. The proposal under this bill is for that to be done with the pre-election report. That is fine, but members of the opposition raised the issue-and I believe it to be true-that other reports such as the budget ought to be done in the same way. It ought to be done on a regular basis. If this bill is about honesty, then let us have that honesty out in the open. Let it not only be honest but be seen to be honest by having reports like that signed off. I will leave my comments there. I commend the report to the House and I wish the bill a speedy passage in the Senate.",16
8,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEES,"by leave I will be very brief. The first point I want to get on the record is that I do not believe it was necessary for the Senate to refer the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill back to the JCPA, and certainly we were given limited time to have a look at some of the elements of it. So on that basis and on behalf of all members of the committee and the chair, I would like to thank the witnesses who appeared at short notice on the one day of public hearings we held. I suppose to a certain extent that was constructive. As I commented yesterday when tabling the report on the Auditor-General's reports, the will Department of Finance people reiterated that the process of introducing accrual accounting is very slow. This is not going to speed it up, but it is one area that is going to be very necessary in this process. The one comment the committee has made in this extra review of the bill is that we believe a review component should be included in the bill so the full reporting process can be assessed after the next election to see whether the highlighted benefits that the bill will provide will actually accrue to the public. We believe they will. I think the bill is an important step forward for the public management of Australia by government and as far as the transparency and accountability of the operations of government are concerned, particularly with the pre-election reports. It means the people of Australia will be able to understand clearly and know the economic situation of the country prior to elections. I commend the bill to the House and, along with the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin), trust it has a speedy passage through the Senate from here. AIDC SALE BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 February, on motion by Mr Fahey: That the bill be now read a second time.",16
9,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEES,"There has been an agreement to bring the AIDC Sale Bill on at this time because we in the opposition have been pushing for a provision to be made to allow for grievances and 90second statements today. There was a reluctance on the part of the government to embrace that and I know it is not listed on the Notice Paper today, but the understanding is that, between now and 2 o'clock, we will be aiming to complete the AIDC Sale Bill and allow 90 or so minutes for grievances and 90second statements. I mention that not only to reflect the agreeit ment and our intent but to indicate that at some stage the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) or a representative may need to move a motion to enable us to get into grievances and 90-second statements. We on this side respect the importance of those debates for backbenchers, and they should not be crowded out by government business. But turning to this bill. The bill was introconcerns duced into the parliament on 27 February. It makes legislative amendments to enable the sale of the Australian Industry Development Corporation-the AIDC as it is known. It was established in 1970 as an investment bank to finance Australian industry. Its role when established was essentially to fill a gap that was not then adequately covered by the banking sector and other financial lenders. It essentially was established to cover cases where the development would not otherwise take place or would have only been possible in circumstances, unless local finance was available, that involved ownership and control going to foreign investors. Over the years the AIDC has pioneered infrastructure financing, and it has a unique capability of turning public policy into reality through reacting as a policy lever for national deVelopment. It developed widely recognised project, resource and infrastructure financing expertise. Some of the many significant examples and developments which occurred with AIDC financing include the Woodside North West Shelf gas project, which involved $US 1.6 billion of financing, and the Argyle Diamond project, where the AIDC was the only Australian financier. There would have been no Australian equity in it but for the AIDe. I also mention the Eraring Power Station project, which was financed through AIDC, and the nucleus telectronics pacemaker, which AIDC underwrote the initial financing of. In addition to all of those very worthwhile and significant infrastructure investments, the AIDC has contributed some $130 million in dividend payments to the Commonwealth since 1983. The AIDC did undergo some substantial losses several years ago. As a consequence, restructured its operations and it has subsequently recovered well, with annual after tax earnings forecast to be around $60 million this year. We recognise it was the coalition election policy to privatise the AIDC. They confirmed this in last year's budget. It is against that background that, overall, Labor will not be opposing the bill. However, we do have some about the legislation and the way the sale is to be conducted. Many of these concerns are reflected in our second reading amendment as well as the amendment we will move in the detail of the bill. Overall, the AIDC has performed well. It did make a loss in 1991, but most banks reported major losses in that period. But it did not, through its difficult period, need to draw on the government guarantee. The loss occurred largely because in the midto late-1980s the AIDC had moved away from its core business of infrastructure and resources. We, as a Labor Party, believe there is still a need for activity in this area. It moved away from those core businesses-infrastructure and resources-towards a far greater emphasis on fee based merchant banking and business. Following its restructure, it did make pre-tax profits of $175 million over the last four years. As I have already indicated, it expects to make a pre-tax profit of some $60 million this year. The AIDC currently employs some 200 people. The Labor Party does not want to see overly generous golden handshakes-or, in the case of some, golden handcuffs-going to AIDC senior management. But, apart from that group, we are concerned that the ordinary workers in the organisation are not disadvantaged by the sale. I note that concerns were expressed about this during the Senate committee hearings earlier this week. Labor is pleased that assurances have now been given that the existing terms and conditions of employment for these workers will be maintained. The AIDC is one of two Australian controlled and independent investment houses. There is a real chance that, through this sale, it could be purchased by overseas interests, particularly as there are no special provisions in the bill to deal with foreign ownership. Labor notes the assurances of the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) in the Senate earlier this week that, if the buyer is overseas owned, AIDe's 48 112 per cent holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation could be excluded from the sale. We welcome that assurance but believe we need to legislate to ensure that assurance. That is the purpose of the amendment that we will be moving when we consider the detail of this bill. We will be essentially moving at that stage that the Australian Submarine Corporation component be removed from AIDC Ltd and located within the corporation which is to stay in place under this legislative arrangement to manage the borrowings and loan portfolio and to manage such national interest assets as the Commonwealth's Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding. Essentially, the AIDC will remain in existence. It needs to manage certain activities. We are saying that this is where the Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding should be parked to ensure the guarantee, the assurance, that was given by Senator Kemp in another place. It will also ensure that the ASC does not become foreign controlled. AIDC has also been a significant investor in Australian infrastructure development. I mentioned some very significant examples a little earlier. Approximately half of its activity in the infrastructure development field has been in regional Australia. The sale of AIDC, without a genuine effort to replace it, will be seen as part of the government's continued assault on regional Australia. There are many reasons why regional Australia feels, rightly, that they have been betrayed by this government. The first act of the Howard government in relation to regional J velopment was to cut $150 million in regional infrastructure projects, despite the fact that they promised during the election campaign that they would not do it. When the announcement was made by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)-he still calls himself the regional development minister but, as his first act, abolished his own department-the statement justifying this breach of election promise was that 'there is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development'. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you this: this comes from a National Party member in this House, a person who is touted as a future leader of the National Party, but if the National Party does not stand for regional development what does it stand for? Yet he has come into the House and justified the abolition of $150 million of the regional infrastructure fund saying that there is no constitutional role for the Commonwealth in regional development. Labor believes there is a Commonwealth role in regional development. We believe that there is a role for all governments in regional development. We are sick to death of this buck-passing between levels of government when the issues become too hard for the government. The simple fact of the matter is that what is good for regional Australia is good for the nation. It therefore requires, if we are to support regional Australia, all levels of government to get behind that work. Instead, what do we see from the present government and from the minister for so-called regional development? They are washing their hands as a government of involvement in regional development. But it got worse. The first budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), confirmed the approach of a massive betrayal of regional Australia. Those who rely on regional roads and infrastructure are the big losers. Higher education funding has been slashed, with the cuts falling disproportionatelyon the regional campuses. Assistance to the unemployed has been cut by over $1 billion, again falling heavily on regional Australia. ABC funding has been cut. There has been a massive attack on regional welfare and service delivery, with cuts in areas such as dental services. We are seeing closures of regional CES, Tax and Medicare offices. There is no doubt that there is an enormous sense of bewilderment and betrayal widespread among regional Australians resulting from the cuts throughout regional Australiaa part of the nation that voted overwhelmingly for this government and expected better of it. But it has been dudded. It has been betrayed. As to the cuts to regional infrastructure alone, first we saw in July last year this $150 million regional infrastructure fund totally abolished. I have mentioned the pretext used-there is no role for the Commonwealth in regional development, which are the words of the minister. Second, there was the axing of the infrastructure bond program with only the vague promise of a replacement program to be brought forward in the budget. Labor indicated at the time that we would support any measure to remove unintended consequences from tax concessions. However, what we are saying is that the failure to announce a replacement program has put at risk billions of dollars of regional development. Just understand the lethargy and lack of ideas resulting from this government. This issue of infrastructure bonds has been around now for over 12 months in this government's term of office. They indicated that they wanted to stop excessive use and excessive claims under the scheme. But what was the decision of the government after 12 months? It was to freeze the fund, to not allow any projects to go forward. After 12 months, having frozen 72 regional infrastructure projects, all around the country, the best that they could say is, 'We'll freeze them-not that we have an alternative, not that we have really thought through a policy change; the best we can come up with after 12 months of looking at this issue is to freeze the funds, to stop further regional development occurring in this nation.' So we have the scrapping of the $]50 million infrastructure fund. We have the freeze now on infrastructure bonds with no alternative having been put in place. There are 72 projects sitting out there all waiting for approval-all necessary to regional development and all prepared to be financed by a combination of the private sector and government authorities. But, no, this government will not allow them to go ahead. No wonder regional Australia feels you have betrayed them. It is not as if these are pie in the sky projects. These are essential projects to the regions of this country-road funding, infrastructure such as gas pipelines, and water supply. Yet we have a double whammy from this government: not only have they scrapped the fund that assist in getting some of these projects going but also they have scrapped the infrastructure bond program and have put nothing in place. On top of all of that, they are now coming along with the sale of the AIDC, again without any alternative being put in place. The sale has been announced. But there is no hint of the government's plans to do anything to address the future need for private sector investment in our national infrastructure, except perhaps the institutional investor information service, which was announced with some understated fanfare by the Minister for Regional Development. He said it was a world first, but all he did was copy the original scheme of Brian Howe, who announced it back in 1995. The only statement made in this chamber by the minister for so-called regional development after more than a year of activity and which gives any sort of hope is something that copies Labor's plan. They have broken promises all over the place. They have told regional Australia that they would support the infrastructure funds. They have told them that they would back them in regional infrastructure. All they have done is cut the very programs that give that support, and the'best they can do is copy a scheme from Labor. We thank you for copying Labor's scheme, but why do you not copy more of them? Why do you not reinstitute the regional development fund? Why do you not put a replacement up for the infrastructure bonds that enable these projects to go ahead? And why do you not put in place a replacement body for the AIDC to support the financing of infrastructure in important parts of this country? The AIDC, it must be said, was involved in some significant infrastructure bond projects. For example, the Wyuna water project, with two water treatment plants in New South Wales, was funded and backed by the AIDe. Yet it is now frozen because of the government's decision on infrastructure bonds. There is also the Oakey power station in Queensland-a 270 megawatt gas-fired power station, essential if you are about supplying energy source to regions to enable them to value add. This, too, was frozen out by Treasurer Costello's announcement on the infrastructure bonds. The Redbank power project in the Hunter Valley-a $300 million project which uses coal tailings as fuel-is frozen. I know that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) has serious concerns about this particular project being put on ice. What do we have from the Treasurer on this? We have an assertion that he has frozen the scheme because it was being rorted. None of these projects was a rort. I challenge the Treasurer to come into this House and identify where the rorts have been occurring. This was the same excuse he used when he wound up the syndication of research and development in this country. This is the classic dupe that Treasury and Finance always put forward. Wherever a worthwhile project overruns as to revenue forgone implications, Treasury says, 'Minister, we have a submission for you. There is an overrun. Call it a rort.' Any time there is a project that is worthwhile and should be persisted with but Treasury does not like it, they get the minister all wound up and say, 'Call it a rort.' That is what the Treasurer has done in terms of R&D syndication. He has also said it in terms of infrastructure bonds, but not had the decency to come into this chamber on any occasion and identify and spell out those rorts. I remember a debate that we were having in this House towards the end of last year on the scrapping of the research and development syndication. He had to sit in the same chair as the duty minister at the table is sitting for some six hours of debate, squirming away-signing Christmas cards, as I remember, to try to avoid attention-because we gave him the opportunity, time and time again, to get up and list the rorts. He would not do it. He cringed because he knew, if he tried to do it, that he could be guilty of misleading the House. I challenge him again to come in and tell us where the rorts are in terms of the infrastructure bonds. In particular, I ask him why those three projects that I have just outlined cannot go ahead-the Wyuna water project, the Oakey power station in Queensland and the Redbank power project in the Hunter Valley. Let him explain why his mismanagement, his blinkered approach, is preventing these important aspects of regional infrastructure from proceeding to fruition. We believe that government does have a role in renewing our regional infrastructure. We believe it does have a role in working with industry to build exports, smart research and jobs. There is still a need for the type of service that the AIDC was originally designed to provide. Although the details have changed to some extent, the need is still there, particularly because investors have a reluctance to put money into regional Australia. The AIDC moved away from that role. Unfortunately, its focus became directed to fee based merchant banking, which could just as easily be met by the private sector. If you look at the Financial Review today on page 32, we have the AIDC entering vendor finance. The simpl- fact of the matter is that we do not need a body to enter fees and interest charges. We do not need another body to get into vendor financing, but we do need a body that supports regional infrastructure, a body that is prepared to back these significant projects where they matter to the development of our regions, getting valuehe has added up, making sure we do not rely on commodities as our sole basis for exports, supporting the huge surge in manufacturing which we have seen over the last decade. These things only happen because governments are prepared to playa role. We think that there is still a role for a body to be established to perform what was originally in intended and commenced by the AIDe. The fact of the matter is that there is a gap in patient investment capital in this country, both in relation to infrastructure investment and in meeting the needs of small high technology, export focused firms. Mr Hockey-Why is that?",16
10,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEES,"I see the member for North Sydney does not think there is a role. You go and tell small businesses who come to you and say, 'The banks won't lend me money. The banks are only interested in taking the full equity in the operation. The banks won't support us.' Mr Hockey-What will you do?",21
11,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEES,"I will tell you what we will do. We will back their interests and we will support them with structures which make sure they get that funding. The fact is, you talk big but you will not act. You get these representations from small business, yet you do nothing for them. So why don't you get real! Why don't you actually do something on behalf of your constituents and back our call for the government to establish an effective body which supports small business in this country? We know that, in the cosy climes of North Sydney, you would not know much about regional Australia. But I say to you, get out there and have a look at the place. Go and see some of these projects and see what has been begging. He incites me, Mr Deputy Speaker. I apologise, I will return to directing my comments through you.",21
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Jenkins)The House might return to a little bit of order.,21
13,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEES,"The reality is, the government is doing nothing to fill this gap because it does not believe that it has a role in this area. Worse, it is cutting away all of the existing support mechanisms-the R&D tax concessions, the bounties, the DIFF scheme, the export market development grants scheme, Austrade, AusIndustry-with a total of $3.9 billion cut out of the last budget. This year the axe looks set to fall further on the motor vehicle industry. We could see its demise if the government adopts the majority recommendations of the Productivity Commission. Textiles, clothing and footwear, pharmaceuticals, information technology and, once again, the research and development concession are all under, not a microscope, but this huge laser beam that the Treasurer wants to zap into industry because he does not believe there is any role for government. It is about time some on the back bench understood the destruction that the Treasurer is creating in terms of our manufacturing base in this country. It is about time they backed manufacturing industry in this country. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr John Moore, from the safety of Hanover yesterday-he is not even in the parliament defending this, he is in Hanover, no doubt checking the stock exchanges to see what little bit of trading can be done on the side-said: I'm not anticipating further cuts to government business programs because when you have a balance of payments problem the role of exports is vital. I hope he is right, but it does sound a little bit like pre-empting the budget process. We will find out when he returns to. this parliament whether he has been successful in that regard. I hope he is more successful than in his discussion the other night at Canberra's most exclusive club with the Treasurer. There they were at the Commonwealth Club, finished dinner, and over port and cigars the Treasurer of the country and the industry minister were discussing the future of the car industry. The Treasurer said, 'Minister, my vision for the car industry in this country is to wipe out Mitsubishi.' That was his plan, his secret vision for the car industry, to wipe out one of the manufacturers. This is the person who is running your government and it is about time people on the back bench stood up to him. Labor recognises that, to some extent, the AIDC has moved from its original charter and that the need for patient capital and private sector investment in major infrastructure projects, while just as significant, does now need to be addressed in different ways. The AIDC itself has confirmed that there is no function that it now performs which cannot be carried out equally as well by the private sector. But there still remains a significant gap in the market. The AIDC is no longer specifically focused towards filling that gap. Labor sought examination of the issue through the Senate legislation committeeand that took place on Monday. It was a process which yielded some useful information, including the fact that the legislation had been drafted without reference to the AIDC board. This is a great government of consultation. It said, 'We are going to wipe you out, board members, but we will not tell you about it. We will keep it secret. We will drop it on you in the parliament. You can read about it in the newspapers.' It was only through the hearings that we had in the Senate that the board was able to flag three problems that they had with the legislation. Unless Labor had actually gone to the accountability exercise over there we would not have known about this. This government would not have sought to ask them about this. These difficulties should have been sorted out well before the legislation was tabled. It does reflect this undue haste, which the government seems to continually get itself into in introducing legislation, and its inability to manage the processes of government. Labor has a second reading amendment with regard to this legislation. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, and recognising that there were difficulties associated with the way the AIDe had moved from its original charter, this House: (1) reaffirms its commitment to the principles underpinning the AIDC's creation; (2) condemns the government for not putting a structure in place which addresses the failure of Australia's capital markets to provide sufficient long-term, patient funds for industry development; and (3) calls on the government to establish an effective means of supporting patient capital ment and to determine remedial strategies appropriate to today's environment"". I indicate to the House that, in addition to that second reading amendment, in the consideration in detail stage we will seek to move an amendment to require that the Submarine Corporation shares be parked in the AIDC to ensure that if the Submarine Corporation and the activities that spin-off from it, that have seen enormous leverage given to the defence systems and heavy engineering capacity of this country, and the critical mass that it established-that would not have been backed by Australian financiers but for the AIDCare to be kept, they are kept properly through the corporation structure and ensure that it does not come under foreign control. I will seek the opportunity at a later stage to address the detail of the bill.",21
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Jenkins)Is the amendment seconded?,22
15,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,It is my great pleasure to second the amendment and I reserve my right to speak.,22
16,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES,"On a more tempered and focused note I would like to initially reflect on the original goals of the AIDC and where the AIDC is at now. A little later I will speak about the management and board of the AIDC, which the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) raised in his speech in this second reading debate. For the record, AIDC Ltd is now an investment house that provides infrastructure, resources and corporate advice and financing in Australia and Asia. It is a specialist in equity investment and funds management and financial markets and securitisation. The AIDC Sale Bill, which was introduced by the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), puts in place the commitment of the coalition government in the March 1996 election campaign to privatise AIDC Ltd. The Australian Industry Development Corporation was set up in 1970 as a statutory corporation. Its mission was to facilitate and encourage the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries. It is fair to say that the AIDC has had some great investsuccesses-for example, the North West Shelf gas project financing for Woodside Petroleum Ltd; the project financing for the massive Eraring power station in New South Wales; and, an issue that is very dear to the heart and mind of the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), the establishment of a consortium of institutional investors in Optus Communications. AIDC's business activities have expanded to fee based merchant banking activities. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, AIDC experienced some substantial losses. In 1988, the AIDC went through a colourful period, including a recognised capital shortage by the Commonwealth government which led to the creation of AIDC Ltd and the Australian Stock Exchange listing of 19 per cent of AIDC Ltd in 1989. Of course the Commonwealth retained 81 per cent of the listed entity. For some years, and particularly during the Labor years obviously, the government talked of selling off the remaining interest in AIDC Ltd. As a result, there was great uncertainty regarding the future of the company. It is fair to say that this does have a damaging impact on the morale of staff and management and also of the board and that that may have contributed to some of the less than profitable years towards the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s. I am prepared to recognise that, particularly when in the 1992-93 budget the Labor government announced its intention to sell down, to 51 per cent, the government's share in AIDC Ltd. It was in August 1992 that the government recognised that this was going to prove very difficult and withdrew the sale. In 1993-94, we saw the Labor government do a backflip yet again on another issue when it said that it was going to pursue the sale. But then in April 1994 the Labor Party said that it may change its mind in relation to the sale process. In 1995, the former Labor government announced that they were going to go into the market and buy back from private investors the remaining 19 per cent of AIDC Ltd, the minority shareholding. They suggested that this was going to take place so they could properly prepare AIDC Ltd for a full sale at a later date. The takeover offer closed in January 1996 and AIDC was deIisted one month before the election last year. The federal government wants to sell AIDC because it is a good idea. It experienced losses in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It had a profit turnaround in 1993 and significant before tax profits in each of the years since. In 1995-96, AIDC Ltd had a record $50.3 million profit, which I will talk about a little later. It is, however, not in the public interest to retain public ownership of a merchant banking operation. There are, of course, many other investment banking operations in the Australian financial marketplace, but the government should not be involved in an operating business on a commercial basis in a competitive environment, especially where that competitive environment is related to the issuance of capital and the use of capital for profit purposes. This is entirely consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit. Further, it is fair to say that Australia enjoys very sophisticated financial markets and there is no public benefit for the Commonwealth in continuing to have an extensive involvement in the financial marketplace. For example, AIDC can enter into swaps agreements, foreign exchange agreements, forward rate agreements, option agreements, futures agreements and hedge agreements, all of which start to become complicated financial instruments once you start getting involved in derivatives of each of those and exotic agreements. These businesses have no place in the public sector other than to hedge the overall risk of the Commonwealth. The government is pursuing the competitive neutrality principle. There is an existing funding advantage for the Commonwealth, and the AIDC has enjoyed access to the Commonwealth's AAA domestic guarantee, which means that it should be an even more profitable enterprise than it is at the moment. I understand that the AIDC does not pay any guarantee fees to the Commonwealth for the benefit of enjoying the AAA status domestically and AA status on S&P rating in international markets. The termination of access to the government guarantee facility Will place the AIDC business where it belongs-on exactly the same footing as the rest of the financial services industry. There is an issue that has been brought to my attention over the last few weeks as I have been researching the sale process for AIDC Ltd. It is a matter of grave concern not just to this parliament but to all Australians, who in fact have a stake in the future of AIDC Ltd. It comes down to the fact that the AIDC management has taken a regressive approach to the sale process. AIDC management has served only its own interest during the sale process and there is a good reason for that, which I would like to elaborate on. As of the figures of 31 December 1996, a contingent liability for employee termination is in the accounts amounting to. around $32 million. This $32 million-most of which benefits around 50 of the total of 200 employees, which would be a rule of thumb application-would suggest that management has set for itself amongst the most lucrative employment contracts in the financial services industry in Australia. The company has net assets of around $246 million. So up to 15 per cent of the net asset figure would have to be allocated to the termination of employees and, particularly, senior management. That is an extraordinary figure. But it goes further. According to the 1996 annual report, the executive remuneration in AIDe Ltd has reached preposterous levels. As I referred to a little earlier, profits have improved. In the profit for AIDe Ltd was $47.3 million. In 1995, the profit was $25 million. In 1995, with a profit of $25 million, there were more than 10 executives in AIDe Ltd receiving over $700,000. More than 10 executives were receiving over $700,000 per annum in an organisation that has a total of 200 employees. That is an extraordinary figure. It is even more extraordinary, if you take the levels a little bit further, that 16 people received more than $250,000, and that was on a profit figure of $25 million. On a 1996 profit figure of $50.3 million, 18 executives received more than $250,000. Some would say-and it is fair, and I agree with it-that it is only appropriate that executives should receive benefits on the basis of the profit projections. But my concern is the fact that the 1995-96 so-called profit is primarily made up of a write back of asset values and loans. So, essentially, what the management has done, or is seen to have done, is revalue everything upwards to create a profit result in 1995-96 of $50.3 million, which seems to be almost a 100 per cent improvement on the previous year. I would not deny-nor would anyone, or very few, in this House-the right of senior management or talented people on the staff to have very generous salary packages based on the level of profit in the organisation. It is only appropriate in the financial services sector and particularly in the markets, where there are extraordinary pressures on individuals and there is extraordinary risk associated with decisions made less than every minute of every hour of every day. There are only too many examples where imprudent financial management has caused grave harm to organisations such as Barings, more recently Natwest in the United Kingdom, and a few other organisations. I think it was Nomura that was the unfortunate recipient of a billion dollar mistake. But when salary levels are pitched at such a high point and the underlying profit of an organisation does not indicate that they should be, then what they are doing is ripping off the shareholder. And that is exactly what the AIDe management have done. They have 1994, ripped off the shareholder by taking such excessive salaries and putting in place extraordinary termination agreements. In 1996, $25.9 million was the total salary package for AIDe Ltd-this puts it in perspective-and yet their termination agreements and the contingent liability in the accounts is $32 million, which would indicate that every employee in AIDe Ltd is guaranteed more than an entire year's salary for termination. You and I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the hard working personal assistant or hard working secretary or the young employee who is running to and from the market or doing the courier service or working in the photocopy room is not going to get a year's salary. So what does that mean about the senior executives' termination payments? And even now we need to ask the question: what is the motivation of the management and the board in impeding the smooth process to due diligence during the sale process? I will tell you what it is. It is an underlying arrogance. Professor Jeremy Davis was quoted in the Australian Financial Review of 18 March as saying: The real core of AIDC's business li<!s in the relationship with our 80 to 100 clients. The exercise of this right to information could be damaging to the company. The report goes on to say: Professor Davis said AIDe was not looking for a veto but a limit to the due diligence process for buyers. Professor Davis is showing an extraordinary arrogance and a lack of understanding of the most basic sale principles for any financial institution. Professor Davis seems to have forgotten some of the lessons of the past. The State Bank of Victoria was never sold to the Commonwealth Bank-they never went through any due diligence process. The State Bank of South Australia was never sold to Advance Bank-they never went through any due diligence process. Bankwest was never sold to the Bank of Scotland-they never went through any due diligence process. The Commonwealth Bank was never sold to the markets-they never went through any due diUgence. process. And it goes on. State Bank was never sold to Colonial-there was no due diligence process. Metway. was never sold into the Bank of Queensland and the Queensland government-there was no due diligence process. And it goes on and on and on. And the Chairman of AIDC Ltd has the absolute hide to come into this parliament and tell the Senate committee that the due diligence process might unveil confidential information about customers. He either does not understand the most basic processes of due diligence or he is· guilty of the most heinous crime of obstructing the obvious will of the shareholders-the people of Australia. If Professor Davis is not going to comply with the demands of this parliament and the demands of the shareholder, then he should resign and take his entire board with him. Because what he is doing is saying to us that AIDC should be absolutely separate from the normal processes of sale, including the due diligence process, which will reveal the true value of the asset. As I have indicated, AIDC's profit result last year was not that good. They have chosen to revalue a few assets and inflated the profit figure but the underlying profit is disappointing-given that it has a AAA guarantee, which only three banks in the world have; only three banks in the entire world have an international AAA guarantee. And AIDC's domestic AAA and international AA give them significant benefits; yet on assets of $256 million last year their profit was $50.3 million with some revaluations tied in. On behalf of the people in my electorate and on behalf of the people in this House, I urge AIDC management to make a contribution to the sale process. The only message I am hearing-and I am standing on the sidelines-is that AIDC management are impeding at every point the smooth sale process. You know why? Because they have set up for themselves the most cosy executive remuneration contracts anywhere in the markets. They like their cosy little arrangement-their AAA guarantee, their wonderful termination payments, their wonderful remuneration payments. They do not even have to rely on substantial underlying profits to deliver them good remuneration. It is greedy and it is grubby! The sooner AIDC is sold into the market, the sooner it will be accustomed to real market pressures, the sooner the executives of AIDC will realise that the gravy train cannot continue, especially at the expense of the people of Australia. I call on the management of AIDC Ltd to lift their game. I warn them that not only am I am watching them, not only are the bidders carefully watching them, not only are the government and this House watching them but the market is watching them-and we are watching them very closely. If they are going to have that sort of attitude in this process, they are going to find it very hard to survive either the sale process or any process after that.",22
17,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"I will be supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean). Let me say a couple things about the contribution from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey). It is all very well for the honourable member to draw these very serious concerns, which we agree with, about the operations of the AIDC and its management, but what does the AIDC Sale Bill 1997 provide to deal with your concerns? It does not provide very much at all. We have moved our amendment not just in relation to these concerns but in relation number of concerns that we have on the opposition side. We have a number of concerns about what is going on and about the way in which the government has dealt with this issue. Although we will not decline to give the bill a second reading, we will be moving amendments in the consideration in detail stage. We believe the second reading amendment focuses on some very important issues. The first issue has to do with philosophy, with the reasons why the AIDe is being sold. The honourable member for North Sydney presented many of the reasons. ",25
18,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"He has left the chamber, but he presented some good reasons. Basically, the AIDe has moved away from the purposes and philosophy for which it was created. But the danger here is that we will throw out the baby with the bathwater. The danger is-and this is certainly the view of the government according to the second reading speech-that the government does not see any role for an organisation such as the AIDe. We have a problem with an organisation. It is not performing the function for which it was originally created, so what do we say? 'Okay, that's the reason to get rid of the organisation.' On top of that, we then say, 'There is no reason for any organisation to perform that function.' We do not agree with that philosophically, politically and in terms of the economic development of this nation because the fundamental issue facing this nation at the moment is employment and unemployment. In order to effectively deal with that issue, we have to deal with the question of industry development. Industry policy is the crucial issue facing this House. It is a shame that it is so poorly addressed at the moment, with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism e Mr Moore) not having a clue, not having any ideas and not having any suggestions. On top of that, we have seen from this government a tax on programs designed to support and sustain industry. It is in this context that we have to understand this debate to a about the AIDe and the amendment moved by the opposition. We are saying in our amendment that we reaffirm a commitment to the principles underpinning the AIDe's creation. It might be reflective to talk about that for a moment. A document from the Parliamentary Library refers to the purposes for which the AIDe was formed. It states: The AIDe was established in 1970 ... the initiative of the Rt Hon. 1. MCEwen, then Minister for Trade and Industry, who saw the need to counter Australia's growing dependence on foreign capital to support its enterprises and industries. The AIDe is an investment bank which finances Australian industries and which also participates in enterprises and projects. MCEwen was not opposed to foreign investment per se and, in fact, he acknowledged the importance of the availability of such capital in Australia. The AIDe was created to assist Australian residents match the share of capital required to create or maintain enterprises so as to avoid too often becoming the minor partner in an enterprise which was the target of foreign investment or takeover. At that time, the Australian motor industry was nearly 90% foreign controlled. The industrial and heavy chemicals industry, and the pharmaceuticals industries were over 80% foreign controlled. Overseas ownership of the electrical and electronic industries was around 50%. The AIDe was created to fill a gap not then adequately covered by the banking and other financial lenders. The AIDe was there to assist in cases where the development would not otherwise take place, or would not be possible in circumstances where, unless local finance was available, ownership and control would go to foreign investors. A piece of history, Mr Deputy Speaker. We believe those general underlying principles of the AIDe are still relevant. But the government, in getting rid of the AIDe, is not putting in place any structure which addresses the failure of Australia's capital markets to provide sufficient long-term patient funds for industry development. It does not address that. This is a critical issue for us as a nation, as a people. We have to develop more broadly and, as the shadow minister said, develop our industries throughout the regions of Australia, otherwise our future as a nation is going to be glum. We must do more in industry development but, without an organisation or a structure that takes up this task, it is going to be very difficult. So we condemn the government for not doing enough, not thinking enough and not putting into place sufficient policies to help develop a structure of this kind that can assist in the injection of capital. There is no doubt that the government does not see any such need because according to the second reading speech: Since its establishment as a company AIDC has been changing the direction of the business activity of the company. While still focusing on the opment or advancement of the infrastructure resource sectors of the economy, it is pursuing to a far greater extent fee-based merchant banking business. This government is firmly of the view that such activities have no place continuing public sector. That is the explanation that we get in the second reading speech when we try to underactually stand what the government is on about in terms of this concern with the financing industry. It is interesting to look at what philosophical basis of this concern second reading speech also says: The government's decision to sell the AIDC Limited is consistent with the recommendations the National Commission of Audit which conin sidered that government business activities whose objectives are to provide goods and services commercial basis should only be retained in public ownership if there is a clear public interest do so. With the emergence and development financial markets in Australia any public interest case to retain the AIDC in public ownership has disappeared. First of all, I suppose that means that the provision of capital is a good or service. That is interesting. Whoever wrote this perhaps should go back and look at their economics texts. It seems to them that the provision of capital is a good or service. They do not understand the fact that the banking sector does not sufficiently lend regional areas, in risk areas, in new areas in innovative areas. Yet in this country we have the problem that we have a large number of skilled people, a very highly skilled work Ireland. force, but we do not have enough industry for them to be employed in. Is it because we not have the general idea of what to do? Couldn't we in Australia produce whitegoods? Couldn't we in Australia produce electronic products? Couldn't we in Australia produce more telecommunications? Couldn't we in Australia have more processing of minerals? Couldn't we in Australia have more processing of food? Couldn't we in Australia have a whole range of other industries? Of course we could. Why don't we have a structure or a body which can actually help at least in the initial stages? This is a matter that is going to have to be taken up at some point or another. I can tell develyou that we on this side of the House are and determined to push this issue about industry development over and over again. If the government is not prepared to put into place in the a minister who is going to listen and who is going to be at least interested in the issues, if the government is not going to be prepared to start thinking in innovative ways about how we can proactively get our industries going, then we are going to be in a lot the of strife. But we are going to make this an is. The issue at the next election. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), who is at the table, knows what of I am talking about because we were recently a parliamentary delegation that visited the Republic of Ireland. It was very instructive to on a see what can be done because in the Republic case to of Ireland they have converted from an of agriculturally based economy 20 years ago20 years ago only-into an economy based on high technology industries. And not only that; they have actually been able to develop those they think industries in the regions. How have they done that? Do you think they have done it by allowing everything to enter the free market without government intervention? On the contrary. As the honourable member for Ballarat knows, we were all stunned to see the number of concessions and in the number of active policies that were put and into place by a government owned organisation designed to achieve manufacturing, high technology industries regionally based in I am not saying that all of these industries do would be possible in Australia. By the way, we thought some of these were against the World Trade Organisation until we discovered how much you can actually do in the investment area. For example, some companies investing in manufacturing in Ireland have a reduced corporate tax rate to 10 per cent up to the year 2010. They are able to have a reduced tax for investment. There is a whole range of other initiatives-tax-free repatriation of profits in certain circumstances, tax exempt government securities, capital allowances and expenditure on scientific research-all sorts of measures put into place to ensure that you get the kind of investment that is required in industry. There is another serious aspect to this issue, and we have had quite a few serious aspects raised so far. We also had the serious questions raised by the honourable member for North Sydney. I look forward to seeing what the minister intends to put into place to deal with the issues he raised. There are also the matters raised by the honourable member for Hotham-the problem we face as a nation with so many regions spread out geographically, so many different places that need small and medium sized industries, industries where our people can work. Are you saying in the context of that that we do not need some kind of organisation? We certainly don't need the currently operating AIDC with all of its problems. But we need an organisation that is going to achieve those results. Unless we hear some answers from the government, we are going to be not only insisting on our amendment, but we are going to be keeping them on their toes over and over and saying, 'What are you going to do about a structure to provide capital for industry?' The other amendments that we are foreshadowing for after the second reading debate stage have to do with the Australian Submarine Corporation. What is the government going to do about the Australian Submarine Corporation? This is a very serious question. As the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham, has said, the opposition asked a few questions about this in the Senate committee hearings. It is instructive to read the text of key questions raised by Senator Robert Ray: Senator ROBERT RAY-Minister, you would realise that the Australian Submarine Corporation was designed to always have an Australian ownership. I think Kockums own about 48.5 per cent approximately and AIDC and the other by a small Australian shareholder. Will this open the possibilitythat is the sale of the AIDCof the Australian Submarine Corporation being owned in the majority overseas? Senator Kemp-That is not the government's intention, Senator Ray. Senator ROBERT RAY-It is not the government's intention but is there a possibility of that if AIDC is purchased in part by foreign owners and you do not actually transfer their holding of the Australian Submarine outside it? Senator Kemp-No. The advice I have is that that is not the government's intention and, clearly, if there was a potential problem in the area the submarine would be pulled out of the sale. Senator ROBERT RAY-Have you identified an area that you would transfer the asset to? An official answers: Mr Hutchinson-The propOSItIon is that the asset initially be held by the Australian Industry Development Corporation-the statutory authority-which would need to continue in operation for some time to manage the borrowings that are still in place and that run for some considerable period. So, in the first case, the corporation would hold the shares but it is possible to vest them elsewhere in the Commonwealth. Senator ROBERT RAY-Would you have any idea where else you could invest those shares? Mr Hutchinson-They could be vested in the Commonwealth directly so that the Department of Defence could hold them, or any other government agency so nominated by the administrative arrangements orders could hold them, or they could be vested in another Commonwealth entity, another Commonwealth GBE, if that was thought appropriate. Senator ROBERT RAY-There would be a great deal of awkwardness if it went to the Department of Defence because then it would be part owner and client, similar to the problems they have with Australian Defence Industries. You would have to put up all sorts of Chinese walls. Where else in the government, apart from Defence, do you think you could vest them to avoid those problems? Mr Hutchinson-If they were merely a financial asset they could be vested with the Department of Finance or the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism if that was appropriate. majority This is the key point: The ministers have given no consideration beyond the possibility that they could be held in corporation for some time. The ministers have given no consideration. The top official admits there is a problem and a very serious issue. The government says, 'No, we don't want to get rid of Australian ownership of the Australian Submarine Corporation. We are going to sell the AIDC, but we haven't given any consideration about what we are going to do about the issue.' What sort of a government is this? Here is a very key defence industry, the Australian Submarine Corporation. They say they don't want to put it out of Australian ownership and yet they have not done anything in terms of putting into place a plan to deal with it. Our amendments will deal with this issue directly. (Time expired)  speaking on the bill that allows the Australian Industry Development Corporation Ltd to be sold off. We have had the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) on the government side intervene in this debate. I would just like to extend a general apology that there are no other government members speaking on the debate and, particularly, no National Party members. I find it extraordinary that no National Party member is sufficiently motivated by the current pressing issues of this bill or the history of the bill, because the AIDC was established when Black Jack MCEwen was Minister for Trade and Industry. I would have thought they would have wanted some pride of ownership on this and to make some comments about it. It is interesting that, when it was set up back in 1970, it was proposed as a mechanism for countering Australia's dependence on foreign capital to support its enterprises and its industry. That was a very worthwhile thing in 1970 and I make the point that it has remained as relevant in the 1980s and 1990s as it was in the 1970s. From our perspective on this side of the House, we are unapologetic about wanting to say that we support processes and mechanisms that allow Australian industry to grow and not to be owned by or dependent on foreign capital. It is ironic that we are supporting a measure to effectively privatise something owned by the Commonwealth. But, like a number of organisations, this institution, regrettably, has long departed from the original vision and aims that were had for it. That is a matter of regret, but it is the reality. So, in selling off AIDC, we are not selling something that is countering Australia's growing dependence on foreign capital to support enterprise and industry. This is not an organisation that is supporting technological breakthroughs any more. One of the things the AIDC can rightly claim some credit for is the fact that it funded the Nucleus Techtronics pacemaker. We need an Australian institution that is prepared to fund breakthroughs-the pacemaker, the cochlear ear implant or whatever the next generation of exciting products developed by our scientists and researchers may be. We do not have that institution. It is a great tragedy that, in a country so relatively small in size, we are and always have been capable of doing good research and providing breakthroughs but we have not been good at product development and getting things onto the market. In particular, all too often we have not been good at keeping things in Australian hands. People are getting more and more upset about this, as they understand that when these things go overseas or are bought out by foreigners, the jobs and the benefits go with them in the majority of cases. We have done all the hard yards to have that research breakthrough but another foreign company in another country will get all the benefits of it. So, when AIDC was funding projects like the pacemaker, it was a very important institution to us on this side of the House, but critically important to innovative Australian industry. They have had some other very important investments-and I want to talk about one in particular in some detail-but they have long since gone away from that role. If you read today's Financial Review, it talks about the AIDC entering vendor finance and wanting to get into deep partnership, but that will not be for the things that John MCEwen had in mind-that is, countering foreign investment. It will not be pumping a lot of money into these companies or doing something that a lot of other companies are doing already. So that is why I am speaking-with regret-in support of the bill, in principle. It is important to read the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean). That says: That whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, and recognising that there were difficulties associated with the way the AIDe had moved from its original charter, this House: (1) reaffirms its commitment to the principles underpinning the AIDC's creation; (2) condemns the Government for not putting a structure in place which addresses the failure of Australia's capital markets to provide sufficient long-term, patient funds for industry development;I say amen to thatand (3) calls on the Government to establish an effective means of supporting patient capital investment and to determine remedial strategies appropriate to today's environment. That amendment sums it all up. We hope that on the government side they will exhibit a concern for and interest in Australian industry, funding the development and the product stage of research and development-although they have cut back research and development-assisting innovative Australian companies to grow, to develop and to export. We cannot say, 'The banks will look after it: we have banks and they do those things.' They have an appalling record. They are the most impatient providers of capital. In the farming sector, it has been an absolute tragedy to see customers who have had relationships of 20 to 30 years--{)r even generations-with one bank, only to see that bank squeeze them out of their property and inheritance. They have done that to the farming sector and to industry as well. I regret both events. We cannot look to the banks-they are failing us-and so we need to look to other institutions. I sincerely hope that the government will consider these issues seriously, because, after all, they are concerned with Australian jobs. I particularly wanted to talk about the Australian Submarine Corporation. I suppose that in the heat of political debate lots may be said about a member of parliament. But when Kim Beazley was Minister for Defence he had an outstanding record of achievement, which I think no-one really disputes. I wanted to talk about what he did on the industry side. There were decisions made on things like transforming the docks down in Victoria and getting Transfield up and running and giving them the frigate project. In relation to the Submarine Corporation a huge decision was made that, 'No, we just won't sign up to an American submarine, a British submarine, a German submarine, or whatever. We want self-reliance in Australia and we are going to build the submarine in Australia.' In fact it was in South Australia. That was a huge decision, a gutsy decision, and a quite right decision. I do not want to quibble with that decision. But if you were to look at one element that you would wish to revisit, it would be the fact that there was not a majority Australian owner. The reason I say that is that the Submarine Corporation has never had the same ambitions for exports or exporting the submarine as I believe those who made the original decisions would have envisaged. What was the Australian institution that funded the 48.5 per cent shareholding? It was the AIDC. Is it not a tragedy that you could not get the Commonwealth Bank, the National Bank, the ANZ or the super funds to come into such an important project in the national interest that added skills and technology exponentiaIIy to our defence capability and self-reliance? We could not get anyone of those; we had to get the AIDe. So if there is now another purchase of important equipment-and the current Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) says that it is vital, in the defence of Australia, in terms of self-reliance, that we have this capability in country-who is going to fund it? Regrettably, there is no institution. That is why I say to the government that we need to think in terms of developing an institution that could fulfil that role, if not others. As I say, it was a huge decision to build the submarine in Australia. I think the Submarine Corporation have done brilliantly. But my one area of criticism is the fact that they have failed to get into exports. I may even be as ungenerous to suggest that somehow Swedish options from Sweden seem to be more vigorously pushed in our region than were Australian Submarine Corporation options. What was the reason for that? We really never had tight enough control. The most amazing thing about this bill to sell off the AIDC is that Kockums still has pre-emptive rights to buyout the AIDC shareholding. So, in other words, if you want to privatise the AIDC, including its shareholding in the Submarine Corporation, you actually have to give Kockums the first right of refusal. I would have thought that that was a difficult process. I do not really think that government has thought through well how it is going to warehouse it. It may be a matter of, 'We can put it here-Finance; we can put it in industry and science-DIST; or we can warehouse it some other way.' I would have thought that in relation to Australian taxpayer funds the people of Australia would expect the government of the day to more seriously consider the implications of this move and to have a very clearly thought out approach to this problem. I am going to be followed in this debate by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), who has got some important contributions to make to this debate-I might say almost scandalous. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are in the chair, so this is not directed at you, but it is disappointing to me that there is no National Party member making a contribution to this debate, given that Black Jack MCEwen was the minister who actually established the AIDC, for reasons that I think were commendable in 1970 and for purposes in the 1970s which are still valid today. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, when I go around my electorate-I do not know what it is like in yours-people are concerned about the amount of foreign ownership. They are worried ihat there are not enough Australian owned companies. They feel that we as parliamentarians are not doing enough to assist, to push up and develop and grow our Australian owned companies and get them bigger and get them employing more Australians in jobs. This was one of the roles that Black Jack MCEwen saw for the AIDe. But it has moved away from that original objective and vision, and that is why we on this side of the House are supporting its sale. So in particular I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham and I support the bill.",26
19,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"There has been a role for the AIDe. As other speakers pointed out, it was originally established to meet real needs in this community, particularly the reluctance of investors to put their money into regional Australia. Many of us would think that there is still a need for the type of service that the the AIDC was originally established to provide. But, as other speakers have also pointed out, it has moved away from that role and its focus on fee based merchant banking can just as readily be met by private sector banks. Therefore, the case for it remaining in the public sector diminishes accordingly. I also want to say that I think AIDC has lost its way in the last two or three years because of the focus of its own management on looking after themselves rather than looking after the purposes for which AIDC was established. Back in October 1995 there was considerable public comment and public concern expressed at the salary increases awarded by senior executives of AIDC to themselves of more than 200 per cent in a single year. The Managing Director of AIDC at the time, Mr Gerry van der Merwe, according to the Sunday Age, was paid a salary of $1.8 million, making him the second highest paid executive in the country. As I understand it, his salary was in fact $1.8 million, but he received $400,000 in options as well, which took him over the $2 million mark and made him the highest paid executive in the country. The Sunday Age compared him with BHP's chief executive who received $1.9 million. But, on the other hand, BHP had a staff of 49,000 and a profit in excess of $1 billion, whereas AIDC had a staff of only 200 and a profit of $28 million. Mr van der Merwe's salary had been boosted from $320,000 to $1.8 million in a period when the bank's profits fell from $46 million to $28 million. It is little wonder that Senator Peter Cook said at the time that he was astonished at the level of wage increases awarded to him. It was not just the managing director who was being paid these extraordinary salaries. By the end of 1995, the 10 highest paid executives at AIDC were earning between $700,000 and $1.8 million each. Their pay packets corresponded to 36 per cent of AIDC's after tax profits-a truly extraordinary amount when the company was only earning those small profits and only earning those small profits when it was the beneficiary of a government guarantee. This was at a time when the senior executives had sought and gained what were referred to as golden handcuff payments. They said they had to be paid these additional amounts of money because there was uncertainty surrounding the merchant bank's future. But it seems to me, looking at the AIDC figures, that the huge percentage which was ripped off for those top salaries meant that the company was in a considerably worse position than if they had left the company. In any event, Mr van der Merwe received two retention payments-the second of which was $400,000-and he resigned one week after receiving that second retention payment. AIDC's profits were $28 million in 1994, $43 million in 1993 and $46 million in 1992 against a background where they had a preferential interest rate as a AAA rated beneficiary of the federal guarantee. So all they had to do was take money and lend it on to the National Bank, making use of the guarantee in order to make a return. The management in place at that time failed to generate new income streams and lived off the diminishing returns of the old AIDC income and that income was based on a continuously falling asset base. In my view, this amounted to a straight rip-off of the taxpayer and amounted to conduct like kids in a candy shop. It is against that background-of executives having negotiated uncommercial retention packages for themselves and highly profitable golden handshakes-that I think we have to ask a number of questions now surrounding the sale to ensure that the public interest will be protected. I for one am interested in knowing what assets AIDC has sold since the 1996 election and for what value; how do those sales prices compare with an independent assessment of the market value of those assets which have been sold; have there been independent assessments of market value; and was there a commercial reason for the asset to be sold when it was? It is certainly my understanding that bonuses being paid to AIDC executives related to asset sales. So AIDC had a motivation to sell assets, particularly prior to 30 June, irrespective of whether it was getting full value for money. I think we need to understand whether there have been independent assessments of those asset sales. We also need to understand what kinds of golden handshakes or contracts for senior management are now in place. Would it be the case that we may get a lower price for the sale of AIDC due to lucrative golden handshakes and contracts for senior management in the event that the new owner of AIDC decides to get rid of the senior managers? Based on the retention payments that occurred in the past, it is quite possible that we would have arrangements in place whereby management gets golden handshakes of such a size that they would tend to diminish the price for AIDC. In my view these are important questions, and I would like to hear responses from the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) before this debate is concluded. AIDC currently employs 200 people. While, as I have indicated, Labor does not want to see generous golden handshakes go to AIDC senior management, we are concerned that ordinary workers in the organisation are not disadvantaged by the sale. It is my understanding that concerns were expressed about this during the Senate committee hearings on Monday. I am pleased, as other opposition members would be, that assurances have now been given that the existing terms and conditions of employment for these workers will be maintained. AIDC is one of two Australian controlled independent investment houses. It is likely that through this sale it will be purchased by overseas interests. There are no sions in the bill to deal with foreign ownership. Against this background, Labor notes the assurances of Senator Kemp that, if the buyer is overseas owned, AIDe's 48.5 per cent holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation could be excluded from the sale. We believe that better assurances should be given, and the amendment we will move to this bill goes to this point. We will move that the ASC be removed from AIDC Ltd and be located within the AIDC corporation, which is to stay in place to manage the borrowings and loan portfolio and to manage such national interest assets as the Commonwealth's Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding. That would ensure that the Australian Submarine Corporation does not become foreign controlled. I want to express some concern about the sale of the AIDe. While the points for the sale are understood by the opposition and we are not opposing the sale, if there is to replace the AIDC, that does form part of a pattern of conduct by this government which is detrimental to regional Australia. We have seen $150 million cut from regional infrastructure projects. That was justified by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, on the grounds that there was no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development. In other words, he was saying, 'We are washing our hands of involvement in regional development.', We have also seen a budget which impacted massively on regional Australia. So people who relied on regional roads and infrastructure, people who relied on higher education-, because the cuts fell disproportionately on regional campuses-and people who relied on assistance to the unemployed have all been massively disadvantaged. ABC funding was cut. There were massive attacks on regional welfare, with the closure of regional CES, tax and Medicare offices. Against that background, it is a matter of concern that the government looks to have some appropriate replacement for AIDC to continue investment special provi- in regional Australia. I do want to repeat the concerns I expressed earlier in my speech, and I want to raise those questions about the kinds of golden handshakes which are involved for AIDC management and the kinds of asset sales that have been engaged in in recent times. What we have had is a situation where AIDC management knew it was the government's intention to sell AIDC-so they knew they were going-and, therefore, there was no incentive for them to behave in a way which was in the best interests of AIDC or the best interests of the taxpayer. It really was a situation which encouraged kids in the candy store behaviour. I am anxious to hear from the government the full details of arrangements concerning golden handshakes and asset sales which have been conducted during the past 12 months.",31
20,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES,The AIDC Sale Bill is a bill to privatise a government entity. I think I should at least be no effort consistent and express my concernMr Ronaldson-Pre-election or postelection?,33
21,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES,"No. The honourable member for Ballarat could find plenty of examples of consistency on this matter of privatisation even before the election. If he is really all that interested in it, I refer him to my speech on the sale of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in October 1993. I would like briefly to address that aspect. I am quite happy to stand here in support of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and indicate that we understand the reasons behind the government's decision to proceed with the sale, but we do not understand the total reasons as they were explained in the second reading speech. The reliance in the second reading speech on the support this sale has from the National Commission of Audit is one aspect that would cause me great concern. The nature of that comment by the National Commission of Audit is to indicate that perhaps a government has no business in the types of activities that the AIDC involves itself in. I think there can be, in various ways, a case put for government involvement in a whole range of activities and that we should not shy away from that. They should be considered just as much as any of the alternatives that government has before it. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you would understand the historical links and involvement of government activity in public enterprises, such as railways and other public utilities. As was said earlier in this debate, government ownership and involvement in activities like that has been very important, especially to the regions of Australia. When we have gone through the sales we have had over the past few years, one of the arguments that has always been put is that historical basis for government ownership of such organisations as the Commonwealth Bank or Qantas is no longer applicablethings have changed, and the nature of those organisations has changed. To a certain extent in the case of the AIDC, that is the basis for the reasoning on the move towards the total sale. In the case of AIDC, it has acknowledged that it has moved away from its original charter. We should also look at that. In we should be looking at the reasons why AIDC was created some 20 to 30 years ago and whether those reasons still should look at vehicles like the AIDC as being important alternatives for involvement of government in ensuring that there is adequate fund provision for a whole host of projects, most particularly, as the shadow minister has said, infrastructure development. An article in this morning's Melbourne Age discusses the superannuation tax-the soup called superannuation surcharge-and its unintended effect on the ability for funds managers to invest in major infrastructure regard. projects. It indicates that the funds managers have some concern that their ability to provide funding will even further dry up, and can take that in the context of the likelihood of the infrastructure bonds being scrapped. What needs to be asked is: how are we going to find these alternative sources of funding ensure that major projects, the likes of which the AIDC has been involved in, and which have been outlined in this debate, will continue? As I have said, I do not believe that the process of privatisation itself will make an organisation any more efficient. I do not believe that it is somehow inherent in the nature of the private sector to always do things more efficiently and effectively. I believe that there is always a role for government ownership as a form of government intervention in the economy, whether it be to achieve important social objectives that the private sector will not deliver on or because of the benefit in terms of the revenue that flows to government. Telstra is an example that fulfils both of these categories. I note in the this context that the AIDC has provided more than $130 million in dividend payments since 1983. Having said that about my concerns of public ownership vis-a-vis private ownership, some of the criticisms that have been made about the AIDC in government ownership likewise indicate that, on occasions, we have to be vigilant that organisations in government ownership do the right thing as well. The issue that has been raised most notably 1997 by the honourable member for North Sydney the (Mr Hockey) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) is the matter of obtain. We executive salaries. I would have to say, having listened to the honourable member for North Sydney in his considered consideration of those matters, that the real danger is that this is symptomatic not just of behaviour within the AIDC as an organisation but of executive salaries across the board. This is an issue that I have taken on other occasions. I do not believe that we can finger one organisation for what appears to be exorbitant behaviour in that The whole matter of executive salaries is a we matter that government, on behalf of the people of Australia, should be looking into. It is something we should be doing all we can to put a cap on. If it is good enough for to ordinary workers to have to put in work value cases to justify pay increases and to justify their level of remuneration, there should likewise be mechanisms that ensure executive salaries have the same constraints. It is expected that government business enterprises perform to the same standards that are required in the private sector. As I have just suggested, it does not mean that they have to perform to the same low standards on some important matters. The selling of an enterprise in itself will not make the enterprise any more effective in doing what it does. There is no reason why these objectives are not able to be achieved in full public ownership. The measures required to bring a government business enterprise to what is considered to be a more competitive standard can be just as easily implemented with the organisation remaining in full public ownership. A public enterprise is a way for governments to promote certain social objectives and act as models for private sector businesses in areas such as progressive industrial relations or providing goods or services to disadvantaged customers. Privatisation always fails to take into account the fact that government business enterprises are often created to fill a need that was not being met by the private sector. This was the case with the former government's business enterprises like the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, which was designed to protect Australia's national interests by ensuring that Australia did not have to rely on other countries for sera and vaccines. This was the case when the Commonwealth moved into the area of telecommunications to ensure that all Australians had equal access to communications. I note that this is something which can no longer be guaranteed now that Te1stra is to be partially privatised. In the context of a debate about public ownership, I also have urged governments of, now, both persuasions to look at areas that they should pick up on. At the time when they are divesting themselves of ownership in certain areas, there is likewise a need to consider the important areas in the 1990s, going into the next century, where government can have a role. Recently in a discussion about the cable roll-outs of both Optus and Telstra, I, in not just a flippant way, said that perhaps what we needed to do was nationalise the cables. If the cables were in direct government control, with access to the cables then being on-sold to the telecommunication companies, we would have had greater control originally and could have greater control about the way in which they fulfil community expectations, the way in which it is an environmentally sensitive issue, the way in which they fulfil the necessary expectations about their capacity and the way in which they would be able to bring things into households. The banking sector did not adequately provide the necessary capital to finance industries. This was the rationale behind the establishment of the Australian Industry Development Corporation back in 1970. It was envisaged that, in a case where development would not proceed, or would only proceed with ownership and control going to foreign investors, the AIDC could step in. The AIDC has a 48.5 per cent holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. The rationale behind this investment was the same-there needed to be Australian investment in an undertaking of such national significance. The issue of possible foreign ownership of such a vital holding as a result of AIDC's privatisation is of concern. As a consequence of this legislation, the AIDC could end up being controlled by foreign investors. While the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) has given undertakings that the Australian Submarine Corporation holding could be removed from the sale should this prove to be the case, the opposition would like to see that stated more clearly in the legislation. Therefore, the opposition will move an amendment, in the consideration in detail stage of the debate, which would ensure that the Australian Submarine Corporation holding will be removed from the AIDC and that it will not end up in foreign hands. This is a clear example of my concern. Whilst the market forces apply in this-and market forces are all important-they do not necessarily act in the national interest. Market forces actually act in the interests of the market. Given that there has been a globalisation of our economy and an integration into the international economy, we cannot be sure that, without proper instruments of intervention by government, market forces will prevail in the national interest. When considering the privatisation of the AIDC, the original objectives of the organisation should be re-examined. The AIDC was established in 1970, as I said, to promote the development of Australian industry and Australian participation in it. There is agreement from both sides of this place that the AIDC has shifted away significantly from the original function that it performed. While the AIDC has progressively moved away from this over time to a more fee based merchant banking institution, the government needs to look at alternative methods of assistance. The movement away from its original role has been further exemplified in an article in today's Financial Review headed 'AIDC enters into vendor finance', which the member for Hotham has referred to. In privati sing the Australian opment Corporation, the government should not think this action absolves them of responsibility for assisting industry to access capital. This is because the problems facing many Australian companies in gaining access to capital still remain, and, as I have suggested, perhaps are getting much worse. The result of this is that many projects get under way only because of foreign investment, if at all. Given the government's current attempts to remove itself from every aspect of industry policy, I do not hold out much hope of the government recognising this. Because the AIDC has moved away from its original objectives, it is now appropriate for the government to examine the creation of an organisation or an instrument that is more in keeping with the AIDC's original function or look at other measures designed to assist business in gaining access to capital. There is certainly a need for an organisation which has as its function the provision of finance for promoting and developing Australian industry. When one looks at some of the infrastructure projects that the AIDC has been involved in, such as the two water treatment plants in New South Wales, one sees that in many cases they are projects of national significance. The government must ensure that a mechanism exists which allows such vitally important projects to be funded, and invested in, when they otherwise might not. One of the functions that the AIDC has under section 8A allowed the minister to provide the funds for investment in special projects deemed to be in the national interest. The sale of the AIDC will lose a vehicle that the minister had at hand to ensure that that could be so. It definitely would be in the national interest to have this function transferred to another body or taken up directly by the government itself. As I said at the outset, I support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham on the basis that it reaffirms the commitment of this House to the principles underpinning AIDC's creation and, further, condemns the government for not putting in place a structure which will address the failure of the capital markets to provide the sort of funding that the AIDC historically Industry Devel- had provided. It is now time that the government, through whichever minister wishes to take the reinsperhaps members in this debate are fast losing faith in the industry minister to provide adequate leadership--ensures that Australian industries continue to be able to not only maintain their market shares internationally but also grow, and ensures that we will not see further losses of Australian jobs offshore in important industrial sectors like pharmaceuticals and TCF. For instance, I was told, from a briefing given to the opposition yesterday, that if the TCF tariffs are to go to zero levels early in the next century it would lead to a loss of 700 jobs in one of the municipalities in my electorate. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in my electorate we cannot afford to lose one job. There are thousands of people who are ready, willing and able to take up worthwhile employment. The government has to recognise that there are many regions, such as the electorate that I represent, that need the assistance and intervention from government to ensure that Australian industry prospers.",33
22,Mr FAHEY,COMMITTEES,"I have listened to the debate today and appreciate that there is a universal view that the subject of the AIDC Sale Bill, AIDC Ltd, is pursuing business activities which make it no longer appropriate to be maintained by government ownership. Whatever the benefit of this particular organisation when it was established-a number of speakers in the course of this debate have referred to various projects that were of benefit to the community generally in an infrastructure sense-it has long past being useful. It has lost its way somewhat simply because of the fact that there has been a deregulation of banking and there are other facilities available for the type of infrastructure that AIDC once supported. The judgment that this business is not appropriate for government is one that has been held by both sides of the House-by the current government and by is predecessorsfor a number of years. Sale measures had been initiated previously, but had not met with much success. The lessons from those previous actions have been learned and led to the legislation currently before the House which will enable this government to bring the sale of AIDC Ltd and its associated business activities to a successful conclusion. The government will be opposing the opposition's amendments relating to the Australian Submarine Corporation holding. I made it clear during the second reading speech that the ASC holding would be quarantined from the sale. Therefore, this amendment is unnecessary. This legislation was necessary because the existing legislative framework governing the operations of the Australian Industry Development Corporation did not provide the flexibility that is necessary to conclude a sale on satisfactory terms and conditions. In addition, despite the successful takeover proposal conducted by the corporation for the shares it did not own in AIDC Ltd, minority shareholdings in the company continued to exist for technical reasons. With the passage of this bill, it will be possible to deal with those holdings in an expeditious manner without in any way compromising the fair and equitable treatment of those shareholders. The bill clearly makes provision to protect the interests of those parties, consistent with the obligations set out in the constitution for the compulsory acquisition of property. Another fundamental issue dealt with by the bill is that it provides the appropriate legal environment for the substantial financial interests of the Commonwealth to be managed both during and after the sale process. A significant characteristic of the business activities of AIDC Ltd has been the added protection afforded its borrowings through the use of the Commonwealth guarantee. With the sale of the company, or its assets, the Commonwealth will continue to stand behind the guarantees that it has already provided, but in so doing it is necessary to ensure that the Australian Industry Development Corporation is provided with the appropriate legislative base to continue that task. The bill provides that base. Concern has been expressed by the board of AIDC Ltd in relation to the power provided by this bill for the minister to require the provision of information to assist in the sale process. The concern was expressed on the basis that that may impact on the company's client relationship. I can assure the House that this power will not be used lightly by the government. The Commonwealth will be mindful of the need to protect commercially sensitive material and will ensure that commercial interests are not prejudiced during the sale process. The bill makes provision for the protection of information obtained under this arrangement. However, it is also important to ensure that the Commonwealth's actions, as the beneficial owner of AIDC Ltd, are not unnecessarily constrained and ensure that an effective power of veto is not provided to third party interests. In progressing this asset sale, in common with other recent asset sales, it is important for the Commonwealth to protect its financial interest and ensure that it receives full value from the sale. For this reason, the bill makes the necessary provisions to protect the sale from the imposition of stamp duty and cancels any residual franking credits that may exist in the company at the time of the sale. The approach to these provisions is consistent with provisions in other sale legislation which this House has previously passed. Similarly-and I note a number of speakers on the other side commented on this--employee interests have been protected by the provisions relating to long service leave and occupational health and safety. In other words, all the benefits that have currently accrued to the employees of AIDC Ltd will be protected through this legislation and will be passed on in appropriate circumstances to those employees. With a maturing financial and merchant banking industry in Australia, it is important that the government progress this sale and thereby remove itself from this area of business activity. I commend the bill to the House. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Crean's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [11.53 a.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr J.N.

Consideration in Detail Schedule 1, items 1 to 38-by leave-taken together and agreed to. Schedule 1, item 39.",38
24,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 1 to 3: (1) Schedule I, page 15 (after line 10), after the heading of Division 3, insert: 33HA Minister for Finance to direct AIDe Ltd to transfer asset (1) The Minister for Finance shall, by written notice given to AIDC Ltd, direct that body to transfer all of its holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation to the Corporation. (2) The direction may impose on AIDC Ltd requirements that are ancillary or to the transfer, including (but not limited to) any of the following requirements: (a) a requirement that the transfer must be completed no later than 30 June 1997; (b) a requirement that the transfer must be undertaken in a specified manner; (3) AIDC Ltd must comply with the direction. (4) To avoid doubt, nothing in this Act or in any other Act authorises the Minister to transfer from the Corporation its holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. (2) Schedule I, page 15 (line 13), omit ""The Minister for Finance"", substitute ""Subject to section 33HA, the Minister for Finance"". (3) Schedule I, page 16 (line 4), omit ""The Minister for Finance"", substitute ""Subject to section 33HA, the Minister for Finance"". We foreshadowed these amendments in the second reading debate because of our specific concern about what happens to the Australian Submarine Corporation shares. We believe that the Submarine Corporation and the arrangements that the Labor government developed in relation to it-its strategic partnership with Kockums, its involvement and establishment in Adelaide and the huge growth in industry development that occurred consequent upon that-are a shining example of what can sensibly be done if the leverage of government policy together with the financing that backed it from the AIDC can be brought together. We believe there is still some potential future to build off the success of the Submarine Corporation. It is for that reason that we would obviously be reluctant to see the Submarine Corporation sold off as part of the arrangement that will sell off AIDC, the share package that the AIDC holds in the Submarine Corporation. That being said, we note that it is the intention of the government, in abolishing AIDC Ltd by the legislation, to still keep the corporation within AIDC ostensibly to manage the loans. We are saying that, in addition to the management of the loans, the corporation should hold the Submarine Corporation shares. We think it is important not just for the strategic national interest that Australia incident control its own defence capability but that there be future opportunities for the development of a defence based industry in this country, and the ability to develop that clearly is going to be significantly limited if the government still is not in the game. Our approach is to keep the government in the game, not by taking the shares back but by recognising where they are held and by parking the management of those within the AIDe. It also would require there to be some bipartisan discussion as to what the government's future intentions may be in relation to the shareholding of Submarine Corporation. We believe we can inject some sensible input and hope that the government might be prepared to embrace us in that approach in trying to develop a strengthened industry off our defence capability, off our shipbuilding industry, off our heavy engineering capacity, but really moving more into the strategic development, the high-tech industries, associated with defence and sense tracking, and recognising the significance that that has, quite frankly, for the manufacturing industry. When you think of the manufacturing industry generally, it is the software packages and the engineering dimensions that are important. It is not just a question of the pLysical infrastructure; it is the processes by which that technology is run. It is the systems running; it is the information technology. If Australia is to continue its growth in manufacturing exports, and that growth has already been significant, we need to use strategic inputs and strategic placements and the government needs to be in there as a partner with industry in securing a future direction for this nation. We therefore think that this amendment ought to be supported by the government. It is still saying that it can look to deal with it as it would like but that there would be a requirement to have wider discussions as to what its intentions might be. We accept the assurance of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) that it is not intended to sell the Submarine Corporation into foreign interests, but we are seeking to secure the base in this country for the Submarine Corporation and that which flows from it.",39
25,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PAIRS,"---I also support these amendments to the AIDC Sale Bill. In my speech in the second reading debate I made a couple of comments about what had happened in terms of answers to questions in the Senate. In the answers I quoted from the Senate committee hearing, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), who was representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), made it perfectly clear after questions from Senator Ray that it was not the intention of the government to sell the Australian Submarine Corporation to foreign interests. But, after a series of questions, it came out that the government and the minister have not put forward any proposal as to how that is to be avoided when the AIDC is sold. We do not know what is going to happen. I hope the minister is going to tell us. What is actually going to happen to the Australian Submarine Corporation? How is the minister going to ensure that that does not happen in the general context of the sale of AIDC Ltd? Interestingly, when asked what the options are, the top official said the government had made no determination. Even though the government have said on the one hand that they want to retain the 100 per cent-and they have brought the bill forward, they are saying they are selling the AIDC Ltd-they have not made a determination on this key aspect of the future of the Australian Submarine Corporation. Given that situation, when asked, the official said, 'Well, one option is to actually do what this amendment proposes', which is to hold the shares in the AIDe. So that is one option, and this is an option which we are urging in terms of these amendments. So we would urge the government to accept this amendment. They have been properly structured and their implications have been looked at. We urge the government to accept these amendments, to accept this approach, and let us give at least some security to the Australian Submarine Corporatioll in terms of its Australian ownership. As the shadow minister said, as we move into further discussions on the future of Defence Industries, we can then have that body in that place at least for the time being until we determine some further important issues in relation to Defence Industries. I also think that we should have some kind of broad discussion in this parliament on the future of Defence Industries and what is to happen after the AIDC is sold. We have supported the AIDC Ltd sale, but we are saying to the minister, 'Look after the Australian Submarine Corporation. Let us clearly state what the intention of the government is, and let us adopt these amendments.'",40
26,Mr BEVIS,PAIRS,"The Australian Submarine Corporation is particularly important to the Australian government and to the Australian people-both because of its importance to Australian defence and because of its importance to Australian industry. The government's significant holding in the Submarine Corporation via the AIDC is not something that should be allowed to go through with the passage of this bill without clear views being expressed by the parliament on that important matter. It is appropriate that the parliament place some restrictions upon the sale of the AIDC to ensure that the Submarine Corporation remains for the time being with a government stakeholding in it. The relevant amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), clearly provides a mechanism through which that can occur to ensure that the Submarine Corporation's government shareholding is kept in the AIDC. That opens up a number of opportunities further down the track as part of the development of Australian defence industry policy, and indeed, more broadly, industry policy for other sectors, because defence industry so often is at the cutting edge of technology developments and where defence industry goes so too does the broader industry sector. Can I quickly say a couple of words about the Submarine Corporation and its importance to defence. The Submarine Corporation has now managed to construct three submarines as part of an order of six, which are without doubt amongst the best in the world and regarded by many as being the most significant non-nuclear submarines anywhere in the world. That is a capability that is important to Australia's defence. It is a capability that opposition take very seriously. Indeed, it is a capability that was established during the period in which Labor was in office, when Kim Beazley and later Robert Ray as ministers for defence strongly supported the acquisition of those submarines and supported the Australian government's involvement in that project to ensure that it came to fruition and to ensure that there was a substantial Ian participation in the management of the organisation. I am not sure that that is a commitment that is shared by both sides of the parliament, and I would invite the minister at the table, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), to take the opportunity in this debate to make that clear. It is worth noting that in terms of the commitment on this side of the parliament to the Submarine Corporation and the defence importance of that program, we have made it plain that were we in government we would commit to the additional two submarines, 7 and 8. I invite the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), who is in the chamber, to address that issue to see whether or not the government is serious about maintaining a significant defence capability in submarine development, maintenance and construction. It is important to the Labor Party. It was important to us in government and it remains important to us in opposition. In relation to the defence industry implications of the Submarine Corporation, it is not just that the Submarine Corporation has produced an absolute world leader in submarine warfare; it is the long line of domestic companies who supply to the Submarine Corporation who have also benefited. The downstream suppliers to the Submarine Corporation number in their thousands. Many of those are local firms who have been pulled along by the submarine program into hightech areas and, as a result of that, are now competing successfully in world markets for the various components provision. That is an important consideration in the long-term sustainability, not just of the Collins class submarine but in terms of the development of new classes of warships and other platforms. That is a capability we the should not see let go. It is important that in dealing with the sale of the AIDC the parliament places these strictures on the sale. The parliament should ensure through this particular amendment that the shareholding in the Submarine Corporation remains for the time being with the government, that it is parked in the AIDC. It is a very sensible and worthwhile amendment, and I do hope the governAustral- ment accepts it.",40
27,Mr FAHEY,PAIRS,"I have noted the contributions that have been made in respect of these amendments by the members opposite. As I indicated in the second reading debate, the government does not propose to sell the Australian Submarine Corporation with the AIDC Ltd. Therefore, these amendments are unnecessary. What the opposition seeks to do through these amendments, as has been made very clear by the members opposite, is to place as many restrictions as is possible on what future flexibility there may be for government in dealing with a 48.5 per cent shareholding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. And that is the reality of it-there is a 48.5 per cent shareholding by AIDC in the Australian Submarine Corporation. In that we have indicated there is no intention to dispose of that shareholding with the sale of AIDC Ltd, the government reserves its flexibility and the legislation provides for where it puts that shareholding in the foreseeable future. By this amendment it is suggested that it should be put in the corporation. The Labor Party is saying that the government must place this shareholding in AIDC Ltd. Well, the government could place that shareholding in the defence portfolio, and I wonder what the objections to that might be from the members opposite. It could place it in the industry portfolio because, from the contributions of the members opposite, the debate centres around the industry that is associated with the Australian Submarine Corporation. It could place the ASC in Australian company-a company approved by the Department of Defence and approved by Kockums who has a shareholding in the matter Australian Submarine Corporation as well. it could place the ASC in that most approprihere, ate department for protecting the assets government-the Department of Finance. It could be placed in any of those portfolios to do. the point where the shareholding continues in government ownership. But what we really have to look at here is not restricting it. We have to look at the that this Submarine Corporation is involved in the construction of submarines. In July last year, the first Collins class submarine launched. There are five more that are being constructed under contract over the next several years, and that is not going to change. That is going to be there for the defence capability of Australia. As each one comes off, gets into the water and becomes operdone ational, that enhances the defence capability er. of Australia. That is not at risk in terms of the shareholding by AIDC Ltd in the Australian Submarine Corporation. I have indicated it is not intended to sell that shareholding. I have indicated that the government-clearly with the support of the Department of Defence and the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan)-will make sure that what happens to that shareholding is in the best interests of Australia and in the best interests of the defence forces. That advice will be forthcoming as and when there is a need to do something further with it. The shareholding will not be sold. That undertaken is given. Legislation is not required. Therefore, the government opposes this amendment.",41
28,Mr MCLACHLAN,PAIRS,"We are dealing with amendments Nos 1 to 3 which the opposition has moved. I just simply agree with the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) that they are totally unnecessary. We will deal with amendment No.4 in a minute. But I would like to comment on one or two things that have been raised. The first thing was that the shadow minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), an said that there needed to be a bipartisan ""discussion. I am not sure there was too much of a bipartisan discussion when this whole arose back in the 1980s. It occurs to Or me that, when you count the numbers around the government ought to be running of these things and ought to be making the decisions. That is what the government will Let me also respond to the assertion that, somehow or other, this government will leave the Australian Submarine Corporation open to foreign takeovers. Well, it won't. But, secondfact ly, it is worthwhile remembering that the shareholder agreement and the articles of of association effectively give protection to was either the AIDC shareholding in ASC or Kockums, the Swedes. The agreement and the articles of association give them pre-emptive rights to make sure that nobody comes in as a shareholder they do not approve of. We have no problem with the Swedes; they have a very good job; but they are a foreignMr Crean-They were strategically brought in by us.",42
29,Mr MCLACHLAN,PAIRS,"Indeed, and they have done a good job. What was also raised was that the government and the country ought to be trying to expand the capabilities in regard to the manufacturing and maintenance of shipbuilding facilities. I could not agree more. There is a rationalisation of those sorts of industries going on all round the world, and you would not expect that this country should or could escape it. The shadow minister for defence, the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), always raises this subject so I may as well respondsubmarine seven and eight. Put your hand up for seven, eight, nine, ten, 11 and 12. The fact is that you did not have the courage to make that decision before the last election but then suddenly with the luxury of opposition, almost in the first few weeks, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) wants to build seven or eight. Let me tell you that a lot of people on my side of the parliament would love to build seven, eight, nine, ten and so on-the problem is getting the priorities right and, secondly, making sure that the submarines we have got are working well. This flip-flop from when you are in government not making a decision to when you are out of government making a decision comes on daily. It is just like the flip-flop you have done on the Hindmarsh Island bridge, I notice, which is most fascinating. As the article in the Sunday Mail said a fortnight agoMr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance.",43
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Andrew)The member for Hotham did not have the call was the point I was going to make. It was fair of him to observe that the minister had in fact moved somewhat away from submarines. I call the minister back to submarines.,43
31,Mr MCLACHLAN,PAIRS,I was actually discussing changes of policy from being able to change policy when in government and not doing so to having the luxury of wanting - o make an instant change when you· are 1TI opposition. Mr Bevis-I think he just said no to submarines seven and eight.,43
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I appreciate that you want to draw an analogy between islands and submarines.,43
33,Mr MCLACHLAN,PAIRS,"The fact of the matter is that, on the subject of submarines seven and eight, I have not said yes or no. I have said many times, as you know only too well, that the issue will not come up until the end of the year.",43
34,Mr BEVIS,PAIRS,"I will be very brief. There are a couple of things I want to add to my earlier comments. We have been told by both the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) and the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) that it is not their intention to sell the AIDC holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. They justify their opposition to our amendment by saying it is unnecessary. They haven't actually said there is anything wrong with it. They haven't disputed the course of action we propose. What they say to us is, 'Trust me, because we agree with you. It is a good idea. Trust me. But we don't want it in the legislation.' I am not sure whether that is a core promise, like a few other promises we came across prior to the last election. It may have gre-ter substance because it is here on the transcnpt, although that would not make it ironclad either. The simple fact is that the 'trust me' line doesn't cut a great deal of ice. There is a lot hanging on what happens to the Submarine Corporation. There is a lot hanging on what happens to the government's holding in the Submarine Corporation. It should not be allowed to drift through the parliament without the parliament expressing a clear view on it. It is important for defence, it is important for defence industry, a-d it - s important for industry development 1TI thIS country. The amendment is a good one. It takes account of the long-term interests of those things and it should be supported.  to respond to a point made by the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey): that is, there would be nothing wrong in warehousing the shareholding in the Department of Defence. I invite the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) to comment about the conflict in being a shareholder of the company as well as its sole client at this stage. It does present some severe difficulties. I am just appalled that that would be one of the options that are ruled in at this stage and advocated by the Minister for Defence as an acceptable option.

NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Aged Care",44
36,Mr MOSSFIELD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in this grievance debate to express my concerns about the needs of older people in our community with disabilities and their older carers. My remarks will be based on a study carried out on behalf of the Mullauna Retirement Village at Blacktown run by the Uniting Church. I propose to quote at length from this report as the findings must surely be mirrored across Australia. Mullauna is seeking to extend its services to older people with disabilities and older people caring for people with disabilities both in the provision of accommodation and in home support. The Mullauna group believe they should be extending their services based on community needs in the following areas: residential and in-home; as part of a continuum of care; with consideration for affordability; with adequately skilled respite carers; with consideration for the needs of older non-English speaking people and Aboriginal people; in more innovative forms, for example, accommodation for both carers and the person receiving care; and to develop its expertise to cater for older people with sengrievance sory disabilities and dementia. The results of the report I am using today would surely apply equally to many other in parts of Australia. The Blacktown local intengovernment area could be described as a We financially constrained area based on the of the relatively high proportion of to people living in public housing. This group represents 14.9 per cent of the Blacktown not population, which is well above the state average of 5.6 per cent. There is also a relatively high proportion of older people on right very low income support. This low income support would be an impeding factor in as obtaining assistance from community and the privately based services for domestic and personal care support. The report says: Blacktown has a relatively high proportion of residents (33.6%), 65 years and over, who were born in a non-English speaking country (NESC). Blacktown is the 4th highest LOA in the state regarding residents, 65 years and over from NES countries. The Western Sydney Area Health Service, in a study of older people in western Sydney from NES countries, stated that it is estimated that in five years time, 25% of all older people in Australia will be from a NESC. In Blacktown there are seven retirement villages comprising self-care and hostel units. There are 10 nursing homes. In total there are 17 establishments which have either self-care, hostel or nursing home places or a combination of these forms of accommodation. The Department of Community Services manages four group homes for people with intellectual disabilities and funds a further 13 homes managed by community or church organisations. This group home accommodation mainly caters for a younger population. In total there are fewer than 10 people over 60 in these homes. A coordinator of a number of these group homes stated that these older residents often suffer from early forms of dementia. As a result they are not able to manage in the group homes because of staffing numbers. The report went on to say: The extent of community outreach services by retirement villages in Blacktown was not investigated, except to note that Mullauna manages 30 community aged care packages. It is known that some of the community and church managed group homes provide support to assist people with intellectual ability living alone or with carers in the Blacktown area. Accommodation is sought in mainstream hostels and nursing homes. Service providers say that it is very difficult to find such hostels or nursing home placements. They are often forced to seek placements out of Blacktown. There is a strong demand for respite accommodation. The resultant waiting list for planned respite means that there is little opportunity for emergency residential care. Also, people with disabilities often have complex care needs that cannot be met in available respite facilities, thereby increasing the concerns of carers of these people. This very important report I am quoting from went on to say: While nursing homes and hostels may be inappropriate forms of accommodation for people under 65 years with disabilities, they have· often been the only forms of respite for carers of people with disabilities. Carers support groups report that in recent times even these 'inappropriate' forms of respite are becoming less available, even though there have not been any changes to legislation or departmental policy in this regard. This report indicates that there is still a significant number of older people with disabilities or handicaps in Blacktown who are managing to assist each other or are being assisted by some family member without any outside help. The older Aboriginal people's needs in this area have never been addressed; they are unique because the elders are much revered. Supply the hostel with the appropriate skilled staff and the families will do the rest. They also have a significantly shorter life span than other groups. Non-English speaking older persons have special needs with dementia in any form that sets in. The first, of course, is language. Therefore the need for hostel and nursing home care in their mother tongue is absolutely essential. Stroke victims are also there in very high proportions, another horror for the victim and the carers. Stroke debilitates different sections of the brain. Persons who lose the power of dis- speech can be locked into a world we dare not envisage. Then others lose use of limbs and cannot feed themselves or control their bodily functions. Carers are usually the partner until either the carer bums out ot ceases physically to be able to perform the needs of the victim. The conclusion in the report is that there is considerable scope to extend services to support older people with disabilities, especially older carers. The report says: The potential for expansion of residential services in Blacktown is virtually non-existent. It seems very unlikely that the Commonwealth government (which administers and funds hostel, nursing homes and community aged care package programs) will extend these forms of care in Blacktown. In the report, service providers pinpoint the greatest area of un met service needs for older people with disabilities and older carers as: respite care, both regular and emergency, both in residential care and at home; community transport, more extensive and more appropriate; assistance to overcome housebound isolation for both those with disabilities and carers. This isolation was also linked to associated needs of more information on available services and the provision of training for carers; and more networking of services to promote complementarity and flexibility of service provision. Finally, the Mullauna report indicates that more than 50 per cent of the older population of Blacktown with its multicultural character has some disability. Service providers in Blacktown indicate that there are some urgent unmet needs for older people with disabilities and older carers in the area. By far the greatest need was for more respite services both in residential care and inhome respite. The demand for respite is constantly increasing, leading to long waiting lists and diminishing opportunities for emergency respite. Further needs include more flexible and more extensive community transport, the alleviation of housebound social isolation and the development of better networking of residential and community based services. I hope that this report on the needs of older people with disabilities and older carers will lead to improved services for those most deserving people, and I compliment the Mullauna village on their important work. I would be happy to table the report for the information of all honourable members. I will conclude by referring to a statement by Ellen Long, who is the secretary of the National Seniors Association at Blacktownthis being Seniors Week in New South Wales-and let her have the last say on this issue. I have asked Ellen Long to make some submission to me relating to this particular matter, and I will read her short comments: Group homes in Blacktown LGA-there are many. Most of these homes have intellectually impaired persons, some have one or several disabilities. Most of these houses have three to five residents, one only has ten. The problems applying to these are many and complex .,. Aging process in our intellectually impaired persons is an enormous . problem.",44

40,Mr MOSSFIELD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It continues: How can we place into nursing homes persons with such multiple disabilities, they require high level and specific care. Often they are aggressive and make a lot of noise. Their needs must be met in a caring sensible manner that is cost effective.",46
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The member for Greenway did indicate during his remarks that he was wanting to table a document. I had the impression that it may not have been seen by the minister at the table.,46
42,Mr MOSSFIELD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,It has not been seen at this stage.,46
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I suggest that at some opportune time the member make the document available to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) to see whether she can then grant leave for it to be tabled. Child Abuse and Neglect,46
44,Mr HOCKEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in this grievance debate today to speak to the House about one of the most tragic and distressing problems facing our community; that is, the abuse and neglect of children. We are all aware of the extensive media coverage recently of the sexual abuse of children by paedophiles. This is obviously a serious problem in our society. However, today I want to speak about the abuse and neglect of children by their families, because the most common child abuse offenders-both sexual and nonsexual-are family members. Indeed, a national study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that natural parents were responsible in more than two-thirds of abuse and neglect cases. Yet the fact that abusive and neglectful behaviour towards children most often occurs at the hands of family members, usually in the home, by no means makes it a private matter. Rather, the abuse and neglect of our children is very much a public issue--one that has tremendous social and economic consequences for our society. The magnitude of this problem is impossible to illustrate with hard statistics; thus real incidence of child abuse and neglect is unknown. However, in 1995, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that, based on substantiated cases, the annual rate of child abuse in Australia is 5.7 per 1,000 children. The national committee on violence has reported that the age group at greatest risk of violent death in Australia is infants up to 12 months of age. In addition, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare study showed that, based on substantiated cases, the age group with the greatest incidence of abuse and neglect were 13and 14-year olds. Furthermore, although female children represent three-quarters of substantiated sex abuse cases, both sexes are equally at risk of abuse and neglect. No-one knows for sure whether the incidence of child abuse and neglect is growing, but many law enforcement officials, social workers and members of the clergy who deal with this problem on a daily basis are of the opinion that it is. What sort of factors put a child at risk of abuse or neglect? While it is true that child abuse affects individuals representing all socio-economic levels, most research suggests that it is the stresses caused by poverty, unemployment, under-employment and social isolation. A child is also at risk if his or her parents suffered abuse or neglect as children. The abuse and neglect of our children entail tremendous social, personal and economic costs in our community. The long-term impact on abused children is grave. These children grow up to have poor self-esteem. They grow up unable to trust others. They often grow up not knowing how to deal with conflict other than through aggressive means, thus setting up a cycle of chronic abuse. Indeed, it is an unfortunate fact that in the area of child abuse violence begets violence. Although the majority of abused and neglected children do not become delinquent, criminal or violent, studies have shown that being abused or neglected as a child significantly increases that child's risk for delinquency, adult criminal behaviour and violent criminal behaviour. Research based on large surveys overseas suggests that severely abused children are two to three times more likely to the have higher rates of academic and disciplinary problems in school, physically violent behaviour at home and outside the home and, of course, substance abuse. Victims of severe child abuse are four times more likely to be arrested. The tremendous economic costs to federal, state and local governments associated with the abuse and neglect of children include costs of medical treatment, family law services, social security, education and law enforcement. Furthermore, overseas research suggests that arrest and imprisonment by law enforcement officials often does little to deter offenders, particularly amongst those groups that are already highly marginalised in our society. Given these distressing and costly consequences of child abuse, I have a major concern that the way in which we are dealing with this problem is seriously flawed. What I mean to say is that way too often we depend on social workers, police officers, lawyers, judges and health care workers to pick up the pieces after irreparable damage has been done. Surely we have an obligation to do all that we can to facilitate the prevention of and early intervention into the abuse and neglect of our children. In this regard, we could learn from some of the community service groups in Australia who are preventing child abuse and neglect by offering supportive services to at risk families. In New South Wales, the real pioneer group in this area is the Child Abuse Prevention Service, known as CAPS. CAPS commenced operating its 24-hour crisis and support line in 1973, three year before the New South Wales Department of Community Services introduced its crisis telephone service. Since that time, CAPS trained counsellors-the majority of whom work without pay-have provided this service 24 hours a day, 365 days year. Remarkably, CAPS has not been off the air, so to speak, since its inception. In addition to its hotline service, CAPS has six drop-in facilities-at Wyong, Orange, Ashfield, Liverpool, Umina and Tuggerahfor stressed parents, primarily mothers. Services provided at these facilities are aimed at the management of stress, resolving conflict in non-violent ways and promoting attitudes and behaviours which nurture and support children through, among other things, discussion groups, nutrition classes and workshops aimed at boosting self-esteem. CAPS trained counsellors also frequently make home visits to at risk families. It is not an overstatement to say that CAPS has saved the lives of countless children in New South Wales since it commenced operations in 1973. What is truly remarkable is the degree to which CAPS provides these services in spite of extremely limited funds. Other than around a $100,000 annual grant from the Commonwealth government, CAPS relies totalIy on private donations and the efforts of numerous unpaid staff. CAPS receives not one cent from the New South Wales state government. CAPS and similar community sector organisations playa crucial role in the prevention of child abuse and neglect. At this time, I want to acknowledge the contributions of the Children at Risk Committee, which has since 1980 provided a significant community education program in my electorate. We cannot, however, depend too heavily on these organisations. CAPS, the Children at Risk Committee and similar organisations are seriously underfunded by governments at local, state and federal levels. I believe we alI have a responsibility and a moral obligation to do more to prevent child abuse and neglect. As law-makers in this House, we must ensure that a deaf ear is no longer turned towards the cries and screams of Australia's generations of abused and neglected children. Apart from the existing support for child abuse services, we must be mindful that our policies should bring families together. After all, a safe, loving and stable family unit is the best environment for the nurturing of Australia's greatest and most precious asset-its children. Evergreen Airlines: Fuel Dumping",46
45,Mr ALBANESE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise today to pursue the issue of the dumping of aviation fuel over the residents of Grayndler and Lowe. It is something I raised in the House two days ago, but as yet we still have not seen a response from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) or the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) or in fact from anyone on the other side of the House. I did think that the chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum might have taken the opportunity today to raise it. The situation on 15 October 1996 where an Evergreen Airlines flight left Mascot airport at approximately 12.59 p.m. and sprayed raw avgas over the residents of Grayndler and Lowe-in fact, from the end of the runway right up to RusselI Lea, which is near Drummoyne, a distance of 10 kilometres-required, indeed demanded, an immediate response from the minister to show that the residents of the inner western suburbs of Sydney could be confident that some action would be taken to ensure that this did not happen again. I raised the issue yesterday in a meeting of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform with the head of Airservices Australia. I was assured by Airservices Australia that they will get back to me with a plan to ensure that these occurrences do not happen again. I would have also thought that we needed an urgent political response from the government to ensure that this does not happen again, because the response I received from the minister to question on notice No. 927, I think, is clearly inadequate. It is clearly inadequate to simply say: (4) Should any future incidents occur, the issue will again be raised with the operator as a matter of urgency. That someone will pick up the phone and ask the operator to explain their actions is appalling and is realIy a tickle and slap approach to a very real problem which has the potential to be a health and environmental catastrophe. So today in this House I am raising again the fact that we do not really have a response from the minister on this, and I calI upon the government to implement a program of real action. The minister's response indicated that there were three similar alIeged incidents in the previous 12 months. I read on page 3 of the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, 19 March 1997 that those incidents occurred on 30 July, 13 August and 14 January and involved Evergreen Airlines once again. It is a pity, I must say, that the minister gave a response to a question on notice of some five months standing to the Sydney Morning Herald and not to the parliament before the residents of the inner western suburbs of Sydney were given an answer as to what had occurred. There has been massive concern since I raised this issue in parliament. I spoke yesterday on radio 2BL, 2GB, Today FM and Triple M. Residents throughout Sydney were calling talkback radio yesterday, telling their stories about oil and petrol fumes being dumped on their schools, their homes, their children, their parks and their clothes and about the black filter of soot they have to wipe off their cars in the morning at places such as Sydenham and Marrickville in my electorate. Unfortunately, we still have not seen a government response. If it is the case that Evergreen Airlines committed these serious offences-four times at least over a l2-month period-then I think there is a case to say that Australia does not want them. The Australian aviation industry deserves better than to put up with shonky US airlines. US registered airlines have an appalling record on safety and on their mechanical administrative operations. It is now up to the government to say, 'Enough is enough: repeat offenders will be told they are not welcome in Australia.' For any offence, as a minimum there should be action to bring in very severe penalties which will ensure that there is action on the lackadaisical attitude of these airlines-in this case where five broken fuel valves were spraying fuel all over residents of my electorate and the electorate of Lowe. I have been very disappointed with the lack of response from the government on this issue. We see a lack of response on the fuel dumping. We see residents of my ·electorate in weatherboard houses which cannot be insulated who are still waiting for a response as to what will happen to their homeswhether they will be voluntarily acquired or what the government will do now that it has acknowledged that those houses cannot be insulated properly. In just the same way, the people in small businesses in Sydenham who have had to shut up shop and have had their livelihoods taken away are still waiting for a response from the government. Whether that response is positive or negative, it is not good encugh to leave them hanging for months and years before there is action. When it is an issue of the millionaire aviator mates of the government, such as Dick Smith, then we see action. But when it is an issue of the health and safety of residents in inner western Sydney we see nothing. We do not see trials of weatherboard housing insulation or of fuel dumping or any of these issues in the ministerial entrance such as we saw with the PAD system. I am very disappointed. I am pleased that the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) is in the chamber, because I hope that he will respond with his concern about fuel being dumped on his residents. As yet the member for Lowe has not participated in have the aviation debate, because he had a function-and I understand that-for the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the leader of the ultraconservative Lyons Forum, who is obviously a very important colleague to him. But, frankly, I would have thought last night when the member for Lowe attempted to attack me and the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) in an adjournment speech-it was a bit like being hit with a wet lettuce and we are still waiting for any issue of substance to be raised-he might have mentioned the fact that aviation fuel was dumped on his residents for about four kilometres. I would have thought there might have been one word expressing concern about that in the speech. But, if you look at the Hansard for Wednesday, 19 March 1997, you will see no mention of aviation fuel nor of Evergreen Airlines. That is the substance of this debate. This is an important debate which requires action from those on both sides of the House who are fair dinkum about representing their electorate. I hope the member for Lowe has something to say about this issue and makes representations to his government to make sure that his minister pulls his finger out and shows he is fair dinkum about preventing further incidents. What we have seen is a trigger. We have anecdotal evidence raised by residents around Sydney airport being taken up now in this House. Not only should action and penalover ties-and if needs be the banning of airlines-be brought in but there should regular reporting to the Sydney Community Forum of these incidents. Whenever this occurs, you should not have to put a question on notice and wait five months to get details about it. Nor should you have to get a response which just says, 'Three similar alleged incidents have occurred,' with details whatsoever. The residents around Sydney airport have a right to know when carcinogens are being dumped on their heads. They have a right to know, and they have right to be informed by the minister. expired) Self-Funded Retirees",48
46,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I want to draw members' of attention to a very unrepresented section the community, the self-funded retirees. This group of elderly Australians amounts to about six to seven per cent of the population. They are about a million people, so I am not talking about a small group but a significant one, living not only in my electorate but all over Australia. The growth in the number of Australians in the over-65 bracket dictates that some drastic measures have to be taken if the Commontimes wealth aged pension is to be retained as safety net for those unable to provide for their own retirement. With living conditions Australia some of the best in the world, excellent nutrition and with skilled medical facilities, elderly people's life expectancy betting longer. People in good health can function quite efficiently into and a fair proportion will live to be 90 plus. This means that, with a conventional retiring age of 65, people will live in retirement for an average of 20 years. This is a quite signifiing cant lifespan at a time when you are no longer getting regular earnings from work. From talking to groups of self-funded retirees in my electorate, it is painfully obvious that these people feel overlooked and neglected by successive governments. I submit that the time has come to take positive action to attend to these people's needs. I again draw members' attention to the fact that six per cent of the voting public can easily change a government and one million be discontented elderly Australians can be Airport ignored at our peril. Self-funded retirees are a special group. They are independent and self-sufficient. They do not participate in the welfare system, they are not a burden on the public purse and they no are a group of people who have always paid their taxes, abided by the law, conformed to government regulations and generally contributed in their working lifetime to the good of a society. In many cases, I am sure they have (Time given much of their personal time-and maybe even their money-to their local community, welfare and political organisations. I believe they should be given a fair go. Consider some other aspects of this group a million elderly Australians. In America of they are known as the 'grey lobby'-an apt and evocative title. Their investments represent a major proportion of national savings. These investments are a major source of funds for national development and, I would like to emphasise again, save the taxpayer many millions of dollars because their investors do not take DSS payments. In addition, you may find that self-funded retirees have helped their families during of major unemployment. They often a assist with education of grandchildren. They support the Treasury in the payment of their in taxes. They do much voluntary work for with senior citizens' groups and community groups, such as Meals on Wheels. Also, most is have retained private health insurance and, therefore, relieve the strain on the public their mid-80s, hospital service. I was approached recently by a branch in my electorate of the Association of Independent Retirees and had the privilege of addressa meeting at which more than 70 people attended. I have since had the opportunity of discussing with the president, Mr Bob Sedgewick, and the vice-president, Mr Bill Turner, a number of their concerns of which I seek to inform the House. The crux of the self-funded retirees' problem lies in the fact that governments in the past have not granted this group any status. There is no classification for self-funded retirees in the government's census form. Can you imagine that we actually have today, in the last stages of the 20th century, a million elderly Australians without classification, unrecognised in law and unprotected in attempting to maintain the lifestyle they have worked so hard to achieve? The first thing we must do for this group is put them on the next and subsequent census. These Australians see themselves as a great asset to our nation. They ask for recognition of the following basic objectives: tax relief for pharmaceutical expenses, inflation protection for investments, such as tax-free bonds; tax deductibility for private health insurance; simplification of criteria for the seniors card and for the card to be made national so that it is accepted by all states. I now would also draw the attention of the House to a risk factor involved for self-funded retirees. Unlike those who live off the state, who receive a regular fortnightly payment which is indexed for inflation, self-funded retirees have no mechanism open to them but to invest in income producing marketable securities. Fixed interest securities are subject to variable interest rates and ordinary shares are subject to market movements, the profitability of the company and the generosity of the directors. Self-funded retirees do not have the security of a defined income or of cost of living adjustments. In the taxation area these people are taxed as if they are still working. Only those with incomes under $20,000 have recently received a tax rebate equivalent to that available to pensioners. Furthermore, they have concerns that the current policy is gradually destroying one of our greatest resources-it is not encouraging current wage earners to save for their retirement. The follow-on from this is the attitude of the younger generation to saving. They are often heard to say, 'What's the use of saving? We will be better off on the pension.' It is painfully obvious that these one million elderly Australians need attention. They need a member of the government through whom their requests and suggestions can be funnelled. I suggest to the House that a minister be appointed to look after the interests of self-funded retirees. Obviously, with such a large group of people, their problems will spill over to many departments. Therefore, the appointment of a minister to intervene for them, to coordinate all their needs and requests is warranted. Furthermore, an appointment of a minister would be recognition of their status in the community. As I said earlier in this speech, the self-funded retirees have nowhere to go, no-one to represent their cause or interests. Mr Deputy Speaker, consider the Aboriginal people who number around 300,000 and have a full-time minister, consider the pensioners who have the Minister for Social Security; but self-funded retirees, who number one million, have no minister, no representative, no-one to talk to and nowhere to go. This group of elderly Australians have never had recognition, yet they are deserving of as much recognition as pensioners, veterans, Aboriginals, migrants, sportsmen, sportswomen, small business, defence personnel, and families, all of whom are recognised and have ministerial representation. These Australians are not a burden to the community; they are not a burden on the welfare system; they are not wealthy-and the longer they live the poorer they get. I shall end by drawing the attention of the House to the fact that one million voters can easily swing an election, and it would be calamitous if they were turned into an electoral burden. Action to help self-funded retirees in a meaningful, ongoing way should be taken and should be taken now. Research and Development: Intellectual Property",50
47,Mr ROCHER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Snap Printing company in Western Australia recently launched its new television advertising campaign. While images of the modem working world flash frenetically across the screen, a company spokesman observes that, 'The world has a new currency, and it is called information.' That proposition is not a new one, but it should be a timely and necessary reminder for this government. The last 12 months have seen regular exposes in the media which suggest that Australia will not be able to maintain its claim of being a clever country if we do not start to take seriously the issues of research and development and of intellectual property. The first year of the coalition government has been an interesting one indeed. On the one hand, we have a government led by the departments of Finance and Treasury that have savaged industry assistance programs, most notably the R&D program, on the grounds that they are not cost effective. On the other, we have industry experts like Mr Jon Stanford, the former Director of the Bureau of Industry Economics, observing: Knowledge is a key factor in underpinning faster growth. Knowledge-intensive ind-s--es genera-e substantial spin-offs to other activItIes by their contribution to economic growth. It is high time that we acknowledge our overreliance on extractive industries-industries that have performed well in the past but which are neither sustainable in the long term nor able to keep pace with the industry of knowledge. As one visiting academic to Australia observed last year, 'The only way to create wealth is through raw technology and the people who deliver it.' Australia has proven itself to be world class in the mining industry, but only after the investment of huge sums of time and of money. Why are we not prepared to take the same level of risk with intellectual property? Putting knowledge back into technology should be a priority for any Australian government. In my contribution to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) debate, I referred to one example of Australia's blase attitude towards the protection of intellectual property and research rights. In September last, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on a team at the Sydney Children's Hospital Cancer Institute and its cutting edge experimentation into the treatment of cancer and the AIDS virus. If research such as this were to develop from pure experimentation into a marketable drug, the spill-over effect it could have in Australia, in both human and economic terms, cannot be overstated. Regrettably, the main gist of the article was to note that several key scientists producing this research had opted to relocate and continue their studies in Canada because of the unfavourable research and development environment in Australia. In short, it will be Canada and not Australia that will reap the rewards of years of painstaking research if the drug is marketed. Less than six months later a similar story hit the papers. Headlines such as 'Flu pill trials leave us in the cold' and 'Giants in battle for flu cure' dominated the front pages of the national press. A story frighteningly similar to the one I have just mentioned emerged. A United States drugs company revealed that an anti-influenza pill, which was described as 'the drug that could be the most profitable in history' was in its final stages of testing. It was also noted that this wonder drug was the product of years of research by a team of Australian scientists at the Australian National University. This was a team of scientists who managed to obtain foreign funding for its research but who were rejected by the Hawke government when it applied for a research grant. Because of successive Australian governments' lax attitude towards patents on intellectual property, an English pharmaceutical company now stands to become the world's biggest drug company early in the next decade. Dr Graeme Laver, an Australian scientist involved in the initial investigation of this influenza drug, noted that this was yet another instance of local scientists moving overseas to further world-class research-and all because of a lack of funding for research and development and inadequate protection of patents in Australia. He said: If itthe flu pillworks, the market is staggering, unbelievable. But ... no money will flow backinto Australia which is a pity because the whole thing started in Australia and Australia should profit from it. What a pity indeed. Australia is already overreliant on imported drugs. If this does not change, our ageing population will see this dependence further burden our ailing current account balance sheet. Last year the World Competitiveness Yearbook showed a substantial drop in Australia's international competitiveness. Overall we rated No. 21-a drop of five places on the previous 12 months, and the largest drop of any OECD nation. Of particular concern was our lack of competitiveness in the areas of entrepreneurship and innovation. Not surprisingly, our shabby performance in these fields meant that we also scored poorly in our ability to promote exports and enterprise overseas. Australian research and development companies have struggled to secure adequate support for as long as R&D has featured in the Australian vocabulary. As a result there has been an imbalance between the amount of time, talent and money that has gone into new R&D compared with the successful marketing of new technology. But that is only part of the problem. The government's minimalist approach to the protection of intellectual property has meant that Australia has continued to fall behind our Asian and OECD counterparts. As Mr Tom Forgan, the founder of Australian Technology Park, observed in an interview with the Australian last July:The question is, if the government puts $4.5 billion into research and development each year, what have we got to show for it? He continued: No one is actually making any products-it's a waste of time and money. We're selling the technology for nothing and we can't afford to keep funding research that we lose the benefit of. While most overseas nations recognise and protect patents on pharmaceutical products for up to 15 years, Australia has lagged way behind. We are yet to hear whether the coalition government plans to bring our 'intellectual property regime' into line with current international standards. It has been argued that Australia wants stability in an increasingly chaotic world. As a result venture capital, a key ingredient of the success of American research and development, is missing in Australia. Australian governments and capital markets have been reluctant to take the necessary gamble when it comes to most R&D projects. In those cases where the risk has been taken and the research successfully marketed, insufficient property rights have seen Australian firms lose their patents to aggressive overseas players. The key to success for technology firms is the getting of, and the marketing of, information speedily. But the protection of intellectual property is equally as important. Without the protection of property rights, companies do not have the time to reap the rewards of their research and development before the patent term lapses. Why would any Australian business be interested in funding R&D in Australia under those terms? The earlier mentioned examples of companies researching cures for cancer and the flu show that they do not. They merely move offshore. The current government has to start looking at the bigger picture. It must review its policies towards research and development and patents immediately, otherwise it is probable that Australia will feature even more poorly in this year's world competitiveness year book. Automotive Industry: Tariffs  a few words in support of a vital Australian industry that has under trying conditions served its sentence, rehabilitated itself, improved and re-educated itself, but is sadly still under threat of yet further punishment. If Australia's car manufacturers drew up Christmas wish lists last year, those lists certainly would not have included the majority draft report of the Industry Commission on the automotive industry. The majority report recommended an annual reduction in tariffs of 2.5 per cent after the 15 per cent level is achieved in the year 2000, thereby reducing them to 5 per cent in 2005. The dissenting opinion written by associate commissioner Ian Webber calls for tariffs to remain steady at 15 per cent until 2005 and a further reassessment down the road before deciding on arrangements post-2005. Of the two conflicting recommendations, the latter is eminently the more palatable choice for my state of South Australia and also for Victoria which are home to the bulk of the car assembly and ancillary industries. In 1988 the tariff on imported vehicles was 45 per cent. It is now down to 22.5 per cent and by the tum of the century it will have been reduced to 15 per cent. The local industry has responded by becoming more efficient and more export oriented and directly employs over 45,000 people, representing 4 per cent of the nation's manufacturing work force and 17 per cent of South Australia's. In the broader sense, 3.5 per cent of the Australian work force relies on the automotive industry for employment. In accepting the Button plan, car manufacturers were promised micro arid macro economic reform as an offset to the tariff reductions. In the area of tax reform, the performance of federal and state governments has been disappointing, to say the least. For a number of years, business, labour, welfare organisations and politicians of all stripes have been calling on governments to alter the crippling tax structure and I cannot remember a state government coming to power without promising some form of tax reform. Yet all too often the reforms have not been forthcoming and the federal government gets the blame because it will not promise to deliver the shortfall to states' coffers. The time for buck-passing is long gone. The coalition tried and failed to initiate reform at the 1993 federal election, but that failure says a lot more about the desirability of consensus than it does about the undesirability of tax reform. We know how difficult it is to achieve consensus when ambition of party holds sway over the national interest and commitment to necessary reform. Experience tells us it is far easier to divide the people than it is to unite them. Now that Paul Keating-who had all the divisive skills of Solomon, but none of the wisdom-has moved on, it is the time for federal, state and local governments to sit down with business and labour to thrash out meaningful reform to Australia's tax base. The bandaid approach to taxation has failed us time and again. The system has become more complicated and open to abuse. Wholesale sales taxes and others such as FID and BAD-and what a superb acronym that is for an inappropriate tax-as well as income and company tax, should be reviewed with all of the possibilities put on the table for consideration. Let us finally look at ending payroll tax. It is incomprehensible to me how any government can justify Australian corporations paying taxes on the people they employ when lack of jobs is such a devastating national problem. The federal government should realise that one of the most costly business inputs for car makers is tax. If the automotive industry is expected to compete in a less protected world, then it is up to the government to dramatically ease that adjustment by changing the current tax system. Without tax reform, lowering of tariffs will not be a means to an end, but become an end in itself. Taxes alone are not the only problem. Reforms are needed in many areas and I am pleased to see that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) has set his sights on the wharves after achieving significant change in the labour market. Reforming the waterfront will certainly assist with exports, but a vibrant domestic market is the key prerequisite for a continued and expanded investment and presence of car manufacturers in Australia. Australians drive a fleet of vehicles older tax than that of most western nations. This may be due somewhat to our benign climate, but more so to the cost of our vehicles. Government must assist local manufacturers in bringing down those costs to make new cars more affordable. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry believes that full account should be taken of the economic, strategic and social impacts of any further tariff reductions. While they support the continuing removal of tariff barriers, they too argue that reductions be part of a wider reform package. The improvement in efficiency and quality of the Australian product has resulted in a more outward looking industry. However, that pioneering spirit is in danger of being stymied by trade barriers that prevent maximising overseas sales. A level playing field in terms of trade is an admirable aim and international accords are leading every nation in that direction. But there are certainly no prizes for being the first nation to cross the finishing line and our haste to get there will hardly influence any other nation to follow suit as swiftly. There are some protectionists left in Australia today, but I am certainly not one of them. 1 oppose the tools of protection, including tariffs, in the belief that our nation should ,beCome more productive and more competi:.tive.;-rll '"",-:r.IPID-r-Yes, you are. We know. You :-e.-m- out of the closet now. "".JI. _ ...; , ,;r!-,'YNE-And one of the protectionists ,is. ,still sitting on the front benches of the opPosition. But reform in the automotive industry should not and cannot be a one-way street. Government therefore must send a signal that we support the automotive industry. As someone who has witnessed my state hit rock bottom because of the mismanagement of successive Labor state governments, I will not compound the problem by jeopardising the jobs of another 17,000 South Australians and 24,000 Victorians by supporting the recommendations of the majority report. We regularly hear about the need to attract new business and to develop new technologies and state governments compete with each other to provide homes for emerging commercial ventures. This is well and good, but let us not ignore that which we already have. Politicians are constantly reminded by the campaign professionals that we must protect our base. In the same way, we must continue to protect our existing industrial base, as well as seeking out those new avenues of opportunity. Prior to Christmas I wrote to all coalition members and senators from South Australia and Victoria suggesting a united approach to the framing of the government response. I am pleased to say that I have received favourable replies from most of my colleagues on this issue. As elected government representatives of those who will be most adversely affected by the adoption of the recommendations contained in the majority report, it is our responsibility to ensure that the government implements policy that will allow and encourage the future prosperity of this vital segment of Australian manufacturmg. While we must of course wait on the commission for its final report, our constituents have not been as patient. They remind us every day of the dire consequences for the industry, for their jobs and for ours should the automotive industry go under. The coalition was elected on the promise of a better deal for regional areas and industries. There are few, if any, regional industries as important to both local and wider communities as our motor vehicle industry. South Australia under Labor suffered an exodus of manufacturing. Holden and Mitsubishi are still there and we must ensure they stay. The South Australian Centre for Economic Studies believes the Industry Commission erred badly in underestimating the importance of the car industry to South Australia. Contrary to the Industry Commission, the centre found that South Australia actually loses from tariff reductions. If tariffs are cut to 5 per cent, the centre calculates that there would be a reduction in my state's GSP of 0.18 percent. It might sound minuscule, but that translates to around $60 million and about 2,500 jobs. That is only the minimum case scenario. Incidentally, the centre is not recommending a halt to taritf cuts either, but merely pointing out the need for accompanying measures to adequately compensate for the tighter regime. Now that we are making cars of which we can truly be proud, it would be tragically ironic if this vital industry were to disappear because of a blind commitment to dogma found in some text book. Should the final majority report echo the sentiments of the draft, South Australians and Victorians should know that I will be firm in my resolve to support the automotive and ancillary industries that would be affected by that report. I am determined that the automotive industry and the jobs of many thousands of Australians will not be sacrificed at the altar of ideology. Second Sydney Airport: Holsworthy Proposal",51
48,Mr TANNER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In May last year the new government within weeks of taking office announced that, rather than proceed with the development of a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek, it would also examine the possible location of the airport at Holsworthy. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) indicated that this was simply as a means of insurance because of the EIS process that was going ahead with respect to Badgerys Creek and that, in order to ensure that there would be a location for the new airport for Sydney, there needed to be a fallback option. Consequently the government decided to hold an EIS into the Holsworthy option as well. We were told time and time again by the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that nothing sinister had occurred. The government was simply making sure that it did not have all its eggs in one basket and that there was another option available to it with respect to the location of the airport. At the time the opposition indicated that view was that the government's decision indicated very clearly that it intended to Sydney's second airport at Holsworthy for a number of reasons: primarily because it would be cheaper, because the land involved was already Commonwealth owned whereas there was substantial land acquisition already occurring at Badgerys Creek; and because it was closer to existing substantial road and rail infrastructure. The fact that there are one or two marginal Liberal held seats around Badgerys Creek did not escape the opposition's notice either. The government kept insisting in spite of these suggestions that Holsworthy was simply a fall-back and that Badgerys Creek was the preferred location for the second airport for Sydney. As the days passed the true evidence of how crazy the suggestion of siting an airport at Holsworthy actually is started to emerge. Some things were obvious immediately. The fact that there is a vast amount of unexploded ordnance throughout the Holsworthy area as a result of its having been used as an army bombing range for a very long time was well known. The fact that much of terrain, particularly in the southern area, is full of very deep ravines that will make any form of construction of an airport extremely difficult was already well known. Then other facts began to emerge: the existence of many Aboriginal sacred sites in the area; a number of rare fauna species, endangered species and other things like a very substantial koala colony that would be threatened by the airport development; the existence of the Woronora Dam and catchment area immediately adjacent to the proposed airport site; the presence of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor nearby; the fact that the proposed Olympic Games shooting range was at one end of where the airport would be located; the obvious presence of Defence facilities that would have to be relocated; the fact that Bankstown airport, the busiest airport in Australia, would almost certainly have to close down because of flight path complications; and other issues such as the fact that one of the world's premier hang gliding locations at Stan well Tops would have to close because of flight path complications if its the southern option for the Holsworthy airport was adopted. Of course, on top of all of these build issues there is the very obvious impact on people living in the southern suburbs of Sydney immediately adjacent to the Holsworthy area. Throughout this fiasco Labor consistently stated its strong opposition to any airport being located at Holsworthy. Holsworthy is in effect the lungs of Sydney and has been very aptly described as the lungs of Sydney. When you look at the map of Sydney you will see this substantial green area sticking well into the main developed built-up area of Sydney. That is Holsworthy and the opposition believes that that is how it should stay. Community reaction to the proposal has been unbelievable. I have spoken to numerous local groups, councils and representatives of councils. I have driven around the area. I have flown over the Holsworthy area in a helicopter and received a vast number of letters from concerned residents in the Holsworthy region. I am sure that the government and the EIS process have received even more. I think it has gone well into the thousands. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) submitted a petition to the House several months ago and he almost needed a truck to carry it in because it was so large. The government deceit in this whole process has been absolutely monstrous. First the fact that within weeks of an election and after an election it indicated that it is considering building an airport at a site when it said absolutely nothing about this proposal prior to the election and won the seat of Hughes partly as a result. It is clear absolutely deceit. Secondly, people were buying land from the Defence Housing Authority within days of the government's announcement and asking the Defence Housing Authority and various other authorities, 'Is there any truth in the rumour that an airport is going to be built here?' They were being told, 'No', but when they then proceeded with their contracts they got the shock of their lives to discover that yes, the government was contemplating building an airport at Holsworthy. They were then told when they complained, 'Sorry, we could not tell the Defence Housing Authority because that would have given it a commercial advantage against people it competes with in the housing market. Sorry, bad luck. The fact that you have bought a piece of land that is going to be substantially devalued as a result of what we are doing is just by the by.' Over the weekend, an even more outrageous piece of deceit-and the final illustration of what this government has been on about-was uncovered. It was in a memo from an adviser to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) to the minister, in which he details a discussion he had with Mr Lachlan MCComish, who is an adviser to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). This discussion occurred in June last year. Yesterday, in the House, the minister for science confirmed the existence and authenticity of this document. A couple of quotes from the document should suffice to illustrate precisely how mendacious, deceitful and duplicitous the government has been on this issue. Remember, this discussion took place in June last year, within weeks of the minister having told the House repeatedly that Holsworthy was simply a fall-back position, a form of insurance, and that Badgerys Creek was the real option. The document says: Lachlan made it clear that Badgerys Creek was dead as a viable option for the airport. It continues: He believes that Holsworthy will be selected as the preferred site, subject to a satisfactory outcome of the EIS. He then says that this makes it 'impossible' for the nuclear reactor to continue at Lucas Heights, or for a replacement reactor to be built there. The document indicates that money from the sale of Badgerys Creek land and from Bankstown airport could be made available to help pay for the airport at Holsworthy and, more to the point, that removing the nuclear reactor from Lucas Heights 'may partly negate the negative impact of the new airport' . According to this document there is a financial pay-off and a political pay-off. The reason specified as to why the government was abandoning Badgerys Creek was the growth of residential housing in the vicinity of Badgerys Creek. What it failed to point out-and it is well known, particularly to people who live there-is that there is a substantial amount of residential housing within a couple of kilometres of the runway locations proposed for Holsworthy, so the deceit and the hypocrisy is absolutely naked. The memo tells us precisely how deceitful and duplicitous this government has been on the second Sydney airport issue. Holsworthy has been its real option all along. Badgerys Creek was abandoned from day one. The EIS process purportedly comparing the two is clearly a farce. The senior adviser to the minister for transport is on the record within the processes of the government, in a document which has been accepted as authentic by a fellow minister, stating that Badgerys Creek is dead-and that was within weeks of the Holsworthy proposal being announced. And yet, to this day, the chimera is maintained. The government says, 'Holsworthy is just the fall-back position.' The government ought to come clean. It ought to state what its true intention is. The minister ought to explain to the House why his senior staffer was telling other government officials, within weeks of the Holsworthy announcement, that that was the government's preferred option, if that is not the case. The minister has a lot of explaining to do, not only to the House but also particularly to the people of Holsworthy and the suburbs in the southern area of Sydney. He has to provide answers to the concerns of residents on the impact of that airport. He has to provide answers on the numerous environmental issues associated with the construction of an airport at Holsworthy. He has to explain, in particular, his outraHealth geous and duplicitous behaviour, both in the House and outside it, in maintaining that an airport is going to built at Badgerys Creek, and that only if the EIS process is unsuccessful there will Holsworthy be considered, when this document makes it abundantly clear that from day one the real agenda of this government was to build an airport at Holsworthy. The Labor Party believes that Holsworthy is a ridiculous site for an airport. The more look at it, the more I wonder why it was even on the short-list of 10 that was considered by the former government 10 or 12 years ago, let alone the primary target for an airport. This government should stop trying to deceive the people of Sydney. It should stop its outrageous, duplicitous behaviour, come clean on precisely what it intends to do, and take proper account of the communities, through consultation with local residents and associatthat ed groups, and work through the issues. It should deal honestly with the issue of a second airport for Sydney. (Time expired) Wallis Lake",56
49,Mr VAILE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to grieve for the oyster industry in New South Wales and, particularly, for the Wallis Lake oyster industry in my electorate, which is based on Wallis Lake at Forster-Tuncurry. Unfortunately, the industry has been hit by disaster in recent times with the outbreak of hepatitis A, with about 300-odd cases around Australia. Allegedly, 70 per cent of those cases have been traced to oysters, some of which came from Wallis Lake. The worse thing about trying to address the problem has been the unbelievable comments made along the way by the Minister for the Environment in New South Wales, Ms Pam Allan. To date she has not been prepared to admit that she was wrong in some of the statements she made, nor has she apologised to the people of the Great Lakes area, based in Forster-Tuncurry, for the damage that some of her comments have caused during a very difficult time. Those people have been trying to manage, along with the local council, the local member, the New South Wales Department of and the EPA. While preparing for the grievance debate this afternoon, we were listening to the news in the office, and we heard that, only this morning, the Premier of New South Wales announced a package of measures to assist in the crisis in the Wallis Lake area. Those measures include an oyster quality assurance program, a financial assistance package, and criteria that will be used for future oyster harvesting, through which the health department will make the final I determination on the basis of present scientific evidence. On a number of recent occasions, contrary to the comments made by the environment minister in New South Wales, the health department has said that there is no suggestion that the risk associated with swimming in Wallis Lake is greater than anywhere else. It has cleared Wallis Lake for swimming, yet is exactly the opposite to what the Minister for the Environment in New South Wales said earlier this month. She has not apologised to the people in the area for the comments she has made, and now the Premier of New South Wales has had to rectify the situation on behalf of his government, albeit a little late when you look at the time frame. On 14 February, the hepatitis outbreak was announced. On 24 February, a man died from the virus, allegedly from contaminated oysters taken from Wallis Lake. In New South Wales, 300 cases of hepatitis A have been notified since January 1991. Allegedly, 70 per cent of those cases are from oysters, one third of which are identified as coming from Wallis Lake. On 25 February, Pam Allan attacked the council. She claimed that the Great Lakes Shire Council was guilty of gross negligence by failing to comply with an EPA order from last November to close down two sanitary depots. At the same time, Pam Allan declared Wallis Lake a non-swimming zone. In yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, in an article headed 'Minister stands firm after oyster poisoning bungle', the lead paragraph says: The Minister for the Environment, Ms Allan, forced yesterday into an embarrassing admission she wrongly accused a mid-North Coast council triggering a hepatitis A outbreak State Government order to clean up two sanitary depots. She still will not apologise to the local munity. On 28 February, a preliminary EPA report ruled out the depots as the source the outbreak. Her own department has ruled them out and proven her comments wrong, but the minister will not apologise to the people of the Great Lakes area. Today, the Premier tried to prop up the swimming. situation and defend his minister, who has been negligent and irresponsible in the ments she has made about Wallis Lake. She claimed that there was a swimming ban on Wallis Lake and that signs would be erected to warn swimmers, and yet the council has had no such instructions from any minister, and the lake has never been closed. As Great Lakes Mayor, Councillor John Chadban, said on 28 February in the Sydney Morning Herald, we expect professional help from the government rather than randoTP criticism. This was a very serious situation which required a professional attitude from the state government. It has not received it. commend the work done by the local council during this crisis, particularly Councillor John Chadban. They have been very professional in the way they have gone about it. The oyster farmers have acted responsibly. I applaud the local oyster growers for their responsible actions in voluntarily withdrawing product from the market and closing down their fisheries until the crisis is resolved. They took that action immediately. I hope the state government will now provide meaningful assistance. I welcome the announcement by the Premier of New South Wales to assist the community and the industry in resolving the problem that has unfortunately arisen at Wallis Lake. There are two issues here. There is the issue of the alleged contamination of the oysters and what that cost is: the Wallis Lake oyster industry is worth $13 million. There is that element. There is the health was element: some 300 people across Australia have been affected by the outbreak of hepatiof tis A; and there has been one fatality-and by ignoring a that is extremely sad. We have a $13 million industry, an outbreak of hepatitis A, one fatality, a $35 commillion flow-on effect to the local economy, 250 local jobs in the oyster industry, and a of tourist industry worth tens of millions of dollars to the region. That industry has been affected by the irresponsible public comments of the Minister for the Environment in New South Wales about the closure of the lake to The New South Wales health department comhas advised that all activities, including swimming and water skiing, are permitted within Wallis Lake and tributaries. The only qualification is that, within the Wallamba River, caution should be exercised during periods of heavy rain. That is the view of the New South Wales Department of Health. It is incumbent upon the media in this country to make it abundantly clear to the general population that that is the view of the New South Wales health department as far as Wallis Lake is concerned. The media in this country ran this issue very hard, and it has I been very damaging to the local community. The media has a responsibility to get that that done by message across. The New South Wales health department has said that there are no restrictions on Wallis Lake as far as water sports and activities in the lake are concerned. It is very important to get that message across in the lead-up to the Easter break. The communities in Forster and Tuncurry rely heavily on the oyster industry, the fishing industry and the tourism industry. That has not been taken into account. I give marks to Premier Carr. He has taken it into account in his response, although it could have come a bit sooner. However, I still criticise the Minister for the Environment, who will not acknowledge the profound effect that her irresponsible comments had earlier this month in regard to the alleged closure of the lake. It did not happen. A survey of 100 seafood retailers in New South Wales was undertaken by the Master Fish Merchants Association. Following this disaster in Wallis Lake there is evidence of a 30 per cent drop in seafood sales and an 85 per cent drop in oyster sales, which may have resulted in a loss through the restaurant trade of $15 million to $20 million. This is all within New South Wales. Thankfully, the Premier has recognised it. The allegations are that the contamination has come from effluent treatment plants. In the 1980s I was involved in the Greater Taree City Council, and in the mid-1980s the Labor Party was in government in New South Wales. When we tried to augment sewage treatment schemes by implementing dry land disposal, the engineers with the Department of Public Works in New South Wales and the Department of Public Works itself-and this was when Bob Carr was the Minister for the Environment-would not allow local government to take that effluent out of the rivers, the tributaries and estuaries, and dispose of it on dry land, because they were philosophically opposed to it. They would not consider any option other than dumping that effluent into the tributaries. (Time expired)",58

51,Mr DARGA VEL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"As part of the government's planned plundering of the 5,000 DAS jobs, its wants to kill the AGPS-a profitable public sector trading enterpriseand cruel up to 500 local workers in the ACT in the process. The AGPS turned a profit last year of $2.4 million. It is a successful public sector enterprise. As part of its functions it performs a number of security-related activities, including the production of budget papers for this House, passports and so on. It appears under the government's Yellow pages test that you are somewhat dammed if you do and you are damned if you do not as a public sector enterprise in this country. If you do not tum a profit but provide services, you arc contracted out, outsourced or sold off. If you do tum a profit the argument goes that you should be sold off because someone else can make some money. The ACT is in recession according to that somewhat conservative economic forecaster Access Economics. The government's solution to the ACT's recession is to sack more workers. I call upon the government to reverse its decision in relation to the AGPS. (Time expired) Goat Liver Exports",60
52,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to bring to the House's attention a unique Australian export. This letter should have been written to Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). It says: Dear Sir It gives me great pleasure to write to you regarding the help and assistance given to me by AQIS Staff, particularly Garry Garreffa and Geoff Wood, in Perth. Since September 1994 I have been endeavouring to export frozen goat livers from Australia to Italy, and the above staff have patiently and efficiently assisted me to overcome the many frustrating obstacles encountered. The first commercial shipment flew out of Australia this month, and it is anticipated that the demand will increase significantly later in 1997. For your information an extract found only in goat livers (UK.lOl) is proving to be one of the newer cancer cures. Initial Italian trials have been very encouraging. Trials are currently being conducted in Mexico. Since the 1st January, 1997 the Italian Government has legislated that any cancer patient can be treated with UK.lOI. The advent of mad cow disease has accelerated the demand for this raw material, hence a new export for Australia. Could you please convey my thanks and appreciation of AQIS Perth's three years assistance, as mentioned above, to their superiors and your government. Yours faithfully NA Australia is well positioned to export these goat livers because we are free of the debilitating sheep and goat disease called scrapie. I congratulate Dr MCDermott, who is a leading veterinary scientist in Australia, on his initiative. (Time expired)",60
53,Mr JENKINS,DR JD MCDERMOTT,"Three years ago today, on 20 March, the New Delhi statement on Tibetan freedom was released at the conclusion of the three-day world parliamentarians convention on Tibet-a gathering attended by members of parliament from 25 countries. Australia was represented at the conference by Senator Robert Hill, who was then the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Regrettably, the sentiments contained in the four-page statement continue to pertain. I call on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to ignore the posturing of the Chinese government and raise on behalf of Australia the concerns of many that so many issues in relation to Tibet continue to remain unresolved. The reports of human rights violations, illegal detentions and environmental vandalism continue. As a demonstration of what could be a very mature and important relationship with China, the Prime Minister should feel quite comfortable in raising the Tibet issue. As part of the New Delhi statement, there were the so-called 10 commandments of Delhi. Amongst them was to encourage visits of the Dalai Lama. Last year we saw the very successful visit of the Dalai, including a visit to this parliament. Also included in that statement was the suggestion that we should target international bodies. There have been many that believe that the United Nations could do more to resolve the Tibet question. The last point made in this 10-point plan was to encourage human rights in China and at home. I believe that the Chinese government should be encouraged to sit down with the Dalai Lama and resolve the questions in Tibet. (Time expired) Employment: New South Wales Central Coast",61
54,Mr LLOYD,DR JD MCDERMOTT,"I wish to highlight briefly today the significant gains being achieved in the fight against unemployment in my electorate on the Central Coast of New South Wales. These figures released by DEETYA from the ABS labour force survey show that employment on the Central Coast of New South Wales in Gosford and Wyong Tibet has risen from 101,SOO to 117,SOO-an increase of 15.7 per cent. Unemployment has reduced from 9,500 to 6,500, which means in percentage terms that unemployment has reduced from S.5 per cent to 5.2 per cent-a very significant decrease on the Central Coast of New South Wales. We have areas such as the Somersby industrial area where many new companies are establishing-ompanies, like the Australian Feed Company, N.J. Phillips and K.c. Country Furniture; companies that are exporting and increasing their production. The government is playing a role in that reduction in unemployment on the Central Coast by creating an environment of low inflation and low interest rates so that businesses can get on with increasing production and increasing employment. The government is also producing jobs on the Central Coast through their teleservice centre, another initiative that has been established in Gosford. This is creating an additional 75 jobs for the people of the Central Coast. The Central Coast is an area that is dynamic. It is the fastest growing local government region in New South Wales and the seventh fastest in Australia. It is an area that is move and is achieving. (Time expired) Long, Mrs Ellen",61

56,Mrs WEST,DR JD MCDERMOTT,"I wish to draw to small the attention of the House the recent flagging by the Minister for Schools, Vocational that Education and Training (Dr Kemp) on the possibility of new in service training for teachers. Inservice training has always been an important and integral part of ongoing quality assurance in the teaching profession. Speaking as a former teacher, I can only concur and support this consideration as the benefits are considerable for everyone involved in teaching and learning. In fact, may I recommend that those recently retired teachers in the 50 to 60 age bracket engaged to lend their considerable years of experience and expertise to this very exercise of assisting current teachers in literacy and numeracy skill development. These recently retired teachers have a vast range of teaching strategies that were successful in the classroom and they overcame many difficulties and disabilities associated with teaching children to read and understand the written Over recent years, with changing emphasises within the whole school environment, most have been taken away from their primary role of learning facilitator to deal with a wide range of non-teaching duties. These extra duties take time away from their very real job. What many current teachers would like to return to is quality teaching time in the classroom with as few interruptions to the major task of concentrated learnIn this ing experience as possible. Time is of the essence.

Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",62
57,Mr FILING,DR JD MCDERMOTT,"In recent times, I and the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) have been subjected to both written and verbal attacks from the member for Forrest, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer  business is getting more and more exasperated with his weak performance because in essence is part of his character and his of the approach to his position. In relation to that, I want to make an observation. The Liberal Party in Western Australia, as the member for Swan e Mr Randall) would know, is having an awful time trying to preselect a replacement for Senator Panizza. On 16 March, at state council which was a very critical meeting in relation to that preselection choice, the member for Forrest, who is the Prime Minister's personal representative in the Western Australian organisation, did not even tum up. Also on 20 May 1995, when there was a similar sort of kafuffle going on at state council in relation to other preselections, he left early before all hard decisions were to be made. Quite clearly, he has not got the stomach to deal with the really hard work and the hard decisions. It is not surprising that, as a consedistricts quence of not having the stomach or the character to be able to do what he was required to do--represent the Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition-he is unable to fulfil his position as the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and represent their interests strongly. Mr Randall-Did he know you were going to do this?",62
58,Mr FILING,DR JD MCDERMOTT,I might say to the member for Swan that he has had his opportunity to give us a serve over our characters. If you remember he called us quislings. I say he is a quiver looking for a spine to go up. (Time expired) Second Sydney Airport: Holsworthy Proposal,63
59,Mr MCCLELLAND,DR JD MCDERMOTT,"The federal government's handling of the Holsworthy airport issue has been deceitful and disgraceful. On 21 May 1996 the government announced a new EIS process for Sydney's second international airport which included Holsworthy as a possible site in addition to the long identified Badgerys Creek option. On that day, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) said that, despite Holsworthy being included, the government's first priority was Badgerys Creek. Yesterday, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) advised this House that a leaked memorandum proposing a swap of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor for an airport at Holsworthy was written in June 1996. The memorandum, which was a written to the minister just a few weeks after Mr Sharp's statement that Badgerys Creek was the government's first option, discloses that one of Minister Sharp's senior advisers was telling other government staffers that Badgerys Creek was 'dead as a viable option for the airport'. The leaked memorandum discloses that the government's EIS is a farce because it indithe cates that the government effectively has a predetermined view against Badgerys Creek and in favour of Holsworthy. Not only were the residents of St George and Sutherland misled by the government failing to disclose the Holsworthy proposal prior to the last election but they are now being further deceived by a fundamentally flawed EIS process. Advances to Income Support Recipients",63
60,Mr BILLS ON,DR JD MCDERMOTT,I rise to speak briefly about the scheme that enables income support recipients to receive a $500 advance. I have received feedback from my local Frankston Community Support and Information Centre suggesting a disturbing correlation between people who have chosen to participate in that scheme and those requiring material aid and financial counselling support. There is a suggestion that the advance is being used for an artificial and unsustainable increase in living standards rather than for addressing a particular and important one-off outlay such as repairing white goods or repairing a motor vehicle. I value the feedback from the Frankston Community Support and Information Centre as it has been very creative in dealing with material aid challenges in terms of tackling causes rather than symptoms. I have invited the minister to consider reviewing the scheme perhaps with my area as a case study. The Frankston Community Support and Information Centre and the Mornington Community Advice Bureau could provide very useful on the ground advice and feedback on how the scheme is operating and whether it is meeting the longer term needs of income support recipients and the original objectives of the scheme. I would certainly encourage the minister to have a look at how the scheme is operating at this time. Unemployment,63
61,Mr FITZGIBBON,DR JD MCDERMOTT,"I said in this place last night that Tuesday's ABS unemployment figures showed that unemployment in the Hunter region reached a 13-month high of 12.8 per cent.

63,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. First, can the Prime Minister assure the House that the reasonable alternatives the government has offered Sir Julius Chan are conditional on an absolute commitment from the Papua New Guinea government to revive the Bougainville peace process-not just a commitment in words but a commitment to concrete measures designed to get all parties to the Bougainville conflict back to negotiating table? Second, given the growing problem with mercenaries worldwide-as instanced by today's reports of ties in Zaire-will the government take up our proposal for Australia to sponsor a UN resolution calling on the international community to condemn all use of mercenaries and strengthen global efforts to eliminate the use of these forces?",64
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. In answer to the second part of his question, can I say that I will have a look at that. I share his distaste for the use of mercenaries. They have been a wholly sordid and unsatisfactory development in our part of the world. Can I say that the indication at present that the mercenaries may in part at least be starting to withdraw from Papua New Guinea is something that I very warmly welcome. I am sure all members of the House join me in expressing that welcome. So far as the first part of the question is concerned, can I assure the Leader of the Opposition that the reasonable alternatives I put to Sir Julius Chan last Sunday week were based upon three elements. The first element was that the mercenaries not be used in Bougainville, the second element was the disavowal of a new military offensive in Bougainville and the third element was a genuine commitment to a resumption of the peace process. So in general terms, I can answer in the affirmative to the Leader of the Opposition's question. I am sure he and his colleagues will understand that it is not really in the interests of a further satisfactory progressing of this issue for me to be any more specific. Economy",64
65,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen the latest Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index of economic activity? Does the index support the view that economic activity will continue to strengthen, resulting in an improving environment for business?",64
66,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I can the inform him that the index does support the view that economic activity will continue to strengthen, resulting in an improving environhorrific atrociment for business. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index of economic activity rose one per cent in January, reinforcing an upward trend in the previous three months and bringing the smooth growth rate to around four per cent, the strongest rate of growth since October 1994. Of course, in October 1994 monetary policy was tightened at that period. The leading index is a function of a range of other indicators that feed into it which are beginning to show a picture of rising activity. For example, building approvals and housing finance approvals both increased markedly in January and there was strong growth in corporate profits. In addition, recent business surveys are suggesting increases in overtime. These are also consistent with the release this morning of the DEETYA skilled vacancy survey for February. This showed that skilled vacancies have risen in trend terms for the last five months and are now 11 per cent above the level of October 1996. They can be taken together with other leading indicators. Mr MCMullan-How do they relate to March 1996?",64
67,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know the Labor Party, from their increasingly volatile interjections, love to see the Australian economy picking up! Nothing seems to ruin their day more than the Australian economy picking up pace. ANZ job vacancies were up 1.8 per cent in February. As I said also, the other leading indicators are increased building approvals, household finance approvals and retail trade. I said that the leading index is the strongest since October 1994 which brought a monetary policy response at the end. I have also said previously that was not without its benefits in relation to keeping inflation under control. The good thing about this pick-up in activity is that it is on a very low inflation base. The other good thing about it is that in the last year we have accomplished an enormous structural change-a structural change in the Commonwealth fiscal position of $7.2 billion. So we come into this pick-up in activity not just preserving low inflation but with a structural change in relation to fiscal consolidation of $7.2 billion by this government. I regret that the Australian Labor Party fought it tooth and nail. The Australian Labor Party, with fiscal irresponsibility unseen in Australia in recent times, fought that fiscal consolidation. This government was pleased to put it in place. The structural change which we accomplished was at a time of low inflation and increasing economic growth, a matter which should be welcomed by both sides of this House.",65
68,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I am happy to let him wallow in the glory of getting the economy back almost to where it was last March. Has the Treasurer seen the report that he will at tomorrow's Premiers Conference propose a new wholesale sales tax regime to be applied to many state, territory and local government functions? Does he agree that such a proposal would be yet another breach of the government's commitment not to increase existing taxes or impose new taxes? Will the Treasurer rule out imposing this new tax on other levels of government? And while he is about it, will he also rule out any further cuts to specific purpose payments to the states?",65
69,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen such a report. I have no idea what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is on about, and, I suspect, nor does he. Payroll Deduction of Union Dues",65
70,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service. Is the minister aware of reports in today's media regarding plans by the government to cancel the payroll deduction of union dues in the Australian Public Service if unions act unreasonably in the workplace? Can the minister clarify for the benefit of the House the government's initiative on payroll deduction of union dues in the Public Service?,65
71,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As I think most honourable members would be aware, one of the most important aspects of the Workplace Relations Act is that, under part 10, we have provided for the first time an absolute guarantee for Australian workers that they have absolute freedom of choice as to whether or not they are a member of a union, so much so that we have preserved one of the items proscribed under the act in respect of unlawful termination. You cannot victimise a person because they are a member of a union. In fact, we have increased penalties against employers who victimise somebody because they exercise that choice to be a member of Taxation a union. The great debate in Australia is that those on the other side of the House do not believe that people should also have the right not to be a member of a union if that is their desire. One of the great things is that, under the Workplace Relations Act, we have abolished compulsory unionism in this country. There is no safe haven for compulsory unionism either within the state or federal jurisdictions across the country. The government, when it comes to the Australian Public Service, acts not just as a legislator but as an employer. We simply want to reinforce the provisions of the new act which came into operation on 1 January. We want to be satisfied that those members who have chosen to be members of a union within the Australian Public Service have provided us with a current and genuine authority that they wish their union dues to continue to be deducted. The system will be that we are writing to people within the APS. I have informed the unions. I spoke with them a couple of weeks ago about the policy and advised them of it. We are seeking from APS members a genuine, current, fresh authority from them to that effect. If that is what people wish to do, then, consistent with that principle of freedom of association, we are prepared to collect those union dues. We also say, as has been the case since the day we were elected, that this is a discretion ultimately in the hands of the government. We welcome and support responsible unionism where that is the choice of members. Where people are acting irresponsibly, then of course that is a discretion-namely, the capacity to collect those dues and pass them on-which we reserve unto the government. We think that is fair and reasonable. We believe that where people want to be in a union that is fair enough. We are prepared to talk with the unions who are genuinely representing the interests of their members. Most members of the APS who are in unions will see this as a very fair decision on the of the government. Tourism: Great Barrier Reef",65
72,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government representing the Minister for the Environment. I refer to reports that National Party MPs have been telling the media and the tourism industry in North Queensland that the Howard government's tourism visitor tax-the second instalment of the reef tax announced by Senator Hill-will be too difficult for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to collect and, as a result, the government will not proceed with it. Do those reports accurately reflect the government's intentions regarding this new tax?",66
73,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen the reports, but we have had the debate in this chamber about the Great Barrier Reef charge. It was varied after detailed discussion with members and the industry. It built on the charge that the former government put in place, so I am a little surprised that the member rose to ask that question. We are putting in place a system for contribution by visitors to meet the cost of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park arrangements. There have been no reports that I have seen to date that indicate there will be any change in the government's approach. Employment Placement Services",66
74,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, a very dedicated and hard working minister. I draw the minister's attention to the government's commitment to provide the most effective possible assistance to unemployed people. Can the minister outline to the House what actions the government is taking in my electorate of Robertson and throughout Australia to reform employment placement services and how these reforms will assist schools and ensure that school leavers will get real jobs?",66
75,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for his question. The government part is involved in very major reforms to help unemployed people at the present time. Yesterday the work for the dole legislation was introduced into the parliament. Of course all sides of this House will be aware of the enormous public support that there is for this legislation. In the next three months the government will be embarking on an historic reform of services for unemployed people. One billion dollars worth of services currently provided by the Commonwealth Employment Service will be tendered out. This cance for around 500,000 clients of the Commonwealth Employment Service. The tender is expected to close at the end of May. Contracts will be signed around September. This is one of the most significant social reforms that this country has seen for many years. The new system, which we believe will be a much more effective system for helping unemployed people, will be in place by the end of the year. Mr Crean interjecting",66
76,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a great deal better than you were able to do in 13 years, when you had unemployment at the highest level since the Great Depression. It is worth making the point that there is an enormous contrast between this government's clarity of purpose and determination to help unemployed people and the utter confusion which prevails on the other side of the House. We saw that in respect of work for the dole. First they opposed it, then the Leader of the Opposition said that they would amend it to blazes, then they said they would support it, and then the member for Hotham said that they had had one any way so it did not make any difference. They simply cannot get their act together. Now we have the member for Batman, on the employment services reforms, saying that they disagree with these reforms because they would like to have completely unlimited access to these services. Of course, that is a very different position from the position they took in government. It is not surprising, of course, that it is a different position because they seem to have a different position on everything that they took in government. They do not seem to be able to sustain any position. It is not that they did not have any trouble spending money. The Two Billion Dollar Man over there, the member for Hotham, had no difficulty spending great wads of money. But the member for Batman, the clone sitting down there, is going to do much better. The member for Hotham lost only 200,000 union members; the member for Batman lost 600,000. You spent $2 billion; he wants to spend about $6 billion. It is no wonder that will have signifi- the Australian",67
77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Where is the money coming from?,67
78,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is coming out of the pockets of battling families. That is where the money is coming from. It is obvious that the member for Hotham is having a very bad effect on the member for Batman. This cloning process is going on and on. We have Woolly Head here, and Dolly down there. They are clones, and they do not seem to be able to get any sense of direction whatever.",67
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, please direct your remarks through the chair.",67
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: there is absolutely no point on relevance as far as this is concerned. This man in his position has presided over a 40,000 increase in the long-term unemployed",67
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are not going to debate this.,67
82,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,As a result of getting rid of the member for Hotham' s programs. That is what he has done and he is proud of it.,67
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,67
84,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's reforms are of particular interest to schools because they provide the opportunity for schools to take a much more direct interest in the employment prospects of their students. I am very pleased to say that, under the jobs pathway program, Marsden High and Acacia Ridge High in Queensland are already successful tenderers.",67
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And one of them is in my electorate.,67
86,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, there is a school in the Prime Minister's electorate which is very much interested in these opportunities. In the new round, schools could tender to provide labour exchange services and entry level training services, and there will be something like $75 million available for which schools can tender. As schools gain this increasing interest, we are going to see put into place yet another step in the comprehensive approach the government is putting in place to help young Australians get real jobs. Tourism: Great Barrier Reef",67
87,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment. I ask the minister whether he is aware the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has offered inducements to tourism operators in Queensland to collect the Howard government's new visitors tax when implemented in 1998. Has the government authorised this action?,68
88,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen any reports and do not have any information about whether or not the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has acted in the way that you suggest. But it is quite clear that government policy is that there will be a collection of a charge to meet the costs of visitation to the Great Barrier Reef. That has been accepted by a majority in this place. It is government policy. It builds on, as I said in the last answer, the decision that you took to have a charge. I might say that the member for Cunningham was involved in the committee report that recommended in part that there be such a charge. It is fair. It is equitable. There have been detailed consultations with the industry and with members about the appropriateness of the charge and how it should be proceeded with. Toxic Shock Syndrome",68
89,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of the fact that tampons that do not comply with Therapeutic Goods Order 51 are still being sold today, some 14 months after the final date of compliance with Therapeutics Goods Order 51, which, among other things, requires all primary packaging of tampons to be clearly marked with a warning that toxic shock syndrome is a rare but serious disease that may cause death? What efforts is the government taking to remind retailers of their responsibility to conform with TG051, and what action is available to the government against those retailers who refuse to comply?",68
90,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, I am aware of the situation, and I thank the member for Leichhardt for alerting both me and the Therapeutic Goods Authority to it. There has been quite a deal of interest in toxic shock, and it principally relates to the third inquest into the death of a l3-year-old Mount Isa girl who died in a swimming pool in December 1994. That inquest has just concluded, and it is not proper for me to discuss that at this point in time. However, Australia manufactures or imports some 400 million tampons a year. Tampons are required to be very clean, but they are not required to be sterile. As far as I know, no country in the world, other than Japan, requires sterile tampons, and Japan only does it for imports which might have an intent other than simply safety. Toxic shock syndrome, as the honourable member said, is very rare. Its occurrence is probably fewer than one in five million women. Nonetheless, it does happen and it does have nasty consequences. Even though tampons are very safe, women do have the right to have informed consent. That is why Therapeutic Goods Order 51 was introduced by the previous government in 1995, and it was something that I, when shadow minister, supported. We were expecting there to be a bit of a changeover time of two to three months between the old tampon boxes, which had no warning, and the new boxes, but the honourable member found, on visiting a number of supermarkets in North Queensland, that there were, in a number of cases, tampons with the old box numbers. We were able to trace these. I find it disturbing that tampons manufactured in October 1993 are being sold in North Queensland in January 1997. That clearly reflects bad stock turnover and stock control. I would not want to suggest that these tampons are in any way dangerous. There is no evidence of that but, again, women do have a right to have informed consent and be aware of the small risk. At a federal level, the Therapeutic Goods Authority controls tampons and has done since 1991, but it only controls their manufacture. Australia has one large manufacturerJohnson & Johnson-which has about 60 per cent of the market. They have a national sales network which ensured, in early 1996, that there was no product left on the shelves. But smaller companies do not have a national sales network and cannot institute that measure. The Commonwealth does not control wholesaling and retailing; the states do. I am afraid that we do not have capacity to do anything there, but I will write to all state and territory health ministers and alert them to the fact that, clearly, in some parts of Australia there is poor stock control and product over three years since the date of manufacture appearing on the shelves. I will ask that they use what power they have to ensure that this does not continue. Unemployment",68
91,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is the decision to redefine real jobs an admission that the government is finding it too hard to kick goals on the employment field? Why is the government shifting the goal posts? Is it the case that a person working 20 hours a week is regarded by the Howard government as a full-time worker? Why has the government defined part-time workers as fUll-time workers? Why has the government fiddled the figures?",69
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is not a bad question from the greatest kicker of own goals, the man pledged to lead the trade union movement of Australia, who, together with the then Labor government, created the circumstances that drove over 11 per cent of the Australian population out of work-the worse since the Great Depression. That was the own goal you kicked-and you helped your former government colleagues to kick-when you, as head of the ACTU, and the then Labor government ran the affairs of this country. My advice is that the legislation to which the honourable gentleman refers does not redefine what is regarded as a part-or full time job. It merely spells out the benchmark in terms of obtaining employment options that must be reached before certain payments become payable. Veterans: Accidents in the Home",69
93,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The minister would be aware that accidents in the home, particularly bums and falls, are becoming far too common as the veterans community ages. As many of these accidents are preventable, will the minister take steps to address this problem and assist veterans and war widows to improve their health and quality of life?",69
94,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wide Bay for his interest in the veteran community. Accidents-particularly as the member for Wide Bay highlighted-bums and falls, poor nutrition and medication misuse do cause pain and suffering to our veteran community and our war widows in this nation. They can often lead to a lengthy stay in hospital. Anecdotal evidence suggests that preventative care visits to the home of the elderly, incorporating education, advice and referral to health professionals, often lead to an improvement in the health, well-being and independence of the veterans and the elderly in our community. That is, of course, an absolute priority of this government. This government, and my portfolio in particular, will have an Australian first in this area. Incorporating research with the University of Newcastle, it will trial home based preventative care visits to the homes of veterans and war widows in metropolitan Australia and rural Australia in Queensland and New South Wales. The trial will involve approximately 1,500 veterans and war widows. I can advise the member for Wide Bay that these visits and trials are likely to include veterans and war widows in the cities of Maryborough and Hervey Bay, and in that lovely rural town, Gayndah, in his electorate. The trials, I must stress, are voluntary. That is extremely important because we will also be selecting nurses from within the community who are specially trained to visit the homes of veterans and war widows. This is extremely important because they will be able to identify, where necessary, where some of the ills which befall our veteran community are able to be prevented. It is much better to prevent an accident by taking preventative action rather than waiting for it to happen. This will create a stronger link between the doctor, the veteran and the community nurse. If we can prevent illness and injury to our veterans and war widows, we will make sure that they have better health and more independence. That is in the best interests of our veteran community. I will keep the House informed as to the results and the progress of the trials. World War II: Misappropriation of",69
95,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Recent evidence has shown that it was not only stolen Jewish gold that was misappropriated with the connivance of Swiss banks but also large amounts of money deposited in Swiss banks by the allies for prisoners of war was misappropriated by the Japanese and used in fact for their war effort. This money was deposited in the Swiss National Bank and with the connivance of the Yokohama Species Bank, now the Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank, was diverted to Japanese forces. Since it is likely that Australian money was involved in the ally deposits, does your government intend to pursue this matter and seek to recover this money? If not, why not?",70
96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will analyse the question. Merit Review Bodies: Amalgamation,70
97,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Is it correct, as reported by Michael Millett today's Sydney Morning Herald, that the government is looking at a radical proposal involving the amalgamation of a raft of merit review bodies including the Veterans' Review Board, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal?",70
98,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. It is in fact correct that the government is actively considering such an amalgamation. That amalgamation was recommended in the Better Decisions report of the Administrative Review Council. Cabinet has agreed in principle to amalgamate the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Veterans' Review Board, the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal into a single tribunal which would be called the Administrative Review Tribunal. The amalgamation contemplated would streamline administrative structures and enhance the operations of the tribunal system. It is envisaged that separate divisions of the proposed ART would develop and maintain flexible, cost effective and non-legalistic procedures relevant to their jurisdictions. An Money interdepartmental committee comprising senior Commonwealth officers will devise a strategy for implementing the amalgamation. The basis and scope of administrative review designed to reduce the number of applications, the overall costs of merits review and excessive legalism will also be looked at. Detailed implementation of the recommendations for improvements to process and procedures of merits review tribunals contained in the Better Decisions report will also be considered. Work for the Dole",70
99,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I seek clarification of an aspect of the work for the dole bill and refer the Prime Minister to his minister's second reading speech yesterday when introducing the bill. Is it a fact that the wage rates for hours worked under the work for the dole scheme will be at the training award wage rate but that there will be no requirement for 20 per cent of the time to be spent in strucin tured training? Does this not mean that workers will be required to work 100 per cent of the time but be paid only 80 per cent of the award rate?,70
100,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The purpose of the government's work for the dole scheme is to provide for the target group, which initially and overwhelmingly will be between the ages of 18 and 24, the opportunity to acquire some work skills in circumstances where nobody can possibly allege that those people are being exploited. I want to make it very clear that there is nothing in the legislation which in any way gives rise to charges, either direct or implied, that people are being exploited. The principle is that people are going to be properly remunerated for the time that they spend on the job. I regard that as being a proper working out of the principle of mutual obligation. The principle of mutual obligation is that we look after people who cannot get a job and it is only fair and reasonable that they do something in return. Literacy Testing",70
101,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I draw the minister's attention to an article in today's Australian in which Frank Devine says, 'We need standardised testing if we are to end illiteracy.' I ask the minister: what is the progress to date of the implementation of national standardised testing for literacy? Is the minister aware of teacher opposition to the literacy testing program? Can the minister advise the reasoning behind the introduction of a national literacy test?",71
102,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. No-one in the parliament, I venture to say, has done more to draw attention to the literacy needs of young people than the member for La Trobe.",71
103,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He chaired the committee.,71
104,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He chairs the House standing committee. Indeed, he is one of the authors of the minority report, brought down by that committee some four years ago, which drew attention to the need to test all young people in the early years of schooling in order to establish their literacy needs. The historic agreement that I was able to reach with the states and territories last for a national literacy and numeracy plan which specifically addresses the needs of young people in the early years of schooling can in many ways be seen as a culmination of the work that the member for La Trobe has been engaged in. I am ready before this House to acknowledge my indebtedness to him for his work. A very key part of this plan is that all students should be tested against national standards or national benchmarks. We will know for the first time whether or not the policies that have been put in place to teach young people to read and write are in fact working and we will know where the greatest progress is being made in the states and territories around this country. I have to say that it was deeply disappointing to read the remarks of the federal president of the Australian Education Union, who described this decision, which has been hailed, I think it is fair to say, around the country, as 'one of the most disappointing decisions ever for quality education'. The Australian Education Union is, of course, the body which gave the Labor Party its education policy. It is because the Labor Party has followed the dictates of the Australian Education Union and the teacher unions for 13 years that we have the current situation where 30 per cent of 14-year-olds cannot read properly. We have seen the opposition of the unions to the learning assessment program in Victoria, which has the overwhelming support of parents. We have seen the continuing opposition of the unions to testing in New South Wales, where the situation is in fact very little better than in Victoria and where the union has banned the basic skills tests. This government is committed to providing Australian parents with the information they need to determine whether their children are gaining successful education and building up the skills that they need for life. It does teachers no service, it does parents no service and it certainly does children no service for the education unions of this country to stick their heads in the sand and try to keep parents Friday and the community in the dark about the performance of Australia's schools. Unemployment",71
105,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, yesterday you quoted from my speech at the National Press Club on 14 August 1991, so you will not mind my quoting from a press conference you gave just six days earlier when you said: It is my opinion that we will never in my lifetime ... go below an unemployment level of five per cent. Prime Minister, do you stand by your statement that a five per cent unemployment rate will not be achieved in your lifetime?",71
106,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have no reason to doubt fOf a moment the veracity of what I said then. Let me repeat what I have said repeatedly since I became the Prime Minister of Australia. That is, I will do all in my power to implement policies to reduce the level of unemployment in this country, but I am not going to hitch myself to a particular target as Prime Minister. I have said that repeatedly, and I repeat it again. I want to make it very plain on behalf of the government that we are absolutely committed to policies that will bring down unemployment, but we are not going to get ourselves attached to a target. While on the subject of employment, the member for Hotham invites me, because he goes back a littleMr Crean-No, you went back.",72
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you went back first, so I am going to go back again. Perhaps the member for Hotham will remember giving an ABC interview on 4 February 1992 after the closure of a car plant which was located in the electorate of Hotham. He gave this interview on 4 February 1992. So in the context of the member for Hotham seeking my views on jobs, let me remind the House what the member for Hotham had to say, and it sits rather at odds with the crocodile tears he and his colleagues have been shedding in recent times about manufacturing industry in Australia. This is what he had to say: Now, the Button car plan has done that for the automotive industry. This is what he said to say: It was always recognised that there were going to be job losses. That is what he said. When he was a minister in the government, he was saying, 'You've got to have job losses,' and now he is taking every little debating point he can. He said: It was always recognised that there were going to be job losses. Whether it's closure of plants or job restructuring, there have been significant job losses in the automotive industry and that has been accepted as a necessary part of making the industry competitive.",72
108,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, which goes to relevance. Is it relevant for the Prime Minister to point these out in relation to the question that was asked of him and not mention the fact that that same Button car plan produced a 400 per cent increase in exports?",72
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, we are not going to debate the issue. There is no point of order. Resume your seat.",72
110,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-It gets even better. On the World Today on 28 February 1991, this is what he had to say, and this is a real peader: I think that many in the media do not appreciate it that all tariffs did was to make us look inward. All the tariffs did was to protect local production. There was no basis upon which there was intemational competition to drive innovation. The absolute core of the interview was when the interviewer said: So you and Paul Keating are now at one on the direction of industry policy? And he replied, 'Yep.' So, can I say that over the last few days the Labor Party have been desperately trying to de-Keatingise themselves. They have been trying to get rid of the ghost and here we have the arch hypocrite of the lot because he said 'Yep,' when asked, 'So you and Paul Keating are now at one on the direction of industry policy?' I do not think the workers in the car industry in South Australia take any notice of you. You promised you would not privatise the Commonwealth Bank, and you did. You promised you would not privatise Qantas, and you did. You are promising something on manufacturing industry, and they are not even listening. Traineeships and Apprenticeships",72
111,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. The minister would be aware of the employment needs of Melbourne's outer eastern suburbs and that the decision to locate a one-stop apprenticeship shop in Ringwood has been well received. Can the minister inform the people in my electorate of Deakin how the implementation of one-stop shops is progressing and what effect they will have on the availability of traineeships and apprenticeships?",72
112,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question and I acknowledge his very strong commitment to the young people in his electorate. The government is streamlining arrangements for apprenticeships and traineeships, and one of the most important initiatives in this regard has been the establishment of one-stop apprenticeship and traineeship shops. Agreement has been reached by the government with all the states and territories to establish 18 demonstration projects which will combine Commonwealth and state entry level training functions. Three projects have already commenced-in Cairns, in the Australian Capital Territory, and in Launceston-and the rest will be opening over the next month. I hope that I will be able to be present in the member's electorate to assist in opening the one-stop shop in his electorate. There will be four such shops in New South Wales, four in Victoria, three in Queensland, two in Western Australia, two in South Australia, two in Tasmania and one in the Australian Capital Territory. These shops are part of a very substantial simplification of the training system which the government is putting in place. This has been necessary because of the extremely complex and bureaucratic nature of the system under the Labor Party. What we tragically saw under the previous government was an emphasis on short-term training programs which did not lead on to real jobs and the lowest number of apprentices and trainees as a proportion of the work force for three decades. This government is determined to revive the apprenticeship system, to produce quality training for young Australians, and this initiative is a very important step in this direction. Automotive Industry",73
113,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen reports of yesterday's speech by South Australian Premier, John Olsen? Does he agree with the Premier's view that: If the Productivity Commission's program were accepted by Canberra the local automotive industry would not survive. And another quote: And I doubt the federal Liberal government would survive being the executioner of our automotive industry. Prime Minister, will you be the executioner, or will you back Labor's plan to export Australia's cars rather than Australian jobs?",73
114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Which Labor plan? The plan you had when you were in government or the plan you have when you are in opposition? Your problem on this-and it is your leader's problem on this and it is the problem that all of you have-is that the people who deserted you in March of last year deserted you because they no longer believed you. And they did not believe you because you promised things and then ratted on them after you got re-elected. You promised the Australian people that you would not privatise Qantas. You promised the Australian people that you would not privatise the Commonwealth Bank. Your former leader wrote a letter to the members of the Bank Employees Union promising across his heart and on a stack of bibles that you would not privatise the Commonwealth Bank-and what did you do when got re-elected? You privatised the Commonwealth Bank. And it is burnt across the brain of every defected Labor supporter who voted for us in March that you were a group of people that could no longer be trusted. Can I make it very clear to the House and to the people who are employed in the motor manufacturing industry in Australia that I have said repeatedly that this government remains strongly committed to the maintenance of a motor vehicle manufacturing industry in Australia. As to the response that we deliver to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission, I might gently point out to everybody who comments on this issue that we do not have the final recommendations of the Productivity Commission yet and, until we have the final recommendations of the Productivity Commission, we will not be amusing ourselves with the little games that are being played opposite. That is all you can do-you can play little games on this subject. When we get the report of the Productivity Commission, we will take a decision that is in the interests of all of Australian people. We will naturally have regard to the interests of people who work in the motor manufacturing industry. We will not gloat about the impact of change, as you did when you were in government. We will not treat people as commodities to be shifted around, as you did when you were in governmentOpposition members-Oh!",73
115,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, you express indignation. Have you forgotten what happened to manufacturing employment when you ran Australia? Have you forgotten that in 13 years you drove unemployment to a post-Depression high? Have you forgotten that it went over 11 per cent? Have you forgotten the devastation that your policies and those of Joan Kirner and John Bannon and Brian Burke caused to the economy not only of Australia but to the economies of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia? You come into this House now and parade yourselves as the born-again believers in the battlers of Australia. The truth is that you ratted on them, you deserted them, and that is why they threw you out. Workplace Relations Act",74
116,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education-excuse me-the Minister for Industrial Relations. Minister, you will recall participating a recent workplace relations seminar in my electorate hosted by the Peninsula T AFE and the Monash University's Key Centre for Industrial Relations. What is the government doing to inform employees and employers of the new opportunities for better pay for better work, enhanced productivity and for improving the balance between work and home responsibilities under the Workplace Relations Act?",74
117,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I am not sure whether I am elated or insulted-and that is no disrespect to my colleague the member for Goldstein. In fact, there is a lot of activity that the government is involved in in telling people about the Workplace Relations Act and the opportunities it provides to both employers and employees. The member for Dunkley and I were the both at a seminar the other day, and there were a lot of people there-a lot of small business people. I know that the member himself is getting out and about in the community. He is fighting for small business people; he is getting the message out to people about the opportunities, particularly for small business, because we see tremendous opportunities for small business in this. The government is doing its bit. The Australian workplace agreement being an individual agreement that you can have at work without a union and without the commission, which is fair to employees and good for business, is an historic change which we are keen to see. We have opened the Office of the Employment Advocate in the last week or so. There are advertisements in the national press. Mr Bevis-For the whole state.",74
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Brisbane.,74
119,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a hotline you can ring to obtain the information kit. That information kit contains information for employees and information for employers. There has been a huge response to it, Prime Minister. Within the first few hours we had 500 requests for the kit and I think as of the last couple of days we have had 2,600 requests. We have even had one of the opposition in member's staff ring for a copy of the kit. So the employer organisations are backing up what we are doing. They are working hard with seminars. The National Farmers Federation is working hard. We have had some very interesting reports of people who are keen to take up the option of AW As and we are encouraging them. The Office of the Employment Advocate is slowly building up its numbers. It is there to help people and to provide people with this opportunity. Lastly, it is not only the member for Dunkley who is doing a great job but also other members. I was in the electorate of the member for Makin the other day. There is a lot of interest in it. I was with the member for Griffith the other day. He is pushing hard. We are looking forward to a good year of providing a lot of opportunities for small business to create jobs. Tariffs: Ministerial Comments",74
120,Mr MOSSFIELD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen reports that South Australian Ministers MCLachlan and Downer refuse to state their view on car tariffs because it would breach cabinet solidarity, but that two other ministers, Hill and Vanstone, have put their position on the record? Have Ministers Hill and Vanstone breached cabinet solidarity by going public with their opposition to further cuts in car tariffs? If not, why won't you also let Ministers Downer and MCLachlan spell out their position?",75
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer is yes, I have seen reports. Like many of the reports in this area, they are bizarre and inaccurate. Can I say that I have total confidence in all of the ministers. I take the opportunity of recording the fact that, since the colonies of Australia federated in 1901, we have the largest representation from South Australia in the federal cabinet since Federation. I pay tribute to the outstanding work of those four members of my cabinet. I am proud to have all of them as colleagues; they are all doing a great job. Nuclear Reactor: Location",75
122,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to reports that the government intends to build a new international airport at Holsworthy with the consequent need to close the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. Will you now rule out the construction of any nuclear facilityincluding a reprocessing plant-at Jervis Bay? Will you give a commitment to this House that any decision to build a new reactor on an alternative site will only be taken after extensive public consultation as to the need for a reactor, possible alternative methods for the production of radioisotopes and the proposed site itself?",75
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I correct the first part of the honourable member's question, if I heard it correctly, and that is that we have decided to build another airport at Holsworthy. We have not taken any decision. We are waiting on the results of the EIS on that. So don't try to slide a little misrepresentation into your question. So far as Jervis Bay is concerned, it is my understanding that it has already been ruled out on umpteen occasions, but I do so again. As to the rest of the question, I think the government's position was eloquently and effectively stated by my colleague the minister for science when he answered a question on this matter a few weeks ago. I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",75
124,Mr MCMULLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Canberra) (2.56 p.m.)I seek leave to make a personal explanation.,75
125,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,75
126,Mr MCMULLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do, Mr Speaker.",75
127,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Proceed.,75
128,Mr MCMULLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Today in question time the Treasurer (Mr Costello), in response to what you correctly pointed out was probably a disorderly interjection of mine, suggested that I was-by interjecting--criticising or deploring the improvement in the Australian economy reflected in the skill vacancy survey. What in fact I was pointing out was that the survey which he was applauding in March 1997 has merely reached the same level at which it stood in March 1996. The survey at March 1996 stood at 155 and at March 1997 it also stands at 155. NA Parliamentary Administration Mr LEO MCLEA Y- Mr Speaker, I have a question for you. Earlier this week you announced that you would be tabling a report on the proposed amalgamations of the parliamentary departments. Could you advise the House when you intend tabling that report, as this session is fast coming to a close?",75
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Watson. I know this is likely to be a consuming passion for many of us over the coming months. Some of our discussions continue. I did say that I would distribute the report shortly. That remains in place, and I fully expect that it will be distributed before the House rises next week. NA National Crime Authority Committee Report: Government Response Motion (by Mr Reith)-by leaveproposed: That the House take note of the following paper: National Crime Authority-Parliamentary Joint Committee-Report-Organised criminal paedophile activity, November 1995-Government response. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA Unemployment",75
130,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to make real progress in solving Australia's worse problem: the unacceptably high level of unemployment at 8.8 per cent and its serious impact of metropolitan and regional Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",76
131,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The question before the House today goes to one of the most important issues that Australia as a nation has to come to terms with at the moment, and that is the question of unemployment-a question that is worrying both metropolitan and regional Australia. As has become the case with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when questioned about these matters during question time, he now seeks, rather than to answer the questions going to the deteriorating employment situa-tion in Australia, to deliver little homilies from the dispatch box. It is that type of approach that he took in response to a question that I raised in the House on 10 October last year. It went to the deterioration in the employment situation. It was last October that the Prime Minister yet again gave me one of his little homilies. In essence, he effectively told me to sit down because he does not like to be questioned about the issue of jobs. He told me that I shouldn't dare ask him a question about the most important issue facing Australia today: jobs and the rising job queues. I know that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) also likes to run away from this important issue. Instead of answering questions about the issue of employment he comes up with policies on the run that will not deliver any real opportunities to reduce the deteriorating situation of employment in Australia at the moment. He also told me to wait 12 months before I asked him a question about the job queues. The simple answer to the Prime Minister today is: time's up. Yes, time's up. We are 12 months into a three-year parliament. One-third of this parliament's term has now gone. Do you know what the real problem for the Prime Minister and the Howard government is? It is not just the Australian Labor Party raising these concerns any more: it is the people in the outfield, the people in metropolitan Australia, the people in regional Australia. The mob that he likes to refer to from time to time: the people who go to the cricket games, the people who go to the netball, the people who go to the football. Unfortunately, people in every suburb of Australia today know someone who is unemployed. People who are part of families in Australia today unfortunately know of a family member who is unemployed. That is the mob, that the Prime Minister likes to refer from time to time, which is concerned at the moment. Yes, time is up. The Howard government has had 12 long months-one-third of a normal parliamentary term-to start achieving on the jobs front, to do something about the critical issue of creating real jobs in Australia. But the problem for the Howard government and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training is that the ledger shows no results at all. I think the Australian community has a right to expect some results. I'll tell you why the Australian community has a right to expect some results. The Prime Minister, just 12 months ago, went all around Australia. The truth is that the community was listening at the time of the Prime Minister's speeches because there was in the minds of the Australian community a need to try something new. Our leader said, in the wind-up of parliament last year, that the Australian community was willing to try something new. They acknowledged the progress and the great change that occurred over 13 years for the betterment of Australia. They also acknowledged that significant progress had been made on the jobs front. The Prime Minister was, in essence, elected on the promise of creating real jobs. That is what his promise was to the Australian community. He said to all those who would listen, 'I will create real jobs.' He talked about the question of job security and promised to resolve the issue of youth unemployment. He told Australians at large that was what he was concerned about. He said he was going to find jobs for our young people. He was going to find jobs for the people in remote and regional Australi-. He was going to find jobs for one of the real problems on the unemployment front at the moment-middle-aged men. He was going to find jobs for all sections of Australian society. He wanted Australians to believe that he was Mr Real Jobs. In a National Press Club speech on the eve of the last election, this is what Mr Real Jobs said to the Australian community and to all the media assembled: We have gone into this election campaign committing ourselves above all other things to do something effective . . . to reduce the level unemployment. That is what the Prime Minister- Mr Real Jobs-said. He then went on to say: I will be a very disappointed man if I have not made very serious inroads into the level of youth unemployment in this country because I would like to see our performance in that area as being the mark of what we have been able to do.as a government. Interesting words, interesting promises. The Australian community, 12 months into the life of this parliament, expects some results. That is why the Australian community is saying today in very harsh terms to the Prime Minister that time is up. What is the score? Have you got any runs on the cricket board? Out there in ordinary voter land, out there amongst the battlers, the young and the families, the score looks pretty bad and it is looking worse month by month as we go into the life of this parliament. This government is pretty good about chasing the headlines. But when it comes to issues of substance, actually trying to put in place practical programs that are going to produce results and assist in creating opportunities in industry, attract investment and get Australians back to work, it is an abysmal failure. As an alternative, we are not talking about real jobs in the parliament this afternoon. In a range of questions put to the Prime Minister today, we had an opportunity to see what his real program is to create real jobs in Australia. What did he talk about? I'll tell you what: he is pretty good on the headlines but awful on the issue of substance. All he could refer to was a pilot work for the dole project or, more recently, what we had floated in the newspapers of Monday last week-boot camps. That is what we have resorted toboot camps. Even the Australian military forces, which have been known to be pretty supportive of governments in the past and to be disciplined with respect to public comment, were forced to say in fairly stark terms to the Prime Minister, 'We are pretty tolerant of your action on a lot of activities, but, I'll tell you of youth what, we can't wear boot camps.' They rejected it out of hand. When you consider the results, you have to come to some conclusions. Let us take the issue of youth unemployment. The truth of the matter is-the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training knows this-that the youth figures have not moved down one iota in 12 months. In reality, more importantly, they are slipping up and up-they have now reached 28 per cent. Well might the minister hang his head in shame. Then we go to the question of long-term unemployment. We slashed labour market expenditure with respect to these desperate cases. We are no longer concerned as a nation in investing public resources in getting those people back to employment. What is the scoreboard on the long-term unemployment front, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) reminded the Prime Minister today? Long-term unemployment is at a 17-month high. That is the result that the Prime Minister thinks his government ought to be proud of. There are an incredible 14,200 more people on the long-term unemployment queue as a result of one month's performance-the last month's performance of the Howard government. The Howard government slashed what I thought was a pretty good investment. It was about Australia as a nation saying to all of us, 'If you are unfortunate enough to lose a job, then we are prepared to invest in your future because we are not prepared to tolerate a situation by which there are some Australians who have got jobs, and a significant group of other Australians who do not have that second opportunity, that hope for the future-the long-term unemployed.' They slashed labour market expenditure last May. I know they like to doctor the figures about the performance of Working Nation, but the facts speak for themselves on that front-especially the facts that came out of the mouth of the minister for education at the Senate estimates hearings in recent times. More than 40,000 people have joined the long-term unemployment queue since last May. Then we go to the issue of regional Australia. This is where they have really achievedin regional Australia! Youth unemployment has gone up. Long-term unemployment has gone up by 40,000 in less than 12 months. What is the story in regional Australia? I know they are not interested in regional Australia. We no longer have a minister for regional Australia. We have got a minister for unemployment, who is sitting in the House today, but we do not have a minister for regional Australia. What are the results? Sixteen per cent of those on the New South Wales north coast are jobless. That figure was 11.8 per cent when we lost government. We found a job up there recently for one of their mates, Doug Anthony, but we cannot find jobs for the unemployed on the north coast of New South Wales. Let's go to Bendigo and Ballarat. There is a big black hole in Bendigo, where they promised an art gallery that would have assisted in creating jobs. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) is absent from the chamber at the moment, as is the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). Perhaps they are out looking for the black hole. In the Bendigo area unemployment is at 10.4 per cent. In the Ballarat area it has jumped not by half a per cent in a month but from 8.3 per cent to 10.3 per cent. If I were either the member for Ballarat or the member for Bendigo, I would be looking for that black hole very quickly. There is a stark reminder in the city of Bendigo about the importance of job creation and Working Nation. There is a stark reminder in the city of Ballarat about the importance of industry policy and making sure that we protect decent industries that create real jobs, such as the textile clothing and footwear industry and the vehicle industry. Then we go to South Australia-another state that depends on a decent industry policy. In regional South Australia in just one month we lost 1,000 jobs. In the New South Wales central west 4,600 were thrown onto the jobless queues. I could go on but, unfortunately, time does not permit me to do so this afternoon. That takes me to the real solutions offered by the Howard government. What do we get? Work for the dole, with discounted wages on the training wage proposal that was producing the results. It was the member for Goldstein himself-the minister responsible-who admitted in the House yesterday afternoon that it was not going to produce a real job, that it really would not seriously assist in reducing youth unemployment in Australia. I suppose he is now going to suggest that it is not even a labour market program. Unfortunately, the Australian community might see it as being fairly popular at the moment, but I suggest to you that 10,000 places, 70 pilot programs, will not really assist in reducing youth unemployment in Australia. The Australian public are now starting to see what is really behind this proposal. Before the election they did not support work for the dole. A couple of weeks ago when we had to hide Senator Woods the government announced it, and it was just for young people. As we questioned them in question time it went from being for 20-year-olds to being for 25-year-olds, and now we have ended up with an open ended scheme. I suppose that is what happens when you are more concerned about creating jobs for Senator Short or Doug Anthony, or even Peter Nixon. What is Peter Nixon's real job? It is investigating the economic situation in Tasmania and how they might create jobs. Unemployment in Tasmania is pretty bad, so that is why we have got to try to create an impression that we are creating real jobs, full-time jobs. So what do we see in the media today? We are going to redefine full-time work. I think we did pretty good as a Labor government. We have got a terrific record employment, with the creation of real partafter time jobs and real full-time jobs. Importantly, that created great opportunities for women, but now we are going to try to distort the situation by the redefinition of part-time full-time work. The facts will speak for themselves. This government has failed. The Australian community does not feel secure as a result the election of the Howard government. are tense and scared. They are tense and scared as unemployment numbers go up and their jobs are placed at risk. I suggest to the Howard government that the time has come to change its budget strategies for the sake all Australians. Promises were made and promises are being broken. Do not let Ausprevious tralia down on the most important issue at the momtmt. All Australians are entitled to a job. It does not matter whether it is a time or a full-time job. Do not seek to create a hoax by now redefining the issue of partthat time as against full-time jobs.. Invest in Australia, invest in labour market programs and invest in industry policy. (Time expired) years.",76
132,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Goldstein-Minister for . Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (3.14 p.m.)- Mr Deputy Speaker, unemployment is certainly one of Australia's greatest social problems. It is probably the single most damaging legacy of the previous government. The previous government showed itself absolutely unable to address the problem and to provide Australians with real jobs. It spent taxpayers' money, money earned by the hard work of the working families of this country, and it spent that money like water in an attempt to solve the problem through government schemes, mickey mouse training schemes and by churning the long-term unemployed through these schemes to redefine them as short-term unemployed. It tried every stratagem in the book but it was unable to make any significant progress whatever. In the last six years of the Labor government's administration, the net additional full time jobs that it created numbered 7,100. And the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) on has the effrontery to get up in this House, 13 years of atrocious policy failure, to criticise this government for not solving, in 12 months, the problem that they left. At no stage throughout those 13 years did the Labor and government attempt to address the fundamental reasons for unemployment in this country. I will go through those fundamental reasons one by one and look at Labor's failure on of each one. They were full of rhetoric then; They they are full of rhetoric now. The fact is that there has been job creation since the last election. In fact, employment in Australia now is the highest it has ever been. of There are more people in jobs now in this country than there have ever been at any time in Australia's history. We do not claim that that is good enough. We do not real go around the country trumpeting that fact partand pretending that somehow or other that solves the unemployment problem; we know there are fundamental issues that need to be addressed, that are being addressed by this government, that were not addressed for 13 Firstly, policies need to be put in place that will encourage Australians to save and invest in job creation. No government in Australia's history did more to destroy savings than the Labor government. Over the last six years they accumulated something like $70 billion worth of deficits: $70 billion they did not have, they spent. And did that produce jobs? Did that produce a prosperous economy? Did that revive small business? Did it bump up investment? No, of course it did not. It destroyed jobs because it pushed up interest rates to some of the highest real interest rates in the world. They drove small business bankruptcies to record levels. They imposed on small business industrial relations laws which absolutely bound and tied the enterprises of this country so they could not invest and have confidence in employing people. They put in place an unfair dismissals law that discouraged small businesses from taking on full-time employees. They thought they could solve unemployment by spending, but they could not. In that respect, of course, they were being absolutely true to Labor Party tradition, because that is exactly what Labor has always done. It is what they did under Whitlam; it is what they did under Hawke; it is what they did under Keating, and it is what they still want to do because they will not face up to the fact that, unless you create an environment in which small business is willing to create jobs, you will not solve the unemployment problem. I will digress a moment to say that last week I had the honour of speaking on behalf of, and to acknowledge the achievements of, Bert Kelly, the former member for Wakefield. Bert was known in this House for his wit in puncturing the pretensions of the hypocrites on the other side of the House. On one occasion he asked this question of Jim Cairns as Treasurer: Last week the Treasurer told us about his policy of using deficit financing to lower the present level unemployment. How is this solution of burying unemployment under a mountain of money actually working out? Bert Kelly wondered: If printing money is a good solution for the unemployment problem, why not print more of the stuff and get rid of the unemployment problem altogether? Kelly recalled this-and it is from his book, One More Nail, at page 188: And Jim Cairns, with his kind heart brimming over with love and affection, just could not resist agreeing with me and replied that that was just what the government had in mind. And many keen political observers pinpoint the beginning of Cairns's decline from that point. Here are his successors-not one, but two of them-the two big spenders, the believers in deficit financing, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Batman. The member for Hotham is the person who probably spent more money on labour market programs than anyone-churning the unemployed through, trying to redefine them as short-term unemployed and not offering them any real jobs. No-one in this parliament has ever had so much experience in spending other people's money to achieve nothing as has the member for Hotham, the man who has pretensions to becoming the leader of the Labor Party. Sitting next to him is his clone, the member for Batman, who berates the government today for its failure to deal with this problem. The member for Batman has plans to spend even more money. He has plans to ensure that there will be absolutely unlimited access to the labour market services provided by government. That is why he criticises this government-because we are not planning to provide unlimited access to these services. The Labor Party in government-not even under the member for Hotham-did not provide unlimited access, but the member for Batman thinks that there should be unlimited access. He is prepared to spend not merely $2 billion but maybe $4 billion or $6 billion, and all of that money will come out of Australian small business. He is not going to get it all through the tax system but, to the extent that of he does, it will come out of the pockets of battling families. To the extent that he borrows to get it, it will push up interest rates and we will be back in that whole destructive cycle the Labor Party was responsible for that has left this country with the unemployment problem that it now has. These schemes that they put in place to address unemployment, because they had no way of creating real jobs, were tremendously destructive of the morale of those who went through them. Of course, the member for Hotham knows that very well because he attended, as I did, the Jobs for Young Australians conference in South Australia in August last year. There was one very clear message that was given by the hundreds of young people at that conference and that was, 'Stop putting us through Simon Crean's short-term training programs. We do not all want to be horticulturalists. We are not all interested in the history of dance in this country. We do not see careers in that. We want training that leads to real jobs.' That is our commitment, and that is why we have picked up that great historic program, the apprenticeship program, which Labor, at the behest of its union mates, did so little about. Of course, the member for Hotham and the member for Batman know all about that because they were the union mates. They have come out of the closet and they are sitting there now trying to sell us the same old snake oil medicine that the Australian people rejected at the election last year. They so despised the traditional apprenticeship system and did so little that in 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. We have put in place the foundations of a new national apprentice system which willMr Martin Ferguson-Which equals traineeships. Traineeships equals new apprenticeships.",79
133,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Which does not equal traineeships, although I fully recognise the fact that traineeships are an important thing this. You simply put in place, after 10 years, the beginnings of a trainees hip system and there were very, very few people in that system when you left office. You had 13 years to address this problem and you did not address it successfully. The new Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system will provide young people with quality training not just in the traditional trades but in a whole range of new industries: in communications, in information technology, in the finance industry. It will build up the status of traineeships and we, for the first time, will provide school students in the senior secondary years with the opportunity to move straight from school into those quality training opportunities. Indeed, under the reforms we are putting in place, they will be able to begin traineeships and apprenticeships in school. It will be a national system, with national qualifications, nationally recognisedMr Martin Ferguson-We started it.",81
134,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Which you never put in place-which will provide opportunities that young people in this country are looking for. One has to say that the member for Batman is probably-and I say this with full deference to the member for Hotham-the greatest snake oil salesman of them all, because if you asked him what his proposal is to provide jobs you come down to schemes like job sharing. Mr Martin Ferguson-And industry policy.",81
135,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Oh, and industry policy ! We can see the labels on the snake oil bottles along the Labor Party policy shelf there. Mr Martin Ferguson-Where do you stand on tariffs?",81
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)Order! The member for Batman has already had his say.,81
137,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He could take any of them off the shelf. But let us just have a look at what the Labor Party thought about job sharing in government in former years when we were in opposition. In December 1993 the discussion paper 'Restoring Full Employment' , commisin sioned and published by the Keating government, said that job sharing may, in some cases, increase employment in the short term but leads to a poorer long-term employment result, primarily because it lowers overall productivity levels and, therefore, per capita incomes. That was the conclusion of the policy analysts of the Labor Party when they were in government. They were not proposing job sharing at that time. The Sydney Morning Herald, on 6 February of this year, reported: The ALP's largest affiliate union, AMWU, has come out strongly against a proposal by the federal oppositionthat is by the member for Batman, the shadow minister for employmentto encourage job sharing, arguing: 'It will not support the sharing of poverty.' That, of course, is precisely what the member for Batman does support. That is what job sharing amounts to: the sharing of poverty. They have given up on creating real jobs. They have no idea how to create real jobs, so they say, 'Let us share around the jobs we have currently got; let us take away a third or a half of the jobs of people currently in employment and give them to somebody else.' It is the kind of nonsense that the Australian people hear from the Labor Party. Of course the reason they are hearing this nonsense is that there is no policy direction in the Labor Party. The Labor Party have no idea whatever where to go. They do not know what to do about work for the dole. They do not know what to do about employment. They are wandering around in the darkness clutching at anything, because in the end they have a leadership which has no purpose and direction. They have weak leadership. The only person who thinks there might be a job for himself out of that weak leadership is none other than the member for Hotham. Job sharing is something he is right into, and he would like to share 100 per cent of that job as soon as possible.",81
138,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Today we have finally revealed the solution of the Howard government to create real jobs: redefine them. It is to take part-timers and call them full-timers. Now we have a situation where so long as you work 20 hours a week you have a real job. What a sham. Where J.)es this come from? It comes from the master of obfuscation, the master doctorer. No wonder he has the title Dr Kemp-this Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training-because he doctors every figure going, and he is at it again. It is interesting that history has a way of repeating itself. In the back of my mind, there was this little recollection about the Fraser government years when they were having trouble with rising unemployment. What did they seek to do? Redefine the problem. Here we have, in the Melbourne Age of 11 September 1978, the heading 'Jobless figures can be what you make them'. The Canberra Times: 'Lies, damned lies and statistics: the conflict of figures on jobless.' This was Malcolm Fraser in 1978. Who was his adviser? Dr Kemp was the adviser. Here was this man in Malcolm Fraser's office, the arch idealogue of the Fraser government, the author of the reactionary right wing ideology of the Fraser government. This minister is a recycled man. This is the man who gave us all that talk about dole bludgers and vouchers; the speech writer who helped stigmatise the unemployed. This is the same man, recycled from 1977, back to his old tricks. Now he has modern equipment. He has the white-out. He has the tape to patch up figures to re-present them in different ways. He recycles the same tired slogans, the same divisive attacks on the unemployed. He is a master of right wing ideology, but the fact is he is a failure as a minister for employment. Not only is he a failure but the budget strategy is a failure. He has been parroting on about the jobs that have been created since their budget. Today we had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) come in and talk about employment-the first time he has actually come in and talked about employment in this Houseand he relied on the DEETY A leading indicator, because he said that it had finally turned up. It is true it has turned up, but it has only turned up to what we left them. This is the record that they would criticise us on. Now they are claiming credit for merely having achieved that which we put in place. To give some real impact of the budget strategy, let me just say this: since the last budget, job growth in this economy has been 6,000 a month; one-third of what Labor achieved. We have also seen a circumstance in which since the last budget they have lost 34,000 full-time jobs. No wonder he is redefining them. The only way they can get their commitment to any sort of job activity is to call 20 hours a full-time and real job. What a grubby little exercise coming from the master of obfuscation, the doctorer ics, the person who was driven by ideology but who has no commitment, no compassion and no intention of doing anything for the long-term unemployed. Mr Wilton interjecting",82
139,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The very program he gloats about and laughs about every time he says that we are spending $2 billion on the long term unemployed. We make no apology for that because it was a program that worked. What we have seen since you have been in office is 40,000 more long-term unemployed back on the dole queues. This is a great achievement, Minister, in the space of but 12 months. We all know this has always been your intention. The trouble is you just wanted to hide it from people. But we will not let you hide it, Minister. You have an obligation to stand up in this place, as a minister committed to getting unemployment down, and come up with real programs. I remember you saying that at least the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, said on the record at one stage that there was no intention of forcing mature age people-that is, those who are over 50-to do voluntary work to receive their benefit. That was a promise made with the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) at a meeting. What did we see in your legislation yesterday? No age limit. It is not just a question of forcing young people into boot camps; you are also forcing older people into meals on wheels. What sort of dignified approach is that? Also, your work for the dole is a part-time activity. At least this is consistent with your attempt to redefine the problem away. But why won't you give young people full-time activity? Why won't you give them real training? Why won't you involve the private sector in this activity, as the premier from Victoria has been suggesting you do? If this argument about work for the dole is worth doing, do it properly for God's sake! Young people deserve more, and so does everyone else in the work force looking to get back into employment. They are not getting economic activity from you and they are not of statist- getting any compassion. Green Corp was the other program that was much heralded to provide environmental action. It resulted in 2,000 jobs. Labor was creating 27,000 environment jobs a year, and this little grubby exercise comes up with 2,000 over three years. But it gets worse. Of the people who have been placed so far-only 254 of them-most of them were employed. This is their program for the unemployed. Give the programs to the employed! What foolishness are you carrying on with over there in the department? You cannot get away with simply continuing to doctor the figures. Let me come to the motor industry, because this is vital to employment prospects in both Victoria and South Australia. We have the circumstance in which this government will not stand up and be counted in backing the car industry. We have the situation in which we have ministers from South Australia prepared to come out and stick up for the car industry-that is, Ministers Hill and Vanstone-but not Minister Downer and Minister MCLachlan. Minister MCLachlan not only has difficulty spelling out the program for the car industry but, in his defence, also has difficulty spelling his own name. The Adelaide Advertiser of the other day had an article headed 'PM backs silent MPs on car industry'. I bet their electorate doesn't. There is also a picture here of the Bananas in Pyjamas twins. Bland B2 sitting over there, silent as ever, cannot even get their position up. Bland B2: the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and the member for Mayo (Mr Downer). We all kno- that the member for Mayo is very keen on these characters. He probably has copies of them in the doll's house on the family property. We know what the strategy for the car industry is by this government. The outcome of this cosy little dinner at Canberra's most exclusive club, the Commonwealth Club, was revealed to us a couple of weeks ago. John Moore actually stays there, so he did not have too far to go home. Minister Costello was able to get into the ministerial limousine. So they could indulge themselves a bit in the cigars and the cognac. There they were, late in the evening. John Moore said, 'Can you give us your vision for the car industry, Treasurer?' The Treasurer said, 'I have a vision for the car industry: it's to close the Mitsubishi plant in Adelaide. This country can't afford four car manufacturers. We should reduce it down to three.' The simple facts of the matter are that there is room for four car manufacturers in this country, only if you get the right policies in place. That is Labor's commitment. It is not just about freezing tariffs and it is not about winding back the clock; it is about giving them security. It is about ensuring that we help them to get into export markets, so we need to keep the export facilitation scheme. But, at the same time, we have an agreement from the industry that if we put in place this plan we will create 10,000 new jobs and we will double exports. For a government that said that it was trying to correct the current account and for a government that said it was trying to create jobs, why would it look this gift-horse in the mouth? Yet it does. It stands there dumbfounded. The only solution for the car industry in this country is for this government to get behind Labor's plan for the car industry. If they do, they will get real security in the work force. (Time expired) Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (3.39 p.m.)-Well, well, well. We have two ex-members of the ACTU standing up and trying to tell us how to run the government. The Labor Party-which embraced privatisation, embraced enterprise bargaining, embraced union power in the accord and sold out on tariffs-now expects their party faithful to come running back to them all of a sudden as new Labor. Well, they did not six months after the 3 March by-election in Lindsay. Now, 12 months after the by-election, I am sure we would get another five per cent increase in our vote. Labor is going absolutely nowhere. It has gone nowhere since the 1990 recession where we had 11.2 per cent of Australians unemployed, and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) professes concern. Oh, he is terribly worried. His heart is breaking for the battlers-for the people at the football. What about the battlers of Lindsay? What about the guys who had to sit there as Labor doled out a 40 per cent increase on sales tax, as they were strangled by the regulation that the Labor Party put on small business, as they suffered tax hike after tax hike, as they suffered ridiculously high interest rates and as the Labor government destroyed Commonwealth savings? In 1992 the Labor government spent $11 Yz billion more than they collected. In 1992-93 the budget figures show that they spent $17 billion more than they collected; in 1993-94, another $17 billion more than they collected; in 1994-95, another $13.2 billion more than they collected. Evidence that they were still on the same track-if the Liberal Party had not returned to government-is Beazley's black hole. The 1995-96 figures came up with a $10.3 billion deficit. How did the Labor Party pay for this-the party that stood for government enterprise, the party that stood for non-privatisation? They sold off Qantas, they sold off the uranium stockpile, they sold off ASTA, the sold off the FAC, CBA and ANL. There is not really much left for us to sell when it comes to fund the $5.6 billion deficit we are facing this year. The deficit is slowly coming down. We are slowly getting Commonwealth savings back into government in Australia. This government will slowly get money in the bank so that, if we do suffer a hiccup such as a recession, we do not have 11.2 per cent unemployed as we did in 1992. We will have savings. We can spend our way out of a recession. That is why Labor could do nothing about the deteriorating labour figures. Despite an economic upturn from December 1995 until March 1996, unemployment went from 8.1 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Australia was in a mess, and the country knew it. The numbers in parliament are proof of this. Those very same ex-ACTU members and exunion bosses, who sit there with their fancy deals and sell their members' interests out to big business to keep themselves a nice cushy job through the union movement into parliament, stand here today and betray the very people they were sent to represent. What happens? Those people tum to people like me-an ordinary Australian, a PA YE taxpayer-to come here and represent their interests, and, I tell you, they are very happy with what we are doing. Instead of coming up with a solution, Labor came up with NWOS, new work opportunity schemes. They cost $10,000 a head. They had a 21 per cent success rate, and the rest of it was wasted money. Do you know what the beautiful thing about that is? Those people did not count in the unemployment figures. Those people were· counted as training, so they were not unemployed. At the end of their LEAP project, new wave project or any of those other government sponsored programs, they went back into the short-term unemployed. Talk about fiddling the figures. If you are worried about how statistics lie, let us have look at what Labor were doing to the unemployed: they were not counting these figures in the unemployment statistics. They make wild allegations that our minister had anything to do with those figures in 1978. He was not even there. If you work for one hour a week, even if it is in a family business, then on the ABS statistics you come up as not unemployed. The distinction between employed and unemployed has not changed. The facts and figures we are talking about here are exactly the same, and the changes in the definition of part-time and full-time work have only occurred for administrative reasons in the employment placement enterprises. They will receive government sponsorship for their money, if the person they have placed has entered full time employment-defined as more than 20 hours a week for six months. I do not know why the ACTU is making such a big thing about this. It stands to reason that, if this enterprise has got these people into a joband let us define job-they should get paid for it. But the facts and figures that the ABS uses to come up with full-time and part-time statistics have not changed. There has been no diddling of the unemployment figures. We have crystallised the unemployment figures. We have not hidden them in programs; we have crystallised unemployment. If you are on the dole now, we know you are. We have a work for the dole scheme, you can join the army, you can do a whole bunch of things, but we recognise that you are unemployed. And we recognise that another of Labor's solutions-'give them a government job' - is not a solution. Under Labor, one out of every five jobs was in the state government, local councilor Commonwealth public services. Again, the people in the other four jobs had their hands heavily in their pockets to pay for the person in the fifth job. We have recognised that those are not real jobs. You cannot hide unemployment figures and stack the books that way. In the end, we have to pay for our public servants and, if there is no money, there is no money to do that. The other solution the opposition has come a up with is job sharing. Let us share a jobyou beauty! 'Wow, I can have a full-time job and bring things home for my kids and my family and my spouse, and we can go away on weekends, or I can have a part-time job.' What do you think workers want? They want full-time jobs. In the last 12 months we have crystallised unemployment and we have set some very strategic groundbreaking measures in place to get out of the rut and off the track to disaster that we were on on 3 March 1996. It has not been easy. It has been a long haul. We have not had much help from the opposition in the Senate. We have not been able to act quickly. Even so, we have balanced the budget. We are heading towards a target in 2000 where we will have government savings to help kick-start us out of recession. With that has come a certain amount of offshore confidence which has lowered interest rates. Do not underestimate what impact that has had-the flow-on effects are just coming now. We now have low inflation and we have flexible workplace relations, which only came in January. Given time, both of those will see an increase in jobs. We have also got individually tailored assistance for the unemployed: they can get the skills that they need and they are still recognised as unemployed and counted in the unemployment statistics. We are not fudging things here. This is a very open and transparent government, and we are not going to dress up any facts and figures for the public. They are entitled to be treated as adults and not as patronised children-as the opposition used to treat them prior to 3 March 1996. We have also spent an enormous amount of time reinvigorating small business and reducing red tape. We have a task force report coming in next week. We have got reduced provisional tax, the capital gains rollover relief and relief in sight for FBT. (Time expired)",83

NA SURCHARGE (ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 March, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Gareth Evans's moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for: (a) breaking solemn commitments made before the election not to raise the rate of existing taxes nor introduce new taxes; (b) attempting to deceive the Australian public by not admitting that this measure is a tax; (c) deliberately inflicting on the superannuation industry an impossibly cumbersome, inefficient and expensive collection method; (d) ensuring by that collection method that superannuation providers incur enormous administrative expenses which will in tum be borne by their members, the great majority of whom are low and middle income earners; (e) ensuring by that method, and in particular the requirements for notification of Tax File Numbers, that over one million Australians, the overwhelming majority being low and middle income earners, will become liable for the full 15 per cent tax; (t) creating major new compliance burdens for small business, at the same time that the Government has been promising to dramatically reduce red tape; and (2) urges the Government to withdraw and re-draft this legislative package, and re-introduce a new package that will meet the objective of imposing an additional 15 per cent tax on the superannuation contributions of higher income earners, without the adverse consequences identified here.",86
141,Mr BRADFORD,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"It is probably fair to concede that this collection of superannuation bills is controversial. I was interested to listen in the chamber last night to the shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), make his contribution to the debate. If you take out a lot of the words and the rhetoric that he threw in, and for which he is renowned, you will find that he actually made some rather interesting and, I might concede, telling points. There are some questions about this package of legislation which, it is a well-known fact, we on this side have been asking and which we have been concerned about. As I have said, if you take out some of the words of the shadow Treasurer's contribution, on balance you will find he made some debatable points. A lot of the difficult decisions that we on this side have had to make since coming to government have to be put in the context of the fiscal situation as we found it at that time. Of course, it would have been much easier to come to government with a clean slate and with the opportunity to not only do things which needed to be done but also continue those many programs which had some merit and were introduced by the previous government, which spent with impunity on so many programs for so long, and we are now bearing the cost of that. You could name lots of programs which had considerable merit, such as the Commonwealth Dental Service. We came into government with the enormous task of turning this country's finances around. That was a difficult task and it affected every portfolio area. I notice that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is in the House at the moment. His portfolio was particularly affected. But all areas were affected because of the need to get the fiscal position in order. In that context, we have been looking to raise revenue. I take it that the main thrust of this measure is to achieve that objective. I think there are some other arguments for it. Some of my colleagues-I note that not many will be speaking on this bill-will probably make some of those points. The measure is intended to raise something in the order of $450 million. From the government's budgetary point of view, it is a very important measure. I notice that the opposition is not intending to oppose the measure outright, although it has moved an amendment. If one looks at the amendment on a point by point basis, breaking through some of the rhetoric, one will find that it seeks to condemn the government for breaking solemn commitments, made before the election, not to raise the rate of existing taxes or introduce new ones. We did make that commitment and by and large we have maintained it in very difficult circumstances. We can deal with the semantics of this issue as to whether it is a surcharge or whether it is a tax, but in the end I do not think it is terribly productive to do that. In the context of the fiscal difficulties faced when we came to government, it is understandable that we had to take some steps. We could not do it with our hands entirely tied behind our backs. So this is one important measure which is intended to raise $450 million. We wanted to raise it in a way that was fair. It is reasonable to argue that this measure is essentially a fair measure. It is intended to impose an additional commitment on those who can afford to pay-essentially high income earners. Those earning $75,000 and above would be classed as high income earners. It has the virtue of equity, which is an important argument for taking this measure. The opposition amendment suggests that we are attempting to deceive the Australian public by not admitting that this measure is a tax. Once again, I say to the opposition that that is semantics. It is a pointless argument. I make the point again that, in the budgetary context, we have honoured our commitment, if not entirely to the letter then very substantially to the letter and in the spirit of the commitment that was made to the Australian people. I think that is widely recognised. The amendment makes the suggestionagain, it reflects the shadow Treasurer's garrulity-that the government is 'deliberately inflicting on the superannuation industry an impossibly cumbersome, inefficient and expensive collection method'. That may be so. Certainly, it has been a concern raised not only by the industry but by others. They have suggested that the administrative complexities will be enormous and pointed out that the costs will be directly or indirectly borne by all members of funds and their employers. They are saying that there is going to be an administrative expense involved-I have heard a figure of perhaps as much as $30 million-in collecting it. Perhaps there are other ways of collecting the surcharge but, on balance, in the discussions that we have had with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on this matter, this appears to be the best way to collect the levy. Any other way of collecting it would place a burden on a larger number of either individual taxpayers we or small businesses. In the end, it comes down to what the most effective way of collecting it is, and this appears to be the answer to that. Part (d) of their amendment restates that point, using a number of other adjectives and adverbs, and, as I say, in the shadow Treasurer's best style, and (e) and (f) do not contribute much to it. The important point is that the opposition recognises that this is an important revenue raising measure and ultimately, I think, recognises, as I understood what the shadow Treasurer was saying, that it had the merit of largely being imposed on high income earners. I suppose the point ought to be made that it has the virtue of impacting on members of parliament. I suppose, as far as the public at large is concerned, it is a considerable virtue. In fact, when you think about it, it is probably its most potent selling point. I do not think any amount of self-inflicted pain is likely to attract even the mildest applause from the public because there is a perception out there that our salaries and benefits are generous. I have sought, on occasions, to win an argument on that, but I have never been successful. I do not think even the most verbally dexterous member of this place could win an argument with anybody on that issue, so I will not even attempt to. The point should be made that, quite deliberately, all members of parliament will be affected by this legislation. We deliberately included ourselves in that. The Treasurer has made a point of ensuring that that fact is well known. The concern I have, which I ought to put on the record, is that we are not certain what the effect will be on us. In a sense, we are all signing a blank cheque here. I do not say that lightly but the complexity, which I concede is a factor, is making it very difficult for us to get an accurate determination of what the actual impact might be on members of parliament. It is likely to be substantial and it is certain that we will be paying at least our fair share, if not more, of the superannuation surcharge. I am, I think, able to say to the parliament that this, hopefully, will be the end of with superannuation for a number of years to come. I do not say that lightly because there have been a lot of changes in superannuation over the years. Over 13 years of the former government there were numerous changes and prior to the last election we had got to the point where people, if they had not lost confidence in superannuation, were fairly close to losing confidence in it and giving up on it simply because, even if it was a good investment-and it was and is, despite the surcharge, I believe-there is nevertheless an element of complexity about it and, dare I say, an element of a lack of trust, that it is seen as a milch cow and an easy target for governments of any complexion to seek to raise revenue from it. We are certainly not pre-empting any budgetary announcement here, but I believe I have detected in the Treasurer's comments on this subject some sort of commitment, which I hope will be put in cement at budget time, to let the superannuation scene settle down, let there be stability for the foreseeable future-and I am talking 10 or 20 years ahead-so that people can regain their confidence in superannuation, because it is so important. Since the 1970s, there has been a revolution in superannuation in Australia. Up until that time, superannuation was the province of a limited number of executives, mainly men I would say, and I suppose public servants, but from the early 1980s, when the extent of Australia's ageing population problem became apparent, superannuation has been encouraged as the principal means of saving for retirement. Many people have had the opportunity to do that. In the context of our ageing population, it needs to be pointed out that the prediction of the Bureau of Statistics is that our population of over 65s will increase from 2.1 million in 1993 to 5.1 million in the year 2035. That makes the point very clearly that not only is the Australian population ageing but it is ageing at an increasing rate, in fact, at a great rate. It accentuates the importance of making people aware of the fact that they will have fiddling to save for their own retirement. The other point in this context that needs to be understood is that people can expect to spend up to one-third of their lives in retirement and, very clearly, because of that long period in retirement-25 or even more years-it is a lot of years in which they will not be working when they will not be able to depend on the government to provide for that retirement. So once again, it accentuates the importance of people understanding that they will have to save for their own retirement and that superannuation has been and will continue to be the main avenue for that particular saving. I believe people must be weaned off-that is what it will require-an unrealistic expectation that somehow it will be okay when they retire, somehow the government will provide. The fact is that the government cannot provide and certainly, by that time, will not be able to provide full support for people in their retirement. If you do the maths of it-and I have not done that, but I can guess-there will just not be enough people in the work force able to pay enough tax to provide for the 5.1 million people by 2035 who will be over 65. It is going to be a mathematical impossibility. People must be encouraged to save. In saying that I mean that they must be encouraged to invest for their retirement and to use those savings for that purpose. That is a radical change. It is a change that has only dawned on us in the last five or 10 years. I think it was a change that the former government brought about. It brought us to that point although it was controversial and difficult. I notice the former Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), is in the House at the moment. Obviously he realised, as the government of the day did, that we had to get people to a point where they understood that they had to save for their and be prepared to use those savings to support themselves in retirement. We have also learnt to understand-the former government went well down that track and we are moving further down that trackthat middle class welfare is no longer an option. Ironically, we could not afford it before; we certainly cannot afford it now. People who can afford to save and invest for their retirement must be encouraged if not coerced into doing so. We now find ourselves in a situation where people are not just encouraged to have superannuation, but it is mandated. Whilst that was a controversial decision at the time-and I think in opposition there were a lot of aspects of that compulsion which a number of us in the coalition had some difficulty with-we now accept that it is a fact of life. I believe we are committed to the ongoing success that that system should have in getting people to contribute, although we recognised at the time that it was a very long-term project. Once we get to the year 2030-when I say 'we' I suppose I mean those who are still aroundthis will probably be looked at as the right thing to have done at the time. As the level of employer support grows from five per cent to I think it will be nine per cent in the year 2001 that system should really start to kick in and begin to be seen to be working. By June 1996 there were 140,000 superannuation entities operating in Australia. It is very substantial industry. Assets at March 1996 were $243.8 biIIion, which is around 60 per cent of our GDP. Perhaps now it has reached $260 billion. There are various estimates going around about what it might be by the year 2000, but it will certainly be a large amount of money compared with, say, 1983 when it only added up to $35 billion. Superannuation has been an attractive investment option up until now and it has contributed significantly to Australia's pool of savings. We need more savings in order to finance investment. We need investment if we are going to have the economic growth that is necessary to provide employment. That is an important component of the solution to the large and totally unacceptable levels of retirement unemployment that we still have. Superannuation is also needed to avoid any further movement into debt. We have a net national debt of over $200 biIIion and it seems that it is going to be very difficult to wind that back. If we in this country do not provide savings for investment purposes from our own sources then the only way we will be able to achieve those goals and create growth and employment is by borrowing from other people's savings. One of the real imperatives we have in government in this country is improving Australia's abysmal record of national savings, and superannuation is an important part of that. In summary, I concede-and I have been one who has at least been reasonably aware of what is going on in this very complex area that I think is a challenge for most members of parliament and certainly most members of the public to get their minds around-that these pieces of legislation are difficult and controversial. Some of the points made in the opposition's amendment, which seeks to take out some of the words, I think we would concede up to a point because of the fact that it is clearly not possible to deny, at least in some aspests, that there are some questions concerning the implementation of this legislation. I think there are some questions about how much money it will eventually raise, particularly if people lose confidence, as they have a done in recent years, about superannuation as an investment. I believe it is a good investment and, as I said earlier, in spite of the surcharge it will continue to be a very good investment. It is important that we now bed down the superannuation system, let people have confidence in it and stop making changes to it and then it will continue to be an important part of Australia's savings pool.",89
142,Mr WILLIS,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"I rise to support the second reading amendment to this superannuation contributions surcharge legislation moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). The professed aim of the bills now before the House is to improve the equity of the tax system in relation to superannuation. The source of the alleged inequity in the present system is that we have a system which essentially taxes at a flat rate and gives greater benefits to people on higher incomes. The bill proposes to redress that by proposing a surcharge or an additional tax, to give it its proper title, on people on higher incomes in respect of their superannuation. Let me say firstly that we do not oppose increasing the equity of the superannuation system. Clearly Labor in government demonstrated that amply because the system we inherited from the previous government when the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer was one which had virtually no tax on superannuation at all. The only tax on superannuation was the five per cent tax on the superannuation lump sum and you paid that at marginal tax rates. At 60c in the dollar, which was the top marginal tax rate in those days, you paid three per cent tax. That was John Howard's tax regime for superannuation-three per cent. We changed that in many respects. It was also, I must say, a system which was there mainly for higher income earners, because low income earners did not have superannuation. It was not something that was available to them, except for those who worked for governments. But for the ordinary, run-of-themill private sector employee, there was no such superannuation available-40 per cent of the population had superannuation, and most of them were higher income earners. So we did two things. We made superannuation generally available, which improved the equity because then everyone was entitled to superannuation. We did that through awards, the super guarantee system-the legislative approach-and then, of course, by changing the tax regime. The tax regime was eventually changed so that we had a 15 per cent tax on the contributions and a 15 per cent tax on the earnings on the fund. For lump sums, they were free of tax up to what is now $86Y2 thousand and then 15 per cent tax on the rest. For pensions, they were taxed at the marginal tax rate minus 15 per cent, reflecting the 15 per cent that had been paid at the contributions and earning stage. So the tax rate, if you took a lump sum, was between 15 per cent and 30 per cent compared to the three per cent under the now Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. For a pension, there was simply no concession. You paid tax effectively at your marginal tax rate. In relation to unfunded schemes, tax was only on the end benefits. For lump sums, it was 15 per cent on the front $86V2 thousand and then 30 per cent. For pensions, tax was at the marginal tax rate. So, again, the total tax rate was between 15 per cent and 30 per cent for the lump sums and no concessions on pensions. That is the system on which all of this is being added. In addition, we sought to limit the extent to which people could utilise the concessionality that was in the system through the introduction of RBLs-reasonable benefits limitswhich set limits on how much you could take as a lump sum and how much you could take in terms of the total package, including pensions. So it was not there for complete exploitation with people with very high incomes being able to milk this for all it was worth. So they were major steps towards improving the equity of the superannuation system, enormous steps compared to what was there before. Now everyone benefited from superannuation and the tax regime was far fairer. So we have very good credentials in that respect, but also we proposed to build on that through another system which was to provide for compulsory employee contributions, up to three per cent, from July 1999 and a matching means tested government co-contribution of up to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings for employees' contributions. This also applied to the selfemployed in respect of their undeducted contributions. So we had the second leg of the tax cuts being converted into a payment, a matching co-contribution, into superannuation payable only to low and middle income earners. The top income earners were not going to get a penny out of that, not a cent out of the second leg of the tax cuts because they had been means tested out of it. It was all going into private sector savings, through superannuation, matching contributions to low and middle income earners. So we were certainly going to add to the equity of the system in a very big way by that approach, an approach which I think has effectively now been abandoned. Of course, that would have boosted savings. Treasury estimated it would increase savings by one per cent of GDP by the year 2005 and 1.7 per cent by the year 2020, and of course it also considerably improved the equity of the system. Now we have a government adopting a different approach. I must say, we see considerable problems with the way the government proposes to increase equity in the legislation now before the House. Firstly, there is the suggestion of unconstitutionality by certainly an eminent person-Dennis Rose, the former Chief General Counsel to the Attorney-General. Whether he is right or not, I do not know. All I know is that there is certainly a substantial chance that there could be some unconstitutionality involved in the approach taken here. There is also, obviously, the problem with the states. I do not want to go into that in any further detail because it has been well covered by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. We also see considerable problems with the way the government proposes to increase equity, and some of them are directly related to the way the government has designed this measure to try to avoid the tax label. It is petrified of labelling the thing as a tax because it promised not to introduce any new taxes-and clearly this is a new tax, along with various other new taxes. It is trying desperately to dress it up as something other than a tax. This is a tax, quite clearly, and Dennis Rose said it clearly was. Although this tax is supposedly levied only on higher income earners, one of the really bad effects of this approach is that many lower income earners will be forced to pay the tax because, if they do not supply their tax file number to the super fund, which is to be reported to the tax office, they will pay the 15 per cent tax. It is highly likely that many low and middle income earners will not supply their tax file number to the fund. They will not do it because they do not understand the consequences of not doing so, or because they are lost members. Lost members can be as high as 20 per cent of members-that is, people that the fund has lost touch with. So they cannot notify them to say, 'If you don't give us the tax file number, we can't pass it on and you'll be liable to the tax.' They cannot even tell them that, and many of those they do tell are not really going to understand the implications. There will also, of course, be people who will have supplied the tax file number to their employer and think that that is adequate. So they have already given it to someone and think, 'Why can't the employer pass it on,' or think he is going to but, in fact, he cannot because of the privacy provisions around the tax file number. So, for various reasons, you are not going to get the tax file number passed on by many low and middle income earners who will, therefore, be subject to this tax. If only 10 per cent of them did not put in their tax file number, you would be looking at something like three-quarters of a million people who would be involved. The industry estimates about a million. Of course, they have some experience in this. They have been trying to get people to give them their tax file number. There has been a situation where there has not been the added incentive of a tax if you do not, but they have had very poor results-up to about 20 per cent at best, five per cent to 20 per cent of returns. So they are not getting the kind of return from their members that gives them any confidence at all that they will get everyone providing the tax file number. This is terribly important because this whole thing is supposed to be about equity but, if there are vast numbers of low income earners paying this tax, it is going to have very inequitable effects. All employees at whatever income level will be adversely affected by the cost of administration that this measure will foist on the super funds. Estimates of these costs are around $100 million in the first year and $30 million ongoing. It is a tremendously high administrative cost to raise around $500 million, which is the supposed revenue from the tax. And that does not include the ATO's admin costs, which are also going to be very high. Why are these costs so high? It is because the super funds have to gather and pass information to the tax office in respect of 16 million accounts, just so that 355,000 higher income earners can be subjected to the surcharge. What an incredibly crazy administrative approach. Sixteen million accounts have to be processed in order to tax 355,000 people. It is just absurd. And this is from a government which parades itself as being here to cut the costs of red tape for small business. The fact is that many small businesses wear the costs of their superannuation schemes and they cover those administrative costs themselves directly rather than putting them om the fund. And they will wear these costs and they are going to scream. They are going to say, 'How does this fit with your promise about cutting red tape by 50 per cent?' Through lack of time, I will not go through all of the ways in which the super funds bear these costs. But they are considerable administrative costs and they are going to have this ridiculous impact on the funds because what they do is reduce returns, therefore the fees are going to have to be higher. They are going to have to cover those higher costs by increased fees or reduced returns to members, and so you have an outcome where all members of superannuation funds, even if they all supply their tax file number, are going to be adversely affected, because they will wear those higher charges. Also, eligible termination payments-that is, golden handshakes, retirement bonuses, redundancy payments-will all be caught up in this tax net. Of course, with redundancy payments there is an allowance for the tax free area which is, I think, $4,348 plus $2,174 per year. But anything over that gets caught up in this net. Many employees who have been sacked and then get a redundancy pay are going to find that that additional redundancy pay takes them into the bracket of high income earners. Therefore, they will be subject to the surcharge; therefore, just at the time that they get sacked they get hit with an additional tax, and then of course they are facing unemployment. And then the government says, 'Hang on. Before you can claim any unemployment benefits, we are going to take your super benefits into account as well.' It is like a triple whammy-you got sacked, over you got hit with extra tax and then you got means tested on your superannuation. It seems as though there is a vendetta against these sorts of people. This is surely incredibly inequitable. There is also the fact that the transitional arrangements for golden handshakes last only five years, till 2001. After that, any golden handshake you get, which might be in respect of service that goes back 20 or 30 years before this legislation came into effect, gets taxed in full. It is real retrospective taxation. It is an outrage. Furthermore, the way in which this legislation proposes to deal with unfunded defined benefit schemes is absolutely bizarre. An unfunded scheme of course has no annual employer contribution to tax, so what this legislation proposes is that such funds should for each member maintain a surchargable debt account, which will be calculated each year by use of a notional surcharge contribution rate obtained from tables currently being prepared by the Institute of Actuaries and agreed by the Australian Government Actuary and the Australian Taxation Office. So the funds will be keeping these notional accounts-only notional accounts because there is no contribution while the person is actually in the fund-so they have the administrative expense of keeping that each year and putting an interest rate on it as well. And then they will inevitably find at the end of the day that it is not the right amount because the right amount can be determined only by the circumstances of the person when they retire. Whether it is voluntary or involuntary retirement, how long they have been in the system and so on will change the type of benefit they take. So just why there is a need to keep these notional accounts is beyond me. Furthermore, these actuarial tables have not been prepared yet. So no-one in such a fund, which includes many public servants and members of parliament, knows what the impact of this legislation will be, as the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) said. And most importantly, the government does not know, but it is bringing legislation into this House, saying, 'We are going to impose a tax and we don't know what the impact is.' They cannot even tell us what the impact is on us-let alone tell anybody else outside in respect of these unfunded schemes. They simply do not know. So this is a bizarre state of affairs. What an incredibly poor legislative approach it is to bring in legislation when you have no idea what the impact is on those whom it is going to affect. In respect of the parliamentary super scheme, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) is saying. 'Well, this might have an impact of around 13 per cent, we think. But we don't really know.' But there are calculations being made in the industry which say that this impact could be more of the order of over 50 per cent reduction in the end benefit. That is before normal taxation cuts in. So those calculations are out there, and what is the government saying about that? What is it saying to the public servants about their unfunded scheme? It is simply incredible gall to bring in legislation not knowing what the impact will be. It is just incredible legislative laxity. It means the government does not know what it is doing, does not know what the revenue impacts are-because it cannot know them if it does not know what the impact will be on individuals-and it cannot say what the impact is on people whose lives are affected by this very legislation. This tax will also have the perverse effect of discouraging many people from putting their money into superannuation, as the member for MCPherson acknowledged, because they will see very little tax advantage. Indeed, there will be no tax advantage if they take a pension. That is because those subject to this new tax will be taxed at rates higher than the top marginal tax rate. For those with funded schemes, the contribution rate will now be 30 per cent, there will be an earnings tax rate of 15 per cent and a pension tax rate of the marginal tax rate minus 15 per cent. So if you are on 48V2 per cent, minus 15 means you are on 33V2 per cent, but you have already paid 30 per cent on the contribution rate and then you are paying 15 per cent on the earnings. So what was actually in the fund is taxed somewhere between 15 and 30 per cent but closer to 30 per cent, then you have 33 per cent on your pension, and you are paying something up towards a 63 per cent tax rate. That is the effective tax rate that is going to apply in these circumstances-way over 48V2 per cent, the top marginal tax rate. For those with unfunded schemes, pensions will be reduced by this tax on retirement by the application of the 15 per cent surcharge and will then be subject to full marginal tax rate. Although the pension itself will be reduced at the outset by a process that I do not have time to go into, it will then be subject to the full marginal tax rate. But the full effect of that is that it is being taxed at way over the top marginal tax rate, at around 63 per cent. If you are going to be taxed above the marginal tax rate, where is the concessionality? Who in their right mind will take a pension? If you are going to get taxed at 63 per cent, why would you take a pension if you can avoid it? As for lump sums-those in funded schemes-there will be 30 per cent tax rate on the contribution, 15 per cent on the earnings, a tax-free lump sum of up to $83,000 plus 15 per cent thereafter, which means that the tax will be at 45 per cent for amounts over $83,000. That is close to the top marginal tax rate-still some concessionality but not much. So people, after they get over the $83,000, will not see much value in staying in these schemes. For pensions, people will not see any value because they are going to be taxed at the full marginal rate. So why bother being in them? We now have a situation where we have great incentives to get out of superannuation. We are seeing such articles as 'Get out super'. The message that the Institute of (Time expired) Chartered Accountants is having its member accountants tell their clients is that they should choose other investments over superthe annuation in the near future. I expect that be a very wide reaction-which, of course, raises the question about the revenue. If they do get the money, it is much more likely that the money will come not from the high income earners it is proposed to tax but from the people who are the unintended quences of the surcharge-the collaterally damaged lower-middle income earners who are going to have to wear the impact through not supplying their tax file numbers. Of course, the better approach to have taken would have been to pursue what the Labor government had announced in its 1995 budgcredit. et, and that was to greatly improve the equity of the tax system in the way that earlier. That would have certainly meant that we would have had an administratively simple scheme. The government, of course, could right now that it is going to pursue that scheme. It certainly said at the election it would, except that it maintained the right vary the mechanism. But in fact the government has destroyed the whole way in which that scheme could have worked by taking superannuation out of awards. So the whole process of requiring employees to make contributions cannot be maintained now because superannuation will not be an award condition in a couple of years time. Clearly, the government has in mind, in case, using the second leg of the tax cuts not how to read. as matching co-contributions for employee contributions but by setting up some mediummembers term savings vehicle which is not going to superannuation at all. That will be less equiwill table, because it will be utilised mainly by higher income earners who have the savings rather than by lower income earners who are unlikely to put their money into such a vehicle in very large numbers. So equity is not going to be improved by that process. With the process that we have here in this legislation, we have an administrative shambles of the first order which is going to be very inequitable, largely because of the of approach taken-but not just because of it.",93
143,Mr MCDOUGALL,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Griffith) (4.34 p.m.)I listened last night to the shadow Treasurer, Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr will Gareth Evans), and in his typical fashion he trotted out the tired old story: it is not a surcharge; it is a tax. He then went on to a technical explanation that I am sure he did not understand himself. It was all meant in typical Labor fashion to scare and frighten the consecommunity-typical Labor tactics. I can imagine the next bit will be direct mail letters being sent out to everybody in the community with misguided information which will continue to frighten people. Any further comment to the shadow Treasurer's contribution would be giving him, I believe, too much This is obviously the way that the opposition is trying to object but not vote I mentioned against the legislation. What did Labor do in their 13 years with superannuation legislation? The member for say Gellibrand (Mr Willis) mentioned a few things a while ago which I will come back to. that What Labor did was make it more complito cated by continually adding to the complexity. Mr WiIlis-This is less complicated?",97
144,Mr MCDOUGALL,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"No. I will come back to the member for Gellibrand. They are the ones who have already burdened the industry and individual superannuation contributors with legislation that I can say the majority of the legal profession in this country-who look any at this in a special way-do not even know Many times I have had discussions with of legal profession who have said, be 'Here are three passages. You read them, I read them, and between us we reckon we might be able to work out what it means.' But at the end of the day they say, 'No, it is too difficult.' That is Labor's legacy. The member for Gellibrand referred to prior to 13 years ago and talked about the five per cent that was paid on lump sums and the benefits that accrued to people who invested in superannuation. Prior to 13 years ago, the former Liberal government offered incentives such as tax deductions for contributions made by an employee, and the member for Gellibrand referred to that as being not equitable. The Labor Party comes to power 13 years ago and takes over what was a very simple and very positive system and gave people a great incentive to invest-and what do they do? They foul it up. They totally rewrite the act in a way that nobody understood, and they write it under the guise of a superannuation guarantee levy. Even they found another word for a tax: they called it a levy. But that is part of all politicians: they will all find another word. What did they do by doing that? They destroyed what had been a very good system. I heard the member for Gellibrand comment that it really wasn't such a good system because it didn't apply to low income earners, that it only really applied to high income earners and people in government employment. I went into superannuation earning $7,000 a year-I would call that a fairly low income-in 1964 as an employee in the corporate sector and I have never been out of it since. Many thousands of other people in this country also have been in superannuation systems. I acknowledge that one of the great tragedies in this country was that most superannuation in the early years was not offered to women. That was something that I certainly would not blame the Labor Party for and I don't think they would blame the Liberal Party for it. It was a problem of our society and culture of the day. That has been rectified and that is a very positive thing. The question we should be asking about this surcharge bill is: whom does it affect? We continue to hear all these wild stories. Whenever you cut into the hip pocket nerve, the reaction is fierce and discussion is usually driven by emotion. I too have been listening to the financial planners who tell me the administration costs will be formidable. I have had constituents of all shades of the political spectrum tell me they will look at other ways to invest their funds. Then there are members of my electorate who are fair game to the opposition when it starts its campaign to discredit government policies. These are the people who have been led to believe this surcharge will mean they lose all or most of their savings. This could not be further from the truth. I come back to a comment made by the member for Gellibrand that 15 per cent was going to be payable by low income earners because they will not pass on their tax file numbers. All I will say to that is that memthe bers of the opposition and all members of the government through their connections with the community at all levels should be ensuring that that information is got out. It is an affront for the member for Gellibrand to infer that they will not get around to it and that it is going to be a problem. If we and the funds and the superannuation managers all do our jobs properly, it can be done. The only people who will be charged this levy on their superannuation, other than those the member for Gellibrand has no confidence in, are those with an income of $70,000 and beyond. It must be clearly said and repeated that it starts at one per cent at $70,000 and does not reach 15 per cent until $85,000 and beyond. We should continue to say that. Don't just refer to it as 15 per cent from $70,000 because that is what we continue to hear and it is not accurate. I also doubt if enough people realise that, for a PA YE taxpayer, this surcharge is only payable on the tax deductible component. Let's tell all the facts. Whose is the tax deductible component? If it had been prior to 13 years ago, it would have also included the employee's contribution. But the Labor Party got rid of that. Now it is on the employer's contribution, not the employee's contribution. This is the amount that the employer contributes. For the self-employed the surcharge is only deductible on the component of their personal contributions. We have heard from the funds and some of the financial world that the surcharge is going to cost millions of dollars-we have heard all sorts of millions. I say to that: rubbish. Noone is denying that it won't cost some money. But what the financial advisers and fund managers are not pointing out is that the surcharge will be collected in the same manner as that already in place for collecting their existing 15 per cent tax on superannuation funds. Some adjustment may need to take place but a mechanism is already there. All they have to do is adjust their software programs. The major burden of collection falls on the Australian Taxation Office. For the financial planners, who have established wide-ranging self-managed fund programs, very little change needs to be made to their current administration system. Let's be honest. Have a talk to them. Ask them what has happened to the administration of their funds over the last 13 years and they will tell you very loud and clear. The many administrative charges and compliances on them are some of the reasons that the difficulties already exist. Let's take a self-employed person whom this is going to affect. The member for Gellibrand made quite great play that the person who was self-employed and running their own managed funds through a financial adviser was going to be greatly affected. Let's take someone at 50 years of age who draws from his business $30,000 a year. I will ask anybody to deny in this place that the majority of people who are in their own business, and who operate a self-funded system, draw much more than that-and we all know thatbecause they minimise legitimately and correctly what they have to pay in taxation. The same person at the end of that year throws $50,000 into their superannuation kitty, and they can do that every year. Of that $50,000, $38,000 would be a deductible contribution. If you add that $38,000 to the $30,000, you come up with $68,000. That is $2,000 under the threshold of $70,000. Where are they going to pay their one per cent up to 15 per cent on that? Let us not run away from the fact and deny that those sorts of schemes exist legally and exist right around this country. What we are saying here is that the person who contributes to his or her own superannuation can take the $30,000 a year in salary, pay their income tax on that, place another $50,000 a year into the super fund, and they still pay no surcharge. It has no impact on the PAYE earner who takes home under $70,000 a year. I think we have got to keep being reminded of that. I understand full well why the surcharge is unpalatable to many people. Any impact on earnings, savings or investment income is uncomfortable. But, if we are asking everyone in the community to tighten their belts, to help us get out from under the crushing national debt that was left to us by the previous government, why should those who enjoy incomes over $70,000 a year be exempt from making their contribution? Those who are complaining the loudest and the longest are doing so through their financial advisers. I wonder whether some of those individuals would cry as loudly and as long if they understood the full story rather than the sanitised version that they get from their financial advisers. These advisers have let us know in no uncertain terms that they will discourage their members to continue with current superannuation and will encourage them to find alternative means of investment and tax minimisation. The member for Gellibrand made that comment. This comes as no surprise, and it should not come as any surprise. That is the business of the fund managers and the accountants. That is what they have been doing for their clients for years. That is how they earn their money. I question how many in this self-employed bracket actually meet the $70,000 level. I would say that not too many declare $70,000 a year as a cash income. I am certain that, as I said before, most have already effectively reduced their income to well below that figure. The important thing here is that, contrary to what the member for Gellibrand says, low income earners and PAYE taxpayers earning under $70,000 will not be affected. I call upon the member for Gellibrand and all the other members in the opposition to be honest and to do their job and to ensure, through their communications, that they get people tv file their tax file numbers. During the last decade we have seen the widening gap between the rich and the poor in this country, mainly brought about by the last 10 years of economic management. We have seen what was once a solid middle-class society being reduced today to the haves and the have nots. We have seen the PAYE worker pay his and her due amount of tax. As I said earlier, we have seen working women fiI'.ally benefit from superannuation-a form of saving that had been denied to them for far too long. Now, to protect the workers, to protect the savings of those who cannot adopt the tax minimisation schemes, to protect those who cannot afford financial managers to establish trust funds and self-managed funds, we are looking to build equity. Until we do this, all of Australia will continue to suffer financially and therefore socially. I am not the only member of this House who has called for simplification of our superannuation system or, should I say, multitude of systems. I will continue to agitate for review and for simplification. But I believe that at this time in history we have to face the fact that we are broke-more than broke-and that we are deeply in debt. That debt has been left to us by our predecessors. However unpalatable it may seem, we must make serious inroads into that debt before we can ever hope to generate the concessions to reduce levies and charges that we would all like people to receive. Today it is a case of those who can afford to pay must pay, and that includes all members of this House and the other House.",97
145,Mr ROCHER,SUPERANNUA TION CONTRIBUTIONS,"On 3 November 1996 the Sunday Age carried a story with the headline 'The news on supernot all bad'. I think that is at best an arguable summation of the superannuation bills before the House. While there are a number of issues in these amendments causing concern amongst superannuation fund members and institutions, superannuation remains a worthwhile investment vehicle in Australia. That said, I, like many other members, have reservations about the new tax-and let us be frank: the government is merely dabbling in semantics in calling the impost a surcharge rather than a tax. I am concerned about the impact the additional impost may have on national savings. I am equally concerned that the tax could adversely affect people not originally intended to be caught in its web. It is questionable whether this proposed impost passes the three criteria of a good tax, that is, a tax delivering equity, efficiency and simplicity. Australians are not good savers, and many tax experts fear that the additional tax on superannuation will further erode our alarmingly low level of national savings. Home ownership is still the preferred savings option of most Australians, and experts agree that superannuation will not be used more than necessary unless people are confident that governments will keep their fingers out of a very tempting cookie jar. It is likely that many Australians will be swayed to divert part of their moneys into higher risk investments as a result of this impost. The introduction of the surcharge will almost certainly see a movement of moneys away from super funds and into equities and negative gearing-this at a time when they should be encouraged to provide for themselves in their twilight years. A recent article in the Australian Financial Review reported that chartered accountants are advising up to 60 per cent of their clients to avoid this new tax by moving out of superannuation. Mr David Brown, the superannuation spokesman for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, ICA, signalled that as many as 60,000 people would be advised to consider shares, equities or negatively geared property as an alternative to superannuation. Mr Brown emphasised that this figure of 60,000 was a conservative estimate. The superannuation tax is meant to apply to only 300,000 high income earners nationwide and is reckoned to generate $500 million in additional revenue for the government. If Mr Brown's figure is accurate, then one-fifth of those who are being targeted by the impost will tailor their investments to avoid paying it. The government is relying on this revenue to help balance its books in the future. Its gung-ho attitude will certainly see a further blow-out in the national deficit if it does not review the administration of the super tax. As I suggested earlier, the new impost fails all three tests of a 'good', or at least a palatable, tax. Some may argue in favour of the additional tax on the grounds of equity, claiming that those who will be hit by the tax are those who can afford to pay it. This was the argument presented by the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, in an article in the Australian Financial Review on 25 September 1996. He said then that in introducing the surcharge the government was acknowledging that concessional superannuation arrangements benefited higher income earners to a much great extent than lower income earners. However, the Taxation Institute of Australia, the TIA, makes the point in its submission on the super tax that the cost of collecting the impost from high income earners will be spread across all members of funds. Fund members could therefore be forgiven for feeling duped by the government, given the former Assistant Treasurer's commitment in October last year that with the introduction of the impost 'there will be certainly no imposition on fund contributors' . One tax expert likened this tax slug to the introduction of the fringe benefits tax in 1986 by the then Labor government. While the FBT was sold to the Australian people as a cost to employers, it is in reality a cost on employees. In this case, the cost of the new super tax will almost certainly impact on pretty well all fund members even though it is aimed at fund managers. While the proposed tax may only apply to those with an income above prescribed levels, the cost of its collection will be borne in part by those members of a fund who are not paying and who may never be likely to pay the surcharge. There is also the potential for serious inequities between protected and private super funds under the current legislation. To date, no-one on the government benches has explained how the government proposes to levy the super charge against a constitutionally protected fund. As the law currently stands it cannot. This paves the way for significant discrepancies between the treatment of protected and unprotected funds. That can hardly be described as fair. On 29 September 1996 the Australian newspaper suggested that 'the lack of equity is the most damaging aspect of the surcharge'. But I submit that the issues of simplicity and efficiency in the collection of the surcharge are of equal importance. The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody, has described the proposed method of collection of the surcharge as 'an administrative nightmare'. When one considers the administration of the surcharge and the compliance costs associated with the additional 15 per cent tax rate that will be created, this description appears more than warranted. On 27 September last year the Australian discussed the 'massive deadweight cost' that will be created through compliance with the surcharge and indicated that much of the $500 million additional revenue will be 'swallowed' in compliance costs-well, if not quite swallowed perhaps more than matched by the costs of compliance. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has branded the method of collection as 'extraordinarily expensive and cumbersome' and has suggested that this method is being pursued in an attempt to avoid the surcharge looking like what it really is-a tax increase.  Association of Superannuation Funds Australia, ASFA, is also critical of the proposed method of collecting the surcharge. One would have to agree that these people represent a fair cross-section of the financial fraternity. Surely the coalition, which has made such a fanfare about its commitment to a more open, consultative and accountable government, cannot ignore those concerns. Several alternative methods of collecting the surcharge, including the P AYE system, have been proposed. A Queensland actuarial firm, Buck Consultants, suggested that tax deductible contributions to superannuation be reduced to produce the same net savings that the surcharge is supposed to generate. The ICA has also supported the collection of the impost on the basis that taxpayers return their contributions with their personal tax return, which are subject to assessment. The ICA asserts that this would be a much simpler and less costly method of recovering the surcharge. The Taxation Institute of Australia proffered several methods of collecting the levy which would allow the government to achieve the same policy and revenue outcomes by other means more efficiently. One suggestion is to collect the surcharge directly from the individual member or allow the member to deduct the tax amount from his or her superannuation account on the provision of adequate documentation to the fund. Mr David Connolly, a former parliamentary colleague of ours, outlined a fourth option in the November 1996 edition of Personal Investment. In his article, Mr Connolly referred to the government's promised review of the mechanism for delivering the l-a-w tax cuts as a matching contribution on the proposed compUlsory superannuation contribution up to three per cent of income. He predicted that the coalition will announce in its May 1997 budget that it will not proceed with Paul Keating's policy of introducing a compulsory levy to achieve the employee contribution, after receiving advice that that may be unconstitutional. Mr Connolly suggested that the Howard government is likely instead to introduce a voluntary scheme which will attract a government co-contribution. He says: The question of how the co-contribution should be paid and to whom, has created the opportunity for the government to review the front-end taxation of superannuation and trade off the co-payment for 15 per cent tax on employer contributions. Mr David Connolly points out that this option would be revenue neutral because the tax on the surcharge on higher incomes could continue at the present 15 per cent rate and would not need to be increased to 30 per cent as proposed. He went on to say: People on incomes below $70,000 would in effect pay no tax on employer contributions, and the government could still meet its budget objective making the superannuation tax system more equitable at no cost to revenue. Surely it would be in everyone's interest to simplify and combine these changes. Surely indeed. Both the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Taxation Institute of Australia have expressed concern about the privacy issues involved with the supply of the tax file numbers-the 1FNs-to trustees. In the words of the institute: The current surcharge proposal provides the potential for breaches of privacy in a number of fundamental ways ... Privacy concerns involve an important policy decision about whether funds should be held responsible for the security of information which was once solely within the domain of the ATO/taxpayer relationship. The general consensus among tax professionals is that they would like to see the government agree to a cooling off period until further consultation with industry occurs. By way of example, I refer to an article which appeared in the Herald-Sun in October last year. It discussed the possibility of new self-funded retirees copping the surcharge if they choose to take a lump sum from their super, which pushes them above the $70,000 threshold for that particular year. These are not high income earners. They are people who have opted to provide for themselves in retirement. It is absolutely necessary that the government define clearly all the elements constituting annual income before this bill is passed by this parliament. Although the surcharge has reduced the advantages of superannuation, it remains an effective tax savings option for many. But, as the superannuation spokesman for the Institute of Chartered Accountants has made clear, the impost has 'exacerbated the the uncertainty in the super area ... additionally, it will eat into the benefits provided by membership of superannuation'. Ms Susan Ryan, a former colleague, echoed this sentiment when she said: It would be a great irony ... if the government allowed the garnering of additional revenue to achieve its deficit reduction target to destroy the long-term savings policy of the nation and jeopardise our retirement incomes policy. of Earlier this year, I received a facsimile from a respected actuary practising in the field in Western Australia. This professional woman advised me that her company had collected information on the number of changes to the rules governing superannuation since 1 July 1994. She observed that since July 1994 there have been legislative changes, or insurance and superannuation commi ssion releases, affecting the operation of superannuation funds once every 6.5 days. That actuary said: This is a frightening statistic rate need for some stability in the system. She suggested that: Everyone working in the industry accepts that there are aspects of the existing system which still need to be improved. This needs to be done gradually to rebuild after the uncertainty and distrust caused by this incredible pace of change. The government has stated that this super tax will target a relatively small number of taxpayers, but many financial advisers point out that there is no longer any confidence in the community that others will not be targeted in the future. Only two weeks ago, the Retirement Savings Account Bill was debated in this place. The government introduced that measure to encourage domestic savings by offering a wider choice of savings options to the Australian people. A fortnight later, we are debating legislation that is likely to dissuade saving because of the uncertainty the super tax has created. Little consideration has been given in this debate to the impact that the super tax will have on the small business sector. Chartered accountant Mr Graham Connolly, not to be confused with Mr David Connolly, argued a very good case in a letter to the Australian Financial Review on 17 March this year. He questioned why small business owners were to be 'penalised' by the impost when they take reduced salaries, reinvest profits and generate employment. Mr Connolly points out that it is only in their later years that these proprietors have adequate funds to set aside and provide for their retirement. These people who constitute the engine room of the Australian economy will be hard hit by the super tax. Mr Connolly's argument is supported by Hughes Fincher Services Pty Ltd, chartered accountants. I received a letter from them dated 4 March. The author said: Small business will be badly affected (by the surcharge). For years small business people take big risks struggling to make reasonable incomes. When they do, those incomes are often limited to only a five to ten year period. For the few years they can contribute to superannuation in a meaningful way, they will be penalised by high taxes on and shows the despe- that saving. This is how the small business community is to be rewarded for its efforts by a supposedly sympathetic government. There is another aspect of this debate that has been conspicuous by its absence. It relates to the application of the surcharge to the proceeds of the sale of a small business where the proceeds are converted into an approved superannuation fund. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that that is a promise of the government, although it has not legislated to that effect yet. I do not recall anyone calling on the government to make it clear whether the impost will apply in that particular instance and, if so, the date it becomes effective. The proposed legislation suggests that the super tax will be applied to the proceeds of the sale of a small business if it exceeds the threshold amount. No wonder the government has studiously avoided any debate about that so far. I invite the Treasurer (Mr Costello), when he responds in the second reading debate, to come clean and advise the House on the effective commencement date and whether the super tax will apply in that particular instance. In the meantime, I oppose these measures in their present form. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (5.10 p.m.)-The people of Lindsay love this measure. They think it is fantastic. It means that $500 million of revenue does not have to come out of their pockets. It does not come out in sales tax, which is the way that Keating raised an extra 40 per cent off the people of Lindsay. When the battlers in Lindsay go to the supermarket and spend their hard earned cash, they are paying sales tax. This measure means that they do not have to pay it in their income tax, capital gains tax, provisional tax or fringe benefits tax. Finally, the people of Lindsay, whose average income is around $40,000, or probably more likely $35,000, do not get to pay. They think that is pretty good. People living in Lindsay on $L 5,000 who have to contribute are a bit too red faced to complain about it. The people of Lindsay are doing it really hard. We can sit here in Canberra and have a really good time in very flash surroundings. The capital of the nation caused the recession, but the people in Lindsay wore the recession. They are pretty pleased that the government is finally spreading the burden evenly. It is not the unions and the leaders of the ACTU doing deals with big business. As you have seen, numerous members of the opposition have stood up and fought for the funds. I wonder what sort of party contributions they are getting. They are standing up for these big funds managers, saying, 'Woe is me. We'll have a terrible time administering this tax, not to mention the 10 people we just replaced with computer technology.' Are you telling me they do not have the technology and the information systems to deal with this tax, that they are going to be so stingy about things that they are not even going to put in a bit extra, quite negligibly, out of their massive profits? These are funds that you have to contribute to. Wouldn't the people of Lindsay love to have that job. They would say, 'You have to come and buy from me. What a great job. What a great industry. You have to pay. They've got a guaranteed source of income.' Those opposite have the gall to whinge and say, 'Oh, our costs are going up. We'll have to pass them on.' I tell you that the people of Lindsay, contrary to the statements of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), do not know a whole bunch about the share market. They do not know a whole bunch about negative gearing. They do not know a whole bunch about those complex things. This is the reason they pay a fund to do that for them. They expect certain increases, certain guarantees and a certain percentage increase in income from the funds. That is what funds are paid to do, and they do it very well. These funds have access to the latest program on the market, Wizard, which is guaranteed to get you gains in the share market between 14 per cent and 15 per cent. Another program came on the market recently. For about $2,000 you can get gains in the share market-guarantee 14 per cent since December 1995. These funds have access to those sort of resources. They are actually, once they get these contributions, making money. The member for Curtin is exactly right. In contributing to a fund, an 18 per cent tax haven is available, not to mention what the funds are going to earn for you. If the funds are not doing that-if they want to talk down their own product and think that they are so lousy about it-then good. The people of Lindsay will go shopping. We will find another fund. We will find someone who is going to give us that 18 per cent tax haven, and more, on our input. If you decide not to contribute to super and you pay your 48 per cent to the government and try to find a better return than 18 per cent plus on your money, I do not think you will be able to. Superannuation is still an immensely attractive option. It is still thepremier option to take advantage of. A lot has been said about small business owners. To answer the member for Curtin: no, the incentive does not apply to the rollover nor to superannuation of $500,000 by small businesses. That has been made clear. The only people who really seem to be affected by this are judges and politicians. And, boy, aren't they all terribly cranky on the other side. Politicians are going to be affected. The members on this side of the House are quite prepared to wear that. If the people of Lindsay have to wear it, we will. If the members of the opposition want to get up here and come out with mumbo-jumbo and support the superannuation funds and the judges and then say, 'Look at that-we benefit too,' it shows that they have no idea why they lost government on 2 March and the by-election on 19 October. It is quite clear to me. This is fair. Saving measures were implemented right around Australia in the last budget. Money was taken from all departments. That was spread right across the board evenly--<:hild care, aged, R&D, the Public Service, Medicare, you name it. In this instance, all we are asking is that the funds pay their fair share. If they want to use their clout and their lobby group and say, 'We are going to make it hideously expensive and pass it on to contributors,' woe betide them. Because, if they want to talk down their own product, no one is going to lose from it except them. There is a lot mentioned about the constitutional challenge to the act. It is said that you cannot get the funds to pay the fund members' surcharge. The opponents to this bill are relying on section 51, subsection (xxxi) of the constitution to do that. That section basically says that the Commonwealth may acquire: . . . property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws They are hanging their hat on that clause, saying that, according to that clause, you are taking money away from the funds without just compensation. It is their money! It is not the funds' money; it is the employers' contribution on the employees' contribution to a superannuation fund which has a responsibility to make a decent profit on those contributions so that people can rely on a lump sum or pension benefit to take them out of dependence on the government in their twilight years. The people of Lindsay do not want to be dependent on the government. We are as keen to save as the next person. We will do the right thing. By 2030, we will have five million people over 60 and things will be looking pretty grim for the younger generation who will have to fund these people. Before I came to parliament, I had never been into a nursing home. All my grandparents were dead before I was five and, moving in the circles I did, which were from my own age-group, I had not had a huge amount to do with older people. My first experience of a nursing home was an eye-opener. You are looking at quite an expensive industry in terms of the enormous amount of care and the workers per aged person needed in these homes. Running a nursing home is a big effort and a very expensive task. We are going to have fewer people wanting to work in that industrybecause it is very specialised and personality specific-and a greater number of people relying on it. People are going to have to take responsibility now for their aged life and fund that themselves. All we are doing is encouraging that process and saying, 'That is fair.' Thanks to the previous government, it is terribly complex to administer, and we should not be hampered in our wish to make these changes simply because it was already complex. The funds which are crying foul about the complexity now probably should have done so earlier. We should not be worried about making the measures we want to make because what has gone before us makes it so complex. Those complexities were already in the system . We are asking for a minor adjustment-the collection of tax file numbers. Again there was a big cry from the opponents of this bill, saying, 'But 20 per cent of the members are lost and the fund is no longer in contact with them.' It has been estimated that there are billions of dollars swanning around unaccounted for in the slush funds of these superannuation funds. No one is making a claim on them. What happens to those funds and the interest on them? What are these fund managers doing? It is almost a genuine requirement that we say, 'Collect tax file numbers. It is better for you if you collect everyone's tax file number because, the next time that tax file number comes through, that person can be found, and you will not have lost 20 per cent of your members.' There is also a terrific incentive now for people to give their tax file numbers to superannuation funds. If they do not, and they earn over $85,000, their employer contributions are going to be taxed at 15 per cent. They will be anyway, but if they eam less than that and do not give their tax file number over, they are going to be taxed at that rate. So there is a terrific incentive there for people who are forward thinking. I do not think it is valid to patronise people and say, 'They will not be aware of it,' 'They do not know about it' and 'Things will not happen.' Most people change jobs every six to seven years, and when they do they tend to change superannuation funds. People are aware of their superannuation funds. They are monitoring them. They are getting monthly or yearly statements from them and are keeping track of how much they are going to be worth on retirement. Everyone is aware of savings. I do not see it as being the problem. If it is, then this government will fix it. We are not inflexible on things. The member for Curtin came up with numerous other avenues, ideas and ways for saving. But who is to say that they would not have similar problems? Who gave them the right to stand up and say absolutely that this is how it should be done? The point is that, whatever change is made, it is going to carry with it certain discomforts. It is going to step outside someone's comfort zone. If it puts someone outside their comfort zones, well, I am terribly sorry, but it is all about progress and the progress of the nation. And go forward we will. The administrative costs should be able to be kept fairly minimal given the high technology and the software available to the funds. It is the industry that is complaining. It is fat cats at the top who are complaining. You really do not hear the average person on the streets in Lindsay coming up and saying, 'Listen, Jackie, about that superannuation bill-' It does not affect them. Yet we have seen incredible lobby power. It is wrong that they should misuse their lobbying ability and come to government with such a mealy-mouthed, stingy appeal and say that they should be exempt in some way from contributing to the almost $10 billion hole that has been left by Labor. All of us have put our hands in our pockets. It is about time that the super funds contributed as well. We have had some advice on the constitutional challenge that is proposed. There are ways to reorganise the act, such as deleting section 34 and making various changes to the regulations of the superannuation supervisory act. That would get us around a lot of the legal technicalities that the super funds use to find a loophole to get out of their obligations. They can try to loop through loopholes as much as they like, but we will make the effort and we have the willpower to carry through with this legislation. I do not see why the opposition are trying to score brownie points on a bill that they will be supporting. I do not see why they should still be trying to score points in that fashion. They must support it because it is fair. It is as fair as our work for the dole scheme. They came out and opposed that scheme but then realised, 'Hang on a minute, the average person on the street likes it. They think it is fair.' All of a sudden we saw a backflip and they said, 'We will go back and reconsider that and we will change our position to reflect something that is fair.' Again, they recognise that this is fair. They support it on one side but then flip flop to the other side. 'Hang on, let us put up a weather balloon and see which way the public opinion is flowing and we will jump on that bandwagon.' We on this side of the House have a vision to get Australia out of debt, to have some solid government savings by the year 2000 and to put Australia back in the black. We are the well on the way to achieving that vision. This bill will playa substantial part in doing that. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA",100

147,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claimed credit for improvements under his government in the conduct of question time. He claimed, with complete justification, that question time was no longer the farce that it undoubtedly became under his predecessor. Although debatable, the Prime Minister also seemed to imply that what now prevails in this place is the epitome of parliamentary reform. In returning to a time honoured approach to question time prior to the aberration created by Mr Keating, I put it to the House that it hardly constitutes reform. It is the only one that goes any way towards improving the relevance of members in the conduct of proceedings in this House. The wide-ranging changes promised to achieve that end have yet to materialise. In some ways, the influence of this House on the executive has diminished. Ministers responsible for legislation rarely attend second reading debates. The responses of ministers who deign to sum up second reading debates-which are almost as rare--demonstrate that they mostly have not even monitored debate on their office television sets. To few ministers who do not offend in the manner described, I apologise. Quite often, despite the presence of advisers, technical matters raised during debate, particularly in the detailed hearing stages, either ignored completely or answered inadequately. Then there is the practice-prevalent under the previous government and almost the rule with the coalition-{)f a raft of government amendments to legislation already before the House arriving sometimes only a matter of hours before the bill or bills are to be debated. Is it any wonder that so much of legislation passed is subsequently found to be defective in one respect or another? These practices certainly do not enhance the relevance of this parliament vis-a-vis executive government. Nor do practices which the government observes in the conduct of business before the Main Committee go any way towards bettering our relevance. Up there, only the most conscientious ministers put in an appearance. The government rosters chairmen of committees to witness proceedings on its behalf. Those chairmen are not even chairman of the relevant committee-just any old chairman will do! ",107
148,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, but, of course, they are not authorised to and cannot respond to the concerns raised by members in debate. It boils down to this: the only improvement in parliamentary procedures under this government is to be found at the one time during the day that the Prime Minister is in attendance. So, while the Prime Minister can be justly proud of his efforts to improve question time, conduct of other business of the House leaves very much to be desired. Electorate of Paterson: Traffic Conditions",107
149,Mr BOB BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Withstanding the test of time, going back to the early 1980s, Rutherford residents within my electorate of Paterson may soon see green rather than amber or red over the need for safer local roads. Last month, I those publicly announced my commitment to seek funding from the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr John Sharp, to deliver on the long-mooted requests by local Rutherford residents for urgent are attention to be given to the intersection at Arthur Street and the New England Highway, and calling for the construction of pedestrian traffic lights. A similar traffic hazard also confronts residents and motorists at nearby Alexandra Street. These intersections and general traffic conditions around the Rutherford area pose a stark reminder that words and more words, traffic study upon traffic study, and further community consultation can drag on for years and years, without a hole being dug or a RTA surveyor in sight. This reminder is etched in the memories of both long-term Rutherford residents and local business people within the burgeoning Rutherford shopping precinct. The commitment and drive of Mr and Mrs Lloyd Gregory has been something to behold. They have lobbied up hill and down dale for a better and safer deal for local pedestrians and motorists for many years now. I hope to make their efforts seem worthwhile in the months ahead. I note, too, people such as Lyndon MCLeod, who runs the local family pharmacy at Rutherford, Tom and Marie Bullen of Bullens Supermarkets, Ian Turner with his newsagency, and Rotarian Arthur Dawn, who has, incidentally, just been awarded the Paul Harris Fellow Award, are just a few Rutherford residents who are keen to see the light finally for a safe intersection at Arthur Street. To my way of thinking, Rutherford shopping centre now has the unfair distinction of being one of the largest shopping areas of its kind not to have a working set of traffic signals to help regulate traffic and better pedestrian access to shoppers. That has got to change. The situation is even more disturbing when the very popular Maitland City Bowling Club, and parents and young children and teenagers utilising the nearby neighbourhood centre and child-care centre in Arthur Street, as well as Rutherford High School, are putting more and more pressure on the intersection. In fact, upon the public statement last month over my commitment to concentrate on lobbying for federal funding, this pressing road issue has again been raised to the prominence it has long deserved. Indeed, I am very pleased that, on this pressing local roadworks issue, Maitland City Council, which has gained some notoriety for some of the decisions emanating from its chamber in the last year, is 100 per cent behind the Arthur Street lights option, as outlined in their 1996 traffic study. Its own studies found that upwards of 155 pedestrians and cyclists per hour were crossing the highway during peak periods within the vicinity of Arthur Street. The federal government is now awaiting the outcome of a joint Maitland City Council and state RTA study of traffic management needs of the New England Highway at Rutherford for consideration of whether additional highway upgrading could occur. Stage I of the traffic management plan for the New England Highway between Regent Street and Dunkley Street has been completed, but more work was considered necessary on traffic solutions for the stretch between Dunkley Street and Wollombi Road, including pedestrian lights at Arthur Street. My fight for safer traffic conditions along the New England Highway, be it for Rutherford, Metford or East Maitland residents, will continue. My full support for a major upgrade of the Arthur Street intersection at Rutherford is part and parcel of that. A shopping precinct of this size, which underwent further expansion in 1995, needs a set of traffic signals to regulate pedestrian and vehicle traffic. That is an issue which my transport minister will be made well aware of. I believe there is real scope for work to take place to install a set of traffic lights, and I will be urging the minister to examine council's position and the state RTA's position on the matter. Unlike the years and years that have passed by without the former federal government or the former Labor representatives representing Rutherford residents addressing the issue or coming to any solution, I am downright determined to do the opposite and actually deliver. I have taken the case for Rutherford residents right up to the minister, and I have an inkling that he is listening to their concerns. The federal transport minister, Mr John Sharp, has responded to my request by confirming that he is waiting on the traffic management study from council, before committing federal dollars to any further upgrade. Arthur Street, as the main thoroughfare for the local shopping precinct, bowling club, high school and child-care facilities at Rutherford, has been long overdue-since the mid-1980s-for consideration of new road works. Let's face it: name a shopping centre larger than Rutherford's that does not have effective and safe access for both motorists and pedestrians. For people like the Gregory's of Rutherford, their red-light wait of some 15 years for a solution may soon tum green. Sales Tax Relief",107
150,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"No wonder the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) is claiming that he is losing so much weight. It is not speed walking, it is speed talking that is trimming him down. Good luck to him. It is said that if you live long enough you will see and hear everything. Even at my tender years I am getting to that point with this piece of correspondence from the office of the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp). It is a letter that has been written to Neil Hammond of Ferny Creek, Victoria concerning the fact that earlier this year Mr Hammond's house was unfortunately burnt down in the Victorian bushfires. He wrote a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) requesting some relief for the reconstruction of his house-a temporary sales tax exemption on the building materials. That letter was sent to the Prime Minister on 27 January. A response did not arrive from the Prime Minister. It was sent on to the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who in tum sent this minor request on to the Assistant Treasurer. A letter addressed to Mr Hammond came back on 7 March and I believe it deserves to be written into the full record of the parliament and the Hansard. It states: The Assistant Treasurer has asked methat is, Virginia Lo Pilato, the adviser on taxationto respond to your letter. I sympathise with the situation that now faces you and your family. However, the Government receives many requests for reductions in tax burdens. To agree to individual requests would often only have a small impact on the Budget. However, if all of the requests were to be granted it would increase the budget deficit by billions of dollars. Such a blowout in the deficit would be unacceptable, as it would place pressure on interest rates to rise (thereby increasing unemployment and reducing economic growth) and would reduce national savings (and could therefore further increase Australia's foreign debt). I trust this information will be of assistance to you. Yours sincerely Virginia Lo Pilato Adviser (Taxation) The information is of no assistance to Mr Hammond. It is a letter of a mean spirited, mealy-mouthed government that does not have the common sense to respond to a request for compassion in sensible terms. There is no sensible response here. It is a response of the absurd. It is theatre of the absurd to say to Mr Hammond that his minor request for a concession on sales tax to help rebuild his home that had been burnt down will blowout the budget deficit by billions of dollars, will send up interest rates, will increase unemployment, will reduce economic growth, will reduce national savings and could further increase Australia's foreign debt. The minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), should have a word with his brother about this standard of absurdity coming out of his office. I have seen some economics in my day but never the economics of chaos theory. This is like saying that if a butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil there will be an earthquake in Western Australia. It is like going back to the old domino theory used in economics. Instead of having the downward flow of communism into Australia, it is the downward flow of national bankruptcy: if a fellow receives a taxation concession to rebuild a house that was burnt down in a bushfire it will send the country broke. That is to say that if Mr Hammond sneezes Australia's 17 million people will catch colds. The office of the Assistant Treasurer is saying that if he builds his house one day the next day the IMP and the World Bank will be knocking on his door to blame him for national bankruptcy. This is a response of the absurd. If a government cannot give a serious response to a family and a citizen who has suffered under the very sad circumstances of having their house burnt down then they should give no response. If they cannot give a serious response in a compassionate situation it is better to say nothing. What sort of government is so mean spirited and absurd that they cannot write back in proper terms to Mr Hammond giving him a sensible response. Instead of having Costelloomics, we have got chaos theory in the economics of government policy, we have the domino theory-that one person's small taxation concession on building materials will send the country broke-we have Mr Hammond sneezing and the nation catching colds and we have him being told that if he builds his house one day the IMF and the World Bank will knock on his door the next and say that he has sent the country broke. This is a government that is mean spirited across the board. It cannot even come up with legitimate, sound reasons to justify that set of attitudes. It has to go into the absurd. If this is the best that the Assistant Treasurer and his office can do, then they will be headed the way of Senator Short not too long from now and off overseas where they belong. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",109
151,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"I am particularly pleased this evening that the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) is in the chamber because I hope what I have to say he will agree with. I want to raise once again an issue not only as the member for Groom but also as the patron of a local community support group for those affected by myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, a potentially disabling and chronic condition affecting the immune and central nervous systems. There is no known single cause, although for mallY it may be a viral trigger. Some patients may have a sudden onset whilst for others it may be a slow and gradual process with no easily identifiable trigger. It can vary greatly in severity and duration. There is no specific diagnostic test. It is a complex illness and the ·list of symptoms can be extensive and profound in the more severe cases. Current research suggests that a dysfunction of the immune system and the central nervous system is involved. The complexity of the illness means that the prognosis can be very difficult to predict. Some patients will make slow and gradual progress over several years to a full recovery. The majority will make variable progress with relapses which may be severe and prolonged. They may reach 70 to 80 per cent of their former functions. Others remain severely disabled with little progress, needing a lot of help with their personal needs. A smaller percentage may deteriorate and be bed bound for much of the time. Peak incidence appears to be in the 20 to 40 years age group with a slight predominance to females and cases, unfortunately, involving young children are increasing. Clearly, it is a very real and for many a very debilitating illness. The consequences of living with ME for the sufferer, the carer and the whole family unit need to be understood. I again take the opportunity to pay particular tribute to two pioneering local Toowoo mba women, Joan Sheath and Lyn Wilson, both as sufferers and as support group leaders, without whose persistent efforts the community group would not be what it is today. I am pleased also that the minister and the medical profession are now starting to do something substantive about the problem and its associated research. I also welcome Australia's active participation in International CFS Awareness Day last year. Furthermore, I am pleased that a working group has been established under the auspices of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians with the aim of developing clinical practice guidelines for the assessment and for the treatment of CFS. The working group has received a grant from the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services to develop and distribute the guidelines to all medical practitioners in Australia. This is a landmark development in CFS clinical management. The major task of the working group is to evaluate the rapidly growing body of scientific literature on CFS and to make recommendations to medical practitioners and to the community. The guidelines will provide a major resource for all concerned and will help to dispel much unfounded speculation and misinformation currently provided. A draft document is expected to be circulated to all interested parties for comment by the middle of 1997, and the finalised guidelines will be published as a supplement to the Medical Journal of Australia later this year. In making my final comment, can I say that I hope that we have left behind unreasonable perceptions that this condition-that is, CFS-is a condition of the mind rather than of the body. It is undoubtedly a debilitating illness which we cannot and must not ignore. Aboriginal Reconciliation",110
152,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (5.45 p.m.)I rise tonight in the adjournment debate to speak about the reconciliation process leading up to the Australian Reconciliation Convention, which is to be held from 26 to 28 May 1997 at the World Congress Centre in Melbourne. It is significant that this is being some 30 years after the referendum which actually made our indigenous people proper and full citizens of this country and which addressed the outrageous racist history of this nation, which some would like to paper over. I would like to commend the reconciliatiC'n process tonight to all parliamentarians and, indeed, to all Australians because it is an issue which is important for all of us as a nation. It has never been more important, particularly given the climate of intolerance which has been fostered since 2 March 1996. In particular, we all sit in this chamber with the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who has stated that she would not represent Aboriginal Australians. That is an outrageous comment and one which I do not think would have been tolerated had she mentioned any other group other than our most oppressed group, indigenous people. The chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Patrick Dodson, has stated that 'to effect deep and lasting change in this country, reconciliation has to be a people's movement'. To this end, Australians for Reconciliation have worked hard all around the country with community groups and individuals at the local level. Their activities have been very much in the social justice tradition of thinking globally but acting locally. Reconciliation is a global issue. Its anti-racism message is one that must be taken seriously if we are to combat the narrow, rednecked views of the outspoken minority because it is still the case that indigenous Australians suffer from a great level of discrimination. I am pleased that the Labor Party has put as our representative on the council the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. I think that it is unfortunate that the government does not have the Racism Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) on the council. The representative of the government, the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), is no doubt someone who is committed to the improvement of the lot of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. It is no reflection on him whatsoever, as I am sure there are many held on the other side of the House who are committed to the reconciliation process and I congratulate them for that. But, nonetheless, it sends a very bad message that the minister is not represented on the council. Also, when I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on radio this morning, it struck me once again that he is a very good performer on radio and knows how to address his audience, but there were two sorts of addresses to the audience. When he spoke about native title, he said, 'I want to address a message directly to the farmers, and I say to you that I will represent your interests.' He spoke to them directly, but when he spoke about indigenous people, it was indirect. He was not speaking to them. There was no, 'And I say to Aboriginal Australians, I actually think that I am going to uphold your rights as well.' The fact that you have a campaign from some people in this parliament to extinguish native title is an outrageous attack on all of us, and I wish those in the government who have a more progressive and enlightened view on these issues the best of luck in combating it. In terms of the racism issue, as well tonight I wish to draw people's attention towards an ongoing community campaign against racism against indigenous Australians and, indee-, against racism wherever it exists: On 12 Ap-l there will be yet another rally In Sydney In Hyde Park against racism. It is being organised by community groups, by churches, by people who are concerned about the increasing level of intolerance. That, as part of the process of the lead-up to the reconciliation convention in May, is something that all of us should participate in in our local communities and all of us should encourage.",111
153,Mr HOCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I have received the following letter from a constituent of mine, Ms Lara Stevenson, which I would like to bring to the attention of the Australian people. It begins: Dear Mr Hockey, I am writing to you as a twenty year old female who is concerned with a problem in our society, which I believe has gone beyond our control. DRUG ABUSE. I have never taken much time to deal with issues such as drug and alcohol abuse because it rarely concerned myself or family and friends, and I am not a person who is out to 'save the wo-ld'. I am just an ordinary girl who cannot belIeve how available, cheap and widely used hard drugs are becoming. Since the universities and schools have been on their summer break I am finding that I cannot go out on a Saturday night without somebody telling me they are on the 'best high' due to taking speed or ecstasy. When I attended high school there was always a group of people who smoked marijuana, whether it was everyday or only on weekends, I had a firm belief that they would ""grow out of it"" and were only experimenting. These people hav- - ow ,tu.rneto hard chemicals to get a more excltmg high. Unfortunately it is no longer a minority group taking chemicals. from what I have observed for myself 'pot' is boring so everybody has now decided that ecstasy and speed are the way to go. This habit has been justified to me by many people, I will give you some of these examples; : Cheaper than a night out drinking. ($30-$60) . Gives you a boost of energy and therefore you can dance all night. . You don't get a hangover. . You don't get hungry. . You lose weight. Admittedly twenty year olds should be old enough and responsible enough to make their own d-ci­ sions, however once someone feels the first exhilarating hit from a line of speed or an 'eccy', they want that feeling again and although they don't realise, they're already mildly addicted. It. affe.cts their way of thinking, and they no longer thmk like responsible twenty year olds. This is not hearsay, I was at a BBQ yesterday and heard one of my friends say exactly this. I work for News Limited, and I was working on The Daily Telegraph news desk the day Anna Wood died from taking an ecstasy overdose. Believe me, it scared all of us. Many people Drugs thought that The Telegraph was making an example of Anna Wood and that it was only a good story. Yes, it was a good story, because with Anna's parents and friends, the Telegraph tried to educate people on the dangers of MDMA. I originally thought Anna's death would frighten people and deter many from taking drugs, it has done the opposite, people think they are immune to side effects and even death. We think the drug problem is confined to Kings Cross, Oxford Street and Cabramatta but it isn't. I was at a nightclub on Sydney's North Shore on New Years Eve, when two fifteen year old girls and their friends approached me, I was their babysitter some time ago. Imagine my surprise to see these young girls in the nightclub and then telling me they were all on ecstasy and wasn't it great. They assumed that because many people in the nightclub were drinking water and dancing they must have been on drugs also. I realise that there will always be a drug problem in our society and there is only so much a government can do. Believe me I can go out dancing and have a great time with the best of them and I love going out with my friends. But how many more deaths, brain damage, accidents and drug overdoses do we have to see before people start to realise that it could be them next? The purpose of this letter is to te.1l you, if you didn't already know, how severe thiS problem has become, and to ask you if there is a possibility of educating young people on the dangers of drug abuse. Why does education have to stop when we leave school? Most people start using hard drugs when they leave school, they're working so therefore they can afford it. I know of two people who use their AUSTUDY money to pay for drugs and alcohol, is this fair? In the end they're just hurting themselves. The television commercials for drink driving are so effective, they shock and scare people. Is this the only way to get through to our friends? I am prepared to help in any possible way, there is only so much one person can do. I that a new drug education scheme and tougher penalties for drug pushers and users be introduced. If it means saving one persons life or another persons sanity shouldn't we do it? Lara Stevenson Government Cutbacks",112
154,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to draw the attention of the House-and in particular the attention of those members opposite-to something that they are very aware of, which is the fact that our offices are being inundated by people with problems. Those Australians who thought this was going to be a government to make them comfortable and relaxed are now finding out just the opposite. We are finding out that the cutback in government services has meant staff in government departments are not cop in g either. I just want to go through some of the examples of the kinds of problems that are coming on a regular basis. A number of people have been in tears when they have spoken to me both on the phone and at my office. The change to social security to become a more efficient system has meant that various offices have actually stopped the system of queuing by number, where they could talk to a departmental officer at a cubicle. People are now required to stand in a line and be dealt with one after the other. I was speaking with a woman this week who spent 20 minutes in line. The woman is 65 years of age, with osteoporosis, but there were no chairs available so she could not sit down. And if she had sat down, she would have lost her spot in the queue anyhow. While she was in the queue she could hear the people ahead telling the officer their business. When it got to her tum, she did not want her affairs to be heard by all the people behind her, but that was what was required. My staff have now dealt with the woman in some detail. The fact is that this woman did not have a problem. Incidentally, she had already rung up earlier and tried.to make an appointment. The current waiting time is three weeks. She felt that she had a problem with but her affairs which may have meant that she propose was frauding. She was extremely anxious, . which was why she wanted to be able to talk to the officer face to face. When my staff then dealt with her in some depth, of course she had no problem. But now she hasbecause she is now very upset and very ill. And this is the kind of damage being done by those opposite who are talking about people being comfortable and relaxed. A gentleman who came into my office on Monday afternoon has two daughters are on Austudy. He has a bankrupt company, but it is a company which means he goes through the actual means test. His wife has been told by her doctor that she can no longer work on the application because her illness, induced by trying to sort out and deal with the Austudy claims, is such that she can no longer cope. So now he is doing it instead. The fact is that these people are on benefits. They have two daughters-one at university, one at school. They are uncertain. Their Austudy has currently been refused. A young woman came in who has an income of $20,000 a year. That got converted to $116,000 a year. She had her year planned out till suddenly she was told she was not eligible for Austudy. The fact is that those who are not eligible for Austudy are eligible for social security. And what is happening? They are being forced to take it. The savings that are supposedly being made are not going to be available because it will be another part of the budget where the spending will come from. We are going to see a cut and a saving in Austudy but, equally, we are going to see an increase in the number of people on benefits. Turning to benefits, people put in their income declarations on a regular basis--every month, every fortnight-and it is absolutely exact, absolutely accurate. There is now a computer error. So one constituent this week now has a debt of $4,000. The department said, 'Look, I'm sorry. It is our mistake, but pay up.' These are people with no money. The government will trumpet this as a saving-'Here we are. We have caught some frauds. We have saved some money.' Who are they saving it off? People who are impoverished. You government members all know this because I have no doubt that you are all getting the same problems and in the same volume, if not more so. Because you are in government, I do not doubt that people will be coming to you thinking you can help. I also know how powerless you are, as your constituents are finding out. And what is tragic is that you have done so little to make any difference.

If you look at store stock levels-a realistic would need another half a million dollars for 15 Fuel stock would be another $900,000 to $2 that situation would need to raise over $1.8 over $4 million.

For example, here is a case that was brought Robyn Suprano accepted Shell's offer to operate self-serve commission agency in return for the Supranos who were dissatisfied with waiting Shell gave assurances that Shell Wallsend would pull out of the site. In October 1989, Shell showed them plans Force franchisees and were promised lO-year there. But Shell departed from its representations into its term of franchise. In September of refurbished Shell Wallsend, the Supranos were agents, not dealer franchisees, putting them outside still signed an agreement which gave them 10 four years.

It encourages firms to search continuously for improvements vital to the process of productivity Competition is also central to ensuring productivity lower prices. I entirely endorse those sentiments of the and protection all encourage inefficiency promotes efficiency and continuous improvement and lower prices. Most Australians are familiar with the benefits Australia is a great sporting nation, it is based on the principle that all sectors are exposed and with the world's best.

Under the Hilmer reforms, governments are have been traditionally regarded as natural electricity, postal and telephone services, only the government can provide. There can wires and one set of telegraph poles. However, whether all these services really need to be to be the provider. Under the competition policy, governments aspects of these businesses which are natural competitive. For example, railways have traditionally governments because of their natural monopoly uneconomic to duplicate rail networks, and wasteful and costly. However, rolling stock, competitive. Just as private cars, trucks and why private operators cannot use public rail By doing this, the natural monopolies-the poles-stay in government hands, but the private where competition is possible. The greater the quality, lower prices and give consumers companies Telstra and Optus has had this result. as different truck operators make use of the called third-party access under the national competition to streamline the mechanisms by which access of access to essential infrastructure like telephone be determined.

These industries, such as rail, have been traditionally regarded as services which only be one rail network, one set of electricity in the last few years we have come to question monopolies and whether government really needs are asked to look at the possibility of separating monopolies and those which are potentially been regarded as being the domain of characteristics.

(2) Did the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and the NSW Department of Urban Affairs and Planning jointly prepare a nomination of the Sydney Opera House and its harbour setting for inscription on the World Heritage List by the Government of Australia in 1996. (3) If so, (a) did the property nominated include the Sydney Opera House, the island of Fort Denison, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the waterways of Sydney Harbour to the mean high water mark from Robinson's Point and Mrs Macquarie's Point in the east to Blues Point and Dawes Point in the west and (b) did the nomination state that the property illustrates the themes of twentieth century architecture and the cultural heritage of Australia, both of which are under-represented on the World Heritage List and that the inclusion of the property would assist in creating a more universally representative list. (4) Did the Australian Government lodge the nomination with the World Heritage Committee on 1 July 1996 when it lodged the nomination of Australia's Sub-Antarctic Islands; if not, why not. (5) Are preparations being made to lodge the nomination by 1 July 1997 in time for the World Heritage Bureau and the World Heritage Committee to consider it in 1998; if not, why not. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes (2) The Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and the NSW Department of Urban Affairs and Planning cooperated, over the period of 1995 and 1996, in an assessment of the values of the Sydney Opera House in its Harbour Setting and the preparation of a World Heritage nomination. Preparation of the draft nomination was the responsibility of the then New South Wales Department of Urban Affairs and Planning. The Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories was represented on a steering committee of officials which oversaw the work. The Commonwealth Government has not lodged that nomination with the World Heritage Committee. (3)(a) Yes (3)(b) Yes (4) No. The Commonwealth Government did not receive the nomination from the New South Wales Government until 26 July 1996, which was too late to allow submission to the World Heritage Committee for consideration that year. (5) The Commonwealth Government has decided not to forward the nomination to the World Heritage Committee at this time. The Prime Minister wrote, in a letter of 19 August 1996 to the New South Wales Premier, that he would wish to ensure complete accord between Governments over funding and management arrangements, if a nomination is to proceed. Uncertainties are raised by the New South Wales nomination of the building in its harbour setting, particularly the difficulty of establishing satisfactory management arrangements in a dynamic urban setting which includes a working harbour. Accordingly, the Commonwealth has decided that its limited resources for World Heritage matters are best devoted to the nominations we have in progress (notably the Subantarctic Islands), the assessments we have under way and the proper management of the eleven properties already on the World Heritage List.
