POSTAL ADMINISTRATION .  tion of the Prime Minister to the following paragraph which appears in today's under the heading "" Postal Administration - Chamber s of Commerce Resolution""BRISBANE, Thursday - At the sittings conference of the associated Chambers of Commerce today Mr Knox (Melbourne) moved"" That this meeting is of opinion that management of the post and telegraphs and telephones w i ll establishment of a permanent and non-political commission."" It was recognised throughout the Commonwealth that the administration of these departments was not what it should be. Mr Winchcombe, of Sydney, having spoken in the same strainMr Knox said that many officers in the ment were harassed by impracticable regulations. He did not wish to' remove any Ministerial sponsibility. What he desired was to see details of adntinistration intrusted to a non-political board. Has the representative of the Corner Party expressed the opinions of the Ministry, and, if so, does the Prime Minister intend to make the question a vital one? vernment will go out, as sure as fate, if that is done. i Mr DEAKIN - I have not seen the'report, but am loth to nip in the bud any attempt at such a difficult task as the reconciliation of entirely non-political administration with complete political responsibility. GERMAN AND BRITISH BOUNDARY. . Mr BOWDE N - On referring to cablegram published in yesterday's Argus, found that the allegation there is' that Gertwo. man officials have entered into disputed territory on the borderland of Papua, and have imposed taxation on British miners working there. The Prime Minister's reply to a question yesterday, however, seemed to acknowledge that the land belongs to Gera.m., many. Is it the case that the country is German territory, or have German officials made a move merely to strengthen their PETITION. claims to territory in dispute?",14
1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We have no official statement as to the locality of the occurrence, but we are directly, though unofficially, informed that the miners do not doubt that the territory belongs to Germany. According to information which reached us practically from them, they are satisfied that they were on German territory.",14
2,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Does the Governintend to accept that rather vague information, or will steps be taken to have, Arms, the boundary properly defined?",14

If so, when will he be in a position to make known his decision? The Go- Mr EWING - The matter has been under consideration, the honourable and learned member having made various repre-. sentations with regard thereto; but. I amnot yet able to announce a definite conclusion. There is a great pressure of work, and the question is a knotty one, but I shall give the honourable member a reply as soon as possible. . Mr KELLY - H as the Minister conPAPUA. sidered the advisability of establishing a pensions system in connection with the Dethe fence Department? That has been sugI gested many times during the last year or",14
5,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The matter has been under consideration, but although the end in view is an admirable one there are serious difficulties. I suggest for the consideration of the honourable member one of those difficulties, viz., whether it would not be well to consider the question in relation to all public servants. I think that every one is in favour of the general principle, and shall not lose sight of the matter.",15
6,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wish to ask a question in reference to the now celebrated Colonel Cox case. The Minister promised that he would do his utmost to obtain for that officer the pay and privileges attaching to his rank from the time he was promoted to it, in other words, to remunerate him, like other officers, for the work he has been doing.",15

HUTCHISON - I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he has observed into-dav's Argus atelegram from Sydney headedLONDONIMMIGRATION BOARD. THE COMMONWEALTH DONATION. MR. WADE'S CRITICISMS The paragraph statesThe Premier, Mr Wade, stated today that some time ago he made inquiries concern.ng the objects and methods of the Central Immigration Board in London, and the information he collected does not induce him to favourably regard Mr Deakin's action in giving ,£ioo of the funds of the Commonwealth, and incidentally . of the States, towards assisting the instilut on. As a matter of fact, Mr Wade thinks it probable that when the Prime Minister understands just what he has done he will be incline. I ask the Board to disgorge the £100 donation. Can the Prime Minister give the House any information in regard to this, matter ?",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I did notice the remarks of the Premier of New South Wales in the Argus today, and brought them with me expecting that they would form the subject of some comment. Let me say, in the first place, that it is an undesirable precedent that expenditure of Common-. wealth money for Commonwealth purposesshould be criticised'by State Premiers, particularly when the sums are trifling, because such action calls for a reciprocal course of criticism on the part of Commonwealth Ministers and members, which would not conduce to the proper transaction of the business of the two Legislatures concerned..",15
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,What is the Prime Minister referring to?,15
12,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"To a telegram sent from Sydney yesterday,. and published in the Argus of today, headed "" London Immigration Board,"" it should be "" Central Immigration Board "" - "" The Commonwealth Donation."" Then the paragraph gives the Premier's criticism at length. . Mr Wade thinks ill of the Cen' tral Immigration Board. I do not challenge his right to his own opinion. But from the statement made, one would suppose that this Board sent, or sought to send, no immigrants from the Mother Country except city dwellers, and that we had given a donation for the purpose of assisting the Board to send city dwellers. That inference, which might be derived' from the perusal of this statement by Mr. Wade, is quite unwarranted. The Central Immigration Board is largely composed of those who have been associated with the WALES. different Dominions of the Empire. Amongst its active members, when I was in. London, was Lord Jersey, an ex-Governor of New South Wales, Lord Ranfurly, an ex-Governor . of New Zealand, - Lord Brassey, an ex-Governor of Victoria, and a number of other noblemen who have held office in the Dominions. Sir Clement Kinloch Cooke, its chairman, has long been associated with Imperial questions, besides, 'the Board is. in close association with the different Agents-General of the Australian States and with the representatives of Canada. At the meeting held in London the other day, I noticed that there were present, and taking part in the proceedings,, the Agents-General of Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, the High Commissionelr of Canada, Lord Strathcona, representatives of the South African Colonization Society, and other bodies. So' that the Central Immigration Board, what-, ever it is and does, includes a large number' of influential men associated with the oversea Dominions. At that meeting, the first resolution carried stated that it was theobject of the Board to provide "" desirable, suitable immigrants"" for the colonies.. The operations of the Board are not large, ibut it is the only body of the kind existing, so far as my knowledge goes, in the Mother Country; and inasmuch as the official Government Emigration Board declines to. advise settlers in any respect as to the part of the Empire to which they should go, or, until lately, as to whether they should remain within the Empire or not, little or - nothing is to be expected from that body. This Central Immigration Board, however small be the scale of its operations, is the 'only body at present* existing available for the promotion of immigration from the Mother Country. Now, what is the Commonwealth "" d o n at i o n "" ? The sum of - jQioo, to be employed on the following conditionsNo cheque to be drawn on this account for any other purpose than Australian emigration. 1. The money is only to be used to assist cases which are accepted by the Agents-General of the various Australian States. - Mr WH IRVINE - The Prime Minister does not anticipate very great results? - Mr DEAKIN - Not from ^100.'",15
13,Mr WILKS,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,We have only had two .immigrants through the Board.,16
14,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The Board had not had the advantage of this assistance at that time. The second condition is2. That no case is to be submitted without 'being previously approved by Sir Tooth or Mr Wise, who may be said to directly represent Australian interests on the Board, and by Captain Collins, as the representative of the Commonwealth. Those conditions are imposed in order that it may be ascertained that the immigrants are suitable and desirable settlers for Australia. ' Mr MCWILLIAMS - The Prime Minister took, a lot of precautions over that J£J 00 !",16
15,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"They are simple precautions in regard to the expenditure of a small sum of money for the encouragement of the only association of the kind existing in London. The matter scarcely calls, I think, for much comment from anybody, - and least of all from the Premier of . a State whosepolicy is said to be the encouragement of immigration.",16
16,Mr MCDONALD,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,It is the only hope that he has of living politically.,16
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable - member for Kennedy should not believe that' 1 He should not hug that delusion !,16
18,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I take this opportunity in debate. of devoting more serious attention to - matter than 'is involved in this particular case, because I hope that this will be the last "" occasion.' on which ' Commonwealth Ministers will be Invited to reply to criticisms from State Ministers of their manner of exercising their own policy, and especially as to such minute details.",16
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,I think a mountain is being made out of a mole hill;,16

22,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Order ! A question has been asked, and is now being replied to by the Prime Minister. I ask honourable"" members to maintain that proper silence which is necessary to enable the Prime Minister to be heard. If any further information is required after the reply is given, it will then be possible for honourable members to ask for that information. At the same ' time, I must ask the Prime Minister not to debate the whole matter, but simply to give such information as may be necessary.",16
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I should like to ask you, sir, how' far the Prime Minister is permitted to go in answering questions put Robert Lucas by an honourable member?",16
24,Mr HUTCHISON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,He must give the facts.,16
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The Prime Minister - to the accompaniment of plaudits from the Labour Corner for some reason or other - is proceeding to criticise a speech delivered by the Premier of New South Wales. I submit that he should take some other course if he desires to do that, and not reply to that speech under cover of an answer to a question.",16
26,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I have already reminded the Prime Minister that he should not exceed the limits of a reply to a question-that he should furnish his reply without' debating . the matter. If I had considered that that intimation to the Prime Minister was necessary before, I should have made it before. I think that, so far, the Prime Minister has not exceeded the limits which are properly open to him. At the same time, I repeat the suggestion which I made just now, that his answer should not assume the character of a speechthe . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - We have had . a fairly critical speech already.",16
27,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Perhaps the honourable ""member will understand my motives when I say that I do not propose in future - to reply in this House to criticisms made by State Ministers upon Commonwealth affairs; and I wish, before taking that, course which might otherwise appear to require some explanation, to give my reasons for making my answer somewhat longer than it would otherwise be. Let me refer to other charges equally baseless and of exactly the same kind. I . find in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of the 7th of last month, a report of a speech made by the Premier of New South Wales. '",16
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Is this in Mr Speaker?,17
29,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,I am not aware of what the Prime Minister is going to say.,17
30,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"In that speech the Premier of New South Wales saidThe Federal authorities had purchased many thousand copies of a certain publication, and had requested the State to take over several thousands in order to have them distributed through its agents abroad",17
31,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Order; I think that the Prime Minister is dealing with another matter now.,17
32,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"It refers to the adveragents abroad. tising of the Commonwealth, and comments by the same Premier upon it.",17
33,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"If it arises out of the question which has been asked, the honourable gentleman may proceed.",17
34,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I cannot say that it does arise out of the particular statement to which my attention has already been called. It is a' similar statement on the same subject made by the same public man. Of course, if you, sir, consider that to refer to it will not be in order, I shall fake another opportunity.",17
35,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"It is not what I conbecause sider, but what the Standing Orders require that must govern the matter, and I am afraid that they require that I should not permit the honourable gentleman to proceed.",17
36,Mr CARR,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he has .seen the article which appeared in the Daily Telegraph, having reference to the immigration question, and comments by the Premier of New South Wales on the subject, and what he intends to do in the matter ?",17
37,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,I do not propose to - make another speech.,17
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable gensaidtleman's masters demand it . - Mr DEAKIN - The statement made is that, on the 26th March, we wrote offering .a certain number of copies of a handbook to the Government of New South Wales for circulation in the East and Oriental countjies. Two commercial agents had waited upon me in the course of their visits to Australia, and had explained the need of some handy compendium of Australian information in China, Japan, and the Straits Settlements, and in the various centres where they were operating. Our own Statistical Handbook was not readyindeed it is not yet ready-and I , therefore, selected the cheapest compendium of the kind known to me. It was published order, in New South Wales, and I obtained two thousand copies at a cost of ; £ i o o . I asked the Premier of New South Wales if he would allow his representative in the East to circulate some copies for the benefit of Australian trade and commerce. Before I received any reply or acknowledgment from him, in the course of a public statement, the Premier of New South Wales saidThe Federal authorities had purchased many thousand copies of a certain publication, and had requested the State to take over several thousands in order to have them distributed through its I might mention that the number offered to the New South Wales Government was 750, and not several thousand. ' As a matter of fact, the same publication had been previoutsly offered to the State Government separately, and ha'd been rejected I am informed by the publisher that the same publication was never offered to the State Government. A different publication altogether, and a very much more expensive one was offered to that Government, and declined. The Premier of New South Wales proceeded to sayit contained nothing new anfl could only take the place of quite as complete and up-to-date information issued forth by the Government Printer. The information contained in the handbook could contain nothing new, since - it comprised statistics of all the States, and of the Commonwealth, added together in a convenient form. Though probabiv it was not as complete and up-to-date as some information since issued by the' several States, in regard to statistics affecting those States, it was certainly the most up to-date publication dealing with all the States and with Australia as a whole. The Premier of New South Wales further Now the Federal Government had gone to the expense of this large purchase An expense, as I have said, of £ 1 0 0 and it coolly asked the Government of New-South Wales to undertake the distribution of their chase, and at the same time to pay 40 per cent, of the cost of an article it did not want. Surely this should demonstrate to the Federal Government the uselessness of attempting to carrv out a work which should be l e ft solely to the State. The publication which was offered by the New South Wales Government instead of this, was no doubt an excellent publication, but it related only to New South Wales. The publication about which these comments were made included full information with regard to New South Wales, giving that State its proper place as the oldest settlement, but that information was coupled with similar information as regards all the other States. It' was, therefore, an Australian publication.",17
39,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Does the gentleman refer to the Zone Hand},18
40,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"No , to a statistical handbook, a copy of which I laid on the table the other day. It included statistics of the various States as well as of the Commonwealth, with notes of the resources and advantages of Australia supported by those statistics. It was a purely Australian production, published in the interests of Australia. I have said that before we received any reply this is the comment offered upon Australian action in the interests of Australia as a whole. I merely wish to add that' I hope I shall not be asked any further questions with regard to comments of this kind by any other State Premiers, though, as a matter of fact, I do not know of any other Premier who has indulged in this kind of comment. The two instances together relate to £200. I propose to disregard comment of this kind, and refrain, from retorting by comment upon even larger expenditures of the several States Governments-eve n where their nature invites it.",18
41,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he has ascertained that the newspaper in whose special supplement he has decided to advertise Australia, advocates a policy in harmony with the policy of the majority of the people of Australia, and whether he is not aware that the newspaper referred to is an uncompromising opponent of the "" Little Englander "" views which are being given prominent expression at the present time in Great Britain? ' Mr DEAKIN - I am in a position to answer the last part of the honourable member's question, because it is well known that the newspaper referred to is an unpur- compromising opponent of what is called "" Little' Englander "" views.",18
42,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"What is a ""Little Englander""? It is merely a fraudulent description by the opposing political party.",18
43,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I think I know very well what the honourable member meant by a ""Little Englander."" It has nothing, whatever to do with English political parties now, but is used to describe persons in the Old Country who hold that England should stand alone, that we have arrived at a time when the Colonies must take care of themselves, and that the policy to be pursued in England should be a policy which considers only that portion of the British Empire and that alone? honourable Mr MCDONALD - That is not how the term originated. It originated during the Boer War.",18
44,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I am not aware that the term originated at that time. Honourable members are aware that I decline to, use British party labels and catch words because they are capable of misapplication ; but I think I have interpreted the term in. the sense in which the honourable member for Wimmera used it ",18
45,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Quite correct.,18
46,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Takin g the view I have stated of the Little Englander policy, I believe that the Standard is an uncompromising opponent of' that policy. But we. had nothing whatever to do with the views given expression to in that newspaper on that or any other matter when we advertised any. more than we have anything to 1 do with the views of other persons with whom we undertake a business transaction. If we believe we can make a bargain for our own benefit, we are not concerned about the political opinions of those with whom we make it.",18
47,Mr KELLY,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Arising out of the question asked by the honourable member for Wimmera, I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether the London Daily Telegraph is not also an uncompromising opponent of the ""Little Englander"" party, a very small section of"" the Liberal Party in the Old Country-and whether its circulation is not four or five times as great as that of the Standard!",18
48,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member credits me with more knowledge of the circulation of English newspapers than I possess. There are many uncompromising opponents of the particular policy referred to; and among them, the London Daily Telegraph, which has an extremely large circulation. OPERATION OF BOUNTIES ACT.",18

If the Minister has seen the paragraph tioned, will he say what steps the Customs officers are taking nowj and have taken in past,- to prevent shipments of foreign dates other foodstuffs unfit for human consumption being landed in the Commonwealth?",19
52,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The anin swers to the honourable member's questions amounts can be paid. are as follow :1. No . 2. If it comes under the notice of the Customs officers that any imported foods are unfit for human consumption they are directed to give local health authorities information thereof. Department has no power to take action of itself in such cases for condemnation. The provisions of the Commerce Act indirectly operate, and put in force, so far as available, in such cases. In the case under remark, however, it is pointed out that there is no proof that the dates were bad when imported. If they were not in bad order on landing, the Customs would have knowledge or control after delivery. / PAPUAN CIVIL SERVICE.

ADDITIONAL ESTIMATES. In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 21st May, vide page 11380): DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE. Proposed vote (Divisions 46 to 188),",19
53,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Calare) [ n . i ] . - In the Est mates for this Department ap: pear several compensation items. Is there any scheme in the Department by which claims of this kind are met? Apparently, every case is dealt with separately, and the whole thing is done in a piecemeal fashion, the result that, as I surmise, equal iustice is not done all round. Has the Minto ister in view any scheme under which these of Monpayments for compensation can be made? Under subdivision No. 1 of General Conat tingencies for the Victoran Military Forces, there appears the item "" Compensation for No names are 1 "" were mentioned, and there is a great deal of surmagmise as to the destination of the vote. Perhaps the Minister will take the Committee the into his confidence by giving particulars of this case. . Mr EWING (Richmond - Minister of shipment Defence) [IT.3] - The vote of ^600 mensuburbs tioned by the honourable member for Calare is in connexon with the case of F. W. : menBuley, Ninth Australian Light Horse, who the was thrown from his horse and killed when and on duty, in the State of Victoria. W th re: gard to the honourable member's main contention, there is a certain procedure .followed the Department before any of these In cases of injury, they have to be certified to by a medical board, and certain regulations have to be followed. They are dealt with on the same principle as has obtained since those regulathe tions were framed under the Defence Act. I The shall have no objection to laying the conditions on the table of the House, and if honare orable members think that any alteration is necessary, I shall be glad to consider it.",19

57,Mr FRAZER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Kalgoorlie) [11.5] Urider the subdivision "" Miscellaneous "" connection with New South Wales, there pears an item of .£5,018 for ""interest due to the Government Savings Bank, New South Wales, on advance of £25,000 made for money order purposes."" Will the Minexceptional ister explain this? I was not aware that the Department was so necessitous that it had to borrow money from Savings Banks to carry on its money order business, particratic cularly at the rate of interest represented by a payment of £5,000 on a principal ,£25,000, presumably for one year.",20
58,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Calare) [11.6]. - Thes e are additional Estimates, which supposed to cover extraordinary items of penditure not provided for in the Estimatespresent in-Chief. The assumption is that arose under conditions that could not be sonably provided for in the principal - mates. But there are here items of £4,000 for the conveyance of inland mails, not cluding conveyance by railway, and £8,761 for the conveyance of mails by railway, New South Wales - It seems extraordinary that such large votes, totalling £12,761, should be required on supplementary Estimates, when provision might have been made for them on the Estimates-in-Chief. The to technicalities? Postmaster-General will find that the tenderthese ing for country mails is going _up by and bounds, and the probabilities are that this exceptionally large expenditure is to that fact. The Minister will find those large increases are caused by what called the commercial methods adopted by his Department in dealing ' with contracts. The conditions imposed are so stringent mail contractors have now to allow theming selves a large margin in order to comply with them, and protect their sureties. instance, in the town of Temora, there is a contract for the conveyance of mails between the local office and the railway station. that tender was let, there was also the same period of three years a tender the conveyance of mails between the Temora post-office and a distant centre known Ariah Park. Quite recently the Departon ment decided to cancel that contract, and handed over to the railway authorities the conveyance of these mails. I am informed that there was a railway service in existence between these points at the time the contracts were accepted. The contractor for the conveyance of mails between the post-office and the station is now called upon to carry the additional mails without further recompense. The contract contains a provision that he shall convey in the mails from the post-office to the railapway station so many times a day, "" or oftener, if required,"" and although it has been the custom of the Department to regard that provision as referring only to circumstances, advantage has been taken of it to compel the contractor to carry, these additional mails without an additional allowance. This harsh, automethod of dealing with contractors is responsible, amongst other causes, for of the largely increased prices shown in the new tenders. Under the old system the Department was prepared to deal reasonare ably with its contractors, and to consider exthe equities of every case; but under the regime it secures itself by well nigh they impossible conditions, and insists upon reatheir observance when it suits its book'to Estido so. The result is that tenderers find it necessary to allow a wide margin beinyond the estimated cost so as to provide against special conditions which the Dein partment may impose during the currency of a contract. It is due to the Postmaster General, to ask whether a little mere of .the equities of these cases should not be considered in place of a strict adherence Provision is made in Estimates for £20,500 in respect of leaps temporary assistance, and the item emphasizes the contention advanced again and due again in this House that the Treasurer that cut down the Estimates-in-Chief to such are an extent that the Department found it impossible to effectively carry on its work. ",20
59,Mr MATHEWS,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"We hear almost every that honourable member in one breath' askfor increased postal facilities in his electorate, and, in the next, urging that For expenditure should be kept down.",20
60,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"That is not the position in this case. This expenditure When relates to established services which must let for be carried on by the Department. One for result of this policy has been to create' confusion in the Department, to. destroy as its efficiency, and to cause dissatisfaction the part of the general public. In reply to the - honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I should like to draw his attention to an incident that occurred in connection with the General Post Office, Sydney, towards the close of last year. The"" number of postal parcels - and the quantity of postal matter passing through that office, as the result of the Christmas season, increased to such an extent that the staff was unable to cope with the rush. Temporary hands had to be taken on to meet the demand upon the Department, and those hands - many of whom had wives and families to support-were compelled to do without their wages during the Christmas season, because the Deputy Postmaster-General had not at his disposal the money necessary to pay them. ' Mr MATHEWS - In Melbourne the Department retired men just before the holidays so as to avoid paying them for a broken week.",20
61,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,They were retired because the Department had not the money to pay them.,21
62,Mr MATHEWS,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"No ; the reason is that the Department was more niggardly than any private firm, and was not prepared to pay them for a broken week.",21
63,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I do not think that that is a fair charge to make against the Department. As a matter of fact, it has been starved by the Treasurer. Although the Estimates-in-Chief showed that the expenditure of the Department had been reduced by £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , we find that additional hands have had to be employed, and that we have now to vote a sum ot. £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 to cover the cost of temporary assistance during the current financial year. I wish now to refer to the item of £ 1 , 0 0 0 for Sunday - overtime. I am glad to learn from the Postmaster-General that the vicious system introduced in the Sydney General Post Office is being remedied. The authorities withdraw men from their regular staff duties-allowin g them time off at inconvenient periods-to place them upon Sunday work.",21
64,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"There was a roster for the day staff whose members were required to make up, by means of overtime, the loss of time involved by the withdrawal of men from their regular duties to perform Sunday work.",21
65,Mr THOMASBROW N,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The men had to break in upon their regular staff duties iq order to perform Sunday work. In these Estimates it is proposed to appropriate £ 1 , 0 0 0 to cover the cost of Sunday overtime upon the basis laid down by the Postmaster-General. I trust that that sum does not represent merely temporary provision in that connection. I hope that permanent provision will be made to defray the cost of Sunday work, so that the dissatisfaction which has resulted from the system that has hitherto been followed, will be removed.",21
66,Mr JOHN THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Cowper) [11.26] - Upon page 43 of these Estimates I notice an item "" repair and maintenance of telegraph and telephone lines and instruments, including all services in connection therewith, chargeable to contingencies, except those provided for under item 2, £ 3 , 8 7 3 . "" I fear that the .Postmaster-General has not made adequate provision for the repair and maintenance of these lines. In my own district the deplorable state of disrepair into which the telegraph and telephone lines have been allowed to f all , is responsible for the very frequent interruptions which take place in the service. Lines which have been erected for thirty years have had no maintenance gang employed upon them during the past ten years, so that when the wires become disconnected it is not safe for the linemen to climb the poles and reattach them. Consequently, interruptions are frequent, and these necessitate delay in the transaction of public business, as well as the employment of men for unduly long hours. I trust that the Postmaster-General will see that a sufficient sum is made available for the maintenance of these lines, in order that the evils of which I complain may be obviated. In regard to allowances to officers stationed in outlying districts, it seems to me that' a better understanding is necessary. As far as I know, the only officers who receive these allowances are those stationed in remote parts of the Commonwealth. But whilst these persons labour under a very serious disability I contend that very frequently officers located in isolated coastal districts are obliged to labour under similar disadvantages. Where an officer is compelled to obtain his supplies by coach his cost of living may be just as high as .that of an officer stationed at Bourke. It seems to me that these allowances ought not to be determined merely upon geographical lines. Local conditions, I contend, ought to be taken into consideration. In connection with non-official, post-offices I maintain that a very bad system has been allowed to grow up. It is practically nothing more nor less than a system of sweating, under which officers receive £120 annually, for conducting a post-office having a considerable revenue, and the business connected with money or. ders, Savings Banks, & c , out of which they have to pay not less than ios. per week to a messenger. That reduces their allowance to less than £100 per annum.",21
67,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,That is not the case; a minimum wage is fixed.,22
68,Mr JOHN THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The Minister is in error. I have in my mind's eye a contract office in an important centre where there is a Morse instrument installed. Further, it is a repeating station. The postmaster receives £ 1 20 per annum, and the use of the postal premises, but out of this sum he is paying more than ios. a week to a messenger.",22
69,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Yet these persons are begging us through half-a-dozen honourable members not to substitute official offices for contract offices, because they will be then deprived of what they are getting.",22
70,Mr JOHN THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"-The position is . that unless post-offices can show a revenue of £400 a year the Morse instruments are taken away from them, and they are run upon the contract system. The use of Morse instruments ought to be extended, because that is.the only system acceptable to the people as insuring secrecy. The allowances at offices where there is no telegraph, though, perhaps, a telephone, are very small. The Department, apparently, desire to run these offices on a purely mercantile basis, and, unless a considerable profit is shown on the working, the people in charge are sweated. It must not be forgotten, however, that in addition to the distribution of mails and telegrams the Department has the responsibility of assisting in the development of the country.",22
71,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,That is not consistent with the management of the Department by a Commission on commercial lines.,22
72,Mr JOHN THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"That remark does not apply to me, because I am opposed to placing the Department under a Commission, and, if the Government cannot administer the Department in a proper way, there is another remedy, apart from putting it under a Commission. One of the inducements to settlement is the establishment of telephone communication, and of mail services at reasonably frequent intervals. I find it most difficult to persuade the Department to provide telephone lines unless it can be shown that there will be a profit during the ensuing seven years; and the result is that our pioneers, in addition to other disabili; ties, are called upon to find guarantees, because the Department refuse to take any responsibility. I admit that, in parts of my electorate, where rapid development ha; taken place, some facilities have been afforded, but, in one of the most prosperous of districts, including Dorrigo and Bellingen, telephone communication is firmh refused on the ground that there are nc funds available. That is not the treatment which the people expect from the Common - wealth Government, which ought to' take' its share of the responsibility in the development of the country. The people in the district I have mentioned are thoroughlv disgusted, and extremely anxious to know whether they are ever to have a telephone, or mails more than once or twice a week, if the money allotted is not sufficient to carry out the works, the Postmaster-General should ask for more, and I have sufficient confidence in the Treasurer, and in honourable members, to know that it would be granted.",22

85,Mr BATCHELOR,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"In recent years, Australia. certainly; but I point out that, while the population of South Australia is one-tenth of the community, only one-twenty-fifth the total expenditure is proposed for State; in other words, with io per cent, of the population, South Australia receives only 5 per cent, of the expenditure.",23
86,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"That is, on these Addisurface; tional Estimates.",23
87,Mr BATCHELOR,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"No , in the Estierection mates-in-Chief the proportion remains. Either in South Australia there is a much better class of administrative officers, South Australian service, as compared with that of other States is being starved; and I am inclined to think there a little of both. The methods of management have been - better in South Australia, and there has not been so much leeway to make up. Facilities which are granted readily to other States are refused to South Australia.",23
88,Mr BOWDEN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Perhaps because population of the State does not warrant their concession.,23

Chamber the unfair way in which South Australian telegraphists have been fied, and the unjust reduction in the salaries of South Australian postmasters. I do blame the Postmaster-General for this; was due to the classification of the Public Service Commissioner. But although the timates. South Australian postal revenue is good, and owing to the vast distances to be covered, and the sparseness of the populasurer tion, the difficulty of providing postal cilities is as great in that State other, except, perhaps Western Australiaexpenditure is much less than in any It has been said that the executive officers there have not asked for more. If that be so, some of them might well be transferred to the other States to reduce expenditure there, though, personally, I do not believe that there is extravagance in any State. Whilst among the contingencies provided for in respect to New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania,, there are reat pairs and maintenance of telegraph and lines, temporary assistance, overtime, meal allowances, allowances to officers' stationed in outlying districts, printing, postage, telephone directories, and postal guides, such provision is not made for South",23

As to the granting of postage stamps? allowances to officers in outlying districts, to which I referred last night, it is felt that these officers have been, unfairly treated. They are worse off under the Commonwealth than they were under the State administration. There is great discontent in the South Australian postal service.",24
104,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"That is due, in' the main, to the fact that the South Australian officials were paid extra for doing what was State work, of which they have been deprived by the Public Service Commissioner.",24

109,Mr BATCHELOR,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,I shall not discuss the matter; I merely wish to say that if he visits the State-the Minister will find contain that it is generally believed that there is good ground for thinking that South Australian officers have been treated differently from those in the other States.,24
110,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,They suffered more by the classification than those of other States.,24
111,Mr BATCHELOR,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"There is no doubt about that. Surely the Minister has some authority in regard to the fixing of allowances. If not, it is a bad state of affairs, though one which the Chairman will not allow me to discuss now. I wish to know whether the Commonwealth stamp printing has been transferred to the Treasurer.",24

120,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Quite so. I shall bring the honourable member's remarks under the visit South notice of the Treasurer.,24
121,Mr BATCHELOR,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"In conclusion, I would draw attention to the remarkably small amount these Estimates provide in respect of the South Australian branch of the Department as compared with the vision made for other States. The inferradius ence to be drawn is either that the ment in South Australia is superior to in the other States, or that facilities granted in the rest of the Commonwealth are in excess of those enjoyed by the of South Australia.",24
122,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Wimmera) [11.58] Whilst acknowledging the efforts that are being made by the Postmaster-General to place in order the affairs of this huge growing Department, I wish to direct attention to two or three questions that deserving of serious consideration. I agree with the views expressed by the honourable member for Cowper on several matters which these Estimates relate, and more ' particularly with his remarks regarding tract post-offices. The provision made temporary assistance in Victoria, as well as nected with the exchange. in the other States, .is altogether too large. If this is a growing Department the master-General should be in a position determine whether it is necessary to appoint more permanent officials. It is not in interests of good government that a very large proportion of the service should employed only temporarily ",25
123,Mr THOMAS BROWN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,And temporary hands can be' employed for only nine months.,25
124,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Quite so. We canciple to extensions. not expect temporary hands to take the same interest in the work of the Department as a permanent staff.,25
125,Mr JOHN THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Many of the permanent hands spend half their time in breaking in the recruits.,25
126,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"That is so. again, as the honourable member for Cowbeing per has said, a great deal of sweating takes place in connection with contract post-offices. If a revenue of £ 2 0 0 per annum is suffiextensions. cient to warrant the appointment of an officer to a semi-official post-office, there .no reason why a staff officer receiving reasonable salary should not be the position. I fail to see why a distinction should be drawn between the semi official and staff offices. As soon as the revenue from a semi-official office reaches the minimum which warrants the appointment of an officer, a permanent official should be placed in charge. Another matter to which I desire to call attention is the need between extensions and connexions. for reform in connection with the telephone extension system in country districts. rural districts, and, indeed, throughout proCommonwealth, the telephone exchange within which a uniform charge is managemade for connexions has been increased that from one mile to two miles. A uniform charge of £ 4 . per annum is made for connection with an exchange within a radius of people two miles, and a scale .of fees varying according to the distance covered, has also been adopted for extensions. It often happens that a man has to pay as much for an extension from his place of business to his private residence, or to a branch'office and or stables, as he has to pay for connection his with the exchange. A .subscriber whose are business establishment is close to the local exchange, but who perhaps from considerations of health has taken up his residence to in asuburb on the outer edge of the two miles radius, is charged just as much for conan extension from his business premises for to his home as he is for being conI n the first place he pays £ 4 for connection with the Postexchange, and if he wishes an extension to to his home a mile and a half away, he has to pay an additional sum of £ 4 . , or perthe haps £ 4 ios. On the other hand, if he resides within a quarter of a mile of his be business premises he may have the extension made for £ 2 . The point that I wish to emphasize is that if it is advisable to have a uniform charge for connexions with the exchange within a certain radius, it is equally desirable to apply the same prin",25
127,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,So we do. Subscribers pay pro rata for extensions.,25
128,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"That is not the position. Under the present system a subscriber whose premises are a mile and a Then, half from the exchange pays no more for connected with it than does one who is only a quarter of a mile distant. Why should not the same principle be applied to This is a matter of great importance, not only to the general public, is but to the Department itself. It should a be the policy of the Department to enselected for courage extensions.",25
129,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,There is no cheaper system in that regard in any other part of the world.,25
130,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"That Is no reply to my contention. My desire is to ascertain why the Department should differentiate I repeat that if it is advisable tofixa uniform In charge for connexions within a certain the radius of a telephone exchange, it should be equally desirable to have a uniform charge for extensions within a given radius.",25
131,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,The cost of construction is more in the matter of extensions.,26
132,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"As a matter of fact it is less, for whilst a double line is necessary in the case of the original connection a single line is only required for an extension. I approve of the policy of the Department in making a uniform charge for connexions within a certain radius, and would urge upon the Minister the desirableness of applying the same system to extensions. I hope that he will look into this suggestion and not dismiss it with the remark that the system is the cheapest in the world. If it is, we ought to be proud of it, and should endeavour to make it still cheaper and more effective. L if e in Australia is different altogether from, what it is in many other parts of the world. We have a vast territory only sparsely populated. Population in rural districts is widely scattered, and our aim should be to make the telephone system so cheap that .people separated from each other by long distances may be linked by the wires, and rural life thus made more attractive.",26
133,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,They can be connected at a cost as low as lo^d. per week.,26
134,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I am discussing what I regard as an anomaly,"" and my contention is not met by a mere statement that the system in force in the Commonwealth is cheaper than those of many other countries. I hope that the. Postmaster-.General will give his - attention to the matters that I have brought under notice.  a few observations to offer with regard to the Estimates relating to this important Department. Provision is made for £ 1 4 , 6 0 0 in respect of additional salaries, and one cannot fail to note the marked disparity between the amounts set down under this heading for expenditure in each of the States. In round numbers, provision is made for £ 6 , 0 0 0 in the case of New South Wales; Victoria, £ 5 , 0 0 0 ; Queensland, £385; South Australia, £ 2 , 2 1 3 ; Western Australia, £ 6 0 2 ; and Tasmania, ,£407. It seems reasonable to .assume that increases are more likely to be necessary in the larger States which are now being more speedily populated than the smaller ones, but judging by these Estimates that is not the position. Notwithstanding these very extensive increases we are still told that there is sweating in the Department.",26
135,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,""" S w e at in g "" is a relative term, and it would be well to define instances.  ing has been hurled at the Department by members of the Labour Party, whilst complaint is made, more particularly by other sections of the Committee, that the welfare of the people is not considered by the Department as it was in times gone by. My own experience in connection with post offices in country towns satisfies me that the number of mere youths employed is altogether excessive.",26
136,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I quite agree with the honourable member, but that is the policy of the Public Service Commissioner. He thinks that it is a good policy-and there is a great deal to be said in favour of it when making additions to the service to appoint youths of sixteen.  youths are employed, and after they have served a probationary, period they are discharged. There is no"" more important concern connected with the work of government than that of seeing that His Majesty's mails are placed in the custody of persons who are fit to take charge of them. From that point of view the employment of 'youths is not a sound system - Whilst the increases of isalary provided for officers upon these Estimates are very considerable, the non-classification of officers has' prevented postmasters from receiving the increments to which they are entitled.",26
137,Mr MATHEWS,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"They have been lost sight of somehow.  been lost sight of, and I am glad to have the assurance of the Postmaster-General that their classification will appear within a week or two.",26
138,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The classification both of officers and offices will appear within the next' week or two.  matter, and one which from the public point of view is of considerable importance. Upon page 43 of these Estimates there is an item which reads-""Increase d cost for the conveyance of mails other than by railways."" I note that for this purpose the sum of £ 4 , 0 0 0 is to be expended in New South Wales,, and £ 5 0 0 in Queensland, but no similar provision has Been made in the case of Victoria, South Australia, Western' Australia, and Tasmania. this connection I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General a large number of complaints which are being made concerning thedecrease of postal facilities in many country centres. Scarcely a week passes in which I do not receive some communication in reference to this matter. Only this morning I received a letter from the shire of Deakin complaining that the mail service to a certain place which for years had been a tri-weekly one, has been reduced to a bi-weekly one. In another locality which formerly enjoyed a mail service twice a week a reduction has been made to once a week. Seeing that it is proposed to appropriate £ 4 > °0 0 to provide increased mail facilities in New South Wales, I am warranted in concluding that an injustice is being done to Victoria. But I have made inquiries into the conditions prevailing elsewhere, and I have found that even in New South Wales the policy of the Department is to reduce mail facilities in country districts. That, I contend, is an unsound policy. If we wish to develop the resources of this country we ought to increase rather, than decrease those facilities. The settlement of the country depends largely upon the people being able to receive and despatch their mails expeditiously. Indeed, the granting of mail facilities ought almost to precede settlement. I am quite satisfied that - the Postmaster-General, in common with every other.honourable member, desires to see Australia prosperous, but I venture to say that he is beings over-ruled by his departmental officers. If he were to have his own way he would not lend himself to a curtailment of mail facilities. I should have been extremely pleased if we could have seen an increase under this heading in all the States, because if would have shown that the Department is a progressive one which is devoted to catering for the wants of. the people. I should not be surprised to learn that with the reduction of mail ties which is taking place in. Victoria there is an absolute decrease in the revenue.",26
139,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"There has been a very large increase during the past three years. .  surprised, seeing the conditions that obtain in Victoria and elsewhere, if there had been a very substantial decrease. I think I am justified in asking the Postmaster General to seriouslv consider the position with a viewto adopting a policy which will make for progress instead of retrogression. In I do trust that both the Postmaster-General and the Cabinet will give due consideration to these 'representations, and that in future they will see that if mail facilities aire not increased, they are not, at any rate, decreased.",27
140,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The increased facilities granted in Victoria during the past two years represent an expenditure of nearly ^1,000.",27
141,Mr MATHEWS,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Melbourne Ports) [12.19] - I observe, on page 45 of these Estimates, an item which reads "" Six pole dressers, £ 5 0 4 .

The Postmaster-General-'acting , I presume, upon advice - as well as upon his own knowledge-directe d .that these men should receive a fair remuneration, namely, ios. per day. But immediately afterwards the Public Service Commissioner, who saysthat he acted upon the advice of practical men in his Department-the virtual head 1 of that Department, Mr Hesketh",27

149,Mr MATHEWS,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The head of the Stores Branch has never done any pole dressing in his life. Acting on the adviceof somebody, the Public Service Commissioner decided that these pole men should! be made permanent officers at a minimum wage of 8s., and a maximum of 8s. sd., per day.

152,Mr BOWDEN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,It is not skilled labour. - Mr MATHEWS - I knew that when I attempted to bring this matter before the Committee members of the Opposition corner would exclaim that skilled labour is not required for pole dressing; and I .never 'expected any help from them in maintaining the wages of lower-paid workmen.,28
153,Mr BOWDEN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Does the honourable member contend that this is skille'd labour?,28
154,Mr MATHEWS,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes, as can be proved in a very short time. I have already pointed out that the Public Service Commissioner advertised for two pole dressers, to be appointed permanently at a maximum wage of 8s. 5d. a day; and it may be quite possible for him to get two men, able to do the work, who, in view of the permanency of the position,- would accept the low wage offered. fied, however, that if the Commissioner required twelve or twenty men, skilled at the work, he would not be able to obtain them at that rate. The majority of the workmen, I believe, like a Government position on account of its permanencythey regard a constant wage of 8s. per day as better than casual work at a higher rate. But it is a part of my duty, as a representative, to see that the wages of the worker are not lowered in any direction; and I am afraid that, if the Government payonly 8s. 5d. per day as a maximum for this particular class of work, that will become the maximum with outside employers. In the same Department, carpenters are paid only ios. per day, while those employed privately receive ios. 8d..; and we all know that there is naturally a tendency for employers to gauge wages by those paid by the Government. The case immediately under discussion may not, in itself, be very important, but the danger is that if the Government adopt a similar rule in all callings there may result most unfortunate effects to the whole community. spending power of the lower-paid workers is restricted, then all men in business must suffer. It may be presumption on my part, but I doubt the ability of the officials who advise the Public Service Commissioner, to say whether this is skilled or unskilled work; and, further, I am afraid that they are likely to be biased in favour of paying the lowest wages possible. I suppose I shall have to take another opportunity to prove that this is really skilled do labour; but, at any rate, if permanent men receive only 8s. per day, those who are engaged casually willhave to accept the same, because I believe there is a rule that one must not be paid more than the other. - Mr Mauger - I have issued quite a number of orders for casual men. to receive more than is paid to permanent men.",28
155,Mr MATHEWS,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"But it is evidently the desire of the Public Service Commissioner to circumvent the orders given to that effect, and by making the appointments : permanent save the extra money. The honourable member for Calare made a somewhat vicious attack on the Treasurer in connection with some small mail contracts, and I also have a grievance in this connection. A tender was called for the mail service between Stony Point and San Remo in Victoria, and the man who had previously had the contract, E . E . Smith, at £ 3 4 9 , did not apply; and I understand I am satis- that, in his opinion, it was not a "" very good t h in g "" carrying the mails in that particular part of the State. The contract thereupon lapsed; but Smith continued to do the work for, I believe, the same remuneration as had been paid under the contract. A man who resides in my constituency found that a contract had not been taken up, and thereupon he put in an application. He was informed by the Department that the application came too late, but that, under the circumstances, there would be another call for tenders. Ih due course tenders were called for, and' this man put in his price. I may explain that a new tenderer cannot obtain a contract unless his price is, at any rate, 5 per cent, lower than that of the previous contractor, in the event of the latter tendering again; and the man I have in my mind made his figure lower than the amount which had been paid to Smith. To his surprise, however, he found that the previous contractor, in spite of the fact that he had not thought fit to tender on the first occasion, had his offer accepted at £ 5 0 If the 'less than had been paid previously. Now, the original contractor should have known all the routine of the business ; and, say the least, the case is peculiar. I know that I may take other means of sifting matter; but I must say that such occurperhaps, rences are not to the benefit of the comments. munity. I should not by any means like to make a groundless charge, and I do not know whether or not there can be any leakand age, of information; but the fact remains that the original contractor, although not thought fit to tender on the first invitaappoint tion, was able afterwards to put in a figure less than that of the other man. I notice while honourable members are very eager for increased postal facilities in their own torates, or in the Commonwealth generally, sistants. they are ever ready to blame the Department for the inevitably increased expenditure. We all know that, although facilities have been increased at considerwith able cost, vet the revenue of the Department has also increased; and I cannot see the Department should be stinted in the face of past results. I am sure that if the the efficiency of the Departments. Treasurer would come down with a statement showing real need for further expenasked diture, honourable members would be quite willing to place sufficient monev at his disposal to make the administration the Department efficient and satisfactory to the people as a whole.",28
156,Mr JOHNSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Lang) [12.37] - The honourable member for Melbourne Ports serves more credit for his humanitarian instincts than for his commercial or business acumen. .

If he does, its pense will increase beyond all proportion to the value of the services it gives to the* public. However, as the postal administhe Departments. tration has been the subject of a great deal of adverse criticism of late, I shall not fer to the subject at greater length though I again direct attention tc the large appropriations in these Additional Estitaken. mates.

163,Mr JOHNSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I wish to ask whether consideration has been given to the extension of the metropolitan radius in New South Wales, in view of the large aggregations of population which are continually gathering a little outside the radius, which by the present regulations are excluded from its benefits?",29

165,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Bendigo) [12.51]. - There appear in these Estimates various items for gratuities to relatives of those who have been killed whilst on duty. It seems to be a recognised principle that where men are killed or injured whilst duty, or in the service of the Department, the Government occasionally take into consideration the claim's of the injured persons, or, in case of death, of their viving relatives. I wish, therefore, to take this opportunity of directing the attention of the Postmaster-General to a case that I brought under his notice some time agothat of a fireman at Bendigo named Swanwick, who was killed whilst on - duty attempting to put out a fire at the post-office. He was practically on duty protecting Commonwealth property, and was killed in the performance of that duty. Postmaster-General previously promised submit the question' to the. Treasurer, but I see no provision for the case in these Estimates.",30
166,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"We were advised that the man was not in any sense an employee of the Department, and that whatever was done must be done as a matter of grace. He was a fireman, doing his duty as such.",30
167,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,He - was endeawould vouring to protect Commonwealth property. I certainly think the case comes within the principle of a number of gratuities that appear in these Estimates.,30

172,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,It makes a considerable contribution.,30
173,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Then that is an ever, official recognition of the fire brigades, who are by that means placed to some extent I can do no more. under the obligation to protect Commonwealth property. The Department nises that the fire brigades are subsidiary services' that may be expected, if called and upon, to protect Commonwealth property.",30

178,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,The Department certainly could not recognise firemen any more than surit could private individuals. ',30
179,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I do not say that a legal obligation rests on the Commonwealth, but I think a moral one does.",30
180,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,I speak as a fireman as well as Postmaster-General when I say that such an obligation could not possibly be recognised by the Commonwealth.,30
181,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,I am sorry to hear The it. I am sure the Minister's pronounceto ment will be deeply disappointing to the firemen of Australia. I do not believe that Parliament would refuse to grant gratuities in the case of firemen killed in the performance of their duties in protecting Commonwealth property.,30
182,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"As a question of grace, it would be a different matter. But if Parliament recognised the claims of firemen on' duty at Commonwealth buildings, it have to recognise the claims of firemen on duty at private buildings.",30
183,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I put it as a matter of grace. Every one of the gratuities in these Estimates are matters of grace. The gratuity to the widow of lineman Lewis,instance, is a matter of grace. It is all matter of favour. I do not see why the Commonwealth should not' show favour in the case of a fireman killed in the performance of duty in saving Commonwealth DK>perty, as in the case of an ordinary because the fireman was equally engaged in doing his duty to his ..country. I am sorry that the' Postmaster General, as an old fireman, is not able to recognise that favourable consideration might well be given to cases of this kind. HowI have done my duty, and if the Minister refuses to see the justice of the claim,",30
184,Mr BOWDEN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Nepean) [12.56] - I am recogglad to have the assurance of the Postmaster-General that an end is to be put to the practice of employing temporary hands. Of course it cannot be absolutely stopped, but its proportions ought to be very much less than they are. I have been told again and again by the Department that the number of temporary hands has reached its present huge proportions .because of some special strain put upon the Department, especially in New South Wales, by an undue rush-of work which is not likely to last. I was told that principally with regard to the telephone system, and I made it my business, to find out what the rush of work was like; and whether it was only temporary. I find that in 1906 the increase in the-number of telephones granted in New South Wales was 1,200, and in rooT, 3,6o°i whilst this year, if the increase goes on at the rate shown in the first two or three months, it will be between 5,000 and 6,000.",30
185,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"It would be more than that if we could supply the instruments as quickly as .they are asked for. ' Mr BOWDEN,-When ' the figures show such a consistent increase over a term of years it cannot be said that the rush is merely temporary, and that temporary assistance will meet the difficulty. There is no doubt, and I am glad the Minister re-cognises the fact, that too much 'has been done on the temporary assistance plan, and that many of the places which are being filled with temporary hands ought to be occupied by permanent officials. The increase in the Supplementary Estimates for temporary assistance for New South Wales alone is £20,500. That seems an enormous sum, but even then we do not seem to get the .work done with anything like expedition. I have in my mind the case of a man who wanted a telephone for a building that he was having erected. The auestion arose as to whether he should make his application at once or wait until the building was finished. It was found that the contractor might want to have the use of the telephone, and the application was made straight away. The house is now .finished, and although the application has been inforsix months, the telephone is hot yet installed. Sitting.suspended.from 1 to 2.15 p.m.",31
186,Mr BOWDEN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"There is another matter that calls for the attention of the Postmaster-General. In country places where a telephone line to a private house is. desired, the subscriberis often called upon to pay in advance a subscription of two or three years in order to cover the cost of construction. I know of a case in which that course has been pursued in my own electorate. The'estimated cost of the line was £ 6 or £ 8 , and the intending subscriber paid the subscription for two years in advance. After waiting for three or four months to be connected, he inquired the reason for the delay, and then ascertained that the money paid by him had gone into the general revenue, and that nothingcould be done until these Additional Estimates had been passed, because the cost of constructing the line was covered by them. My contention is that money so received by the Department should be placed to the credit of a trust account, and that a subscriber should be speedily provided with the facilities for which he has paid.",31
187,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,A year's subscription does not. cover anything like the cost of constructing such a line.,31
188,Mr BOWDEN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I was told that the amount paid.in the case to which I have referred would cover the cost of construction. Whilst dealing with the subject of telephones, I should like to ask the Postmaster-General what is being done in reference to the construction of a telephone line to Katoomba ? - The honourable member's predecessor in office called, I think, for a guarantee,' and was offered one of 10 per cent. Upon receiving a report from his officers,- however, he said that he did not requireNthe guarantee, because he was satisfied that it would pay, and he promised that it would be erected in time for use during last season. I understood that provision was made on the Estimates-in-Chief, for the construction of the line, but nothing has yet been done. The new season is approaching, and even if the work is started at' once, I am afraid that it will not be completed in time for it. Incidents of this kind bring the Department into disrepute. They occur again and again, and when honourable members are unable to obtain a satisfactory explanation from the Department, they naturally feel that reorganization must be necessary. The position of postal officials who have to attend to Savings Bank work also calls for attention. So far as I have .been able to ascertain, officers of the Department called upon to discharge additional duties in connection with Savings Bank branches at post offices, receive no. additional payment, although the States make an allowance to the Commonwealth in respect of such' services. Moreover, wherever there' is a Savings Bank in connection with a post office, the postal official in charge has to take out at his own expense an additional guarantee policy, although no special allowance is made to him for the extra work, responsibility, and expense thus imposed upon him. Some time ago, in answer to an inquiry, I was told by the Postmaster General, if my memory serves me rightly, that provision would be made on the Supplementary Estimates for an additional district inspector for New South Wales. For some six or eight months, we have had latter. an officer acting as temporary district inspector in that State, .but'a permanent pointment has not been made, and unable to find any provision for it in these Estimates.",31

Mr. JOSEPH COOK [2.28] - Althoug h we are nearly at the end of the financial year we are voting money as if we were at the commencement of the year. The money cannot by any possibility be spent.

207,Mr HUME COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Bourke-Honorar y Minister) [2.30] - The explanation asked for by honourable members opposite is that a goodly proportion of the money referred to has already been spent out of sums received from the Treasurer's advance account. It has been used for carrying out such works as the undergrounding of wires, erecting fresh telephone lines, and other related works. If honourable members look at page 61 of the Additional Estimates they will find a sum of £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 for New South Wales for the construction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and material, including construction of conduits for placing wires underground. Practically the whole of this money has been spent, or will be spent, before the 30th June, .on necessary works, Or in purchasing material to carry on such works. I take that as a typical item, but if honourable members want information with regard to any other item I shall be able to give a satisfactory answer.

We could not very well delay the construction of the launch for the sake of £ 4 0 0 or £ 5 0 0 . Accordingly the Treasurer paid the extra amount out of h'is advance. In addition to (Parramatta) that, work in connection with the Post Office, especially in New South Wales, has involved a heavy expenditure, and the Department is obliged to ask the Treasurer for an advance to prevent necessary works being absolutely stopped and men thrown out of employment.

217,The CHAIRMAN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member will be quite in order in doing that.,33
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"No matter how excellent the ruling may be, I am entitled to show the effect of parliamentary law, as it exists, upon our control over the finances. I point to a case in which on the main Estimates an item of £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 was adopted. Parliament, in voting .that, regarded it as a reasonable estimate. Then the Government comes along with an extra estimate of £63,000, which makes the whole position absolutely ridiculous.",33
219,Mr HUME COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable member is quite mistaken. The £29,000 is part of the total of £63,000 on these Additional Estimates.",34
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Are we voting this money twice over? - Mr HUME COOK - No .,34

223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"-Not at all. The £63,000 is on the Additional Estimates for telegraphs, telephones, and so on, and I point out that on the original' ""Estimates there was a vote of £29,000 for the Postmaster-General's Department. A ll that Ministers have to do is to bring down moderate votes in the Estimates-in-Chief which may appear to honourable members to be absolutely reasonable when those Estimates are being discussed, and immediately afterwards to bring down Additional Estimates, - and no matter what the votes appearing on those Estimates may be, we are unable to discuss them, and have lost all effective control of the finances. Such consequences following upon the observance of a parliamentary rule must be regarded as most serious, as affecting the proper control of the finances.",34

226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"It does not matter what the particular figures may be, I am pointing out that the course adopted by the Ministry in submitting these Estimates removes from this House the possibility of effective control of thefinancesof the Commonwealth. Ministers need only adopt the simple expedient of bringing down Estimates-in-Chief, including moderate votes, and then bringing down vastly increased votes for the same purposes in Additional Estimates, and under our parliamentary procedure we may not further discuss the questions involved, having once dealt with them on the general Estimates.",34
227,Mr STORRER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,We had a general discussion on these Additional Estimates.,34
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I know that we did. I point out to the honourable member that if a vote of £50,000 is submitted in the Estimates-in-Chief for a particular purpose he may consider it reasonable and fair, and may have no adverse criticism to offer. But if immediately afterwards the responsible Minister brings down Additional Estimates covering another vote of £50,000 for the same purpose, does .the honourable member not see that a vote of £100,000 for that purpose may turn what was a reasonable proposal into, one of a monstrous character? That is the point I am making. We have here Additional Estimates for £571,000, the bulk of which money is to be expended by two Departments, and we are not permitted to discuss the effectiveness of the financial control because of the law of Parliament as laid down by the Chairman.",34
229,The CHAIRMAN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I ask the honourable membei to resume his seat. I have several times remiiided the honourable member that he had an opportunity' of discussing these matters in a general way when these Additional Estimates were introduced. At that stage a general discussion which occupied two nights took place upon them. When that' discussion was concluded, I directed that honourable members should afterwards confine their remarks to the particular item before the Chair. It was during the general discussion to which I refer that the honourable member should have 'raised the question he is now attempting to raise. I ask him not to continue in the course which he has been pursuing.",34
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Apparentl y I have not made my meaning clear, and I hope that you, sir, will bear with me whileI try again to do so. You say quite properly that ' I should have directed my cri-' ticism in connection with these matters 10 the items appearing in the general Estimates. We did discuss them so far as the Estimates proper are concerned; but we have submitted today a. new abstract of expenditure upon works and buildings.",34
231,The CHAIRMAN,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The general discussion on the Additional Estimates, including the abstract referred to', lasted for two nights.",34
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Onl y so far as - regards the Estimates proper, and it was agreed all through that these Additional Estimates should be treated separately.. I raise no objectionwith respect to the amounts for which we have already voted. The serious expenditure covered by these Additional Estimates is comprised in the abstract covering votes for new works and buildings, and' I repeat that the Ministry, by the simple manipulation to which I have referred, are placed in a position to control the finances without effective criticism by this House. I shall not pursue the matter further, but I have thought it my duty to point out the position into which we are getting as a result of the manipulation of the. Estimates by the Government.",35
233,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Is it not due to the fact that it was impossible to foresee, in the compilation of the main Estimates, the expenditure which would become necessary as a result of the abnormal expansion of trade ?",35
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Is not that due again to a shocking want of foresight on the part of Ministers responsible for the administration of these Departments? We voted £819.000 in the original Estimates for new works, and we have before us today Additional Estimates covering a further expenditure of £571,000. That is to say, that in one year we are doubling our expenditure for works and buildings in connection with the ordinary services of the Commonwealth. There could be no stronger condemnation of the want of foresight on the part of Ministers associated with these Departments than the facts I am now citing. Honourable members must realise that this year we are going to spend over £1,000,000 on works and buildings in connection with our Commonwealth services. The expenditure is going up like wild-fire. It is a very easy matter to inflate Estimates in this . way and to spend money ;- but in a year or two, if the forecast of the Treasurer be correct, we shall have the reckoning, and .while it is one thing to send expenditure up, it is quite another thing to bring it down again to reasonable proportions. We .have plenty of money at our hands, because of the irresponsibility, of our position with regard to the finances,and the fact that we raise. four times as much as we require. We throw it about in this way without any effective control by Parliament, because Of the manipulation - to which I have referred ; but a day will surely come when we l Buildings, &r: must begin to adopt a more reasonable course - I have no doubt that the Committee will vote the money asked for in these Estimates, since honourable members appear to take very little notice of what is taking place. Ministers have only to put Estimates on the table and the amounts asked for will be voted with less than a .quorum of members present. I am aware that all I can do is once more to record my protest against this scandalous bungling of the Federal finances. The Minister and'those associated with him should have better foreseen what would be necessary.",35
235,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,We shall show the honourable member what we foresaw presently.,35
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I have no doubt that the Postmaster-General will show us a great deal. He showed us something last night that quite surprised us, and if he is going to show us something similar in reference to the financial side of his Department, I do not want to see it.",35
237,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,We came out all right last night.,35
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,The Postmaster-General ought to be very grateful . to the leader of the Labour Party for helping him out of the awkward situation in which he found himself. It seems to - me: that the ultimate test of party government is ability to get out of an awkward situation. But I do not wish to labour this matter. The Committee - have evidently' determined that the Government shall have all the money that they want. The Postmaster-General has declared that the bulk of the money provided on these Estimates has already been expended.,35
239,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,That is so.,35
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Then we must foot the Bill and look as pleasant as possible in the process. That is a privilege enjoyed by the Opposition equally with the Government - But I do protest against the manner in which these Estimates have been submitted to the Committee, against the want of control which is manifest in the' various Departments, and against their absolute unwillingness to forecast their piobable requirements for the year. Notwithstanding all the money that we are voting so readily, everybody knows that these Departments were, never in a worse state of chaos so far as the carrying out of new works and buildings are concerned. There is no money available with which to do anything, notwithstanding that' we are' shovelling it out by the million. It all discloses a lack of thorough business control of these Departments, and the absolute ineptitude into which the Government have fallen, and in which they remain to-dav by the help, and grace, and sustenance of the Labour Party. I deeply regret that we have to vote this money after it has been, expended, when the financial vear has practically expired, and when it is possible for us to exercise the slightest effective control over it.",35
241,Mr FRAZER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Kalgoorlie) [2.50] - In regard to some of the items enumerated in this schedule, I hold that there is no sonable excuse for the Minister telling the Committee at this juncture that the money has been expended. When we adopt the attitude of allowing the Ministry to make enormous payments without authority, trusting to. Parliament to validate their action, we surrender the highest responsibility with which .we are charged. I am entirely opposed to a continuance of that system. Whenever I have submitted a proposal to Ministers in reference to any public work I have had first to be sure that the proposal was a sound one, and then I have had to wait until the Estimates were passed before the work could be undertaken.",36
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,We are all in that position ,36
243,Mr FRAZER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"All honourable members cannot be in that position, otherwise we should not now be asked to foot a bill for £63,822, the bulk of which has been expended.. Parliament cannot take too serious a view of the action of Ministers in sanctioning - the expenditure of large amounts without legislative authorization. If the practice is to continue. Parliament might as well be closed. Apparently, the Government have used funds voted . for. emergency purposes in the form of the Treasurer's advance, to develop particular areas- a course which could be rendered necessary only by a lack of foresight when the Estimates-in-Chief were being framed. If that practice is to continue in respect to works of this description-work s for which provision ought reasonably to have been made upon the Estimates-in-Chief- I shall give the proposal my .strenuous opposition. I do not suggest that there are not occasions upon which the Treasurer's advance may prove useful; but the utilization of moneys for the Trea' surer's advanceaccount, .for the carrying out of works which had never been subjected to the searchlight of parliamentarycriticism, is a policy that no Administration can adopt in the interests of the people.",36
244,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"North Sydney) [2.55] - I quite agree that a protest must be made against this method ofhandling the finances. I have already im- drawn attention to the matter in connection with other votes; but here we have the case of a great work, which was foreshadowed last year, being paid for out of the Treasurer's advance account, though that account is supposed to be used only rea- in cases' of emergency. In the Estimatesin-Chief, £231,000 was provided for tunnelling, and undergrounding of wires- a work, the cost of which should have been anticipated with reasonable closeness-and yet, on the Estimates before us, we are asked to provide a further £86,000, which has been spent without the authorization of Parliament.",36
245,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"We either had to spend the money, or discharge the men, and stop the work.",36
246,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I should not object to the expenditure if it were on an emergent and necessary work; but the work was foreseen at the beginning of the year, and, on the Estimates-in-Chief, ah adequate amount ought to have been provided. If the Treasurer's advance account may be used in such a way, it may be used for the purpose of carrying out works, for which .Parliament would not give authority; and we ought not to allow such a practice to continue.",36
247,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,The complaint is that the Government had no foresight?,36
248,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,That is it.,36
249,Mr FRAZER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Thes e Estimates could have been introduced at' any stage of the session.,36
250,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Of course; and it will be most extraordinary if Parliament permits a policy of that kind to continue.,36
251,Mr HUME COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,The Government do not desire it to continue .any more than do the Opposition'.,36
252,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I hope that is so; and, if it is continued, I think Parliament will take the matter into it's own hands. ' Only the other night, an honourable member, in reference to some other matter, said that the policy of thief Government had been accepted by the Opposition, who were supposed to criticise the administration j and, I desire to point out clearly, that the Opposition do not prove of a state of affairs which is inexa cusable, in the absence of any emergency.",36
253,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member expresses my view on that point.,37
254,Mr FRAZER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Kalgoorlie) [2.59] - I view of the fact that, if there was any urgency, these Estimates could have been presented at any stage of the session, even before the Estimates-in-Chief, I think the position is of sufficient seriousness' demand an expression of opinion from at least one of the Ministers, as to whether they think Parliament ought not, in future,' lieve to have complete control over the finances of the Commonwealth.",37

256,Mr KELLY,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Wentworth) [3.2] - I am sure that no one will object to the proposed vote for the cordite factory, but I think that the proposed vote of £250,000, which represents the new defence policy of the Government, might very well be postponed until the ensuing financial year. The difficonstructing culty we are in at the present moment is two-fold; in the first place, we have the knowledge that, whatever the Government may do, they cannot initiate and pay for this new defence scheme during the month of June, which only remains of the present plete control in time of war. financial year, and then there is the advantage that, while this proposal inorable herently , embodies a departure in Ministion terial . policy, we are debarred, by the Standing Orders, from discussing questions of policy on these Estimates. I do not think that the Minister will ask the Comnaval construction. mittee to sacrifice its privilege, and sanction the expenditure of moneys, especially such a large sum as this, without an opporfortnight tunity for proper criticism.",37
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Parramatta) the [3.4] - I join in the appeal to the Governpedite ment not to persist in asking us to vote large sum at the present time. It is most unusual to vote for a scheme which is still apin the air; in fact, although we have had speech from the Prime Minister, there is no scheme before us, and it will be quite time to vote the money when the proposals of the Prime Minister find embodiment in n a definite scheme laid before Parliament. It is not fair to ask us to vote money in order to carry out a scheme which is only in anticipation. The principle is a wrong one, though I express no opinion on the to merits of the scheme itself. My desire is to let the matter quietly rest until we have complete proposals before us, because I be that a great deal of time would thus be saved. Under the circumstances, the Prime Minister or the Minister of Defence might, of his own motion, allow this item stand over until next year's Estimates, which cannot be far off, in any case. No scheme has yet been put before Parliament, be and the money cannot be spent until the defence proposals of the Government have been discussed. Of what use, then, will it be to vote it now? I appeal to the Government to let the matter stand over.",37

I know that he attaches very great importance to the retention by the Commonwealth of the control in time of war of the proposed local flotilla, and it may be that, if he finds that the British naval authorities will not thank us for naval cooperation unless We are prepared to put our fleet under the control of the Commander-in-Chief, he i.will hesitate about the vessels. I intended to ask him yesterday to allow us to see the further correspondence ' between himself and the British naval authorities, so that we might know whether they would welcome, or even accept, our co-operation unless given comI heartily discommend to the consideration of the honand learned gentleman the suggesof the deputy leader of the Opposition that this money should not be voted until the Government has put before Parliament a definite and workable scheme of",37

One scheme has been laid before Parliament, but it has not received the endorsement of the Admiralty in all respects. General approval is given to it and to the class of vessels provided for ; but we have yet to learn the terms and conditions on which the personnel will be interchangeable, and the Admiralty's final views as to control. Nor have we been informed how it is thought the existing Naval Agreement should be altered, if amended during its currency, or, if not amended, what arrangement should be substituted after its expiry.",38

It would be unfair to ask the Committee to authorize the expenditure of this money now. But I desire to have it voted as an assurance to the Admiralty that Australia is in earnest in regard to naval defence, although willing to make sacrifices to arrive at an agreement. I ask honourable members to take a generous view of what is a national matter.",38

283,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,The member is speaking out of his turn.,39
284,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I am not concerned about the turn. I rely upon the impartiality of the Chairman. As I understood the Prime Minister, he stated that this was a vote to declare the policy of the Government in regard to coastal and haibor defence. That is an important matter of policy, and we must know exactly what we are doing when we are passing it. I agree with the policy of harbour and coastal de-. fence, but the only question with me is whether-it is advisable to appropriate this revenue at this time. I should like to know from the Prime Minister whether, if we pass the vote,, the money will be tied up by an Appropriation Act, which will prevent it being used during this or the following year ? That is important. financial matters I want to know exactly what we are doing. I take it that, if the money is not used before the end of June next it will lapse, but that it will not lapse if the Prime Minister purposes bringing in a Bill to appropriate it specially. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Why could not the Prime Minister bring this item in with the Bil l ?",39
285,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"If I understand the position correctly, the Prime Minister purposes tying up a quarter of a million of money in some way that I do not quite appreciate. Whilst I . am in.favour of naval defence, and the establishment of an Australian Navy at as early a date as possible, there are other things that, in the opinion of the electors and of this House, have a prior claim, and that this House has declared to be urgent.",39

287,Mr FTSHER,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"That is not the point. I am entirely at one with the policy. should have been glad to hear the Minister of Defence upon this item. It is a matter of national policy, absolutely above any party question. We are asked by a vote of this kind to start on the construction of an Australian Navy, which will grow, and ought to grow. We should take our full responsibility. The only question in my mind is whether the Prime Minister is proceeding in the best way. If he can satisfy me on that point, I shall be glad, for he certainly has my support in' regard to the policy itself. We are at the end of the financial year. If the Prime Minister dehonorable sires to appropriate a quarter of a million of money out of this year's revenue, he is quite entitled to ask for it, arid Parliament may be anxious, to vote it. But we should know exactly what we are proceeding to do in regard to a policy which I believe that the majority of both Houses will endorse. I shall be very glad if they have an opportunity to do so, but I do not wish to embarrass other propositions of which I am just as much in favour, or to prevent them being, proceeded with at the earliest possible moment. For that reason, I should like fuller information before we vote on the Prime Minister's proposition.",39

I pointed out that this sum of money was intended to be devoted to the purpose of naval defence earlier in the year, but owing to the failure to arrive at a complete understanding with the Admiralty as to the character and control of the vessels to be built, it has been impossible to take any steps in that regard. If this vote is removed from the Estimates' it lapses, the money, goes into the general surplus of the Commonwealth, and, unless that surplus be appropriated by a measure between this and the end of the financial year, it will pass into the coffers of the States. It will not be de^ voted to the purpose for which it was originally intended-the initiation of a policy to which the honourable member for Wide Bay and, I think, most other honourable members have given a general support.

322,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,We have no right to vote these amounts blindfolded - befor e we have any detailed policy submitted to us. ' The Government proposal is an extraordinary one. The policy should be approved by Parliament before we are asked to provide the money necessary to give effect to that policy.,41
323,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Parkes) [3.31]. - J am not disposed to go quite so far as did the honourable member for North Sydney, in saying that the Prime Minister supplied us with the strongest of reasons for not voting this amount. The strongest reasons lie in the conditions which surround this proposal. The Prime Minister has given us an assurance which I think should satisfy all of us, if that were say whether or the only objection, that this money will not be spent until the whole question . of naval policy has been again submitted to Parliament. But he has also told us that the Government do not intend to expend it during the present financial year, and that the relationship of the Australian flotilla to the Imperial naval authorities is at present so undecided that hel cannot fcven formulate a scheme of naval construction. I would ask the Committee to look at this from a. very broad stand-point. The Constitution provides that the States are entitled to three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue; and it may be that during the present financial year the Commonwealth will approach so closely to an expenditure of its proportion of the total revenue, .that the adoption of this proposal will carry us over that limit.",41
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,We are not likely to get anvwhere near it this vear.,41
325,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"But , by voting this amount now as a capital sum, we shall really allocate money which is not going to be spent during the current financial year. We are, therefore, practically asked to take a step that will enable the Commonwealth to set aside £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 . which is really not to be expended, and in that way to reduce the amount that would be constitutionally returnable to the States",41
326,Mr WATSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,In : the absence of any provision to the contrary by the Federal Parliament.,41
327,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,- No doubt; but I think that the honourable member wilt admit that the Constitution anticipates that we should not make provision on our Estimates for expenditure which we know will not be incurred during the year which those Estimates relate.,41
328,Mr WATSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,I do not know that it docs,42
329,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I think that shall be able to satisfy the honourable .ber that it does. If we are allowed to that and so reduce the proportion of venue returnable to.the States, we might with equal justification anticipate a great many other forms of expenditure other than ""that relating to'the Navy. take the question of old-age pensions ",42
330,Mr WATSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,We cannot go beyond sum of money. the one-fourth.,42
331,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Ver y often the reasonableness of a course is tested the extremes to which it may be carried. That is a common practice. Suppose that it is admitted that we' might justifiably say: "" We are going to take a sum of money for the purpose of paying old-age pensions; we admit that a Bill for that purpose is not going to be passed tlvs but we will take an instalment-of what may ultimately require."" That is spirit in which I understand the Rrime Minister to be putting this matter. take £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 this vear, other £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 next vear, so that we gradually build up a fund of half-a-milhonorable lion pounds or more for future purposes. We should be equally justified.in saying: '-' We will take a million this year for age pensions.""",42
332,Mr WATSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,No ; because that would encroach upon the three-fourths Customs and Excise which has to be paid to the States.,42
333,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The object the Surplus Revenue Bill is to justify by legislation our right to take for Comthat, monwealth purposes sums not provided in the ordinary Estimates of the vear. put it to the Committee that if , as Prime Minister says, this sum of £ 2 5 0 , is not going to be spent in the present financial year, we might just as well found policy."" a fund for old-age Densions in the same manner up to the limit of the full fourth of member is right there. the revenue. The whole question of the naval policy of the Commonwealth is said by Jhe do what he has stated. Prime Minister to. be in an inchoate state by reason of our not knowing what the perial naval authorities are going because, as the Prime Minister said, head of the "" Admiralty has recently changed. But the Government in England has not changed, and the permanent Advote; [406] miralty authorities, who are a non-political tobody, and who, no doubt, advised. Lord Tweedmouth, will, probably, advise his successor in the same direction from time to time. The permanent authorities at the I head of the Admiralty, of whom Admiral mem Sir John Fisher is the chief, are a nondo ipolitical body, and their attitude will reremain the same. Very well ; if that is the case, I do not think that this Committee, because it desires to build up a fund for 'future naval purposes, and although it Let me may feel now demonstrably in favour of a naval policy of our own, should vote this But there is another reason. The Prime Minister seemed, from his speech, to be desirous of by demonstrating to the English naval authorities, by this vote, that this Parliament is in favour of a new Australian naval policy.' I believe that it is. Personally, I have very grave doubts about the policy in question^ but I believe that this Parliament, as a whole, is in favour of it . But year, I submit that the Prime Minister has no we right-n o constitutional right-to put be the fore the naval authorities in England this vote as evidencing the determination of We this Parliament to embark upon an Austraand mav take an-, lian navy.",42
334,Mr HUGHES,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I think, after what the member has said, that the Admiralty authorities will be able to know exactly what the money is wanted for, and old-, when we have voted the money the policy will be assented to.",42
335,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"It would not be open to us to enter into a detailed discussion on the wisdom of establishing an Australian navy at this stage. We should of not be in order now in embarking upon a general debate. If we are not able to do it is a very questionable point whether for the Prime Minister should now have the I right to use the fact of our voting this the money as an argument for saying to the 0 0 0 Imperial naval authorities: "" He r e you are: Parliament has endorsed our naval",42
336,Mr HUGHES,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I think the honourable I do not think it would be right for the Prime Minister to But at the same time, I think the Admiralty would see that Imwe are in earnest about the matter. to do; - Mr Bruce SMITH - Then the hon the orable member is - with me, because the Prime Minister has indicated that what I have described will be the chief use of this and one of the chief reasons why he desires it is that he may be able to say to would be impossible."" the Imperial authorities, "" Here you have an indication of the determination of the Australian Parliament to embark upon the construction of an Australian navy."" .",42
337,Mr HUGHES,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"As a matter of general policy, yes; as to details, no.",43
338,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"It is only as a with matter of general policy that we can discuss the matter, because the honourable member will admit that he is not prepared to say yea or nay to the question of the founda-' tion of an Australian navv until he knows the whole character of the scheme.",43
339,Mr HUGHES,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Certainly .,43
340,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"Therefor e we authorities. cannot discuss it now, and we cannot commit ourselves in a merely abstract way to the question of the construction of Australian navy. I will put this case, Suppose that, instead of a proposal for local flotilla, the Prime Minister put before Parliament a scheme for building one lineStates. of-battle-ship, and no more, which was be the nucleus of an Australian navy. take it that the members of the Australian Parliament would hesitate very mucheven those who are in favour of an tralian navy-a-to endorse such a policy. I use that argument for the purpose of showing that Parliament cannot, with the sent indeterminate proposition before it, commit itself to this policy, and that Prime Minister ought not to use the voting of this amount as an argument with the Imperial' authorities that this Parliament country. is in favour of an Australian navy, such as he has proposed.",43
341,Mr MAHON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The Admiralty is not against the founding of an Australian navy, I think.",43
342,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"What the - tha Admiralty say is this-""We should like you to continue your money contribution, but if you are determined to make it in "" kind "" instead of in money we should considerable time. like it to be in theform of a class vessels which would be useful to us; but we should require to have complete control of. them in time of war."" This House.matter has said that it will not agree to that.",43

345,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The honourable ment, member is quite right. The House has not said so, but the Prime Minister said and it seemed to me, from reading speech, that the House acquiesced, because the leader of the Labour Party said Those were his very words. If the House is not in favour of that-system of control,', it may be many months, and even years-w e may even witness a change of Administration in England-befor e the Prime Minister can get the . British Government to come into harmony him with respect to the - personnel, the > distribution of vessels, and the interchange of officers between the.two navies. I submit, therefore-withou t putting the point in a party spirit at all-that on the grounds that I have advanced this. vote ought not to be used as an argument to help the movement with the British Imperial naval It ought not to be used as indicating that the Parliament of the Cornmonwealth is unconditionally in favour of an a new naval policy for Australia; and we ought not without some prospect of actual a expenditure to reduce the amount which is constitutionally divisible amongst .the On these grounds I think that the to Prime Minister would do well to withdraw, I the item at the present time, and bring it forward when he is able to lay details before us as to the kind of local navy Auswhich he proposes that we shall have,",43
346,Mr HUGHES,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"West Svdnev) [3.44]. - The honourable and learned member who prehas just sat down has endeavoured to impress the Committee with the idea that if the we vote this sum of money it will be the endorsement of a policy about which we know nothing, and will be committing this",43
347,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"The Prime Minister said that he would only use it as an arguent in regard to naval defence, m",43
348,Mr HUGHES,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"That would be undesirable and incorrect. The general policy t is to say, that we should have some sort of Australian' navy-ha s been be- fore this House and this country, as well as before the Admiralty authorities, for some Further, the main deof tails of that policy have also . been before this country, this Parliament, and the authorities at Home. So that the in doubt, as it appears to me, is' not whether ' we shall have a navy, or one line-of-battle ship, or a number of smaller ships. To the latter scheme kind, the Prime Minister and his Governso far as 1 understand are committed: That is to say, to some collection of torit, pedo boats and destroyers, and possibly his some submarine vessels,",43
349,Mr JOHNSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"But Parliament has "" That never been consulted about that yet.",43
350,Mr WATSON,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,Parliamen t is being consulted now.,44
351,Mr HUGHES,STATEMENT BY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH,"I am not saying that Parliament has been consulted, .but that, that is what the Prime Minister has set forth to the world as his policy. We know nothing of the details as to the cost and character of the vessels; their speed; the proportion of submarine to torpedo boats and destroyers; who is going to construct them, and when and where and under what conditions-they are to be constructed. We know nothing,' either, as to the manner in which the Admiralty will be prepared to help us in regard to the supply of officers and so on. But if we vote this £250,000, we shall affirm our approval of the general policy of the Government, and we shall give an earnest-and it is about time We did - of our intention to do something besides talk about this matter. If we were able today to assent to a proposal which would give the Government power to at once take action to put the fleet, which is now on paper or in the air, into being, three years at the very least must elapse before that .fleet could be put into commission. In these circumstances, unless we do this now, a year must be wasted. It appears to me that nothing more is being asked of us than that we should assent to this vote, with the knowledge that we shall have another opportunity of considering details, and of vetoing the whole thing if we think 'fit. That is all that Parliament can ask for. That, by assenting to this vote, we shall be committed to anything more than that, I utterly deny. If the Opposition opposedthe Government's scheme, it has Been open to them for some time past to do so definitely.

I strongly protest against any such assumption. We do riot yet know what our minds are on this subject. We have had speech after speech, and scheme after scheme, from the Government during the last four or five years, and we do not now know what is really the scheme at the back of the Ministerial mind. To assume that the passage of this vote, on the express understanding with Ministers that none of the money is to be spent, is to be regarded as an indication that the House of Representatives will approve of some Ministerial - naval scheme, which has not yet been put before it, is preposterous.",44
