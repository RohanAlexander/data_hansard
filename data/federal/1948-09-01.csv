1,Mr HARRISON,ACTS INTERPRETATION,"Wentworth-Actin g Leader of the Opposition) [3.40] - I should like the Prime Minister (Mr. Ohifley) to giye to the House some indication of the business which he proposes to introduce. We are concerned about current reports that the Government proposes to ask the House to sit on four in a bill for an sition a isweek days from now on.. The Oppoin complete accord with that Act 1901proposal provided the sittings are not unduly lengthened by indulgence in unnecessary debate. In fairness, the Prime Minister should at this juncture give to House some indication of the nature ADDRESS-IH-RBPL Y. of the business which he proposes to introduce so that the Opposition may be to assess its national value! .",12
2,Mr CHIFLEY,ACTS INTERPRETATION,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.42] - in to reply-Any proposal - which will eliminate unnecessary debate .wil] have my full support. At least the Opposition and myself are unanimous on that point. As I have indicated personally to the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. of Mr Harrison), it is proposed that the be Address-in-Reply dejbate shall be protho ceeded with tomorrow. I understand that many honourable members desire to speak on a wide range of subjects. The Address-in-Heply debate will provide them with the opportunity to satisfy that desire. I have told the Acting Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) that I shall ask the House to suspend the Standing Orders, probably next Wednesday, to enable me to bring down the budget and some of the associated measures. The objective in proceeding with a four-day programme is to pass necessary administrative measures as soon as possible to enable the machinery of government to be kept moving. One cannot judge how long honourable members will require to debate various matters, but they will be asked to consider many bills, not only those originating in this chamber, but also those originating in the Senate, for the opportunity will be taken - to introduce in that chamber measures that may be initiated there. I shall ascertain from the Acting Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party the days on which they desire to hold parfcy meetings to consider various hills.
