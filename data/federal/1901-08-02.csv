OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",16
21,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE," I m o v e That, in the opinion of this House, it is desir-. able, in the interests of the deserving aged poor, that the Government should, without unnecessary delay, formulate a national' scheme 5 for the payment of old-age pensions, and that this motion, when earned, be an instruction to the the honourable the Attorney-General to draft the, necessary measure. The motion that I have the honour of moving today deals with a question that is not now in the realms of Utopia, but that has been proved to exist in the realms of practical politics by the fact that this is the law of New Zealand, New South Wales, and Victoria. To-day, I do not stand in tins honourable House to beg for charity thab will palliate the effects of poverty, but to simply demand that justice which will remove the causes of poverty. That is the democratic line. It is said that poverty is not a crime. Yet poverty is punishable by long years of hard labour, poor clothes, and bad tucker.",16

I want it to be distinctly understood that while I am in this House I desire to be absolutely fair. I do not want any honourable members to think that I am going to monopolize every Friday. - It looks very like it ; the honourable member has every Friday.",16

27,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I want to start fairly, and I am willing to give way to the honourable member. I am not going to make a long speech today, being desirous that honourable members should be able to reach their proposals. In the Constitution, it was provided-as you, sir, will remember, by the heroic efforts of the Hon. J. H . Howe, of South Australia, and other members of the Convention-in sub-section (23) of section 51, that Parliament, subject to the Constitution, should have power to make laws Jor the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, with respect to invalid and old-age pensions. That will be found in the old-age pensions portion of the Bulletin's federal policy. I would recommend honourable members to read the JBulleiin's policy on old-age pensions, because if they did so it would not be necessary for any one to stand up and make a speech on the subject in this House. policy is far better put in the Bidletin than it could be put by any honourable member. Let me try and illustrate the position as it stands today by a reference to an ancient fable. It is an ancient fable that the eruptions of Mount Etna are produced by the giant Enceladus, who was imprisoned beneath ; aud that every time he turned oh his side to stretch his limbs, or to struggle to escape the curse, the mountain belched forth fire red hot cinders and red hot lava. It carried - dismay and despair to the unfortunate dwellers on its lofty slopes. Now, I want to say that the imprisoned giant of the ' Commonwealth Constitution, who threatens to burst it into splinters every time he turns on his side or stretches his limbs or attempts to escape, is poverty-the monstrous offspring of past political and social injustice. Poverty is the result of bad laws and compromises with evil, and compromises with evil are invariably a victory for the devil. ",16
28,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable memaway ber for Maranoa tells me to look out for Argus. It seems to me I have heard of fchafc name before. Some anthropological professors would say that the Argus sort of petrified corpse of conservatism. I particular State concerned. do not. I simply say that it is an embalmed relic, or embodiment of conservative, diluvian, fossilized mummydom, masquerfche ading in the pious garb of up-to<late hypocrisy. Sir' WILLIAM MCMILLAN - I think that "" is highly disorderly language.",17
29,Mr GB EDWARDS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I rise to a point of order. Ourfcimeis very limited, and the honourable member for Tasmania does not seem to be dealing with the motion of which he has given notice.",17
30,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Unles s the honourable member for Tasmania can connect his remarks, of course he will be out of order. But I imagine that he intends to do so.",17
31,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I intend to connect my remarks, bufc I think that I have the same righfc to defend myself as the Argus hasfcoattack me.",17
32,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member will not be in order in proceeding on those lines.,17
33,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It seems to me that fromfchepast policy, of the Argus upon the The question of old-age pensions, at any rate, it is a modern edition or echo of a fourteenth century Chinese bob-tailed Boxer's paper. Having lost its bob-tail it ought to change its name, and call itself the Bob-tailed Boxen: But I shall now proceed to discuss the question of old-age pensions. I shall devote a little more timefcothe Argus between now and Christmas. Several honourable members in speaking upon the Address in Beply, said that this question of old-age pensions and flame, oughtfcobe leffc to the various States. In other words, the various States should be permitted fco cany out the great policy of old-age pensions. I deny that that is the policy, intention, or spirit of the Commonwealth Constitution. Let us look afc this matter. I submit fchafc a man is first of all a citizen of the Commonwealth. His paramount allegiance is to the Commonwealth of Australia, and his subordinate allegiance is to his State. Let us suppose that the Commonwealth desired to carry out some law which was very unpopular in a State, and gave instructions accordingly. If the Commonwealth sent to the homes of various citizens, took fchem at 12 o'clock afc night, put rifles upon the their shoulders and knapsacks upon their (backs, and sent them forth to enforce a law of the Commonwealth, I submit that those is a men would be most unpopular with the Can it be said that in such a case the Commonwealth anteought not to defend those citizens against tyrannical law offchafcState ? Can it be said that the men who obey the mandate of the Commonwealth Government should be afc the mercy of the State Government which hated the law fchey had enforced? There is a lot of talk just now in reference to the proposed law which will affect Tattersall's sweeps.. Does any one think that a man who was sent to Tasmania to enforce that law would be very popular ? As the citizen's first allegiance is to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth's first allegiance is to the citizen, and it is the duty of the Commonwealth to protect the aged poor and to enable them to receive the benefit of their contributions fco the State exchequer for years. A great many of our friends talk about the Braddon blot. I ask-""What has the Braddon blot to do with the right of the Commonwealth Government to bestow pensions upon the people "" ? Nothing whatever. Let us look at another point. Let us suppose that tomorrow we received news that there was an army coming from - Japan on board of that nation's best warships. Would any one say that as the Braddon blot prohibits us from raising more than a certain amount of revenue we could uot fight Japan, that we must let the Japanese land, and at the end of five years, when the bookkeeping period has expired, we should raise a bit of revenue with which to start an army and fight the invaders upon the land? I hold that the 69,330 old people who are in a state of - penury in the Commonwealth represent a greater emergency in the estimation of Christian people than would an army landing here to take Australia. These people are our helpless brothers and sisters. W it h us, therefore, it is a matter of faifch and justice. We simply ask the Commonwealth to step in and perform its duty to its citizens. Let me put another case before honourable members. To-day, according to the Bulletin, we are paying away between £600,000 and £700,000 in charities, and those charities are annually increasing. The necessity for fchem is increasing.",17
34,Mr BABTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Thaf c is not paid by the Commonwealth.,18
35,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is paid by various charities,' including benevolent asylums and kindred institutions.  not pay anything.",18
36,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,I look upon the Bullefdn as one of the great organs of this country. It is reallyfche highest type of Australian literature. It approaches nearer to Australian national literature than any ofcher publication we have.,18
37,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Will the honourable member proceed ?,18
38,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Victori a is already paying away £335,'000 a year in pensions. NeAv South Wales will presently be paying away £365,000 annually. There is a total of £700,000. According fco Mr. Johnston, the statistician of Tasmania, £1,190,000 will supply every aged man and woman in the Commonwealth with a pension.",18
39,Mr EWING,PUBLIC SERVICE,Of how much?,18
40,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"He does not say. I am not going to say what the amount will be. Honourable members can divide the amount up according to their own ideas. Upon this question let me say that I am serious and solemn. I am not in destitution myself, bufc I see destitution all around me, and I am my brother's keeper uponfchisquestion. I repeat that two States are expending £700,000 in charities. We have therefore only to raise £490,000 more, in order to pay the whole lot and makefchequestion a national one. "" But,"" honourable members may ask, "" how are we to do - it ? How can we do it""? Let us consider the matter for a moment. The basic principle underlying the value of all commodities and determining their relation and exchange is the quantity of the necessaries of life which enables the labourer to reproduce his labour. We all admit that when men form combinations, great trusts and great associations, the power which they possess enables them to get credit, to control the machinery, and by that means to give employment to great armies of people. 'There is no doubt that fchey pay a legitimate wage according to the times, bufc nevertheless the fact remains that great fortunes are made, not by the men who work themselves, bnt through the difference between what fchey pay their labourers and what the material costs to produce. The balance goes into their pockets. I have done the same tiling m yself. AVe have all done it . The difference is taken as a toll for finding employment for the people. I say that the great Teacher of. morality founded ""his Christianity upon two speculative maxims-lov e of God and love of humanity-and out of these two speculative maxims arose the two great practical maxims that the strong should bear the burdens of the weak, and that the rich: should feed the poor. All I want is that we shall levy a reasonable tax in order to, provide for these old-age pensions. AVe need not overtax anybody, but we do want to see the incidence of taxation distributed on a more equitable basis. By that means we will gefc sufficient money. There is another side to this question. I know that in the State of Tasmania complaint is made that they cannot afford to do this. I contend, however, that they cannot afford not to do it . Why did we join with Victoria and New South Wales? This is a partnership ; it is a partnership of honesty and justice, and those who have should help those who have not. All we ask now is that you distribute this more equitably and help us. The miner who goes to the west coast of Tasmania and lives there in a hut after years of struggling accumulates nofcJiing. There are thousands and thousands of them who do not. But the rich merchant, who does nothing but send goods over there, accumulates a good fortune out of the miner. The miner is moving from State to State and town to town with Very little in his pocket. After years of struggling, these men find themselves in their old age absolute beggars infchemidst of plenty. To-day, whilst thousands are starving,fchegranaries are bursting. Millions of bushels of wheat are stacked, bufc they are not properly distributed. All I ask is that the Commonwealth Government shall exercise its functions ; take hold of this question and grapple with it . The statesman is the man who masters the present and directs the future. I am sure honourable members will all admit that we have a fair sample of him here, anyhow. I want to read at this stage a few passages from the Bulletin, which calls attention to this matter. The Bulletin writes:But if the old-age pension 83'Sfcem is the concern of the Federal Government, thenfcheonly needful qualifications will be that the applicant must be in need, offcheprescribed age, and have put in so many years residence anywhere in Australia or Tasmania, or in Maoriland when Maoriland comes in.",18
41,Mr EWING,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Step s are being taken in the States that have passed Old-age Pension Acts to recognise residence in other States that possess similar laws. """,19
42,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"And a veiy good thins? too. To leave the pension system in the hands of the States when there is a Federal Government; to attend to it, would be to greatly reduce its usefulness and make it a gratuitous mockeiw. And when the Federal Government does take the matter up it will probably find it one of the best investments any Government ever undertook. Australia wants to gain population, and when it is known iis the one country in the world where an old. citizen cannofc come to absolute want, that will bring population. It will probably do more in that direction than all the millions of revenue mouey and loan money that have been spent in promoting immigration. Australia wants to retain its own population, and there will be a strong inducement for population to remain in the only country which offers something better and more reliable than a workhouse or benevolent asylumfcothe impecunious citizen in his last years. The old-age pension system will probably costfcheCommonwealth £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 a year. But supposing it does ! Here we may suggest many systems of taxation.  member suggest 1",19
43,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"An absentee tax, a direct land tax, straight out, on the progressive system ; every man paying according to his much or his little. I honestly suggest a progressive income tax and progressive succession dufcies. This is simply equality of sacrifice, and we can reach it. Our free-traders will havefcotake it. I recognise that the Government have a great responsibility. They cannot become responsibility dodgers. The intention of our Constitution is thatfchisquestion shall be finally settled and managed by the Federal Government. I hear complaints and questions as fco how we are going to do it . Ifc is said we have not magistrates and that we have not Judges to carry out the work. I say that it can be done.purely through the Post-ottioe. In the United States of America there are 993,529 old soldiers on the pension rolls. They receive 140,000,000 dollars, or £28,000,000 sterling annually, and the whole of that money is paid through the post-ofiices. Surely if they can do that in America, we can do it in Australia. AVe are the same people. Honourable members have noticed that in Victoria if they put these people in the benevolent asylums they lose hope. They herd them together like sheep. Is that honest? It is not honest. AVe want fco do away with all. fchis pauperism; I hate this doling out. We want to raise these people up, so that they will feel that, although they pioneered here in the early days and got little, fchey are .now going to be looked after by a good, honest, just, and loving Government. I am not going to denyfchatpoverty, like ofcher suffering, has not played, and does not play, an important part in the economy of human civilization, because if. men are strong, healthy, and able, and can gefc work, bufc will not work, they ought to go to bed hungry. The question reduces itself to this : Is poverty an essential, substantial, integral element of human progress ? Is it simply transiently present, and is ifcamenableto destruction, suffocation, annihilation? To me, poverty is like all evils, transiently present, and it belongs the process of development, and not to the nature of humanity Furthermore, I say that, if God be jusfc, then only things founded ou justice are everlasting, and poverty cannofc be everlasting. Ifc seems to me fchafc poverty is like cannibalism. I like the butchering of prisoners in time of war. Ifc is like the continuing of war the sake of plunder and murder. Ifc is like the sanctificafcion of slavery. The matter in the hands of the people. Arefcheyequal to the situation ? I ask the Prime Minister to speak. I thank honourable members for their attention, ancl trust that this will become the law of the land.",19
44,Mr KIRWAN,PUBLIC SERVICE," I desire second the motion. This, to me, is a very serious question, ancl I trust that it will treated byfcheHouse seriously. There are a some, perhaps, who may object to fchs of the motion, but I believe that the ciple of old-age pensions is acceptable the majority of the people of the .CommonColonies, wealth. During the elections for the Federal Parliament a very large number of the canone didates, if not a majority of them, pledged - themselves to the principle, and I trust those of them who have now entered the House will not be in any way diverted from carrying out their pledges fco their constituents. The question is one that long since entered the domain of practical politics. Old-age pensions have been in existence for some years, and have for worked very satisfactorily in many parts of a the world. AVe have had experience them in the Australian colonies. For some years past in New Zealand a scheme of old-age pensions has been in force, and results have been very satisfactory. Accordfov ing to a return that was prepared in March hist, there are in the colony of New Zealand »o less than 11,285 persons in receipt of old-age pensions, and . the sum that is annually expended in providing that number of persons with provision for their old age is £193,000. That gives average annual pension to each recipient of £ 1 7 3s. 3d. Most honourable members are aware of the system which is afc present in force in A icfcoria. I have heard r complaints against that system. Ifc beeu said that many of those who received pensions have left benevolent asylums where they were comfortably situated, and have gone into places other where they have been neglected. Some of to the pensioners have given way to the weaknesses bf human nature, and I believe that some of them have died from the effects of drink, which they have been able to secure as the result of their pensions. Sir GliOBGE TOBJTEE - Onl y a very small t is proportion have abused their pensions.",20
45,Mr KIRWAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"This has occurred in a for few instances, and those who are opposed to old-age pensions try to make the very most is of these particular cases. While we may point to these instances, while we regret them very much, and say, perhaps, that they are owing to the maladministration soon of the scheme, still fchey in no way affect the scheme or the principle involved, to and furnish in no way an argument against the adoption of the principle. As is be well known, this. subject has occupied considerable amount of attention form in the old countiy for many years. prinThe Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain, to the present Secretary of State for the has been for many years an ardent advocate of old-age pensions,, and in of his speeches he refers to the very lamentable factfchafcoffcheworking classes that in the United Kingdom, one of every two who reach the age of 65 years, have to re ceive parish relief in their old age. This is very much to be regretted, and Mr. Chamberlain, when referring to this particular matter in a recent speech, said I say that this inadequate provision in old age our working people is not only a disgrace but danger to social order- I say it is injurious to of the individual and to the nation. I believe that quite recently a Bill was introduced into the British House of Comtlie mons by Sir AValter Foster that provided old-age pensions for persons who had reached the age of 65 or over. Unfortunately that Bill was not carried, but still the whole subject has met with a goo.d deal of support throughout Great Britain. The prevailing feeling amongst the statesmen of the old countiy is favourable to old-age an pensions, and the delay in putting the principle into practice has been occasioned simply and solely by differences of opinion as to the best means of giving it effect. I many might refer to what has been done has in a federation of a very different have character to our own. I refer to the scheme that has been in existence for some time in the German Empire. We are accustomed to regard the German Empire as being under an autocratic form of Government, and we are sometimes inclined to speak rather disparagingly of what has been done there for the general mass of the community; but it seems to me that the German Empire has taken this subject up, and given it attention in a manner that is certainly very creditable to the authorities there. In Germany it is compulsory for every one in fixed employment to contribute to a fund which is subsidized by the Government, and is utilized for the payment of old-age pensions, and I believe that the number of persons who are controlled under that fund amounts to no less than 12,000,000. Surely, in a community such as we have under our Commonwealth, which prides itself on. its liberalism and advanced ideas, we can provide something for old-age pensions, when we see that so much is being done in Germany.",20
46,Mr CONROY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Eac h member of the community contributes something ?,21
47,Mr KIRWAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes ; every individual who comes within the operation of the law. There are some honourable members who, while approving of old-age pensions, say that . they should be paid by the various State Governments and not by the Commonwealth ; but that seems to me to be a very illogical position to take up. A Commonwealth scheme of old-age pensions is the only one that could be thoroughly efficient as far as the whole Commonwealth is concerned, because any individual State scheme is bound to be imperfect owing to the fact that.a large proportion of the population of the Commonwealth is migratory. The people travel about from State to State, and if there were six separate schemes of old-age pensions each controlled by an individual State there would be thousands of persons who would be disqualified from receiving pensions under any scheme, because they would not beable to put in the necessary residential qualification underany State Act. A large number would thus be debarred from receiving pensions, and these would include some of the most deserving subjects in the Commonwealth-the men who travel out into the back country to open up new territory, the men who develop mines, prospectors, and those* who go into the tropics to open up industries and develop the resources of those portions of the Commonwealth. If it is agreed that old-age pensions are desirable, and that a Commonwealth scheme would be better than one carried on by the individual States, it musfc be conceded that the Commonwealth ought to undertake some system of pensions, and the sooner the better. It has been argued that there are many finarcial difficulties in the way, ancl the Braddon clause in the Constitution Act is very often referred to in fchis con*nexion, because it is said that somuch of the Customs revenue has to be returned to the various States that the one-fourth retained byfcheCommonwealth would not be sufficient to provide for a scheme of old-age pensions and at the samefcimemeefc other requirements. This may or may not be quite true; but, even if it be quite true, I cannofc see why we should adopt the stand that direct taxation ought to be left exclusively to the various States. The States, if not the Commonwealth, ought to adopt some old-age pension scheme, and if the Commonwealth does not adopt it the States will be bound to go on ; and, further, they will be bound to raise the necessary fundsthrough direct taxation. Therefore, we simply have the alternative before us of direct taxation, to be collected either by the . States or by the Commonwealth; and it seems to me to be a matter of indifference whether the States collect the money or the Com? monwealth, because the people of the Commonwealth will have to pay it in either case. The Constitution distinctly provides that the Commonwealth ought to under* take such a scheme. The mere factfchafctheprovision is inserted in the Ac t is an infer 1 ence that the scheme of old-age pensions should be undertaken and controlled by th« Commonwealth, and it is for this Parliament to seefchafcthe intentions of the framers of the Constitution are earned out. I believe that the particular provision in the Consti* tution which empowers the Commonwealth' Parliament to deal with fchis subject was carried atfcheConvention by a majority of 26 votes to 4. The motion seems to me to go hardly far enough, because it proposes to make provision only for the aged poor, whilst the Constitution refers also fco invalids, ancl I think we should provide not only for aged people, but also for cripplesand others who may not be able fco look after themselves.' There might be somedifficulty in adjusting the finances, in the event of the Commonwealth Government taking action in this matter, so as to dove-; tail the Commonwealth provisions into the scheme already in operation in Victoria? Bufc if there be difficulties in this connection, the longer we delay the settlement of the matter the greater they will become. If the Commonwealth be not forced by public musfc opinion to provide for old-age pensions, most of the States will, sooner or later, compelled to take up the subject, and more the movement extends the greater will be the difficulty infcheway offcheComVictoria monwealth taking the matter over. cerely hope that a vote will be taken on question as soon as possible, and for that reason I would like to see the speeches shortened in order that honourable members may have an opportunity of afc once declarfact;fchatbhe ing themselves one way or the other.",21
48,Mr FE MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE," I am quite in agreement with the honourable member for Kalgoorliefchafcas fchis is a most portant matter, and our time is limited, should not speak afc too great length. I am also quite in accord with the honourable member for Tasmania in his desire to make reasonable provision in the way of old-age pensions for the aged poor of the Commonnofc wealth. I believe, with him, that we same. can have no proper system of old-age pensions until the Commonwealbh takes the matter in hand, but at the same fcime there can be no good achieved by our ignoring the practical difficulties that will have faced. In the two large States of Victoria and New South Wales, the State Parliathe ments have enacted laws for the establishin ment of old-age pension's, and in both cases pensions have been paid, and the systems may be said to be in f u ll working order. I understand fchafc ib is estimated that £400,000 will be required in New Soubh AVales alone to provide for the pensions, and we cannofc yet tell to what extenb claims may be increased. I have not the figures with regard to A^icboria, bub tainly a very large sum-probabl y bebween £300,000 and £400,000-wil l be required when all the claims are fairly considered connection with their scheme, so that JhiUetin figures, quoted by the honourable member for Tasmania, of £700,000 for the two large States, may be fairly well accepted for the purposes of our discussion this afternoon. The honourable member Tasmania has quoted the Tasmanian statistician to the effect that £1,190,000 would be required bo provide pensions for the aged poor of the whole of the Commonwealth, and as £700,000 is being provided under State laws, he estimates that £490,000 addifcional would be required to furnish pensions for those not already provided for. The honourable member will admit,fchafcthere b""e equality and justice throughout the Commonwealth, and that the Commonbe wealbh musb underbake the responsibilities the attached to the pensions already provided for under the State laws of and New South Wales. There-I sinfore, the Commonwealth musfc find fchis the whole of the £1,190,000 that is required. It is very easy to say that this can be provided by direct taxation, bufc honourable members musfc not overlook thebwo large States have alreadymade provision, or are making provision, for the paymenb of the claims under their old-age pension laws at the present fcime;imand, therefore, any scheme of direct taxawe tion which may be imposed in order to provide old-age pensions for the people in thesmaller States musfc be superadded to the burdens of the people of the larger States.",22
49,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Would they save that amount of money just the,22
50,Mr FE MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Undoubtedl y that could be arranged. If the Commonwealth'Parliament were to establish a system ofdirect taxation in order to provide for oldto be age pensions for the whole of the poor of the Commonwealbh, it would be possible for Sbate Legislatures bo remit; the baxabion bheir own Sbabes in order bo relieve the people from unnecessary taxation burdens* The proper' way to treat fchis question is _ to give the Commonwealth Parliament a free hand in dealing with ifcs own revenue. The only satisfactory solution of it will be found in the removal. of the rethe sbriction imposed by secbion 87 of the Constitution Act. I do not see how it is cerpossible for honourable members supporting the Government, which is practically pledged not to raise revenue except through the inCustoms, fco consider the establishment of the an old-age pension scheme under the Commonwealth, unless some serious afcbempb be made bo alter section 87 of the Constitution.",22
51,Mr BARTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member's party are equally pledged not to raisefor revenue through direct taxation.,22
52,Mr FE MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am not putting bhis forward as a party question. As a matter of fact, a great number of honourable members on both sides of the House are pledged not to raise revenue for Commonwealth purposes by means of direct taxation. Personally, I - am not so pledged, but have a free hand. Under the circumstances, during the life of fchis Parliament, bhere can be no Commonwealth scheme of old-age pensions, unless some attempt be made to amend the Constitution A.cfc in the way I have indicated. I. am not afc all disposed to prolong the discussion. I - am going to move an amendment which will take the form of the addition of some - words. In the first place, I do not think that the mandatory part of the motion is one that the Government are likely to agree to. In any case, I propose to omit all the words after "" that,"" line 5, with a view to insert in lieu thereof.steps should be taken for the , repeal of the 87fch section of the Constitution Act so as to enable Parliament to make the necessary financial provision. 'There can be no doubt that should such a course be adopted, it would ease the way considerably for the introduction of a system of Commonwealth old-age pensions. - Mr MCDONALD - Why does the honourable member not vote against the motion ?",22
53,Mr FE MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,What is the use of the honourable member asking me a question like that 1 I am just as much in favour - of old-age pensions as is the honourable member.,23
54,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,"W it h a "" but.""  in favour of old-age pensions, I should not have supported the scheme as I have always - done i nfcheState Parliament. I advocated - old-age pensions long before they came within the range of practical politics in the State Parliament. I voted for the principle, and worked for it jusfc as loyally and enthusiastically as the honourable member for Kennedy.",23
55,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Does member not see that his amendment would ""be the means of killing the motion ?",23
56,Mr FE MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I know that if the motion be carried in its present form it can have no practical effect. If practical effect is to be given to the motion, the words I propose must be added. The honourable member knows perfectly well that the two large States have undertaken the financial responsibility of their own schemes. To say that the amendment would k ill the old-age pension scheme is nonsense, because every State has the power to establish the system ; and when the financial responsibility is assumed by the States themselves, uniformity of legislation can be brought about by the action of the Commonwealth Parliament. The honourable member for Richmond, I think, made an interjection to the effect that steps were now being taken by the States which have already adopted old-age pension schemes, to recognise residence in other States which possess a similar law. In the New South Wales Act, which was introduced by the Minister for Home Affairs, poweris given to the New South Wales Government to enter into negotiations with the Government of any ofcher State for the purpose of recognising residence in those States. Accounts could be kept between the States, and arrangements made generally which would permit 1 of an interchange of benefits. That could be carried out in every State of the Australian union, and ultimately uniformity of law could be established by the Commonwealth. But it is idle for us to be asked to at once establish a scheme as suggested by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr . O'Malley, unless we take some steps fco amend section 87, of the Constitution Act, which prevents the Federal Parliament from controlling its own revenue. If Parliament had a free hand to retain what is required for Commonwealth purposes-and old-age pensions would become a Commonwealth purpose as soon as we legislated on the subject-the way would be open for an easy solution of the difficulty. As the motion now stands I fear that the mover, while having the very best intentions, and while ad vocating what is in harmony with the feeling and opinion of almost every honourable member in the Chamber, is trying to do something which will prove to be impracticable. I go so far as to say that if at any subsequent stage direct the honourable legislation were projected by the Government for the purpose of establishing a system of old-age pensions, I would, at the risk of being considered inconsistent, support such a proposal, even though it superadded direct taxation. I atill believe, however, that it would simplify this matter and remove a great many practical difficulties if, in conjunction with this motion, we affirmed the desirability of altering or repealing section 87 of the Constitution Act.",23
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE," I would ask the honourable member for Lang to allow his amendment to stand oyer, as I wish to move an amendment earlier in the motion. . Mr FE MCLEAN - I now merely give notice that I will submit my amendment when the question is put.",23
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am sure honourable members will admit that the Government are desirous of dealing with this question if it is possible to do so. But there are a great many difficulties in the way of dealing with it at the present time. Some of these difficulties have been explained by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, and by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. But we must not forget that it is only lately that several of the States have inaugurated systems of old-age pensions. New Zealand was the first to do so, and I am not quite sure at this moment how much the scheme has cost that colony, but I think it was somewhere about £300,000 for the second or third year. In Victoria I understand that the cost is about 8s. per head, the total coming to some £300,000 per annum. Of the New South Wales expenditure under this head we have only an estimate, but the payments in that State are larger than in Victoria, and probably the average yearly expenditure will be a little higher. But, if I remember aright, the sum which it was anticipated would be paid in New South Wales was a little below £400,000 or £450,000 a year, so that, ex- uding New Zealand, between £700,000 and £800,000 will be paid in A ictoria and New South Wales.",24
59,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,PUBLIC SERVICE,AVha t about South Australia?,24
60,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not think that Soufch Australia has yet initiated a policy of old-age pensions, but I have no doubt that that and other States will have perforce to follow the example now that the two larger States have led the way. The difficulties afc the present fcime are very considerable. Honourable members will recognise that it is not possible to do every thing in the first session of the Commonwealth Parliament. There are many measures now before Parliament, some of which we may not be able to gefc through, though I hope allwill.be dealt with. In any case we have sufficient work before us to last us during the present session. Considering that the old-age pension system has only just been introduced in the two larger States, and considering the difficulties to which the honourable - member for Lang referred in respect to the payment out of : Pensions. 3483 revenue for this service under the section known as the ""Braddon"" section- I do not think an amendment such as the honourable member proposes can be entertained now. There may possibly come a time when we shall find it absolutely necessary to do something in that direction. AVhether that will be so or not we cannot yet t e l l: but until wo are a little further advanced in the Commonwealth work, and know what our revenue and expenditure are likelyfcobe, and how the section referred to is going to affect expenditure as betweenfcheCommonwealth and the States, it is almost impossible to say that we could undertake any system which involved the payment of large sums each year in connection with old-age pensions. I do not say that it is not possible to do it . It may be possible, because we might arrive at some understanding with the States, allowing the States to hand the money to the Commonwealth with a view to the making of the payments direct from the Commonweal th. But that might prove a very cumbersome method, and it would be much better if we could raise our own revenue and deal with it in our own way instead of dealing with it through the medium of the States. It seems to me, so far as I can judge, that this is the only wayof gettiugover the difficulty which exists afc the present time. There seems fco be only one serious objection to the system which is being T adopted now. That is the difference in the .payments in each State, together with the trouble which exists regarding residents alongfcheborders of each State.",24
61,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Thafc is the serious trouble.,24
62,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Buf c I do not think it is impossible to get over that trouble. 1I have not had time to look iuto the New Soufch Wales Act, and I cannot for the moment recall the provision as to the length of time a person who applies for a pension has to live in the State. I think that the period is ten years, though he must have lived in Australia for 25 years. I may be subject fco correction oh that point, but I find that in the Victorian A ct the State is not named, bufc the word "" Australia"" is used, and an applicant must have resided in Victoria for five years immediately preceding the date of making the declaration.",24
63,Mr AVATKINS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In New South Wales the period of residence is 25 years, unless the applicant comes from another State - which gives the same privileges to people going from New South Wales.",24
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Te n years.,25
65,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is not the case another State - where they are prepared to reciprocate.,25
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Quite so ; but they must be ten years, I think, in New South Wales. If they have been 25 years in Australia, or in a neighbouring State, and that neighbouring State is prepared to reciprocate, then New South Wales requires ten years' residence instead of five years. In Victoria, a five years' residence is quired instead of ten. Bufc I do not think there would be any difficulty afc all i ing an arrangement between the various States. Ifc would be very easy to amend attack. the law if necessary, or to make an rangement between the States, so that persons who have lived for ' 25 years in Australia shall not be debarred from pension lights merely because they have not lived for so many years on one bank of the River The Murray or the ofcher. I think the honorthis able member for Kalgoorlie said that the present was the time when we should declare where we are going to raise the necessary amount of revenue from. The readhonorable member for Tasmania, Mr. O'Mialley, spoke of a tax upon absentees. able That may be requisite in some of the States, but it is not requisite in New Soufch AVales. There it is anticipated that after the amount such of revenue which is returnable from the pensions. Commonwealth has been paid, there will plenty of money available to pay old-age pensioners without there being any need to resort to direct taxation. Under our Constitution Act, New South Wales able must of necessity raise a larger sum than has been raised in the past. Bufc that is not caused through the operation the State Old-age Pension Act. It is the result of the Constitution under which we live. Portion of that money, afc any rate, will go towards paying old-age pensions in New South Wales. Tho honourable member for Tasmania said that we should be generous to that State, aud that if Tasmania had not enough money to pay old-age pensions we ought to provide it for her. In view of all these statements, I think it would be wise to wait and see how our finances pan out before making any declaration as to what we shall do in regard to any particular State. That is one of the reasons which almost preclude the Government from doing anything at the present time. As far as I can judge, taking as a in basis the expenditure which has been incurred up tb the present, it would require between £1,000,000 and £1,100,000 a year to payfchewhole of the pensioners through; ' out the various States, excluding New Zealand. Thafc is a very large sum to be called upon to pay out of the Commonwealth funds, shackled as they are by the clause to which reference has been made. The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, reasked if, in the event of a Japanese army coming to these shores, we should wait to n makconsider where we should get the money necessary to enable us to repel theThat is an entirely different armatter. If we were threatened with invasion we should probably borrow the' money for the time being, as they do in ' Great Britain. The analogy which the honourable member instituted cannot, therefore, be considered for a moment. Government are desirous of taking up question of old-age pensions on behalf of the Commonwealth so soon as ourfinancial position will allow us to do so. I suggest that the motion should be altered to That, in the opinion offchisHouse, it is tlesir-' in the interests of the deserving aged poorthat the Government should, as soon as the financial position of the Commonwealth justifies action, without unnecessary delay formulate a national scheme for the payment of old-age be I ask the honourable member for Tasmania to expunge the last two lines of his motion. ",25
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,I hope honormembers will be reasonable. It is impossible to force the hands of the Government by passing a motion directing the Attorneyof General to bring in a Bill at once.,25
68,Mr BARTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,I should not accept a direction of that sort.,25
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Surely the House will allow the Government to say, when the finances are in such a condition that we can afford to take away the responsibility from the States which they now have, and transfer it fco the shoulders of the Commonwealth. If this is not done in the Commonwealth shortly, it may be expected that the other States will pass some law similar to that which prevails in New South Wales and Victoria. I think that gradually the States willpass almost identical laws. We are all the same people in Australia. In Victoria the limit of the pension proTided is 10s. per week, and if that amount is found sufficient to meet the deserving cases then, perhaps, we have given a little too much in New South .Wales, because there the limit is fixed at £ 1 a week for single persons, whilst an aged couple may receive £ 1 10s.",25
70,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is decent.,26
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We are always decent in New South Wales. If it is found that the amount payable in the mother State is too much it can be easily altered, but I feel that each of the States should pass a law to bring itself into line with the ofcher States, if we Cannot see our way at an early date to establish a Commonwealth scheme of old-age pensions. It would not be judicious for the Commonwealth Government to ask the House to pass a Bil l during"" the current session dealing with this matter when we have such an overwhelming amount of work to get through-wor k which appears on the business-paper, and work which does uot appear there yet. I ask the honourable member for Tasmania to allow his motion . to be amended in the way I suggest. If that is done it will be a direction, to the Government to undertake the task of providing for au old-age pension scheme so soon as our financial position justifies the adop. tion of such a course. I think that the Treasurer, who has taken such an interest in this question, and who passed an old-age pension law in Victoria, as well as myself, who did the same thing in New South Wales, can fairly be trusted to deal with this matter. Surely, we can be trusted to pass a general law for the whole of Australia, when our financial position justifies such action. I move That the words ""without unnecessary delay"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" as soon as the financial position of the Commonwealth justifies sueh action.""  have spoken on this question but for the remarks of the Minister for Home Affairs. In Queensland the Government have been using exactly the same argument to stave off making provision for the payment of old-age pensions that the Minister is attempting to use in this Parliament. The Prime Minister . in his speech at Maitland declared that the Ministry would deal with But as soon as the)- get into power they want to stave the matter off for an indefinite period.",26
72,Mr BARTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Will the honourable member allow me to say that in my Maitland speech, and in every speech which I made afterwards, I qualified that statement precisely as it is to be qualified in this amendment 1  the qualification defers the consideration of this matter for perhaps twenty years. Such a qualification iudeed will stand good for an indefinite period. The only possible inference to be drawn from the Prime Minister's speech at Maitland is that the Commonwealth Parliament would deal with this matter in our time, and not in somebody else's time. I feel very strongly indeed upon this question, as the result of a pathetic incident which I witnessed when I was twelve or fourteen years younger. I was going to a picnic at Moreton Bay when I saw an old couple on their way to the Dunwich Benevolent Asylum. They had been very well off in their time. In fact, only a few years before they had owned a cattle-station upon the Burnett. Through circumstances over which they had no control they were forced to seek relief from the Government. The old man was 85 years of age, and the woman over 70 years. When they were landed at Dunwich a lady came and took the wife away on one side, and the old man was taken away somewhere else. The old woman inquired- "" Are you going to separate us 1"" What was the consequence 1 The authorities violated the principle to which every man subscribes when he takes unto himself a wife. The clergyman says- "" Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder."" The Queensland Government were the first to step in and violate that injunction. I made a vow upon that boat that, if ever I could do away with the existing system of housing the aged poor, I would use my power and voice to that purpose so long as 1 had breath in my body. The result of that incident was that the working men on the boat clubbed together, took the old couple back, and started them in a little shop, where they lived happily t ill the}' both died. What the working men on that boat did we want the Commonwealth Government to do. It is of no use staving it off from year to yearwhere there is a will there is a way.",26

He talks about undertaking the task "" as soon as the Commonwealth can afford it . "" We all. know what that means. We are old enough in politics-eve n though we are youngto understand the meaning of that phrase. The same argument was'used in Queensland. I only hope that, for the sake of the men and women whose claims my honourable friend for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, has urged today, he will go on to the bitter end. He will find me at his back.",26
74,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE," So far as the amendment proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs is concerned, it is no use for the Government or any honourable member to say that it is not an attempt off the question. There is no other object in viev.'. It is a well-known fact that the Government would be prepared to vote for the motion if the latter portion of it were omitted. Why do they want to strike out the last two lines ? The answer is, that a bald motion without any instruction to the Government to bring down an old-age pension scheme means absolutely nothing. It is idle for the Prime Minister to say that old-age pensions did not occupy a prominent - Sir WILLIAM LYNE place in his speech at Maitland. Whether he made certain qualifications or not at Maitland in regard to old-age pensions, I do not know, but I do know that when the reports of his speech reached us in the outlying portions of the,Commonwealth, we found that there was no qualification of the promise. The newspapers in favour of federation and of the Government put the matter forward as one of the reasons why the working classes should vote for the Government. The fact that they favoured old-age pensions was one of the reasons why the Government got a good deal of support in different parts of the Commonwealth. I myself on several occasions mentioned this fact. I told the electors that we were more likely to get old-age pensions under the Commonwealth than under the State Governments. Do we not know that for a large number of years there has been a continuous agitation for old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealth ? States have got the system at the present time ? Only New South Wales and Victoria.",27
75,Mr AVINTEK COOKE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Two-third s of the people have it . I,27
76,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am not talking about the people; I am talking of the States. In Queensland they play the Federal Parliament off when the question of old-age pensions'is raised, just as the Minister for Home Affairs is now attempting to play off the States. We are told that such a system would cost us about £1,100,000. At the present time it costs the various States between £800,000 and £900,00 0 per year to look after the aged poor, and that money is doled out under a system of charity. If we take into consideration the extra amount that the system of old-age pensions will cost New South Wales and Victoria, we shall find that the total will nearly approach the £1,100,000 which according to the Minister for Home Affairs it to stave would cost the Federal Government. My opinion is that it will cost more. But what if it costs £1,200,000 or £1,300,000? I think that if these old people have assisted to build up the wealth of this country, as some of them have done for the last 40 years, the least we can do is to make some provision for them in their old age. In stead of the Government saying- "" We will put it off"" - I do not think the honourable member is very fair to the Government. We never said anything of the kind.",27
77,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The amendment proposed by the honourable gentleman puts the matter off for an indefinite period. It matters not whether they are free-traders or protectionists, the moment an attempt is made to do anything for the working classes, capital, as represented on both sides of the House, comes together. Have we not seen an honourable member on the Opposition side of the House getting up and suggesting an amendment, the effect of which he must know would be to stave off old-age pensions for twelve or thirteen years ?",27

82,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The amendment suggested by the honourable member for Lang is for no other purpose than to prevent the system being carried into effect.

90,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am very pleased or to hear it. The honourable member for Lang has told us that New South Wales and Victoria have already dealt with this matter, and that they can deal with it without going in for extra taxation. That is the position deny that. he takes up. Does not the honourable member see that if the Federal Government takes over the old-age pensions, the result will be to relieve those States of a proportionateamount of taxation, so that it comes exactly' to the same thing 1 I believe that the Commonwealth Government can deal with this, proposal in a very efficient way, whether it has to resort to direct taxation or not. I know that both the leader of the Government and the leader of the Opposition are against direct taxation, which they considershould be left in the hands of the States. I am of opinion, however, that it should be i a the hands of the Federal Government. Sooner or later the present or some otherTreasmer of the Federal Government will be compelled to resort to direct taxation.",28

97,Mr BARTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I want to confine myself to the reason of the matter for the moment, and I want to say that within a few years no definite period can be fixed. I take it for granted that honourable members, on whichever side they sit, will listen to reason. I do not want to go beyond what is reasonable. We are in this position: Unless we take steps to amend the Constitution by wiping out the bookkeeping clauses which were inserted, certainly, for the protection of all the States, including the weakest in finance, we cannot approach a .subject of this kind. If we did, an extra burden would be cast upon us, unless some assistance came from the States to the Commonwealth, which would be a subversion of the proper procedure. 1 stated definitely in - every speech I made that this Government was in favour of old-age pensions, and just as definitely in every such speech I said that that system could not be brought about for the present, but that must await the time when the financial possibilities of the Commonwealth justified it . In fact, if not in the same words, I expressed myself in much the same language as would be used in the motion if it were amended as. suggested by the Minister for Home Affairs. Old-age pensions was, no doubt, an important plank in the Maitland platform, and that fact derives additional importance from this, that the Minister for Home Affairs and the Treasurer of the Commonwealth have been the only two Premiers in Australia to carry out old-age pensions. If that is not a guarantee of the good faith of the Government, what can be ? Is it not obvious, then, that any postpone ment in dealing with the matter is not due to any hesitation on the. part of Ministers holding such opinions, and in which opinions the whole of the Cabinet concur, but is due rather to their, instinct of self-preservation of the Commonwealth itself ? The Commonwealth must not be allowed to drif t into such a financial position that it will not be able to meet the requirements of the States to be paid back during the bookkeeping period. It is said - that we can do this by direct taxation. If honourable members paid attention to the financial aspects of the debate on the Address in Reply, they must know that it was over and over again pointed out on both sides of the House that,' if the Commonwealth went in for direct taxation, it would take away from the States the ability to make up from that source any shortage which any failure of revenue on the part of the Commonwealth might leave them. Unless the Tariff were absolutely exorbitant, in which case every pledge made on both sides of the House would be falsified, this could not be done without resort to direct taxation. Both sides are pledged against that. There are exceptions, of course; but I use the term ""both sides"" in its general sense. Honourable members will, therefore, see the reasonableness of the position. I do not want to unduly drag out this debate, but I want to say something more about this matter.",29
98,Mr THOMAS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Le t us divide.,29
99,Mr BABTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No ; not t ill the voice of reason has been heard. Divisions of this kind cannot be snapped. So far as I am concerned, I am not very fearful about the result of a division, because if this motion were carried, as it stands, neither this nor any other Government could give effect to it .",29
100,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is what I want to know. What would be the effect of this motion 1,29
101,Mr BARTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Neithe r this nor any other Government could carry it out until the expiration of the bookkeeping period.,29
102,Mr THOMAS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Why did not the right honourable gentleman say that at Maitland 1 ',29
103,Mr BABTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I did say so. I mentioned the bookkeeping period in several of my speeches. The difficulty is this, that some honourable members who have not taken the trouble . to read my speeches are asserting that they did not contain certain things which I say they did, and I find this rather unsound reason given by the honourable member for Kennedy. He says that whatever qualifications I may have made in my speeches, they were not reported in Queensland, and I would ask how I can be held responsible for that.",29
104,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,I did not say the Prime Minister was responsible.,29
105,Mr BARTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If the honourable member had thought that I was not responsible he should not have continued his argument in the strain he did. Prom end to end of those speeches I pointed out that the finances of the Commonwealth would not, for some time to come, permit of an old-age pension scheme being carried out, and I can appeal to honourable members on. both sides of the House to bear me out in that. There' is no in. difference really between the position set up by the amendment proposed by the the Constitution. Minister for - Home Affairsand the statement of the policy with which wewent 1 to the country, and if honourable members supported us on that statement of policy, they are equally in reasonbound to support us in connection with the amendment. As I the Minister for Home Affairs has pointed out, we cannot accept the last portion of motion, which contains a direction to the Attorney-General. Of course it is contrary to the courtesies of Parliament to order Minister about in that way, and Ministers are not going to be lap-dogs-fro m what-' ever direction the order may come. If this motion, were carried in these words, 1 think I can appeal to-honourable' members on the opposition side, who spoke very strongly about it in .the election struggle, and oven thought I had gone too far, to say whether it would be possible for. the Oppospeech sition, if they got into power, to carry out motion, so long as the bookkeeping clauses exist. Even without the bookkeeping clauses, but with the obligations of the Commondictation. wealth, and in the absence of greater economy in the States, and until the Commonwealth gets into a. much better position in matter of finance, it will be' impossible carry out any such scheme: We all foresaw that the position of the Commonwealth would not be an unrestricted one-that the Cpnstitution imposed certain limits upon and we ore talking all round with a knowfavour ledge of' those limits, which; render it impossible for us to take any action at the. present time.",29
106,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,Are .we to understand that the Government will not take the matter up for five years 1,30
107,Mr BABTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"What I wish the House to .understand is, that I cannot see within the next five years, any Government can be possessed of the funds necessary to carry out such a scheme. This - is not like other matters of a similar which the Commonwealth Parliament has power. This is a concurrent power, on the part of the Commonwealth-, and there, power on the' part of the States in the meantime to establish their pension schemesin where they have the financial possibilities in their hands.

111,Mr BARTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have pointed' it out The honourable member seems to think that anythingthathehasnot read has not been said. t may be that there will be some possibility of arranging matters with the States; but in this the meantime the States have it in their own hands to carry out old-age pension schemes, and the two most populous of the a States have already passed such schemes into law. I admit that that is no justification for on indefinite postponement of the matter, but on: the other hand, the fact' that two States have already carried such a measure into effect affords every justification for extending the same system' to the who whole of the States as soon as it may be practicable.
