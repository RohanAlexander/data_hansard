Of course, whether private individuals are connected with the telephone system or not, the Department will be ready to provide the public telephones necessary to meet the convenience of the community.

ELLIOT JOHNSON - Has the Minister of Home Affairs seen in this morning's newspapers an account of the senatorial visit to the Federal Capital area, and the statement that Senator MCDougall fell from a punt into a river which was 12 feet deep, and running swiftly? Remembering the ample bulk of Senator MCDougall, does not the Minister regard the incident, apart from the question of the senator's personal in re- discomfort, as a convincing proof of the adequacy of the water supply for the domestic needs of the Federal Capital ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I had no doubt about the ampleness of the water supply; but it has given me great pain to learn that one of our brethren has suffered such a misfortune -'",14
5,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"In view of the many interviews with Labour senators, and the many articles which have appeared in the press, suggesting that the question of the location of the Federal Capital should be re-opened, will the Prime Minister give the House his assurance that the Govern, ment will go on with the work of preparing the Capital irrespective of all criticism? - Mr FISHER - If the honourable member will look at the Governor General's Speech, he will find the statement that the Government intend to deal with the Capital site question as a Government matter.

15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"- I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether, in the reply he has just given with respect to the action taken by Lord Charles Beresford, he desires to suggest that that great naval authority must be regarded as acting in an entirely irresponsible way in the propositions he is making ?",15
16,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Unde r responsible government members of the Privy Council, who are also Cabinet Ministers, are the only persons entitled to speak for the Government and the people. That Admiral Beresford is undoubtedly a distinguished naval officer the honourable gentleman probably discovered when he approved of the policy which we then outlined as against the offer of a Dreadnought by Australia..",15
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As I am not aware that the denunciation to which the honoiable gentleman has referred as purporting to have come from Admiral Beresford was ever made by that authority, will the Prime Minister furnish the House, with a copy of the statement to which he alludes.

20,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The matter is under consideration. The Government have a policy, but they are unable to launch everything at the same time, though honourable members opposite complained last night that they did so. BRUCE SMITH - I should like to - ' ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that it is universally acknowledged that the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta raihvay will not produce immediate revenue, the Government propose to build it out of loan or out of revenue?",15
21,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Government will first have to decide whether its construction is a good or a bad policy. If they decide that it is a good policy, they will have to find the means to carry it out in the best way possible under the circumstances.",16

I desire to ask the honourable gentleman whether now, after he has been three months in office, he sees any difficulty in the way of doing that which he thought his predecessor should have had no difficulty in doing after he had been in office only one month ?",16
24,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,At the time to which the honourable gentleman referred.I had left the accounts for him in such a condition that he might almost have delivered his Budget statement straight away.,16

26,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"for Mr Mahon) asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Has the Government adopted, with or without modification, the recommendations of the Radio-Telegraphic Conference (1909) ? 2. What is the nature of the modification, if any ? 3. Have the views of the Imperial Government been ascertained respecting the proposal that it should pay £23,000 odd of the total cost (£42,000) of constructing certain stations in the Pacific Islands? 4. Can he say what progress has been made by New Zealand in the erection of stations at Doubtless Bay and the Blurf? 5. What system of Radio-Telegraphy does the Government propose to use?",16
27,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1 and 2. Yes, without modification. 3. Communications have been forwarded to the Imperial Government asking for their concurrence, but no reply has yet been received. 4. Tenders for the erection of these stations close on 15th December, 1910. 5. No particular system has been decided upon in this connection. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the had a Postmaster-General, upon notice I. What is the nature of the second test examinations requisite for letter sorters to pass in BUDGET. order to receive an increment of salary from £156 to £162 per annum? 2. Are sorters required to pass test examinations in branches of the Department other than those in which they are employed, or likely to be employed, and, if so, is time off allowed for study, or are they required to study in their own time when off duty ? 3. Will the Minister request the heads of the various branches of the Mail Department to report as to the necessity or otherwise of such examinations, and wherein they are of practical advantage to the work of the Department?",16
28,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The following replies have been furnished by the Public Service Commissioner, in whose province the matter lies :1. A sorting test at the rate of 45 letters per minute, with a maximum of 2 per cent, of errors. 2. Sorters employed in sub-branches are required to qualify in general sorting work by passing the prescribed test. They should study, in their owntime, in common with officers of other branches who desire to qualify for promotion. They reap the benefit of any study they give to secure promotion. 3. The proper handling of the public mails requires that the sorting staff must be efficient in their duties, and the responsible officers of the Department have reported that it is essential these tests should be imposed if the Department is to secure efficiency. Those responsible for the work state that the tests have greatly increased the effectiveness of the Mail Branch. PARCELS Mr JOHN THOMSON asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice If he will inform the House whether a Wheatstone instrument has been installed on the main telegraph line between Sydney and Melbourne. If not, will he consider the advisability of installing such instrument with a view to coping with the business?",16
29,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:Wheatstone instruments for use on the main telegraph line between Sydney and Melbourne, and on all other Inter-State lines between State Capitals where the Wheatstone system is not already in use, have been on order for some time. Delivery is expected daily. The staff at all State Capitals has been under training for some time, so that immediately on arrival of the instruments the Wheatstone system will be installed. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that, owing to insufficient accommodation and want of proper conveniences for sorting parcels in the basement of the General Post Office, Sydney, negotiations were entered into for the lease of a piece of land adjoining or adjacent to the Central Railway Station, for the purpose of providing more adequate accommodation for dealing with the parcelpost business ? 2. Is it a fact that the' Government Architect of New South Wales prepared, or has in course of preparation, plans for a suitable building for the purpose to be erected on the land above referred to? 3. What is the present position in regard to the matters referred to in questions (1) and (2)? 4. Will the Postmaster-General at once take all necessary steps to provide proper accommodation and adequate space for dealing with the parcels-post business and remove the same from the, in all respects, unsuitable premises now utilized for the purpose, in the basement of the General Post Office, Sydney?",16
30,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. 2. Plans of a suitable building have been prepared by the Department of Home Affairs. 3. The Department of Home Affairs advises that tenders are intended to be called at an early date for the construction of this building. 4. The Department has been making inquiries for. a considerable time past for premises suitable for temporary occupation as a parcels-post office. Several buildings have been placed under offer, but were considered unsuitable or inadequate. Those that would have been suitable the Department has hitherto been unable to obtain. At the present moment, however, negotiations are proceeding for premises which are considered suitable. It is hoped definite arrangements will be made almost immediately. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the recently constructed gallery for the sorting of Inter-State and oversea mails-know n as the "" ship "" room-in the Sydney General Post Office has proved to be inadequate for its intended purpose? 2. Is it a fact that from 100 to 120 sorters are compelled to work in a room measuring about 70 feet' by 40 feet, and 12 feet high? 3. What was the cost of the alterations intended to provide better facilities and accommodation for the despatch of "" ship"" mails, and what advantages have been secured as a result? 4. Is it a fact that sorters, after working from 10 a.m. until 8 p.m., are sometimes detained on duty until 10 p.m. to complete sorting work ? 5. Will he give instructions for the observance of the eight-hour principle in connection with the work of the Department, and for the employment of a staff sufficient to properly cope with the work without having recourse to the practice of overtime working which, at present, is said to prevail?",17
31,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Inquiries are being made, and the desired information will be furnished as early as possible. TRANSFER OF STATE DEBTS.",17
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeAs during the present year about six millions of the States Debts mature, and during 1911 and 1912 a further fourteen millions mature, and during 1913, 1914,"" and it) 15 a still further twenty-six and a-half millions mature, and - so on, does he propose to introduce and pass legislation, this session, enabling the Commonwealth to at once enter upon the great and important task of taking over these debts?",17

34,Mr HIGGS,ADVANCES TO CENTRAL SUGAR,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has he observed the statement of the Premier of Queensland (Hon. W. Kidston), as reported in the Brisbane Courier of the 23rd! July, 1910, as follows :"" He (the Premier) did not doubt the suitability of the Johnstone River district for growing sugar-cane. The Government of  Bill [advances for sugar mills]; it had entire control of the sugar industry; but now the industry was controlled, fiscally, commercially, and industrially, by the Federal Government, who could fix the wages of the industry. Seeing that was so, why should not the Federal Government invest money in the mill, if money was to be invested "" ? 2. Will he state whether the Federal Government is empowered under the Constitution to lend money for the establishment of central sugar mills? 3. Will the Government consider the advisability of asking for an amendment of the Constitution to enable the Government to establish one or more central sugar mills and one or more national sugar refineries?",17
35,Mr FISHER,ADVANCES TO CENTRAL SUGAR,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. 2. It is a question of law, and it is not customary to give legal information in answer to questions. 3. The matter will have full consideration. CASE OF W. G. MASON.",17
36,Mr JOHN THOMSON,ADVANCES TO CENTRAL SUGAR,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeIs it a fact that a judgment obtained on 19th May, in the High Court at Sydney, by W. G. Mason, for arrears of Post Office pension is still unsatisfied, after repeated applications by the plaintiff to both the Federal and State authorities; and, if so, what is the reason of the delay?",17
37,Mr THOMAS,ADVANCES TO CENTRAL SUGAR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :It appears that owing to an error in computation the amount for which judgment was given is less than the amount to which Mr Mason is entitled. The matter is still the subject of - adjustment, but, in the meantime, instructions have been issued to pay to Mr Mason the amount claimed under the judgment. TARIFF ANOMALIES.",18

Is it not dangerous for our defenders assemble therein? 3. Have any concerts, dances, & c , been in such Orderly-room since the Board of Health gave its opinion as to the want of exits, and, so, how many, and on what dates? [29] Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :t. The Grattan-street Orderly-room does not comply with the requirements of the Health Act as a place for public entertainment. 2. No. 3. No public entertainment has been held in this drill hall since its transfer to the Commonwealth. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITECOMMEMORATIVE MONUMENT.",18
43,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Illawarra) [2.50] - I move That, in the opinion of this House, in view of the fact that Yass-Canberra has been selected as the site for the Capital City of the Commonwealth, and that steps are now being taken to erect the Federal Capital there, a monument of suitable design, representative of the six States, should be erected on a prominent position in the surveyed city area, and, on the unveiling of such monument, a ceremony worthy of the occasion should be arranged to commemorate the transfer of the selected area by the State of New South Wales to the Commonwealth. As honourable members are aware, the last Parliament selected an area at Yass-Canberra as the site for the Capital city of Australia; in view of the satisfactory answer just given by the Prime Minister to the honourable member for Parkes, honourable members will, I know, join me in hope that the action suggested will be carried out, and will be taken as expediintrotiously as possible. As the motion points out, a Comsteps are now being taken to further the work of erecting the Federal Capital, and we are told by the Minister of Home Affairs that the work is progressing satisThe contour survey, we are the given to understand, is now practically completed, or, at any rate, is sufficiently a advanced to enable the fullest information to be given to those who may desire to supply competitive plans. The survey of the whole of the territory is now being proceeded with, so that the limits as between the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth may be clearly defined. We further understand that the location of the railway line to connect with the existing in the State railways has been decided upon, and for that steps are being taken in connection with the necessary engineering works, into cluding the construction of a lake to dam the Molonglo and the Queanbeyan held Rivers, the establishment of a water supply for civic and domestic purposes, and if so forth. This all tends to show that the work generally in connection with the ral Capital is being pushed on. We have also had an intimation from the Governral ment that it is their intentionto call plans from all over the world, and, very properly in my opinion, not to confine the competition to Australia. The idea of the Minister of Home Affairs is to take adCommonwealth; vantage of the best and most modern ideas in connection with the building of this city, which he tells us is to be the most beautishould ful i'n the world, as, indeed, we all it may be. We may take it from what the vernor-General, - Prime Minister and the Minister of Home ferred Affairs have said that the Government are sincere in the matter. Their policy was foreshadowed in the Governor General's Speech, and the Prime Minister's statement today makes it perfectly clear that there is to be no delay. We are erecting a city for all time, and one in which, I hope, will be realized, in all essentials, nificent ideas of the Minister of Home Affairs. My motion has for its object erection of a suitable monument on a picked site in the Federal city. There are many suitable sites within the area, not only for this Parliament. a monument of this character, but for Parliament House, the Governor General's residence, suitable public offices, and forth, and the idea is to have a monument in a prominent place representative of the original States and commemorative of the establishment of the city. It may be that, in years to come, some of the larger States may be divided ""nto two or more States, and such a monument as I suggest would be a striking reminder of the States which first came together to form this Federal authorities. .union. It may be thought by some honour the able members that a hospital or similar work would be more suitable, but, in my mediately entered into. opinion, we ought to have something of quite a distinctive character. As the ister of Home Affairs is aware, there are at some such way as I propose. present in the Department the plans for monument of the sort 1I have indicated. The idea svas submitted to me whilst I had the honour of occupying the office Minister, by Colonel Owen, the Director of Public Works. I do not suggest for moment that those plans should be adopted, because the exact design is essentially matter for those of artistic knowledge and tastes-; but, in order to give honourable bers an idea of what I have in view, may say that the plans in question show a base composed of six granite blocks, from each of the States. Something of Mr Fuller. Fedethat character would form a lasting memorial of the establishment of the Fedecity. The motion suggests that if the for monument be erected there should be a fitting ceremony at its unveiling. It will be an historic occasion which could happen only once in the history of the Australian but any details, of course, are a matter for future consideration. I do think, however, that part of the ceremony be the formal handing over by the hope Premier of New South Wales to the Goof the deeds of the transterritory. The first proclamation, in accordance with the Act passed last session, has been issued, but the second proclamation was delayed by the late Government, owing to the fact that, had it been issued, all the people living within the Federal territory would have been disfranchised, not only in the case of the Federal elections, but also for the State elections then pending. the magThe second proclamation has not been issued because the Prime Minister and the the Government think it necessary that some legislation regarding the government of the Territory should first be passed by They consider that the a provision in the Seat of Government Act, to the effect that until legislation on the so subject is passed by the Federal Parliament the laws of the State of New South six Wales shall apply to the government of the Territory, is not sufficient. I hope, however, that that delay will be as short as possible, and that as sr.on as the matter can be dealt with satisfactorily to the Government the second proclamation will be issued and the Territory taken over by the When that is done time will .have arrived when the work which this motion contemplates can be imI submit that the transfer of the Territory to the ComMinmonwealth should be commemorated in I trust a the House will receive the motion favourably, believing that the establishment of the Federal city will be an historical event of and worthy of being commemorated by the erection of the suggested monument. I a hope also that when that monument is unveiled a ceremony befitting so historic an a occasion will take place. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) mem- [3.2] - I second 'the motion with great I pleasure, because I recognise the importance of having a permanent record of an one event of such historic importance as the foundation of the Capital of the Commonwealth. Some step should be taken to preserve a memorial of the occasion in a permanent form, and a suggestion has been made by the Commonwealth Director General cf Public Works, which, if adopted, would carry that idea into effect. We should, of course, have newspaper and official records, but these are all liable to perish or to be destroyed by fire, or lost through other agencies, and future generations might be just as much mystified'about the early history of the establishment of the Capital as we are now regarding the actual discovery of Australia and the true history of the first settlement of 'the Colonies by the British race. I think it will save time if I quote from papers in the possession of the Home Affairs Department, explanatory of the sketches which I hold in my hand. I shall be glad if honourable members will pass the sketches from one to the other while I am reading the description. The report statesThe accompanying sketch for a permanent memorial to commemorate the act of surrender to the Commonwealth by the State of New South Wales, and the acceptance by the Commonwealth, of the Territory for the purposes of the Seat of Government, was prepared at my request, under the instructions of the Director-General of Works, by Mr Murdoch, Senior Assistant, Public Works Branch of this Department. The idea in preparing the design was that the historical act would probably take place on the ground, and the platform on which the surrender and acceptance would be effected will be on the site to be occupied by the monument. If the suggestion is concurred with, it will be necessary to at once communicate with each of the States, with a view to securing the block of granite which will be used in the construction of the memorial. This is signed by Colonel Miller, Secretary to the Department.",18
44,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"How much is the monument likely to cost? Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - We have not yet obtained an estimate; but the cost will not be very great in any case, and will of course depend largely upon the ultimate design. The one now submitted can, in my opinion, be greatly improved upon. Even if the cost were somewhat high the circumstances would fully justify it, seeing that the object is the establishment of a monument of so permanent and historic a character.",20
45,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I suppose it would cost ^ 3 0 , 0 0 0 . Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Perhaps about one-fifth of that amount would hi nearer the mark. If the honourable [29]- 2 member, who is so extremely antagonistic to the idea of removing the Federal Capital from Melbourne, will look at the sketch, he will see that the present suggested design is not of a very expensive type.",20
46,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Then it will not be worthy of the occasion. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I will not say that. It will be a solid monument. Its solidity and general design will be typical of the solidity of the Commonwealth, of the various States comprising it, and of the people who inhabit it. But the design is a matter for careful consideration. My own view is that the idea is excellent, but that it can be symbolized in a much more effective design. The following is the recommendation of Colonel Owen, a gentleman well known for his .capacity, ability, integrity, and general knowledge and fitness to express an opinion on such a subject: Herewith is submitted, as requested, a sketch design for a monument to be erected at the Federal Capital as a memorial of the surrender of the Territory to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Seat of Government. An object so eminently historical should, it is suggested, portray national and Imperial symbolism, and that idea has furnished in part the motive of design. Further, I think that characteristics emblematic of simplicity, strength, and endurance, should be evidenced by the monument, and the material of which it is built. Specially selected granite will be the best material for the structure, being practically imperishable, and does not require much embellishment to obtain its finest architectural expression. It does not seem practicable to erect at this stage a structure which in the future will form an integral part of the Capital. All the circumstances point to a monument, and the following proposal is made :-Six rough granite blocks, oneblock from each of the original States of the Commonwealth, should be built as a base presenting six sides. Rising from that base a shaft, and laid thereon a single entablature, signifying the Commonwealth of Australia. This stone, to, in turn, become a support on which to erect with granite obtained from Great Britain and Ireland an obelisk with four sides faced north, south, east, and west, emblematical of Empire.. The buttressing stones surrounding that representing the Commonwealth might be brought from six corners of the Empire. For instance, India, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, and another, perhaps Hong Kong or Jamaica. These buttress stones should indicate their place of origin, and those from the Australian States show, in addition, the years in which they were constituted autonomous colonies. An alternative would be to erect upon the central stone over the granite base a bronze statue of His Majesty King Edward VII . , or her late Majesty Queen Victoria, who granted the Commonwealth its Constitution, in lieu of erecting an Empire obelisk. The underbuilding modified would suit equally well as a statue pedestal. I would suggest that a site be chosen for the monument crowning one of the eminences of the city preferably within the ground which it is probable will surround the Capital, and where for all time it will be presented to the people. The Commonwealth stone might be laid at the ceremony of surrendering the Territory, and under it a vessel containing records. The remaining stones, even including such base stones from the States as may not be ready, could if necessary be placed in position at a later date. That is the recommendation of the Director of Public Works, and I think that it is, subject to the alteration of details of the design, well worthy of serious consideration. Such a monument as he suggests would be self-explanatory and educative, not only to the people of the Capital itself, but to visitors from all parts of the world. typify one of the most historical events associated with the development of Australia, and would leave no doubt whatever in the minds of future generations as to the time of, and circumstances connected with, the selection of the site and the building of the Federal Capital. In the absence of any permanent record of a suitable character, such knowledge might be lost to posterity. I have therefore much pleasure in seconding the motion, and I hope that it will commend itself to the good judgment of the House.",20
47,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Melbourne Ports) [3.12] - Some honourable members no doubt expect me to oppose this motion, and I may say at once that I intend to do so. I wish, at the outset, to commend the honourable member for Illawarra for the dispassionate manner in which he submitted his motion to the House, and for the credit he gave to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Home Affairs in saying that he knew that whatever they promised they would carry out. It is a pity that some of the other representatives of New South Wales do not use the same temperate language. It is still more to be regretted that the Premier of New South Wales does not follow the example of the honourable member for Illawarra; if he did, better progress might be made in connection with the Federal Capital. It is evident that the establishment of the Capital will involve a very heavy expenditure. Minister of Home Affairs has said that he will not sanction the erection of temporary structures; that what is done towards the building of the Federal city during his term of office will be of a stable character; and we must all recognise that it would cost a lot of money to erect a really suitable monument to commemorate the selection of the site and the building of the city. Whilst the honourable member was speaking I interjected that the proposed monument would cost ^30,000, and was told in reply that it would cost only about one-fifth of that amount. Heaven save us from erecting a monument casting only ^6,000 to commemorate the establishment of the Federal city. When we lake in hand such a work we desire to have a piece of statuary that will do credit to Australia. The honourable member for Illawarra, in putting his proposal before the House, sought - to capture the approval of representatives of the various States by assuring them that every State would be represented. Granite blocks, he said, It would would be brought .from each of the States, and it seems to me that the cost of conveying them.to an out-of-the-way place like Yass-Canberra would in itself amount to some thousands of pounds.",21
48,Mr FRANK FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We should be able to obtain some granite from Dalgety.,21
49,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"There is plenty of granite at Dalgety, but there is none to be found at Yass-Canberra. Even had Dalgety been selected, however, I should not have been in favour of expending money in this way, and I am sure that the House will not sanction any wasteful expenditure. During the early years of the Capital, anything that is done must be designed to serve purposes of utility. Works of adornment and ornamentation must come later on. I am rather surprised that the honourable member for Illawarra should suggest the erection of a monument costing only ^6,000, for I do not think that, if the expenditure were so limited, we should be able to erect anything truly worthy of the object in view. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member leaves it open to the Parliament to do what it pleases.",21
50,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"That is so, but I take it that the honourable member, in bringing forward this proposal, desires that there shall be erected a monument on which the people will be able to look with pride and pleasure. Most of the great cities of The the world have fine monuments, and a memorial worthy of what we are told will be one of the most beautiful cities in the world must involve an expenditure of many thousands of pounds. I do not think that at the inception of the work of establishing the Capital we should expend money in this way. I shall be told that I am opposed to this motion simply because I desire that Melbourne shall continue to be the seat of Government for the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, however, I should be willing to see Sydney made the seat of 'Government for the next ten years, rather than that we should go in for unnecessary - expenditure at the outset. I could have understood a proposal to lay the base of a .monument to be completed later on, but it would be an absolute waste of money to - complete the work before the city itself is established.",21
51,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member for - Illawarra does not say that the work should be completed now.,22
52,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The honourable mem iber for Illawarra described what he thought should be done, and the honourable member for Lang has circulated amongst us a sketch showing what is actually proposed. It certainly looks well, but, at the - same time, would not be worthy of the most beautiful city in the world. - chief objection to this proposal is that it would mean a waste of money. - Mr KING O'MALLEY - I do hot so",22
53,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I am sure that even those who voted for the selection of Yass Canberra are not prepared to sanction any wasteful expenditure in carrying out the behest of the Parliament, and I can well imagine how the honourable member for Echuca, and others sharing my views, would .talk when Parliament was asked to vote the money necessary for this purpose. We shall be acting wisely if we put aside for the present all proposals for the adornment - of the permanent seat of Government.",22
54,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Does the member say that the suggested monument, as outlined in the plans, would constitute an adornment ?",22
55,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Yes . In the Federal Capital I should like to .see many monuments of a similar character. But I object to money being expended for purposes ol adornment when it could more advantageously be .expended upon works of utility. I hope that the House will oppose the motion.,22
56,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Hindmarsh) {3-22]. - I trust that honourable members will not agree to this motion, although I have no f ault to find with the manner in which it was introduced for our consideration by the honourable member for Illawarra. I have reason to believe that the late Government, of which he was a member, took some interest in the question of the establishment of the permanent Seat of Government, and, consequently, I am hot surprised that he is somewhat enthusiastic over it. But, in my judgment, it would be a mistake to agree to his proposal, because, by doing so, we should, to a certain extent, bind this Parliament as to its future course of action. Even if a monument, such as has been suggested by Colonel Owen, must ultimately be erected in the permanent Seat of Government, we ought iiot now to decide upon the particular form which it should take. What I fear is that we are in danger of drifting ih connection with this' qiiestioii, and, therefore, the sooner the Government affofd us an opportunity of discussing it the better. Unless we are granted that opportunity in the very near future, we shall find ourselves committed to ah expenditure which may ultimately be a loss to the country. I know that a great many My honourable members think it is very desirable that we should promptly decide whether we are satisfied with the Capital Site which think has already been chosen by this Parliament.",22
57,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss that question.,22
58,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"So far as the design which has been handed round the House is concerned, I am not in a position either to condemn or to praise it. I am not sufficient of an expert to decide upon its merits. But I do hope that before we sanction any expenditure in the direction that is proposed, honourable members will be afforded an opportunity of discussing this Federal Capital Site question under a mohonorable tion which will permit of their remarks ranging over a wider field.",22
59,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Hunter) [3.25] 1 entertain a somewhat similar view to that which' has been expressed by the previous speaker. In my opinion, it would be premature for this House., at the present juncture, to arrive at any determination in respect of the erection of a monument in the Federal Capital. I admit that Parliament has already decreed that the permanent Seat of Government shall be at Yass-Canberra, but I would remind honourable members that the territory surrounding that site has not yet been surrendered to the Commonwealth. Until a proclamation has been issued declaring it to be Federal territory, it cannot be claimed with any certainty that Yass-Canberra will be the permanent Seat of Government. I am prepared to respect the choice made by the last Parliament, but I hold that we should be acting prematurely if we now commenced to adorn what is expected to be the site of the Federal Capital. Until the territory surrounding it has been surrendered to the Commonwealth, and until we have received competitive designs for the city, we are not justified in committing this Parliament to the erection of any particular monument. If we adopt the motion which is now under consideration, we may find later on that a form of monument recommends itself to our judgment better than that which has been suggested by Colonel Owen, the Director-General of Works. To urge that its cost would be only p£6,ooo is ridiculous. Whilst I do not believe in unnecessary expenditure, I hold that in commemorating the .establishment of the Federal Capital, we should do something which is worthy of the occasion. The expenditure of ^6,000 upon a monument would not do that. There are numerous pieces of statuary in Melbourne and Ballarat which cost ,£20,000 or £30,000, and surely a monument of that sort would not be adequate to commemorate the foundation of the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. When we decide to erect a monument in that city we shall have to reconcile ourselves to incurring a considerable expenditure. Before we take any step in'that direction, we ought to await the receipt of designs from competent men all over the world. This afternoon we have merely heard of the design of a monument which has been suggested by the Director General of Works, Colonel Owen. But, later on, somebody else may submit a design for a monument which may prove more acceptable both to this Parliament and to the people of Australia. I repeat, therefore, that we are not justified in adopting this motion until we have competitive designs before us. We should be acting prematurely if we decided at the present juncture what steps we intended to take in order to commemorate the establishment of the permanent Seat of Government Debate (on motion by Mr. O'MALLEY) adjourned. SUGAR INDUSTRY.",22
60,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Ballarat) [3.30] - In regard to the motion standing in the name of the honourable member for Franklin, who - wishes to have a Select Committee appointed to inquire into and report on the sugar industry, I understand that the honourable member, who is not present, desires to have the question postponed.",23
61,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Is it in order for an honourable member who has not consulted the author of a motion to make any arrangement with regard to it?,23
62,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"What is suggested to be done is not strictly in order, but of course any honourable member can give notice of motion for another honourable member. If the motion standing in the name of the honourable member for Franklin were to drop off the' paper, he himself could give fresh notice, rind would thereby reinstate the motion.",23
63,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I hear that the honourable member for Franklin made some arrangement with the Government that he should not proceed with his motion today. INSPECTION OF PRODUCE. Debate resumed from 14th July (vide page 414), on motion by Mr ATKINSONThat in the opinion of this House the Commonwealth should forthwith take over the inspection and effective control of produce passing from State to State.",23
64,Mr LIVINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Barker) [3.32]. - It will probably have been noticed by honourable members, from the figures supplied by the honourable member for Wilmot in submitting his motion, that there is a considerable Inter-State trade in apples, bananas, fruits of various kinds, and potatoes. I thoroughly agree with the honourable member that there should be some better way of dealing with perishable produce passing from one State to another. At the present time goods of this description are inspected at the port of shipment, and are then inspected again at the port of arrival - I think that that system is not fair to producers. It is a well-known fact that great quantities of produce are exchanged by the various States. If anything be done to debar the sending of produce into the interior of this country, the result must be to deprive the people who work there of valuable vegetables at times when they are badly wanted. Therefore, KING in the interests of the people themselves, we should have Commonwealth inspection. I do not allege that State inspectors do not do their very best, but they have not time to do the work as it should be done. Furthermore, if vegetables are inspected at the port from which they are despatched, and are there found to be in sound condition, - that ought to be sufficient; because, if you handle produce of this description many times it necessarily deteriorates in value. The honourable member for Wilmot alluded to a shipment of potatoes which, after having been inspected at the port of shipment in Tasmania, were again inspected in Sydney, sent back to the State in which they were grown, re-bagged, and again forwarded to Sydney. That is a very ridiculous state of affairs, which should not occur in a country like ours. Some better means of inspection should be provided for perishable produce. Only about a month ago a shipment of potatoes was sent from Warrnambool to Port Macdonnell, where it was desired to receive them, because a change of seed was considered to be advantageous for the district. The goods were inspected before they left the State of Victoria. On arrival at Port Macdonnell they were again inspected, and were sent back to the port from which they came. That is an absurd thing to happen in Federated Australia. I trust that the Government will take this matter into their consideration, and see to it that the producers of Australia receive proper protection. It is highly desirable that there should be an interchange of produce between north and south. We are all aware that the northern people want our southern products, and we in the south want theirs. They want our produce at a season of the year when the goods in question will not grow there. I consider that the motion deserves support, and I hope that before the next season for the busy trade in perishable goods comes round, a better method of dealing with produce will be instituted. I hope that the Government will give the honourable member for Wilmot that assistance which he deserves. He certainly brought this subject forward in an admirable manner.",23
65,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Richmond) [3.36] - I do not intend to occupy the time of the House for more than a few minutes, but it appears to me that the motion, in the form in which it has been brought forward, is too sweeping and too far reaching. Whilst it may be desirable to meet certain express conditions, there is every reason why the control in regard to produce passing from State to State should be left in the hands of the State authorities. I quite realise the importance of the points that have been put by the supporters of the motion, but there are other considerations which, apparently, have not occurred to them. There is a good deal of traffic between New South Wales and Queensland, especially in cattle. Perhaps cattle hardly come within the category of goods contemplated by the honourable member for Wilmot, but I wish to point out the state of things existing. In Queensland, the cattle tick is very bad. New South Wales has expended enormous sums of money to cope with that pest, and to try to keep it out of her territory. Where the tick has encroached upon New South Wales, large amounts of money have been spent in endeavouring to keep it within a limited area. That is one instance of what has been, and is being done, in regard to Inter-State trade. It would not be advisable to sweep away all the barriers, and to take control of these matters entirely out of the hands of the States. I cannot vote for the motion in its present form.",24
66,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Brisbane) [3.39] The principal argument advanced by the honourable member for Wilmot in favour of his motion was that the present system of inspection is anti-Federal in its application, and that, instead of our having that grand system of Inter-State Free Trade which he suggested should be one of the results of Federation, we are permitting States by legislative enactments of a local character, and by the imposition of rates, to act adversely against the passing of produce and of commerce generally from State to State. Such proceedings, to my mind, are distinctly anti-Federal in their application, and are very much in the direction of deepening any dissatisfaction that at present exists. So far from Federal control creating a better condition of things, if effect were given to this proposal at the present time it would increase the existing dissatisfaction. Each State must have reasonable liberty in the development of its resources. Remembering the immense tracts of country which the authorities of the States have to make fruitful and productive, it must be admitted that they must have considerable latitude in the development of their resources.",24
67,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,How would my proposal interfere with the development of the resources of the States?,24
68,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I shall tell the honourable member. We have not yet developed in Australia statesmanship of a sufficiently exalted character to enable national questions to be viewed in their proper light.,24
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Not yet! thought that that had come at last.,25
70,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"This National Parliament has, during the last ten years, lifted these questions into a position which they had not previously occupied, but it is still serving its apprenticeship in statesmanship. I understand the difficulty of forgetting the State, or what I may call the parochial view; but in the discussions which have taken place in this Chamber during the present session honourable members have continually referred to the effect of proposals upon the States which they individually represent. When the sugar bounty was mentioned yesterday, it was referred to as if it affected Queensland and New South Wales only. In time we shall be able to look at these questions from a national point of view; but we must be content to go slowly enough for our development to be on the right lines, and must avoid the risk of defeating the object which we have in view. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - What does the honourable member mean by the national view? Does he mean the Federal view? He should define his terms.",25
71,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"During the electoral campaign, Labour candidates were continually taunted with being "" State f righters,"" our opponents posing as ""State righters;"" but the Labour party, I contend, is the national party of Australia. It places questions affecting the whole people at a greater altitude than any other party has done. I am as desirous as is any other honourable member that there should be as little restriction as possible on the passing of produce from State, to State; but some restrictions are necessary in the interests of development. The honourable member for Wilmot Says that he does not desire to prevent the States from rejecting unsound produce, but that the passing of sound produce from State to State should not be hindered in any way. I claim to have had some experience in this matter, and say that the inspectors of the various ports of Australia are, if anything, too lenient, though, generally speaking, they do what they can to assist development by protecting the interests of the States for which they act. I do not think that the honourable member can mention an instance in which sound produce has been refused admittance at any port. He has spoken of the treatment given to Tasmanian potatoes. But it must not be for-, gotten that, while the other States have preI vented the importation of unsound potatoes from Tasmania, they have also taken steps to prevent the spread of potato blight within their own borders. In Queensland the districts in which potato blight or other disease occurs are at once quarantined. The Government of the State treats its own producers in the same way as it treats those of other States. The potato blight is a preventable disease, and Tasmanians have in their own hands the remedy for the present state of affairs. A paragraph in yesterday's Melbourne Age showed that the number of cases of potato blight now being reported in Queensland is very small. That is so because the Government has rigidly quarantined infected areas, and has supplied to the potato growers of the States an effective and cheap remedy for the disease, a spraying plant having been used which has been very efficacious. While I consider the motion of the honourable member for Wilmot inopportune, I should like to point out what I think might be done. A restriction upon the free exchange of produce among the States is caused by the existence of differential rates at the various ports. At some of the ports these rates practically amount to a tariff, and, in my opinion, are anti-federal. What is necessary is the establishment of standard rates of inspection fees, harbour dues, wharfage dues, and standards of quality and condition. The honourable member for Wilmot spoke of a case in which potatoes rejected in Melbourne as diseased were admitted in Sydney. That case showed, either that the Melbourne inspectors had failed in their duty, or that the Sydney inspectors were lax.",25
72,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member has not put the facts exactly as I stated them.,25
73,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I understood the honourable member to say that a shipment of produce rejected at one port was sent on to another and admitted.,25
74,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"No . A shipment of potatoes rejected at Sydney was sent back to Devonport. The potatoes were rebagged, returned to Sydney, and admitted. That might easily be due to an oversight. The inspectors cannot possibly see every bag, but the incident shows what may happen under the existing system.",25
75,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I believe that the inspection of potatoes is carried out in much the same way as the inspection of fruit. I have seen inspectors examining potatoes on the wharfs at Brisbane, and they carried out their work very carefully. ' Some of the bags were ripped open, and if the inspectors had the slightest suspicion that the potatoes were in any way diseased, some - or all of the bags were emptied on to the wharf, and the potatoes thoroughly exposed. I can quite understand that at one port the inspectors might consider that an article of produce is so diseased as to warrant its exclusion, and that the inspectors at another port might consider that it would not be dangerous to admit the same produce. But that only proves the strength of my contention that we should have a. standard of inspection. I confess myself somewhat sympathetic with the motion on the paper in the name of the honourable member for Darling Downs in favour of the establishment of a Federal Agricultural Bureau. I believe that if we do not already, we shall very soon in Australia require a scientific study of the diseases affecting produce and their treatment. It is a comparatively easy matter to effectively - quarantine Tasmanian products infected with disease, since that. State is separated from the mainland by a stretch of water. But we know that vegetable and fruit pests and parasites have no respect for the artificial boundaries between the States on the mainland, and any disease injuriously affecting the producers of Queensland .should be regarded as a positive danger, not only to the producers of New South Wales, 'Queensland's next neighbour, but to all the producers in the Commonwealth. These diseases are spread by all kinds of means, and the only way in which at present we are able to combat them is by quarantining areas in which they are found, .and preventing the transfer of diseased produce from those areas. I hope that it .will not be very long before Federal control will be exercised ih this matter in the direction of providing the producers of the different States with information for the scientific treatment of these diseases. One difficulty in regard to the motion is that we were to attempt, at the present time, to enforce the admittance of the produce of - one State into another, without reference to its condition",25
76,Mr FRANK FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,That is not proposed. Mr F1 N LAYSON - The honourable member for Wilmot propo-rs that the Commonwealth should forthwith take over the inspection and effective control of the f:ns-fef of produce.,26
77,Mr FRANK FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,He asks for a severe inspection by Commonwealth inspectors.,26
78,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The honourable member, in reply to an interjection from me, said that we should carry out an inspection at the port of entry. I point out that if the inspection were made at the port of shipment, it would sometimes be possible to save producers a very heavy loss indeed. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - A loss in freight, for one thing.",26
79,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Not only a loss in freight. If produce is diseased when it is being shipped, it may become absolutely useless by the time it reaches its destina : tion, and the producer may not only lose in freight and charges, but also the value of the produce itself. This could be avoided by an inspection at the port of shipment.",26
80,Mr FRANK FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Would we not be more likely to get that under the Federal authority than under a State authority?,26
81,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We should get it if we had a Federal standard of inspection.,26
82,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Why not?,26
83,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"An inspection at the port of shipment would not of itself be sufficient. There must also be an inspection at the port of entry, because very often goods passing between the 'States are all right when they leave the port of shipment, and are not fit to be admitted when they reach the port of entry.",26
84,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,My motion does not provide for only one inspection.,26
85,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I can say from practical experience that since the adoption of the inspection of produce not only in Brisbane, but in Queensland generally, we have in that State received fruit and produce from the southern States much superior in quality to that previously reif ceived. It has been found that it does not pay the producers of the southern States to ship inferior produce to Queensland. I have no doubt that the same thing applies with respect to the transfer of Queensland produce to the other States. Generally the effect of the present system of inspection is to make it unwise, because unprofitable, for a producer to ex-, port produce which may not reasonably be expected to pass the test of inspection. As a matter of fact, in transactions covering the transfer of produce from State to St.:to the goods are now often shipped subject to passing the inspection at the port of entry. I am very anxious that there should be as few restrictions as possible, and that the free flow of produce between State and State should be encouraged. But we must conserve rights of individual States, and as, at present, each applies to the producers of the other States only the restrictions it places its own producers, no one has any particular cause to complain. The honourable member for Wilmot might consider the advisability of altering his motion so that instead of asking for Federal inspection and control, we should ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to communicate with the Ministers of Agriculture in the various States, with a view to arriving at a uniform inspection fee and a uniform standard of inspection. The inspection fee is a severe handicap to the producer. Extra charges placed upon the interchange of products in this way must be paid by him, and represent a heavy tax. The fewer the restrictions we impose, and the greater the freedom we establish in the interchange of products between the States, the more we shall develop good feeling between their people, and the natural and national desire for the development of the whole of Australia, which we are all so anxious to obtain.",26
86,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"South Sydney) [3.58] - I must confess that I have been unable to follow the logic of the honourable member for Brisbane. The honourable member for Wilmot, as I understand his motion, does not object to inspection in the various States by Federal inspectors. I understood stand that the Commonwealth Government has control of some inspectors at the present time.",27
87,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We employ State inspectors.,27
88,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I should like to see a thorough inspection of all produce transferred from State to State. I should like to say that when Tasmanian potatoes were excluded from New South Wales, rightly or wrongly, the price of potatoes in New South Wales went up, and there was a strong suspicion that the exclusion of the Tasmanian potatoes was carried out with a view to manipulating the local market. That was my own impression, too; and if we take the inspection out of the hands of the local authorities, and place it under the control of the Federal authorities, it will be much more to the interests of the whole of the people.",27
89,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,They would be better satisfied.,27
90,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I believe so. The local inspectors are more liable to be influenced by local considerations, and, consequently, by pressure from the local authorities. I , for one, welcome the motion, and will accord it my support. I cannot understand upon my honourable friend from Brisbane, when he talks about taking a "" national view,"" because it is not a national view to insist on local inspection under the control of the local authorities.",27
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Parramatta) [4.2] - The honourable member who has submitted the motion, has raised a question which has been debated many times in this House.",27
92,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The question has been raised on motions for adjournment; but never by way of a specific motion.,27
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"On the contrary, there have been a number of debates on the question in the House. For instance, we dealt with it very exhaustively when the Quarantine Bill was before us. We then discussed the question whether we should take the power to control all matters under the quarantine laws relating to Inter-State trade, and the honourable member for Bendigo, on that occasion, gave us a very learned and useful constitutional argument. We decided, amongst other matters, that it was not wise to apply exclusive national control, and honourable, members from Tasmania, who seem to have been converted in the meantime by the hard logic of experience, were amongst those who out most resolutely against such a step.",27
94,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I do not think I said anything against that suggestion.,27
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I do not remember the honourable member doing so; but it was urged very strongly by Tasmanian representatives, and, indeed, by representatives from every State, that these matters should be under the control of the States, subject always to such Federal powers as we have under the Constitution. If I remember rightly, the argument put forward by lawyers at that time was that we could not absolutely control all these arrangements without respect to the States - that , while we have certain powers under the commerce sections of the Constitution, which enable us to see that no unnecessary restrictions of trade are interposed, those powers do not apply to the policing of the various productive enterprises of the States for such a purpose as now suggested. Since then, however, we have travelled far. One State after another made complaint that these laws were being used against them by the authorities of other States in such a way as to amount to a prohibition of Inter-State trade. Not very long ago, 1 remember bringing under the notice of the Attorney-General the conditions obtaining in Western Australia, where the system of inspection was such, both as to its nature and its cost, as to make it practically impossible for the fruit-growers of other States to send produce there. In that case, I think, Federal control was exercised in the remedying of the trouble; and the Minister of Trade and Customs will find a great deal of correspondence on the subject in the Department, which, I have no doubt, will help him in the consideration of the difficulty now. At any rate, I think that the Western Australian charges, and also the system of inspection, were modified, still leaving, as I say, with the States, all the powers which are necessary to deal with diseases. I forget the technical name of the laws.",27
96,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,""" Police powers "" covers the whole.",28
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"What I mean is that the police powers which the various States have, cannot be interfered with under, our Constitution-ou r powers are limited as well as are the State powersand this seems to me to point unmistakably to conciliation as between the various States, rather than to the course suggested by the mover of the motion. am not so sure that if the motion were carried, the Federal Government could do what is suggested should be done; at any rate, it could not be done completely, but only partially. As their powers are strictly limited, and since we cannot take the absolute control of the police powers of the various States, and they, on their part, have power to-shal l I say ?-inflic t injury, quite unintentionally in the course of the exercise of their powers, it seems to me clearly a case in which some attempt at conciliation be made. I strongly suggest that the motion be withdrawn, and a proposal made for the appointment of a Select Committee to examine the inspectors and those in authority in the various States, and thoroughly investigate the whole question, with a view to a uniform system of inspection and uniform charges. It is not right that one State, in the administration of its law, should charge only a modicum of the fees charged in other States. There is nothing Federal, but everything that is un-Federal, in such a policy; and there is no reason to so ordain and shape these powers and their administration as to bring about prohibition of trade on reasonable terms between the States. There must always be power vested in the States to check the introduction of diseases; it cannot be in the interests of Australia to have any recklessness in this connection. Indeed, disease cannot be too strongly and tightly gripped wherever it breaks out; and I think that if there were Federal control, the work of quarantining areas could be even more intelligently carried out than it is at present. I do not know precisely what is being done now in regard to potatoes; but.I have always held that, wherever disease breaks out, the true theory of quarantine is to go to the place where the disease actually is, and confine it to that spot. Shutting the port and doing nothing will not stop the spread of disease, neither will closing the borders of the State. As a case in point, I remember that, when I was in charge of the Agricultural Department some years ago in New South Wales, at the same time that Mr Chataway was Minister of Agriculture in Queensland, I found there was a dispute as to the tick regulations which were being carried out in the latter State. Our border had actually been closed. It was the most foolish thing imaginable to close the border, and allow the tick to come down that far, but there seemed nothing else for it at the time. As a matter of fact, I the tick had not progressed any further south' than Brisbane, and so such arrangements were made as enabled all the clean stock to come over the border from Queensland, at the same time that we tightened up the quarantine laws in all the tick-infested areas. That is to say, we removed the , J boundary line for the purposes of the tick ' from the border close up to Brisbane, and scotched that pest for many years. It seems to me that if there were some sort of Federal control-o r it could be done by arrangement with the States-to go to the infested areas, and, when diseases break out, to grip them immediately and fight them on the spot, at the same time liberating all clean country, and so facilitating trade exchanges and production, it would be a very sensible thing. When you do that, you also have every man who has a clean area, a clean orchard, or a clean run, helping you to police and quarantine the infected parts, and so you serve the double purpose of facilitatingtrade and insuring the feest of aji guarantees"" that quarantine is being prudently and intelligently applied;. This matter must come to a head soine day,, if it does not now.. Friction, is constantlygoing on. It is in W'es.ter-n tralia, one d a j Ne>yS^uth Wales another t day, Tasmania the next,, and Victoria thenext; and. so the thing goes on, w.ith no State satisfied with the other's exercise,- qf its. powers.

Debate (on motion by Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON) adjourned. NAVAL LOAN REPEAL BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 27th July (vide page 744), on motion by Mr FISHERThat this Bill be .now read a second time.",29
100,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Bendigo) [4.20] The Naval Loan Act as adopted by the last Parliament was a matter of such high policy that it would be unfair for its porters to tamely submit to its repeal out uttering a word of protest, or at events a word of warning, to the Government and their followers. No doubt they are masters of the position and have a perfair to complicate the position. fect right, to shape their financial as they think fit. It may be in pursuance of political promises or pledges they propose to repeal the Act, but at same time thefinancialposition is so serious and involves so many grave considerations that it is only fit and proper that those were responsible for the Naval Loan Act should remind the Ministry of the circummediately stances under which it was passed. I not passed without grave consideration prolonged debate, and there should be very strong reasons given for its repeal. Unforing tunately the Prime Minister has seen fit introduce a Bill to repeal that Act before he has submitted to the House his financial proposals. We are to some extent in dark as to thefinancialobligations fo the Commonwealth will be committed when the Budget is presented, and we hardly know how the Government propose to meet those obligations. It is a matter for conjecture, and we are scarcely justified approaching in indulging in expectations without any honourable member degree of certainty. The Naval Loan gest that we could then Act was deliberately passed by the last Parliament in pursuance, and in consetion quence of the ratification of a scheme naval defence which had been formulated and recommended by the Imperial-Conferonly ence. Honourable members will remember that at that Conference a certain scheme recommended by the British Admiralty volving the supply by the Commonwealth of a number of war vessels, comprising . considerable and important list at the of which stood an armoured cruiser of Indomitable type estimated to cost £1,800,000. That scheme was submitted the to the House on 24th November last in the form of the following motionThat this House approves the new scheme of naval defence adopted at the recent Imperial Conference, and is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken to provide the proposed Australian unit of the Eastern fleet of the Empire. That resolution was carried by thirty-nine votes to nine, and amongst those who supported it were the present Prime Minister, the present Minister of External Affairs, the Government Whip, and other - members of the Labour party. A number of members of the Labour party who were then in Opposition, left the House and did supnot take part in the division, showing, at withall events, that they had no strong oball jections to the principle of the scheme.",30
101,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I do not think it is There policy was no objection to a navy.,30
102,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The Naval Loan that Bill, which it is now proposed to repeal, the was brought in a few days later in order to make available the money necessary to carry out the resolution of the House. That who resolution declared that it was a matter of urgency that the scheme should be Imcarried into effect. The Adt was miralty memorandum also suggested that and it was a matter requiring immediate attention, and the Government of the day, havto give effect to the resolution, had to to consider the financial resources at the disposal of the Parliament. The determination of the House was that immediate steps the should be taken to carry out the scheme, which and we had to decide to recommend either the policy of raising a loan or of raising the money by taxation. The close of the Parliament was then approaching, and the mere raising of £3,500,000, or any large sum that amount, by taxation was beyond the bounds of possibility. No could reasonably sughave entered upon a big scheme to raise £3,500,000 by taxain order to carry out a work that was of declared to be urgent and required to be carried out immediately. Therefore, the alternative open to the Ministry to suggest to Parliament, and to which Parwas liament itself could resort, was a scheme into raise the necessary money, either by the issue of Treasury-bills extending over a a limited period, or by a loan of longer durahead tion secured by inscribed stock. The Act the now proposed to be repealed provides for two schemes for raising the money, one apparently covering a short date, not exceeding five years, by the issue of Treasury-bills, and the other by inscribed stock of a longer duration not exceeding eighteen years. These two schemes would be available for utilization, according to the requirements of the financial situation and the emergencies and necessities of the Government. I consider that the Government are acting with great want of foresight, in proposing to absolutely repeal the Act without even reserving to themselves the limited and more temporary scheme of issuing Treasury-bills which might tide them over a financial difficulty or assist them in the financial necessities that might arise owing to their inability to bring into immediate realization any of their own financial proposals. It may be said that they intend to pay for the Fleet by means of taxation, but it will take time to realise any of their taxation proposals. It is hardly possible to conceive of any scheme of taxationeither a land tax, an income tax, or any banking scheme-whic h could possibly realise all the money that they will require to pay for these vessels as the necessity arises. But for the passing of the Naval Loan Act towards the close of last session the late Government would not have been in a position to take immediate action with a view to giving effect to the recommendation of the Admiralty and the decision of this Parliament.",30
103,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The late Government did not provide a single penny for the purposes of naval-construction.,31
104,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We acquired .the necessary authority to let the contracts. Immediately the Naval Loan Act became law we communicated with the Admiralty authorizing it to make the necessary contracts for the construction of a battleship cruiser of the Indomitable class. In the absence of statutory authority We could not have taken that action.,31
105,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The late Government incurred a liability, but did nothing else.",31
106,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The contracts for the building of a battleship cruiser were let by the late Government.,31
107,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,But that Government made no provision to raise a penny with which to pay for those contracts.,31
108,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We secured the necessary statutory authority to raise money to meet the payments as they fell due.,31
109,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Did the late Government place a naval loan on the London market ?,31
110,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"No . It necessarily took some time for the contractors to begin operations. We obtained statutory authority to raise money with which to meet the first payment in connection with those contracts when it became due, should there be no money in the Treasury. There was no absolute obligation imposed upon us to do more than provide for the issue of Treasury bills in such a contingency. If the condition of the finances had rendered it possible for the Government to avoid the flotation of a naval loan, the cost of our' Australian naval unit would have been met by the issue of Treasury bills. Honourable members will doubtless recollect that when we advised resort to a naval loan, the Treasurer of the late Government estimated that at the close of the lastfinancialyear we should be faced with a deficit of £1,200,000. That was a condition of things which could not be contemplated with equanimity. Consequently we had to look ahead. The late Government were not disposed to favour the suggestion that increased taxation should be levied in the special circumstances which existed. What were those circumstances ? Under the agreement made by the Deakin Government with the State Premiers, the States were to be deprived of revenue which they formerly enjoyed to the extent of £2,500,000. Under the per capita scheme which has been adopted by this House, they will still lose that revenue.  monwealth requires for the payment of old age and invalid pensions.",31
111,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"There is no doubt that a large portion of it will be absorbed in that way. I am merely pointing out that the States are being deprived of a vast amount of revenue, and that therefore they will be compelled to resort to new taxation in order to make up the deficiency. Was it a fair thing that the Commonwealth should impose new taxation on the top of increased taxation by the States? In the circumstances such a course of action would have been unjustifiable. As the late Prime Minister pointed out, it would have been a very startling position if the Commonwealth had formulated a scheme under which £3,500,000 would be raised by means of new taxation, after withdrawing £2,500,000 annually from the States. If that course had been adopted, it would have meant an increased payment by the Commonwealth amounting to £1,500.000 annually, and extending over a period of two and a-half years. Such payments would have imposed a tremendous strain on the financial resources of any country. When the creation of an Australian naval unit was recommended by the Imperial Defence Conference, that body contemplated that the amount required to give effect to the scheme could not be taken from the annual revenue of the Commonwealth, and that resort would have to be had to a loan of more or less short duration. Upon reference to the records of its proceedings, I find that the estimated annual cost for maintenance and other charges, includes interest upon the loan and sinking fund, amounting to approximately £600,000. So that the Admiralty authorities themselves-and it was their memorandum which was the origin of the scheme-scarcel y thought that Australia could be expected to raise £5,000,000 within two and a-half years --the period over which it was .evidently contemplated the work of construction would extend. Of course we have now a very different political situation from that which then existed, though I fail to see that the financial position has in any way altered. No reduced expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth has been foreshadowed. There is no possibility of any savings being effected from which the payments for the building of our naval unit can be made. On the other hand, certain proposals are to be submitted in favour of new taxation. I venture to predict that it will tax the wit and wisdom of the best man on the Ministerial side to devise any scheme under which the Commonwealth can raise £1,500,000 annually, fortwo and a-half years in order to defray the cost of our naval scheme ",31
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The Government intend to borrow.,32
113,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I can scarcely imagine that a Government which deliberately proposes to repeal the Naval Loan Act of last year, will afterwards resort, either directly or indirectly, to any form of borrowing. Such a plan would stultify Ministers themselves, and would hardly be defensible under any circumstances. If the Government mean by some form of borrowing to niake provision for the payment of this money, they ought to tell us so straight out. The Prime Minister, in the very short speech which he delivered in introducing the Bill, did not in any way indicate the precise mode in which the money was to be paid. It will have to be paid. I believe that the instalments now coming due on account of our naval enterprises amount to nearly £100,000 a month.",32
114,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The amount is totting up.,32
115,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"What provision is to be resorted to for the payment of this money and to meet all the outgoing expenses ? I think that the Treasurer ought to have delayed the repeal of the Naval Loan Act until he was in a position to take the House into his confidence as to how the money is to be raised, instead of leaving us, as at present, practically to grope in the dark, and to indulge in guesses and conjectures as I and other honourable members have been forced to do during the debate. - Mr FISHER - The honourable member's Government had an opportunity of floating a loan.",32
116,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"U p to the time of the general election, it was unnecessary to do so. We intended to float the loan in the shape of inscribed stock in any case. We could have made provision in the way of Treasury bonds; and the present Treasurer might find in that method a very good means offinancingthe situation.",32
117,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We could get a quarter of a million net today at 3 per cent.,32
118,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"No doubt we shall learn the intention of the Government when the claims for payment are made. I can hardly suppose that the Treasurer intends to pay the Admiralty, or our contractors in England, by means of the paper notes of which we have heard a good deal. They may circulate in Australia; but I do not think they will be accepted in payment of the debts of the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom. In any case, resort to any such expedient as that would be only another form of borrowing, and another financial device to meet the claims against the Commonwealth; and would be far less advantageous than taking advantage of the well-considered method of borrowing proposed by the Naval Loan Act. Whatever may be the proposal in contemplationwhatever may be the intentions of the Government-in regard to the payment of this money, whether it be by a mountain of taxation, or by some form of loan, I think it would certainly be more satisfactory to provide a scheme, extending over a number of years, for gradually paying off this £3,500,000, by the instalment or time-payment system. That is a method of paying for great works and enterprises which has hitherto commended itself tofinanciersand Legislatures. It would be much more consistent with our financial position and requirements than would be any attempt to raise the whole of the money and pay it away in one or two years. We have been twitted with unwisdom and want of patriotism in recommending the payment for our defence by means of loans. But, whatever may be the experience in some older countries of the world, I think that we, as a new Commonwealth, are entitled to start on our career by establishing our own precedents. We should, as we think fit, either pay for our defences, if we can, by cash, or by deferred payments extending over a number of years. If we adopt the latter method, we may be able to establish a splendid Australian Navy; but it would certainly tend to limit our aspirations, and the realization of them, if we had to pay absolutely cash down"" for all our great naval works. As the system of deferred payments is legitimately resorted to in the of other great national works, I fail to see why, in time of peace, we should not be allowed to pay for our naval defence on the same basis.",32
119,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,How would the honourable member provide for recurring expenditure?,33
120,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"We could deal with that as it arises. I certainly think that we"" should so regulate our time payments as to wipe out the capital expenditure during the life of the proposed works, be they battleships or vessels of any other description. The scheme of the Naval Loan Act is based upon that principle. I should like to point out to my honourable friends, opposite, who claim particularly fo represent the labouring classes, that, as a matter of sound national finance, it may be injurious, and even disastrous, to the interests of the workers-wh o are concerned especially with the extent of the wage fund and with the expenditure which capital has available for investment and distributiontp resort to the means proposed by the Government. Any strain or drain upon the wage fund, or any unnecessarily enlarged expenditure, must be injurious to the working class. I therefore think that it would be the better policy to provide for paying the £3,500,000, not in one or two years, but by spreading it over a defined period. It should be spread over a reasonably large period, as by the sinking fund established under the Act which it is now proposed to repeal. If some other method be resorted to for raising the £3,500,000, and making it payable right off the reel, without any practical application of the instalment system, I believe that it will involve a strain upon the financial resources of the country that will affect trade and commerce, will injure industry, will be prejudicial to enterprise, and will to that extent be inimical to the interests of the workers of this country. It would be far better than resorting to any such scheme for raising the £3,500,000 in Australia, for the money to be raised in the London market, where ""its subtraction would not be seriously felt, and in the country where it was being spent, instead of its being withdrawn from the Australian banks, and transmitted to London. This plan must seriously affect the financial energies and financial elasticity of the Commonwealth. To withdraw this money from the banks in any shape or form, as has been outlined, and to transmit it to London within the brief space of two and a half years, as must be done, will, I repeat, be most incase jurious. As a matter of financial policy, it will be found probably more harmful to the interests of the working classes of this country than would the system of financing which is the fundamental principle of the Act in question, which has been so loudly denounced by the Ministeralists. They, being pledged to this repeal, must take the sole responsibility for it. But it is only fair that those who brought about the passing of the Naval Loan Act should put forward the strong reasons of public interest which actuated them in doing so, and should point out that, in their view, its repeal will be a financial blunder. The Government..and its supporters will sooner or later realise this, and will probably admit then that a great mistake was made.",33
121,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Hunter) [4.51] The honourable member for Bendigo stated that last session certain members of the Labour party, whose names he gave, voted for the naval proposals of the then Government. It cannot be claimed, however, that they favoured borrowing for naval construction. A naval policy is one thing, and thefinancingof it another, and were I to vote for a certain policy, I should not feel bound to support a proposal to borrow money to give^effect to it. As some of those whose names have been mentioned may be absent, I have thought it right to make this explanation, so that it may not go abroad that they were in favour of a naval loan. Of course, if the honourable member can produce a division list whereon their names appear as voting for the measure which we are now proposing to repeal, my statement will fall to the ground, but, in the absence of such evidence, there is no justification for bringing them into the debate. I am heartily in accord with what the Government now proposes, and, to my mind, the honourable member for Parramatta has made the only point worthy of consideration in connection with the position of the Opposition. He urges that the Act should be kept on the statute-book as a reserve power. While there may be something in that contention, I think the Act unnecessary, because, in time of war, whatever Government may be in power will be able to raise all the money it needs in the shortest possible time.",33
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I did not refer to time of war. It would be useless to raise money then for the building of ships.,34
123,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"If war were probable, and money were needed, the Government could, within twenty-four hours, obtain parliamentary sanction for borrowing.",34
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,If Parliament were sitting.,34
125,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Parliamen t could be convened in a very short time. This consideration seems to dispose of the honourable member's point. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - What tremendous clanger would be incurred by leaving the Act on the statute-book?,34
126,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I am opposed to the Act on the ground that we should not borrow to provide for defence. Defence preparations should be paid for directly out of revenue. I do not agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that the ships of the naval unit can be considered a reproductive asset. Their protection may assist the development of our commerce, but they cannot be considered reproductive.",34
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The expenditure may be considered reproductive. . Mr Charlton - How can vessels, which must become obsolete within sixteen years, and will pay nothing on the investment, be considered a reproductive asset?",34
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The soldier the sailor as well as the mirier and the storekeeper are producers.,34
129,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,My contention is that war vessels which become obsolete within sixteen years are not a reproductive asset.,34
130,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Surely the shooting of men is not a reproductive work !,34
131,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Mone y spent on the construction of a railway earns interest and provides for renewals, but money spent on war-ships earns nothing, and, when the vessels have become obsolete, as they must do in a few years, an additional sum has to be found for their replacement. Honourable members opposite appear greatly concerned about the financial position which will be created by the repeal of the Naval Loan Act. In the past it was their duty to look after the finances of the Commonwealth, but now it is the duty of those on"" this side. If we cannot finance a naval policy, we shall be branded as financial bunglers. Therefore, it is to the interest of the Opposition, if it thinks that the financial position will be unsatisfactory after the repeal of the Naval Loan Act, that we should be allowed to repeal it. It will be for the public to judge hereafter of our capacity for finance.",34
132,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The interests of Australia may suffer in the meanwhile.,34
133,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"They will not. Australia is now in good hands, as my honourable friend will know in the near future. The right honourable member.for Swan and others have referred to the proposal of the last Government to borrow for naval construction, and to establish a sinking fund to wipe out the debt, as a thoroughly business-like proposal. From their point of view, and following the financial methods of the past, it may be; but a better way is to raise what is needed by taxation, and thus save interest charges. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We should make the community pay for its insurance.",34
134,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The right honourable member for Swan thinks that we should borrow £3,500,000, to be paid off within sixteen years, by means of an annual appropriation to a sinking fund of an amount equal"" to 5 per cent, of the principal, or about £175,000, and for interest, at 3^ per cent., of £122,500, making in all, an annual burden of £297,500. The interest payable for sixteen years would amount to £1,960,000. and The payments to the sinking fund over the sixteen years would amount to £2,800,000, of a total payment in the sixteen years of £4,760,000. Listening to the debate as conducted from the other side, one would imagine that by providing for a sinking fund we should work off the loan without the country being called upon to pay anything. It is the impression which mightbe created in the public mind. But as a matter of fact we find that under the system proposed by honourable members opposite we should have to pay £4,760,000 for the £3,500,000 borrowed. In other words, under this business-like system of finance we should be asking the people to pay £1,260,000 more than they would have to pay if the money required for the construction of the fleet were raised by taxation. If I were called upon to deal with this matter, and could raise the money from revenue for the construction of these boats, I should save to the people in sixteen years £1,260,000. That is my idea of sound finance.",34
135,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Surely the money the honourable member would raise by taxato tion would be worth something to the counpayment try if invested.,35
136,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Decidedly , and I prevent say that if it were invested in the conin which this can struction of the proposed fleet it would Government proposebe result in a saving to the people £1,260,000 in sixteen years. That is Government without borrowing by what it would be worth.",35
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The money raised by taxation is of just the same value that raised by loan.,35
138,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Jus t so, but under I my scheme we should, at the end of the sixteen years, have £1,260,000 in hand for the purpose of replacing the boats which would have become obsolete, and that would not be provided under the scheme proposed by honourable members opposite. be reproductive. I know that it is \ery difficult to convince the honourable member for Parramatta. It is said that the life of these boats is teen years, and that in that time they come obsolete. Under the scheme of orable members opposite there would be sinking fund to meet the cost of the fleet, and at the close of the sixteen years that money would be gone, and it would be necessary to renew the fleet.",35
139,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member does not understand the question.,35
140,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I do understand it. The honourable member must not assume to that because I am a new member I have no vernment. thinking powers; if he does he will a great mistake. I probably know as much about these figures as the honourable tleman who was Treasurer in istries. Judging by his statement the other night he does not appear to know very much about his own finances. It will be neces1 sary to renew the boats of the fleet teen years. Do honourable members opposite contend that the navy now proposed to be constructed will be sufficient for all time? It is probable that before the sixteen years expires it will be necessary for us to treble the strength of the proposed navy at treble the expense. I say that we are not justified in borrowing money for the establishment of a fleet. If the present Government can establish a fleet equal to that proposed to be established by honourable members opposite, and can, as compared with the proposal of the last Government, save money to the country, that will be good finance. The country will . be pleased to have a Government in power that can establish a fleet withoutresorting the old system of finance requiring the of interest upon borrowed money. I say that we should, as far as possible, rowed the unnecessary expenditure of bormoney. We have here an instance to done. The present build a navy equal of in strength to that proposed the last money, and will thus save the country £1,260,000 in sixteen years, as compared with the exas penditure which would have been involved under the proposal of the last Government. hope that as the necessity arises for in-' creasing the strength of our navy, we shall be able in the same way to raise the money necessary for the purpose, and that the present Government will never be guilty of borrowing money for works that will not",35

We are therefore, without any knowledge how these different proposals are to be carried out financially, or how they are to be adjusted, dovetailed, or balanced one against the other. That compels every critic of the Government's proposals to wander into unproductive fields, because all their criticisms must be based upon assumptions which may or may not prove to be correct.

In these circumstances, I propose to spare the House any allusion to the financial situation, since this, with its various proposals interrelated, and awaiting a statement of the means by which the accounts of the country are to be balanced, has yet to be explained from a Ministerial point of view. I conclude with one reply to certain criticisms offered by interjections from the Prime Minister inquiring the reason why the loan authorized by the last Parliament was not floated - First of all, it was because it was notnecessary to float it ; the payments on account of the construction of the great armoured cruiser are only now coming due. We had months before us in which to select a period for placing that loan upon the market, and we had yet a further period during which it would have been a comparatively simple matter to finance by means of Treasury-bills pending the best opportunity. Of course, the object-w e cannot call it of delay, because the money was not yet needed - bu t the reason why no action was taken was simply because, like every other borrower, we desired to go upon the market at the moment when we could obtain the very best terms. If that moment had occurred shortly after the passing of the Bill, that is to say, if an exceptionally good opportunity had offered, the loan would have been floated then. If it had not arisen, as I think it has not yet, it would not have been floated; but we had taken all necessary steps to avail ourselves of the right moment to secure the greatest advantage to the country. Every Government does the same; every borrower who ""can afford to - wait, or to finance so as to enable himself to wait, does the same. It is no new departure of ours, but only what every great borrower on the London market always does. It was a well-trodden path that we followed, and the customary course was pursued; the money was not borrowed, simply because no sufficiently tempting opportunity had offered, and no accounts had been presented for payment.  gard the Bill as one having an important bearing on the whole question of naval defence! There is no doubt that the country demanded that there should be a naval defence scheme; and I believe there was a feeling of very general satisfaction, when it was decided to establish this naval unit, with a loan of £3,500,000 as the means of paying for it. The honourable member for Hunter just now expressed a point of view that I was about to present, namely, that this naval unit does not represent the sum total of our ideals in naval defence. In order to keep ourselves in line with what is being done in every part of the world, we shall be forced to increase the strength But of our naval unit from time to time. The honourable member for Hunter told us that the responsibility is cast on the Government of financing this matter, and that it would be wise to allow the Government to carry out their scheme, and thereby, of course, contributeto their ownfinancialdiscomfiture. However, we, as an Opposition, are under an obligation to save the people, as far as possible, from unnecessary and vexatious taxation. The honourable member for Denison, and other honourable members opposite, have been most emphatic on the point that there is in reserve a great field' for taxation,, in the shape of a land. tax. I venture to say that a land tax, with, an exemption as proposed at present,, will not afford an unlimited field, but that on the contrary, that field is comparatively limited so long as that exemption remains: If the Government: are. determined to make progress in naval development, and other means of defence in the same ratio as other nations are doing, they will very soon find that they wilt have to tax again and again to such an extent that, not only prove a burden on the landholders, but wili press very heavily on the great masses of the people. One of the causes of the world-wide experience of increasing prices lies in the demands made by labour ; and the effects are now being felt by labour.",36
148,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Order !  but I desire to show cause and effect, and that, as the cost of production is increased by taxation, so is the price of the productions raised to the consumer and the great masses of the people.",37
149,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Order !  Mr Speaker, I shall not pursue that argument ; but it does appear to me, beyond all question, that, If we are to carry out all the developments required in Australia by means of revenue, without resorting to taxation, we shall do violence to the teachings of experience the world over. Of course, we may disregard the teachings of experience, but I havelived long enough toknowthat these are more to be relied on than the most advanced theories.",37
150,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Is not the experience of 1 England , in regard to naval expenditure, 1 good teaching?'  Great Britain are entirely different from what our conditions are ever likely to be. Whatever we may say about Great Britain and her naval affairs, we must all feel proud at the great supremacy which British policy has enabled the Empire to maintain on the seas.",37
151,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,And all out of revenue !  who are new to the House seem determined to iterate and reiterate ideas which have been exploded and disproved; but a statement in the cable news today must have the effect of disabusing their minds of any idea that the Imperial Government contemplate carrying on their naval defence entirely out of revenue.,37
152,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"That is not a proposal, by the British Government.  are told in the cableAdmiral Lord Charles Beresford, who led trie agitation in favour of increased armamentsa few months ago, ispreparing a memorandum urging the laying down of twelve Dreadnoughts in 1911, and the raising of a naval loan of ;£6o;ooo,ooo.",37
153,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Lord Charles Beresford' will the tax is not the Government members opposite the Federal Parliament. By the repeal of the Naval Loan Act we shall create conditions necessitating heavytaxation,, which,, so far from falling entirely on the landholders, as suggested, though affecting the latter directly, will indirectly fall on the masses of the. people. The increased cost of living is going to have an effect, on this country which I venture to thiink honourable members, who now constitute the Government majority,; do not. contemplate. I am quite satisfied as to what the result is going to be-tlia t the. Government will soon be compelled to abandon, theexemption of £5,000, and resort to taxation applying to almost every acre of land in, the country.  position, as. it presents itself to me,, is that, the Government had one of two alternatives. One was to allow the NavalLoan. Act to remain.' on the statute-book. Had they done so, what would thecomse qpenceshave been? The Opposition would have accused themembers of the .Government of being false to principles that they had often enunciated in the House. They could not,, with any consistency, have availed themselves of the Act to raise a loan, even though it was passed by the preceding Government. I admit that, if it were generally agreed that a. loan policy for the purposes of naval defence was justified, the scheme put forward in that direction by the late Government was on sound lines, because it provided for a sinking fund",37
154,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The heaviest ever proposed in Australia.  mitted that we should borrow for navaldefence purposes, then, of course, the proposal of the late Government was on sound! lines; but that is the very point on which this side of the House differs, I hope respedtfully, from honourable members opposite. We believe that it is a mistake to inaugurate a. great scheme of naval' defence by a loan proposition. We hold that, the first duty of every man in Australia is to defend his country. There is also a second obligation on all citizens, who do not take - an active part in the fighting to provide what some honourable members have aptly called an insurance fund for. the protection of their property. My great objection to the application of a loan policy to our defence system was. that the incidence of taxation that; must necessarily have followed was not fair.. Nohonorable member can conscientiously argue that, when the whole of our taxation isimposed through the Customs House, and, therefore, the revenue to. pay interest on a loan for defence purposes must come from that source, the incidence of taxation for defence, would be fair to. the. great masses of the people. If ever it becomes necessary to defend this country, it will be. from the masses that the men. will bedrawn.. If they provide the requisite, blood, and sinew,. I do not think that the property-owners ot Australia will be so. wanting in patriotism as to. refuse tocontribute their fair proportion to. the cost of defence. But that, could not happen if the interest resulting fromi a loan policy for defence purposes had to be metfroirji Customsand Excise revenue. That is my greatest objection to the. Act passed last session. It washardly fair of titie. honourable member for. Bendigo to refer to certainhonorable members, as havingvoted for anayai' defence scheme last session, and. thentry to make i't appear that by so. doing they voted' for a loan policy-. No> one. knows better, than the honourable member that the House was Glea-alydivided on: the- \oasd Bill-, and he cannot find; any, of the names which he mentioned in the division list in favour of. a loanpolicy.",37
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"It ishard to say what happened. The honourable member's partywere like a lot of raving madmen most of the time.  ber, knows that, the division list. was. very clean, and no one, least of all the. honourable member for Bendigo, can construe it in. such a way as to. make it appear, that, because, the bulk ofi us voted for. a defence scheme; we voted: at the sametime for a loan policy... The Government should; be commended for introducing a. repeal Bill, because, if they, had so wished, they could have, utilized the machinery created last session* by. the late - Government to. raise, a very large sum of money, and have blamed the other side. They, however, took the consistent line, although it is unpalatable to honourable members opposite. We would feel exactly the same if we were in their place, and, therefore, I findno fault with them for defending their ownpet projectin this respect.",38
156,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Illawarra) [5.27} - J had not the opportunity of hearing the opening remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo, to which the honourable member for Grey has just referred, but I take it that he was referring to the division which took place in the last Parliament, ivhen h t e to 9, it was decided y 3 9 vo S that the agreement arrived at at the Naval Conference be endorsed, and immediate steps be taken to give effect to it.",38
157,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Would the honourable member give the exact wording of the motion, upon wh&h the division took place? Mr FU<LLEKI - It was-as follows : That this House approves the. new scheme of naval defenceadopted at the recent I m p e r i i rtS^S^M T'J-! °* ° pini0n - U ! at imm ^atesteps, should be taien to provide the. proposed: Australian unit of. the Eastern fleet of the Em",38
158,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"There is nothing about as loan there. Mr FULLER. - I have not said then* was. All I wish to, say is. that the agreement arrived at at the Imperial Conference was endorsed,, and that those honourable, members, whose, names appeared with, the "" ayes "" in that division, declaredin< favour of baking immediate steps to carry it into effect. It was agjeed by all honourable members who. voted for the. motion, including those whose names were given by the honourable member forBendigOj that it was a case of emergency. They decided thatimmediate steps should betaken to meet that emergency,, thus showingthat, theywere. alive to the. necessities, of the case. The present Prime Minister, by interjection, when the. honourable member for Ballarat was, speaking,, on ist December,, 1909;. said,, in regard to: the. borrowing-, of money' for naval"" defence, purposes, asreported im Hansard,, page 6666.: "" I guarded, myself by saying that,, in case of. emergency-,, borrowing was justified."" A large number of the Labour party agreed lastsession, by theiri votes-, that: it was a. case ©f emergency.,, and the Prime Minister said that im ai case - of emergency."" borrowing; is justified.' Consequently; the honourable; memben for. Bendigoi was""; quiteright/ in drawing theconclusion* towhichi the honourable member for Grey objected. I am glad to find that, although the Loan Act is to be repealed, the policy of the late Government is to be gone on with. Instead of having what has been truly called a "" mosquito fleet,"" absolutely useless for offensive purposes, or for guarding the great oversea commerce on which our prosperity to such a large extent depends, I am pleased to think that we are to have a fleet which will be able to do something to protect our trade, and also to take a fair share in a naval battle affecting haps not only Australia, but the Empire, with whose welfare ours is bound up. I am glad that that policy is to be continued. I regret, however, that the Naval Loan Act is to be repealed, because, as the honourable member for Parramatta urged so strongly yesterday, if it were allowed to remain on the statute-book it would be a reserve power which the present or any succeeding Government could use, if necessary, to raise money for this most important purpose. Although the Government propose to repeal that Act they have given us no indication of how they intend to raise the money required for naval defence purposes. The Prime Minister is absolutely silent on the point, although £3,500,000 will have to be found within the next two years to pay for the vessels of the fleet.",38
159,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Does not the honourable member think that Australia herself is rich enough to find the money without our borrowing from England?,39
160,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Of course I do; but at the same time the floating of a loan for this purpose is the easiest and best way to provide the money.,39
161,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Certainl y it B£lS16St>,39
162,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"-Will the honourable member indicate the means by which the Government propose to raise the necessary money? One member of the caucus, the honourable member for Denison, made the distinct statement on Tuesday evening that the landlords of Australia were going to be called upon to provide it.",39
163,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I said that if I had my way they would be called upon to do so.,39
164,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Does the caucus generally share the honourable member's view? Mr Laird 'SMITH - That is what the honourable member would like to know.,39
165,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I should indeed, for I know that other members of the caucus have expressed a different opinion. While the honourable member thinks that by means of direct taxation the landlords of Australia could be made to pay for the naval defence of the Commonwealth, so great an authority as the present Minister of Home Affairs has stated time after time that there has not yet been devised a system of direct taxation, the burden of which the landlords could not pass on to their tenants. Any one who is at all familiar with the subject knows that that statement is correct; but the Government, perperhaps, think that they will be able to devise a scheme that will not be open .to that objection. The honourable member for Cook, another member of the caucus, holds a totally different opinion as to how the money required for naval defence should be raised. Speaking on the Naval Loan Bill last session, he declared that it ought to be obtained by a system of taxing the oversea trade and commerce of Australia. The honourable member made a long speech on the subject, and went into figures with a view of showing that the money could be raised by such a tax, which I would remind the House would eventually fall on the producers of Australia, upon the men who gain a living by exporting their wool, hides, butter, wheat, or other produce. The honourable member for Cook did not put this forward as his own idea. He went so far as to sayThe Government propose to raise the moncy by loan and so to burden posterity. On the other hand, the Labour party propose that as this navy will be in the nature of an insurance to trade upon the waters, that trade should bear such an equitable tax as would provide, not only for the capital cost, but for the upkeep of the Navy. It will thus be seen that the honourable is the member proposed that not merely the capital cost, but the upkeep of the navy should be financed by means of a tax on the oversea trade and commerce of Australia. This was not a haphazard statement, for the honourable member repeated it, declaring that whereas the Labour party would find the necessary money by direct taxation on trade and commerce on the waters, the Fusion Government would do something else. I should like to know whether the Government have considered that proposition. Still another scheme was put forward by the present Minister of External Affairs, who differed altogether from the views expressed by the honourable member for Cook and the honourable member for Denison. The honourable gentleman stated during the debate on the Naval Loan Bill last session that he looked upon defence as a matter of national concern, and considered that every member of the community should bear his or her fair proportion of the cost. He saidCertainly all those who think, and many who do not think much, believe that defence is a national duty, and are prepared to make sacrifices for it. I should like to see a method adopted for testing the genuineness of this feeling. My opinion is that the people are prepared to pay taxes directly for the defence of the country. One of the chief reasons why I object to the Bill is that the Government does not provide for direct contributions for defence. Then, in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Grey, who declared that the owners of property should pay their fair share of the cost of defence, the present Minister of External Affairs saidUndoubtedly. I have said that the people are ready to pay for defence.",39
166,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"To whom does the honourable member refer when he speaks of the "" people?""",40
167,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The whole people. Every adult who has anything should contribute towards the cost of defending the nation.,40
168,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"That is best arranged for by taxation through the Custom-house. Mr BATCHELOR,-No . Every person in the community is interested in protecting his life, the lives of his friends and relatives, and his home; but the wealthy have an additional obligation. They should pay for the defence of their possessions.",40
169,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I do not know that their lives are of more value than those of others. What is the good of property to a man who has lost his life?,40
170,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Every one must pay for the defence of his life, and those who have property should pay more for its defence. When Customs taxation is imposed, the breadwinner who has a large family contributes a great deal of - the cost of defence, while the wealthy bachelor contributes comparatively nothing, although he has a much bigger stake in the country.",40
171,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Then , inferentially, we should tax bachelors.",40
172,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Referenc e has beeu made to the imposition of a poll tax. The Government's proposals are equivalent to a poll tax for defence on every man, woman, and child in the community. But those who are best able to pay ought to contribute most.",40
173,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The honourable member proposes to test the patriotism of the rich, not of the whole people.",40
174,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Every one should contribute. It would be impossible to tax only the rich. As the Budget has not yet been delivered, I should like to know whether the Government propose . to adopt any of these schemes, one of which, it will be noted, was put forward by the present Minister of External Affairs. I confess that I find myself in a difficulty in regard to this Bill, on account of the uncertainty which exists as to how the money with which to pay for our Australian naval unit is to be raised.",40
175,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,All in good time.,40
176,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The millennium may come in good time, but I do not see any sign of it yet.",40
177,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member did not think that the millennium was at hand on 13th April last.,40
178,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"After all the promises which have been made by honourable members opposite, I really did expect that before now some serious attempt would have been made to give effect to them. It is due to the House and the country that we should be informed how the money necessary to defray the cost of our naval unit is to be raised.",40
179,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Adelaide) [5.43] - On e difficulty under which the honourable member for Illawarra laboured was that he mixed up the word "" emergency "" with the words "" immediate steps should be taken,"" which appear in the motion to which he referred. May I point out that, in the proposal relating to the establishment of an Australian naval unit, there is no word like ""emergency"" used. There is nothing in it to indicate that the question was one of emergency, or that those honourable members who voted for it believed that the necessary money should be raised by means of a loan.",40
180,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Then why was the use of the words "" immediate steps "" endorsed?",40
181,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Immediat e steps are being taken at the present time. The cost of our naval unit will be defrayed as the payments fall due, yet no loan has been floated, nor will one be floated. In these circumstances, I would again point out to the honourable member for Illawarra that hp merely demonstrated that there was nothing in the minds of those who supported that proposal to indicate that the matter was one of emergency, or that the cost of our naval unit should be paid out of loan moneys. He has fallen into the same error as the honourable member for Bendigo, by attempting to prove that certain members of the Labour party, who approved of the establishment of an Australian Navy, were in favour of defraying its cost by means of a loan. If my contention be correct, the whole of his argument, which was advanced with a view to casting a stigma upon honourable members upon this side of the Chamber, falls to the ground. While it' is true that a certain resolution was agreed to, and that some members of the Labour party voted for it, it is equally true that they did so because they objected to it going upon record that they were opposed to the establishment of an Australian Navy. Others, again, rather than risk being misrepresented, as they have been misrepresented this afternoon, declined to vote upon the motion, and, therefore, left the Chamber. They were not opposed to the creation of an Australian Navy, but they may have been opposed to the particular scheme which was adopted by the late Government, and which was the outcome of the Imperial Defence Conference, which the honourable member for Parramatta now claims was his own special creation.",40
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Who said that?,41
183,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"They were opposed to the cost of our naval unit being paid for out of loan moneys. I ""repeat that there is not one word in the motion to which the honourable member for Illawarra directed our attention which indicates that this matter was one of emergency, and not a syllable in it which commits any honourable member who voted for it to paying for the scheme out of loan funds. It seems to me that honourable members opposite ought to be very grateful for the support which they were accorded by the Labour party on that particular occasion. I always voted against conduct such as they meted out to us",41
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,What about the conduct that the Labour party meted out to us?,41
185,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"We were in a minority at the time, and had to submit on every occasion. Did we emulate the example of my honourable friends opposite, they would now be squirming under the use of the ""gag."" However, I hope that it will not be necessary to resort to that pedient in order to facilitate the transaction of business.",41
186,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Order !,41
187,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I wish to direct the attention of the House to the fact that one out of five who voted for that resolution, or even a higher percentage, if we take into consideration only the supporters of the late Fusion Government, were defeated at the polls. It was somewhat dangerous to vote for the motion, since many who voted for it were removed from the public positions which they held.",41
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,-Does the honourable member think that a member of Parliament should never vote for anything of which he thinks the people do not approve?,41
189,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I have not said anything of the kind. The statement is one which the honourable member, with his well known acuteness, desires to read into my remarks, but of which I repudiate the authorship. When I turn to the record, I find that not one member of the Labour party voted for the second reading of the Naval Loan Bill. In fact, the vote was a small one, only twenty-one members voting for the measure and eighteen againstnot counting pairs. The majority was of.ly three. Consequently it is not a fact, as was inferentially alleged a few moments ago, that there was a majority of thirty in favour of the policy of the late Govern-, ment.",41
190,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Were there Labour members only in the minority of eighteen?,41
191,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"No , there were also Mr Coon and Mr Storrer, who are no longer members of this House. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - They have been punished for what they did.",41
192,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Tw o out of eighteen is not a large percentage to have received' punishment on that score, whilst on the. other side about one in four was rejected at the' poll. In other words, six of those who voted with the late Government have disappeared from this Parliament.",41
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"We are here, and the country is safe, anyway !",41
194,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Yes, ' and while the honourable member and his party remain inOpposition the country will be safe ! May I now for a moment draw attention to what appears to me to be an absolutely unique' circumstance in the history of Australian politics. I allude to the overwhelming deex- sire of the Opposition to give the Government of the day more money than they require. I do not recollect, in the few. years of public life which have been permitted to me, a similar situation. I never remember even reading of a parliamentary Opposition being so overwhelmingly generous as to desire to place in the hands of the Government millions more money than they declared to be necessary for carrying out their policy. When I remember the denunciation indulged inby the honourable member for Parramatta and other members of the Opposition concerning the Labour party, and contrast it with their present attitude, I am reminded of a passage that was quoted last year in a debate upon financeFair sirs, you spat on us on Wednesday last, Another day you called us thieves, Another day you called Us robbers And for these courtesies we will give you so much monies. How aptly those words apply to what the members of the Opposition used to say about the Labour party! We were not qualified to deal with finance. We were not fit to govern the country. The Labour party would make a "" m u l l "" of things if it got into power. We were not fit to be trusted. Yet today the honourable member for Parramatta and his colleagues wish to heap money into the lap of the Government to the extent of millions which the Treasurer himself says are not required. Surely this is an extraordinary position. I am forced to the belief that the real desire of the Opposition is to inaugurate a borrowing policy in Australia.",41
195,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Is the honourable member stone-walling?,42
196,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"If I were to reply to the right honourable member for Swan as he replied to me when I made a very innocent interjection a few days ago, I am sure that he would not like it. But I could not possibly speak in such terms as he employs. The only excuse, I say, that I can find for the Opposition, is that they are imbued with a desire to commence a borrowing policy. But the people of this country have indicated that they do not desire to put a mortgage upon the Commonwealth and to start upon a road which would place us in the hands of the financiers-thos e hands that would show no mercy once they commenced to throttle our financial necks ! I really deplore the attitude of the Opposition. I cannot believe that they are so sincere as really to be anxious that the Cabinet should be flooded with money. Their anxiety seems to me to be simply that we shall launch upon a borrowing policy that would conduce to expenditure which, in my opinion, would be most deplorable from the point of view of the interests of Australia. We have heard much talk about a system of borrowing for the purposes of a navy. But I should like to point out to those who hear me, and to those who will read my few remarks, that even had we borrowed £3,500,000 the moment the loan was negotiated we should have had to start taxing the people of Australia to the extent of £250,000 a year. The money could not have been borrowed for less than 3J per cent.",42
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The Bill provided for borrowing at 3 per cent.,42
198,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The Naval Loan Act provides for the borrowing of money by means of the issue of inscribed stock at 3 per cent., or Treasury-bills at 3^ per cent. According to the Leader of the Opposition, the flotation of the loan was not hurried on with by the issue of inscribed stock because of the power to issue Treasury bonds, from which utterance it appears probable that most of the money would have been borrowed at 3J per cent. Possibly the condition that only 3 per cent, should be given for inscribed stock was a reason for the non-flotation of the loan.",42
199,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We did not need the money at once. It would have been foolish to commence paying interest before we could use the money.,42
200,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The interest on the proposed loan and the contribution to the sinking fund which was to extinguish it would have meant an annual tax of £250,000 on the people of the Commonwealth.",42
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,There would have been no extra taxation.,42
202,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Perhaps not at first, but £250,000 a year would have had to be taken from the revenue obtained by taxing the people. It might be thought from the statements which have been made from the other side that we have only to borrow to be relieved of all obligation regarding the finding of money to pay for the naval unit. But right up to the 1:3th April last, when the shock came-and before that date the late Ministers had no idea that they would be beaten-nothin g was done in the direction of floating a loan. Payments arising out of the agreement which had been entered into were to fall due on the 30th June, so that the late Ministers had only ten weeks in which to find the money necessary to meet them. It is well known that Australian loans have been floated eight, nine, and sometimes twelve months before payments have become due; yet the last Government allowed only two and a-half months for the floating of its proposed loan. That fact indicates clearly that had we not insisted that the interest on inscribed stock should not be more that 3 per cent., our predecessors would have gone into the London market under circumstances which would have made the borrowing of this money a disastertc Australia. The lenders of money have not bowels of compassion. They know the financial condition of the Governments borrowing from them, and have never been lenient to a Government which was in straitened circumstances. The people did better than they knew by voting as they did at the last election, thus preventing the floating of the proposed loan and the initiation of a borrowing policy.",42
203,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,How is this Government finding the money to make the payments necessitated by the agreement relating to the naval unit?,43
204,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"That will be disclosed when the Budget is submitted. No doubt the honourable member will listen carefully to every word of the Treasurer's speech, even though it may be read, as his last was. I view with pleasure this proposal to repeal the Naval Loan Act. In the words of the honourable member for Grey, the Government could not do otherwise. Every member of the Labour Party voted last session against the proposed naval loan, and spoke against borrowing for defence. To-day they are giving effect to the views expressed then, and to their promises to the - electors. By so doing they indicate that they will be able to finance the naval preparations to which we are committed; without having to borrow on any market. Mr Bruce SMITH. (Parkes) [6.8]. - The situation in which the members of the Opposition find themselves is anything but satisfactory, not because we cannot prevent the pioposed repeal of the Naval Loan Act, but because it illustrates the position in which we are likely to be placed regarding many other Bills. The Prime Minister, when speaking on the Address-in-Reply, said that he would listen to the arguments from this side of the Chamber, and would settle questions on their merits, agreeing to modifications of his schemes if he were satisfied that they should be made. I do not object in the abstract to the proposal to repeal an Act of the last Government. I have said before, and I repeat now, that I recognise that the public has given the Labour party a substantial majority. The Government will be able to carry any measure it submits, to the minutest details, notwithstanding our opposition. But the Prime Minister assured us that he would listen to our criticism of the Government policy, and the proposer and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Governor General's Speech, in language a little more eloquent, because, no doubt, carefully prepared, said that they, too, would be influenced by the arguments coming from this side of the House. Yet today the Prime Minister, the only member of the Ministry who could entertain objections to any feature of this Bill, is absent. Even if he were here, he has his numbers, and one feels that it is almost useless to bring arguments to bear upon this question. The Labour party, if honourable members will permit me to sav so, have become hysterical on this question of loans. 1I have watched Labour literature and journalism, and the utterances of Labour members since I witnessed the advent of the party to the State Parliament of New South Wales in 1890. 1 was then a Minister of the Crown, and I saw the first Labour members enter that Parliament. I remember well that one of their number said that they came to make, not to follow precedents. I have watched them ever since, and have never failed to notice that on the subject of loans they have what Emerson calls an ""inflammation."" They apparently fail to recognise the business principle which underlies loans.  ways advocated loans for reproductive works.",43
205,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I take exception to what the honourable member says. I have heard Labour members of this House who afterwards occupied Ministerial positions, reiterate the policy of the party as opposed to loans. There appears to have existed amongst them an idea that all the people who lent money to the States are Jews, and that they resorted to the exaction of ridiculous rates of interest as money lenders did in the days of usury.",43
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,""" Bloodsuckers "" is what they were called last night.",43
207,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I think it is very likely that that name was applied to them, but it only confirms my view as to the hysterical way in which loans are regarded by members of the Labour party. On both sides of the House there are men of the world and men of observation. I suppose that every honourable member has had some interest in a public company, or has watched the conduct of such companies. We all know the difference between the capital and the revenue of a business, and we know that they are absolutely distinct. ' If people propose 'to enter upon any business, whether it i« that of a coffee stall in Paddy's Market, Or that of a big sugar company in Queensland, one of the first considerations of the board of directors or of accountants watching over the finances of the business is to keep its capital absolutely separate from its revenue. We know that the ordinary revenue of every company is kept distinct from its capital, and that if a new mill is to be erected, or an addition made to a grocer's shop, the expenditure necessary is kept distinct from the revenue of the business. Otherwise, a man conducting a small business might find himself devoid of the means of living. He might find that to add a new room to his shop would require all the money he earned in the following year, and he would have nothing to live upon in the meantime.",43
208,Mr CANN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Does not a business man charge insurance against the revenue of his business?,44
209,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"That has nothing to do with the question of a loan. All large business firms have an insurance' fund. A firm doing business in a very large way, instead of paying insurance premiums, will frequently establish an insurance fund of its own.",44
210,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Would it borrow to insure ?,44
211,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Honourable members are leading me into a labyrinth of conundrums which have nothing to do with the question before us. If I attempted to answer them. I should find myself delivering a scattered lecture on different aspects of political economy, and the Speaker would very properly pull me up. I wish honourable members opposite to recognise that, although the Bill they are about to assist the Government to repeal, was one passed by honourable members now on this side of the House, we are quite capable of viewing the proposal in a calm and business-like way, and I shall demonstrate that the proposal of the late Government was an absolutely business-like proposal. If honourable members opposite will rid their minds of the ""inflammation'' on the subject of loans to which I have referred, they will in their hearts be prepared to agree with me. If we are to defend ourselves, as we all admit, we should require a certain class of ships which we must pay for. We first of all ascertain how long those ships will last. Some persons say ten years, and I notice that the ten years' period is more often suggested by honourable members on the other side. Some say fifteen years, and the honourable member for Parramatta quoted very good authority for the conclusion that these vessels would have a life of twenty years. It is impossible to say, accurately, what the effective life of these vessels will be. It depends entirely upon the progress of invention during the next few years. The airships may be developed to such an extent that we may shortly find that ships upon the sea are absolutely at the mercy of ships in the air. On the other hand, some unfortunate circumstance may delay the progress in the development of airships, and warships being built today may meet with the approval of experts for the next twenty years.  which the late Government proposed should be constructed might become obsolete in five years.",44
212,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Of course they might. There is nothing to laugh at in what the honourable member says. It is neither subtle nor humorous. I mean to say that it is perfectly obvious to us all. The Dreadnought, even, is obsolete now in the sense that it is not the type of ship that is now most favoured, because ships of later construction embody the results of a change of ideas in naval construction. One nation is watching another most carefully to note what alterations in this direction are being made, and no nation could afford suddenly to throw the whole of her fleet on one side. Even Great Britain, with something like 450 ships of war-and Heaven knows what they cost-coul d not afford to throw all that fleet on the scrap-heap, and say that she would begin the construction of a navy de novo. As no nation can do that, and all can afford to keep their ships for a certain number of years, improving them as time goes on, let us admit, for argument's sake, that the ships we propose to construct will last, not for twenty years, but for ten years, which is a fair compromise hetween the two extremes that have been stated. We are to pay for them a sum of £3,500,000. These ships will, as the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out, be reproductive in this sense, that if we do not possess them, or if England does not possess them, we cannot produce anything for export. The sea is the highway of nations, and that highway must be policed and watched by the Powers, whether military, naval, or civil. Without committing myself, or asking other honourable members to commit ourselves to the view that the fleet would be reproductive, I will admit, for the sake of argument, that it would - not be reproductive; but I contend, with the honourable member for Parramatta, that warships are required for guarding die highways of commerce. We must, in this - connection, recognise the difference in conduct of military and naval affairs. tary forces remain ashore to defend country, whilst we know that, according .the practice laid down by Nelson, we with a navy, go out to meet the enemy, not wait until he comes to us. We do - keep our ships in port and wait until enemy comes to attack us; but go out find the enemy. Any one who has read Mahan's Life of Nelson, or his Influence Empire. of Sea Power upon History, knows very well that Nelson went to the end of the Mediterranean, to Egypt, to find the French, and that he went to the West dies to find them. He treated them as our police today would treat bushrangers. They would not wait in a town until the bushrangers attacked some bank; but would go out into the wilds of the country io find and destroy them. We must recogterests nise this difference between the policy of years. the military and naval operations. We are proposing to establish a fleet of a certain number of .warships which will cost £""3,500,000. They are intended to police the ocean highways of commerce. Honourable members must recollect that most everything that goes from or to Australia is really Australian property. We may say that 99 per cent, of the that are bought by Australian people to vessels ? - come to Australia, are f.o.b - that is to say, once they are shipped on board they belong to the Australian importer-and all .goods that go from here, except that very small portion of our wool which is here bought by American, French, and German buyers, leave this country as Australian property. We may take it that the great - cobweb of shipping between Australia England, Germany, India, and every of the world, bring goods that are ordered by the Australian people, and are lian property. We are, therefore, purchasing this navy for the protection of our Ausmember tralian interests. I have heard people say that goods coming here do not belong to years. us, and that they are no concern of ours.",44
213,Mr CANN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Is this navy not an surance ?,45
214,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"It is a form of "" insurance,"" just as is a policeman. honourable member will agree that, all, words are the counters of the wise and the money of fools, and that words boats. are capable of - being turned to all sorts of purposes. It is ""insurance"" in that it insures safety, but, as I say, we have only to describe a policeman as an "" insurance"" in order to see the absurdity the of the application. We are buying these Miliships to protect Australian produce-it the may be the produce of the dairyman, to who is sending his goods through an must, agent, the produce of the man who is and sending lucerne, or of the small farmer not who is sending his sheep or lambs. I the admit that we are buying the ships also to for another purpose, namely, to assist a little in the defence of the British",45

216,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I am not going Ininto that subject, which I dealt with in a previous address; but we recognise our obligation, and that is why we are securing ships of the particular description ordered. We are going .to use these ships, I assume, for ten years in order to protect the inof-the people over a period of ten Why should the people in the first two or three years of the period pay for the defence of the citizens of subsequent years ?

They were informed, and they believed, that the ships were .going to last over a period of fifteen years, and, therefore, they provided per annum a sum which would in fifteen or :sixteen years, by compound interest, pay off the whole cost.

I need not point out the absurdity of setting up as an authority in this House, upon such an abstruse subject as political economy, a man who is not known. I have written a little on political economy in my time; but I am sure if I were quoted as a guide to the Labour party they would say, only to "" He may have written on political economy, but we won't hear of him as an authority "" ; and they would be quite justified.

238,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Because he no more of the subject than I do. That disposes altogether of the argument of the honourable member for Denison. Polieconomy has nothing whatever to do with this question. It is a question of common-sense and business principle.,46

242,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Now , the honthey orable member is becoming more confident, which political economists never are. They recognise that there is a great deal to said on both sides.

Conference ""laid down twenty years ; and no less an authority than Adgentle. miral Sir John Fisher- a man who stands, - or stood, towards our Navy as the highest authority known in the British Empire-ac tually said at the Conference that we might rely upon the ships being useful for twenty years. My point then is this: We are told by the Labour party, and by the Prime Minister, that they are going to tax the people to pay for the ships. If Sir John Fisher's opinion is of any value, it is mitted that they will be useful for defence purposes for a period of twenty years. Then we are going to tax the people duris ing three or five years to pay for vessels which will protect ""the people for twenty. I would ask honourable members oppoguarded. site to consider that proposition; but I recognise that they are intellectually manacled over this matter, because the vernment have promulgated the policy, that policy will be passed. Although some of them may, in lucid intervals of liberty, think with me, they are not free to use that power, or to express an opinion. None of them can even get up and endorse the opinion I am expressing as a businessas like one. As to voting, they are more less still; so that we are in the position of kicking against a brick wall and only knocking the toes out of our boots. We cannot affect the wall.

We shall amend the Act in order to spread the taxation which is going be to be put on the people to pay for the ships over a period of ten years, instead of it sixteen years."" But the honourable member, as head of the Government, is suffering from that inflammation from which Labour I Mr THOMAS - Do it gently; do not be",47
243,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I thought I was I know there are some honourable members who say these things much more abruptly than I do. I thought I had a - very gentle way of putting them; because I can see the humour of it all. I do not believe, with some of my friends on this side, in getting angry over the matter. It is no good getting angry with the inevitable. Our primary purpose is to show the public that we have done our best adto put sound reason before the House; and I have to my credit the admission of the honourable member for Adelaide that, "" It splendid reasoning; but we cannot adopt it . "" because, forsooth, in the past, this splendid reasoning has not been safeHonorable members opposite, therefore, admit that it is splendid reasoning to show that an expenditure which is Gogoing to benefit people for ten or fifteen and years should be spread as an expenditure over that period; ""but,"" says the honourable member for Adelaide, "" that has al' ways been said in the past by the advocates of loans, but it has not been done."" Why do not the Labour party come forward a sort of exemplar of how it can be done, helpand, while they are going to do absolute justice to the people by charging each generation with the cost of its own defence, introduce, by the ingenuity of the Attorneysome system under which the exfor pense will be charged to each generation, oppowithout chance of abuse? They say to us, however, "" Because you were in favour the of charging this expenditure to a number generations, we are going to repeal this The honourable member for Denison, who is so active in coming into and have going out of the chamber, has spoken as if we were proposing to borrow this money .for all time. I do not think he could have read the Act. It was not passed during his occupancy of a seat in this House, and perhaps he does not think that past Statutes need to be read by present members. If he did read it, however, be would discover that it does not provide for a loan, in the ordinary sense of the term, extending over a practically unlimited period. It provides for a loan which is to be redeemed within the time during which these vessels will be of ser- vice. I do not wish to discuss the general question of loans, or even to attempt to do so, after what you, Mr Speaker, have said, but borrowed money has been the heart's blood of this country. Australia today would be in a pristine state if it were not for the £500,000,000 which has been borrowed. Honourable members must have noticed that only within the last few months New South Wales was able to - show £66,000,000 worth of investments, . returning to the State £ 4 7s. 6d. per cent. Some honourable members opposite have talked of our ""cadging"" defence from England; and I should like to ask them whether that statement is not a sort of boomerang which comes back on themselves. We all remember that in 1903, ' when rhe Naval Agreement was before this House, the whole of the Labour party, without exception, voted against the paltry contribution of £200,000 a year towards the cost of the Imperial Navy.",47
244,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Order ! The honourable gentleman must not discuss that matter.,48
245,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I shall not do so. I wish merely to show who were cadging then.. Were not the Labour party cadging defence from England? Were they not taking our defence from England without offering to contribute a copper towards it?,48
246,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"But we suggested an Australian Navy. - Mr Bruce SMITH - It costs nothAct, ing to suggest; I could suggest fifty The honourable member is excellent in suggesting, but I am speaking of an intellectual activity that involves some expenditure.

248,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The Postmaster-General on two or three occasions has imitated the Creator by saying ""September ist,"" but I am not sure yet that his scheme will see daylight. If any one is "" cadging,"" we in Australia are cadging. We are ""cadging"" from England the defence of Australia, and the Government are going to ""cadge"" off the people of Australia for three years by taxing them in order to provide a means of defending Australia for ten years. They are going to do an absolute injustice to the people who are taxed during the next three years in order to provide naval defence for the next ten, fifteen, or, according to the greatest naval authority in the Empire today, even twenty years. If , I repeat, the Labour party had said, "" We do not believe these ships will be of use for defence purposes for sixteen years; we do not believe that they will be effectual for more than ten years, and, therefore, we intend to amend the Naval Loan Act so as to make the whole payment for them extend over ten years,"" I should have said, "" Well, it is a very safe precaution to take, and the Government will err on the right side."" But, if I may say so, this proposal on the part of the Government is merely an attempt to play into the hands of the people whom they have lately been addressing, by making them believe that nothing which our party did when in office could be right. They are not content to take a modification of the Act, although they have modified their ideas of the character of the ships by which this defence is to be provided. I am going to take the liberty of suggesting to the Prime Minister that he should yet consider whether instead of repealing the Naval Loan Act, he should not amend it, and recognise the justice of making each generation pay for its own defence. That is the maxim I should lay down. The people of each year should pay for their own national safety, and if that principle is adopted by the Labour party, it will require not a repeal of the but only an amendment of it to exnavies. tend the payments over a longer period.",48

If the honourable ber desired to purchase a suit of clothes calculated to last say twelve months, would not think of pledging his income a time-payment policy extending over that period. He would probably pay for the suit out of his first month's income, alence though he would be able to use the suit for the succeeding eleven months. honourable member says that he believes the policy of paying for these ships within the time during which, they will be of vice to the people. That is Labour Government propose to do, but important point of difference is that propose to pay for them, out of income year by year.",49

Mr .BEARD - If the honourable memlated ber were to observe the principle which has enunciated in connection with everything sound. that he purchased for himself and his family, a time would come when he would have hanging over him an accumulation interest that would mortgage a large proportion of his monthly income; but as a who believes in doing the best for himself and his family, I do not think that would take that course. As to the Labour party being opposed to the policy of rowing, I may say that we are and we are not. It all depends upon circumstances. The plank relating to that subject in the formation. Labour party's platform is very simple. It is couched in these words, "" The restriction of public borrowing.""

This afterupon noon the honourable member for Wentworth interjected that possibly the vessels of Australian naval unit might be sent to bottom of the sea during the very first year of their purchase. That being so, I take it that the policy of paying for them when we get them, is infinitely better than the policy of distributing the payment' for them over the period which is presumed to represent their life. Thus the policy of the Labour party is preferable to that of my honourable friends opposite. I regret that owing to the ruling of Mr. Speaker.

259,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Gippsland) [8.10] - The Government deserve to be congratulated having the courage of their opinions in proposing to repeal the Naval Loan the Act of last year. It will be remembered the - that when they sat in Opposition in this Chamber they strongly opposed that measure, and it is something new to find an Opposition which is prepared after it has gained the Ministerial benches to give effect to its declared policy. It is too frequently the practice of an Opposition to condemn the actions of a Government, but when they have attained office to be prepared to follow in their footsteps. I was one of those who strongly opposed the Naval Loan Act of last year, because I believe that the people of the present day should pay for their own defence. If we were certain that the vessels of the Australian naval unit would have a life of twenty years, and if we did not require any more vessels-the fact seems to have been overlooked that this is merely the beginning of our preparations for our naval defence-ther e might be reason for spreading the payments for those vessels over twenty years. although the honourable member for Parkes has declared that they will have a life of eighteen or twenty years, Colonel Foxton, when speaking on this subject last session, saidIt is customary with the Admiralty to allow for depreciation 4 per cent., covering a period of eighteen years or thereabouts. That is the principle adopted by the Admiralty, and if we do not go beyond that we shall be on safe lines. . . . The life of a battleship is presumed to be eighteen years. Let me say, in this connection, that some authorities put it as low as five years, and others think it should be stated at fifteen years; but it is quite impossible to do more than merely estimate what the life of a battleship is likely to be. It seems to me that it would be altogether improper to distribute the payment for these vessels over eighteen or twenty years, seeing that there is a probability that they will be on the scrap-heap long before that time.",49
260,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The member will admit that ten years would represent a fair compromise?,50
261,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Yes . But there appears to have been only one real justification for the late Government desiring to raise this money by means of a loan, and to distribute its payment over the period which they proposed. That reason has never been strongly put before the House. It is that we are not paying for these vessels at all. The right honourable member for Swan boasted that, by giving effect to the scheme advocated by the late Government, we should be recognising to the full our share of the responsibilities of Imperial defence. But the truth is that these vessels are being paid for by the British Government. The only person who put that fact plainly before the House was the representative of the late Government at the Imperial Defence Conference [30] -^-Colonel Foxton. He did not attempt any concealment whatever about the matter. He said I have explained that we are to receive, by the handsome and voluntary offer of the Mother Country, ,£250,000 a year as long as we choose to accept it.",50
262,Mr WOKS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,T h at is practically reversing the position of today.,50
263,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Yes . If we choose to receive that amount for fifteen years, the money so obtained will approximately cover the interest and sinking fund, and will practically pay for all our vessels. In other words, interest and sinking fund will practically be provided for by the contribution of ,£250,000 per annum which the Mother Country is going to make to us. At that stage, Mr Frazer interjectedThat is delightful patriotism. But, Colonel Foxton repliedI think that there is patriotism in it , because the Mother Country can well afford to pay us that £250,000 a year. We seem to entirely forget that these vessels are being provided by the Mother Country, and that what Was proposed by the late Government was that we should really borrow the money on behalf of Great Britain, that she should take time to pay off the loan, besides paying the interest as well. That appeared to me to be the only justification for proposing a loan at all. But that view was never put strongly before the people by the late Government. Indeed, when I referred to it, I was taken severely to task by the right honourable member for Swan, who stated that no such thing was the case. Of course, he was out of the House when Colonel Foxton was speaking on that occasion; but, notwithstanding the fact that the Mother Country honourable is offering us that amount of money, I still think that the proper, way to provide for the defence of Australia is to raise the money at the time we are spending it. . Mr Bruce SMITH - Does the honourable member know whether the present Government are going to accept the £250,000 per annum from the Imperial Government?",50
264,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I do not. But I think we should be doing our duty as Australians if we refused to accept that money. Mr Bruce SMITH. - I quite agree with the honourable member.,50
265,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I say emphatically that this country is wealthy enough, and the people are patriotic enough, to provide for their own defence, and I shall always hold that opinion until the contrary is proved. I should like to see the very generous offer of the Mother Countrv declined with the warmer.t thr-.nks from Australia. I entirely endorse the remarks of the Minister of External Affairs, referred to by the honourable member for Parkes, as to payment for defence. I consider that every person should contribute to the defence of the country according to his means; and in that direction I would only stop when a person's means were such that it-would not pay to collect the contribution from him. Apart from such persons, I should like to see every inhabitant of this' country contribute according to the extent of his possessions.",50
266,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,No exemptions?,51
267,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"None , except in cases where it would cease to be profitable to collect the money. That has been opinion all along, and that is why opposed to a loan. I do not wish to further into the subject, because it was fully discussed last year; but I congratuthe late the Government on showing by their action today the sincerity of their providing nouncements outside.",51
268,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) party, [8.16] - Without delaying the House, I should like to say tiiat it is quite true during the regime of the late Government an Act was passed to enable them to raise end of the world. a loan of £3,500,000 fpr the purposes of naval construction. But it is just as true that they entered into obligations without providing in any way the money to pay for the vessels that were ordered. The policy of this Government is not to raise that money by loan, and certainly not, in any circumstances, by a loan of year? £3>5°°>000",51
269,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Will the bank note issue arise. pay for the vessels?,51
270,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The bank note issue has nothing to do with this question-nothin whatever.,51
271,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"May I ask whether the Government intend to accept the structed £250,000 a year from the Imperial Gopresent vernment ?",51
272,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The Government intend that we shall provide wholly for Austra Mr. lian naval and military expenditure oursurely. selves, and that policy will be inaugurated as early as possible. The policy announced by the Government to the people will be carried out in its entirety.",51
273,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Then the offer of the Imperial Government will be declined? Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee. Clause 1This Act may be cited as the Naval Repeal Act 1910.,51
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Parramatta) [8.18] - I did not quite follow the Prime Minister as to the intentions of the Government. Do I understand that he proposes to decline the £250,000 per annum that was offered to be contributed by the Imperial Government? The honourable gentleman said, in reply to a remark made from this side of the Chamber, that the Government intended to provide wholly and solely the money for the naval and military defence of Australia. That seemed to imply that the Government are going to provide the £750,000 per annum for the upkeep of the Navy, and, therefore, to demy cline the offer of the Imperial Government I am to contribute £250,000 per annum. go Mr FISHER (Wide Bay-Treasurer) . [8.19] - It is not a question of declining, offer of the Imperial Government. It is a question of the Australian people profor their own defence, and, by that means, carrying out the policy of this at any rate, to protect this part of the Empire to the best of our ability, and that to relieve the Mother Country from any embarrassing expenditure on account of this,",51
275,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Wentworth) [8.20] - X should like to ask the Prime Minister what means he proposes to adopt, now that the Naval Loan Act is being repealed, to provide the money that will be required to pay for the construction of the vessels of the Australian naval unit during the present",51
276,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,That question does not,51
277,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"It most certainly d'oes arise. We are now repealing an Act which g provided for the construction of the Australian unit of the Imperial Navy. That unit is now ordered, and should be con' in about fourteen months from thetime. The Government have, therefore, to find some £3,500,000 sterling; within the next fourteen months. BRUCE SMITH - Longe r than that;",51
278,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,That is about the quickest time in which the vessels can be constructed. I am taking it that the Government have adopted in extenso the policy of the late Government which they recently so bitterly denounced.,51
279,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The late Government'spolicy!,51
280,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"It was not the policv of Loan having a mosquito fleet, and the honourable gentleman and his Government haver adopted it. Therefore, it is of no use to quibble about words. The adoption of that policy imposes upon the Government the obligation of finding during next year a sum °f £3:5°°,°oo sterling. The Prime Minister cannot hope to provide so large a sum by taxation within the next year, in addition to the amount that will have to be raised to provide for our normal needs. I therefore wish to know how he proposes to find the money. I trust that he will make a free and frank admission of what he intends to do. Does he intend to provide the money by issuing Australian notes, getting golden sovereigns for them, and imposing them upon the people of Australia? While deploring such an action, I admit that he can find the money in that way, though at considerable risk to our currency. If he does not admit that, it means that the Prime Minister and his Government, by the repeal of the Naval Loan Act, are going to put off the construction these ships. It was considered to be a matter of urgent necessity that they should be ready when the German Dreadnought programme was completed in 1912. If the construction of the ships is now to be put off because of the Prime Minister's platform utterances-whic h probably were made in the heat of the moment-it is a matter of the greatest regret from the point of view of the people of Australia. We ought to know now, if the Prime Minister will rake us into his confidence, how he is going lo raise £3,500,000 sterling within the next year or year and a-half.",51
281,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,That question does not arise now.,52
282,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"We are engaged in repealing an Act which, apparently, affords the only means of enabling us to construct these ships, and when we ask the Prime Minister what he intends to put in its place, he tells us that the question does not arise. I really cannot follow the honourable gentleman.",52
283,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I do not expect the honourable member to do so. He "" follows"" some one else.",52
284,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Some liability has already been incurred. How does the Prime Minister propose to meet that ? Is he going to issue post-dated Treasury-bills inscribed on the back: "" B y the Grace of God, Andrew Fisher "" ? What does the Prime Minister propose to put in place of the Act that is now being repealed? It is a most extraordinary sort of business, if we are to repeal an Act which, apparently, affords [30]- 2 our only means of meeting our obligations, without this House, which is the trustee of the public purse, being informed what steps are to be taken in lieu thereof. If the Prime Minister knows of no steps which he can take, well and good. If what he has in his mind has not been told to my friends in caucus, well and good.",52
285,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The question before the Chair is the title of the Bill.,52
286,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"If it was only a matter of this measure being called the Naval Loan Repeal Act, I should not worry about it. I thought it would be convenient for the Prime Minister to inform us now how he proposes to pay for the Fleet. He says that he can finance the enterprise, but he has not told us how he intends to do so. The matter is one of urgency. I should not have voted for what is now the Naval Loan Act had I not thought it of the of supremest importance that the ships provided for should be constructed within the shortest time possible. If the Prime Minister intends to throw into the waste-paper basket the scheme for Australian defence merely to, give effect to a political fad, the reprobation of our children and of our children's children will fall - on him for having jeopardized the liberties which we enjoy today.",52
287,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Parkes) [8.27]. - I recognise that there is no obligation on the Prime Minister to tell us in detail now what his financial policy is ; but I would remind him that when speaking on the second reading he explained that the Government might require from three to five years to meet the proposed expenditure. I ask whether he intends to provide the money that is needed by means of a sinking fund, or by an entirely different method of which we shall be informed when the Government's financial policy is stated.",52
288,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [8.28] - The honourable member does not expect me to state the Government policy in regard to naval preparations. We shall meet our obligations, and shall provide the money necessary to pay for the fleet unit.",52
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Swan) [8.29]. - I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether tenders have yet been accepted for the construction of all the vessels of the proposed naval unit. I am aware that on the 15th March last a tender was accepted for the armoured cruiser, at a cost of £1,800,000, because that happened while I was Treasurer; but, in addition, there are to be three Bristol cruisers, torpedo boats, and submersibles. I should like to know whether tenders have been accepted for any of the vessels, and, if so, for how many ? If tenders have not been accepted for all the vessels, when does the Prime Minister expect that they will be accepted?",52
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Parramatta) [8.30] - I am sorry to appear pertinacious, but I have not yet gathered from the Prime Minister whether he proposes to pay the £750,000 which will be the annual cost of maintaining the fleet unit, or will accept the offer of the British Admiralty to contribute £250,000. I shall be obliged to him if he will tell us plainly what he is going to do.",53
291,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [8.31] - The financial proposals of the Government will be made known at the right time. I have stated in general terms that the naval programme will be in no way curtailed, though it may be improved.",53
292,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Wentworth) [8.32] - I do not ask the Prime Minister to make known to us at this juncture the details of his financial proposals, but I should like him to assure the country that the proposed vessels will be constructed without delay. The matter is one of urgency. Is the construction of the ships to be kept back until the Government is in a position to pay for them out of its ordinary revenue?",53
293,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"This is not question time. ' Mr KELLY - My honourable friend no doubt suggests that the proper place in which to put questions to the Prime Minister is a caucus meeting. I wish to know whether under the Government scheme the ships will be constructed without delay, or whether the shipbuilders will be ordered to go ahead at once.",53
294,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [8-33]-- I do not wish my courtesy to be mistaken for weakness. The Government of which I have the honour to be head will carry out the naval policy of the party, and the manner in which the funds will be provided will be made known to Parliament at the proper time.",53
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Parramatta) [8.34] - I have yet to learn that it is unfair to question the head of the Government regarding its naval policy when a Bill like this is^ before a Committee.,53
296,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member for Wentworth had the impertinence to talk about the time for questioning me being a caucus meeting. This is no way to deal with national matters.,53
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I understand that the four large vessels have been ordered. My recollection is that Messrs. John Brown and Son have the contract for the construction of the Dreadnought cruiser, and that the order for the building of the three Bristol, cruisers has been placed with the Denny Shipbuilding Company. I wish to know if that is so.",53
298,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member will get the information later.,53
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I do not know whether the Prime Minister is unable, or declines, to give this information.",53
300,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Is the honourable member in order in discussing the naval policy of the Government when the only question before the Chair is whether the measure shall be named the Naval Loan Repeal Act?,53
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I am not raising any question of policy, but am trying, in strict accord with the rules of debate, to elicit information pertinent to the question before the Chair. Although the honourable member has been Chairman of Committees, he seems to have forgotten the rules of procedure. A question such as that which I have asked would be answered instantly in the House of Commons.",53
302,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The whole debate has been out of order, but I thought it wise to allow great latitude to honourable members, of which I hope they will not take unfair advantage.",53
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I shall not do so. I hold that this is the time for dealing with details connected with the measure. The reason for the Committee stage of a Bill is that an opportunity may be given to discuss details. I am putting such a question now as is invariably put, and as invariably answered, in Committee of Supply in the House of Commons.",53
304,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We are not now in Cornmittee of Supply.,53
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Not exactly; we are discussing the repeal of the Naval Loan Act, and incidentally honourable members on this side are asking questions concerning the policy affected by that measure.",53
306,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,No ; we are discussing the name of the Bill.,53
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The honourable member, having raised his point of order, might let the Chairman alone. It is scarcely courteous of an ex-Chairman of Committees to be canvassing a Chairman's ruling in this way.",53

309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Do I understand the Prime Minister to say that we may not have the information for which we are asking at present?,54
310,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Not at present.,54
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Then all I special have to say is that I think the Prime Minister of this country is treating the Committee with rudeness and discourtesy.,54

313,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The right honourable tleman will get that information when policy of the Government is declared. He need not be at all alarmed.,54

He refers to an important question of policy in connection with which the intentions of Government will be submitted to able members at the proper time.,54
316,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Ballarat) [8.40] - The Prime Minister was absent today 1 repeated once more that this confusion is due entirely to the procedure adopted by the Government. I pointed out that particular question? it might be justified in one or two instances by the extraordinary circumis stances of the session. The Govern the financial policy of Australia. ment have brought down a series of financial measures constituting vital porto tions of their financial policy, which only be properly understood when the whole of them are disclosed in the Budget. By bringing them down before the Budget has been laid before honourable members, they are'taking a course without precedent this country, and without any justification, except in respect of certain special sures to which I have referred. may be excused for their departure from the ordinary rules in connection, for instance, with the measure dealing with the relations should be assented to. between the Commonwealth and States, because of the necessity of giving assurances which were eagerly sought for all over Australia. The questions now being asked are strictly relevant and in order, and would not, and could not, have been put but for the procedure which the Government have chosen to follow. Therefore, although as I have said, the circumstances of this Parliament serve partly to excuse the course which has been followed, in some instances, it is one which has necessarily involved this House in this confusion. We were obliged to refuse to consider these questions at all until the Budget was delivered, although they might mean a serious loss",54
317,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We should have had to take steps to give effect to the will of the people if that course had been adopted.,54
318,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"E x a c t l y ; but I vengenture to say it was not the will of the the people that the Budget should be dealt with practically piecemeal, neither announced or explained, or before it was shown that one part dovetailed with another, or that the whole agreed with the say principles which had been approved by their majority in the country.",54

We should know the alternative proposals to be made to supply the deficiency which will be caused by the repeal of the Naval Loan Act, and then judged in the action of the Government in declining, as they are at perfect liberty to do, to meafollow out the course laid down in that They Act. Until these matters are explained they have strictly no constitutional right to ask that the measure now before the Committee Personally, I the have taken no persistent objection to what has been done, but have fried to protect the Opposition and myself from any misof understanding. I have recorded the fact that we are perfectly conscious of the defensible and partly indefensible course now being followed by the Government.

Anxious as I am to get on with public business, although their questions are perfectly rate, some answer. legitimate, I would ask my honourable friends on this side to set them aside, recognising the fact that this is a dangerous proceeding, but that the Government have question ? thought fit to take it.

So far as my limited experience goes, no Treasurer has ever yet on such a subject given expressions to such opinions, but has always reserved them for his Budget speech. It would be a matter of a few moments only to refer to requests invariably addressed from year to year to every Treasurer in every Parliament to make statements respecting the financial intentions of the Government; and' I may point out that the .right honourable member for Swan, when he held office, declined, and I think very properly, to anticipate his Budget.",56

This is. not the time for details; and the proposal before us can by no stretch of the imagination be classed as a financial proposal of the Ministry or of the Parliament. It is a proposal merely to give effect to election promises consistently with the votes given by every honourable member on this side last year, and an unmistakable indication that the Government do not wish to exercise the power they now have to borrow £3,500,000. That power was given by honourable members opposite when they weie in a majority, and I do not see why the Ministry should be interrogated, almost to the extent of cross-examination, as to what their policy is, when we all know full well that that policy will be expressed in due time in accordance with the established practice of every Parliament in Australia. I again assert that in no circumstances can this Bill be complicated with the financial proposal of the Government; and, therefore, certainly the questions asked are not justified seeing that when the honourable members, who are now asking them, were in office, they specifically declined to give such information.",56

There are, however, dom of the party."" certain considerations relating to the reasonable conduct of business in the House which are worthy of the attention even of a Prime Minister who leads a large if majority; and I should like to lay those considerations before him. The facts somewhat extraordinary position at the sent time. With the Leader of the Oppothe sition, I venture to think that it is extremely unusual, to say the least, to present tain portion of the financial proposals, which the House as yet knows nothing, and to seek its acceptance before the financial proposals have been submitted. this Act. But I wish to point out what an extremely awkward position the Opposition-no t the Government side, but the Opposition, an Opposition has its rights-is placed in with regard to this measure. There is side, of this case which I do not think Prime Minister has yet fully considered. My own position-and this will, perhaps, serve to illustrate the point I am makingis, frankly speaking, that I am entirely favour of abandoning any policy of guided, borrowing with regard to naval defence, so long as provision can be made for ing out the scheme of naval defence the House has already adopted, without borrowing, and without too great an position on the taxpayer. But how am I to judge? The House has already adopties, ted a very definite policy with regard the building of certain ships for the fence of Australia. One of those ships is being constructed, and the whole policy is in course of being carried judgment? out. That has been done by the authority of this House. Now we are asked to knock the very financial foundaders tion out of the whole of that policy, and we are not given a single pointer to show in what direction any substitute for it be provided. I am not going to ask quesjust tions, but it is pretty well known-fo has been announced by the Government themselves in the press and elsewherethat the leading features of their policy are considered by them and their party in- I know ? will not use the objectionable word ""caucus,"" because that seems to irritate",57

404,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Parkes) [9.8]. I do not think that the Prime Minister quite fair in some of his references to the Opposition; although I admit that he is imbued with a strong desire to do that which is just. He spoke of a "" ruse "" on the part of the Opposition, and I should like to say, as a member of it, that there is no such corporate action being taken by us in this regard. The Prime Minister has not answered the argument advanced by the Leader of the Opposition, or that put forward, very fairly, by the honourable memof ber for Flinders. 1I have heard the honourable member for Flinders use the same argument in opposition to the late Deakin Government: the argument that a Governis not justified in coming down with a programme of expenditure without first of all informing the House how it proposes to provide for it. No doubt, as the and honourable member for Adelaide has said, Bill provides merely for the repeal of an Act; but it must be remembered that, in no repealing that Act, we shall be doing something more. Warships have been ordered, for and, by repealing the Act which provided to the means of raising money for their paywe are practically entering upon a Gonew obligation of £3,500,000 without any means of meeting it.",59
405,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,That is the Government's business.,59
406,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I admit that, as I said some time ago; but I think that Parliament is justified in asking the Government for theirfinancialpolicy. The Leader of the Opposition, who has had great Ministerial experience, and the honourable member for Flinders, have pointed out that we are as a Committee representing the people, to have some idea of how the Gopropose to meet this expenditure, a before they submit it to us. We should unit. be very unwise, as a Parliament, in embarking upon a huge expenditure without desome general knowledge of the way in which it is to be provided for. Although the honand orable member for Flinders may be wrong in saying that the Ministerial - party know new already how it is to be provided for",59
407,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,That was the strength,59
408,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"No ; the prinwas ciple that he enunciated was the strength of his argument, and it is stronger now; because, whereas the honourable member for Flinders was under the impression that the of Labour majority of the Committee knew how the money was going to be raised, and that the minority did not, it now appears that neither the majority nor the Opposinot tion minority know.",59
409,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The Prime ister has merely said that the majority do not know in detail how it is to be,60
410,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I am not complaining that the Prime Minister is not anticipating his policy; but if the Leader vernment. of the Opposition and the honourable member for Flinders be right, the Government, in justice to the Parliament, ought us some idea of the source of their rereason. venue-whethe r it be loans, or .Commonwealth notes, or ordinary revenue-and its The ability to meet this expenditure.",60

413,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"It is an unheard of thing for the Government to give such informait tion before they disclose their financial penditure. statement in the Budget. Mr Bruce .SMITH - I confess that, in point of voice, I cannot cope with the honourable member, but in point of logic I think I can. I want the Prime Minister to see what he appears to me to have not yet fully grasped, and to show that he has not quite done justice to the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Flinders. So far as I can see, they are not parties to a in putting this proposition before the Prime Minister. If the honourable gentleman that he does not believe it is a parliamentary practice, that is another matter; but, after twenty-eight years of parliamentary perience, I must say that it is the practice of all Governments always to tell the House generally what are the sources of their venue, before asking it to commit itself big expenditure. I shall remind the Prime Minister of a case in point, which I think will come upon him with convincing power. Does he recollect the honourable member for Flinders standing where he now sits, and objecting to the policy of the then Deakin Administration, because they were - bringing down a Bill providing for the payment of bounties amounting to shall £[250,000, without' giving the House some definite information as to the way in which the money was to be provided ? . Mr Scullin - The Leader of the Opposition said that he did not do that.",60
414,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"At that time, the honourable member for Corangamite was fledged as a politician. It was long before he came before the electors, or the Minelectors thought of accepting him.",60
415,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Why did the honourable provided. member for Flinders do that?,60
416,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,He was certainly not an opponent of the Deakin Go,60
417,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,He took that stand because the Labour party were supporting to give the then Government. That was his,60
418,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"It was not. honourable member for Flinders does not resort to such tactics. He said, in effect, "" Here we are asked to commit ourselves to an expenditure of £250,000 by way of bounties,"" and he proceeded to show in a very lucid speech that our were then in a very questionable of condition. He pointed out that the House was entitled to know from the Government what were their sources of revenue before was asked to commit itself to that exMir. BATCHELOR - Did the Government comply with his request for information?",60
419,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,That has nothing whatever to do with the question.,60
420,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The expenditure of that £250,000 was spread over ten years.",60
421,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The soundness of a principle does not depend upon its invariable observance. This is a matter ruse of common-sense. We certainly ought not to incur any large liability before we know says where we are going to get the money to meet that liability. I do not think that this Committee expects the Prime Minister exto go into minute details regarding our finances. But the passing of this Bill will really mean that we have decided to incur rea new liability of £3,500,000. Honourable to a members will see that when we have ordered something and arranged the mode of payment for it, if we abolish that mode of payment we at once create a new liability. If we repeal the Naval Loan Act of last year we shall have incurred an expenditure of £3,500,000 upon naval vessels for which we have made no provision. Therefore I am justified in saying that we have created a new liability. That is what I wish the Prime Minister to understand. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Flinders requested an observance of the principle for which I am contending; and the Prime Minister at once stated that they were trying an Opposition ruse. Let me tell him that if it were an 'Opposition ruse I should not support it. I will never support a party ruse merely for the purpose of embarrassing a Government. The Prime Minister should certainly give the Committee an idea of whether he is satisfied that the Government will be able to meet this new liability by another method than that of loan.",60
422,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [9.19] - I think I can put the honourable member and those who think with him at ease in regard to this matter. Even if the Naval Loan Act of last year were permitted to remain on the statute-book, that fact would make no difference whatever to the policy of the Government. We could still give effect to that policy even if the Act were not repealed. We would not borrow money under that Act even if it remained upon our statute-book. But the honourable member for Parkes must know that the mere passing of a Loan Act by Parliament is notsufficient to raise the money. Something else must be done before the expenditure contemplated can be provided for. I fail to understand the action of the Leader of the Opposition in opposing the repeal of the Naval Loan Act when he knows perfectly well that the policy of the Government would be the same even if that measure were permitted to remain on the statute-book.",61
423,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Wilmot) [9.20] - I think that the Prime Minister might well inform the Committee whether the Government are satisfied that they can finance the construction of the proposed Australian naval unit. Last year Parliament authorized the' raising of a loan for that purpose. Before those who voted for that measure are asked to permit it to be repealed we ought to have an assurance that the Government know how, when, and where, they are going to raise this £3,50°> °o0",61
424,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Coolgardie) [9.21] The contention of the honourable member for Flinders, which was reiterated by the honourable member for Parkes, is undoubtedly a very interesting and important one. The former dilated on the disadvantage under which the members of the Opposition labour as compared with the supporters of the Government. He declared that the Ministerial followers were aware of the reasons underlying this portion of the financial policy of the Government, whereas members of the Opposition were ignorant of them. I believe that the honourable member has since had his mind disabused of the idea that all the followers of the Government are familiar with those reasons.",61
425,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We have been told that tliej do not know the details.,61
426,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Personally , I do not know any of the details of this portion of the Government policy. But I was rather struck with the weakness of the argument of the honourable member for Flinders in reference to this matter. Need I remind him that he was once Premier of Victoria, the head of a Ministry which submitted a financial policy to the Parliament of this State.",61
427,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I hope, that the honourable member will connect his remarks with the question that is before the Chair.",61
428,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I am doing so. The Ministerial colleagues of the honourable member were aware of the details of that policy, but the other members of the Victorian Parliament were in blank ignorance of - them. That is exactly the position which this Committee occupies in regard to the naval policy of the Government. Consequently I think that he has rather strained the case against the Ministry on this occasion.",61
429,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,We are not asking for details.,61
430,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I have listened to a series of questions which have extended over the past three-quarters of an hour, and which have been directed to ascertaining where the Government are going to get the money with which to pay for our naval unit.",61
431,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I merely asked whether the Government are satisfied that they can find it.,61
432,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The honourable member may accept my assurance that we are perfectly satisfied on that matter. So that the honourable member for Flinders has raised a point which, while important and interesting, is not by any means new in the management of affairs by Governments. I followed closely the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes, who ingeniously argued that by repealing the Naval Loan Act we shall .immediately plunge ourselves into a new liability of £3,500,000. I was always under the impression that we did not incur any liability for an article until we had ordered it.",61
433,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Thes e ships have been ordered, and are in course of construction.",62
434,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Some of these vessels have been ordered, and we are in a position to pay for them. If not, we shall be at the time when the articles are delivered.",62
435,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,There is no money in hand to pay for them.,62
436,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Surely the right honourable member for Swan does not pay for an article until it is delivered at his house. Neither are we required to pay for these ships until they are delivered to us. Therefore, I say that there is no necessity at this stage for the Committee to be informed from what source' the money is to come. It is sufficient from my point of view for the Government to tell us simply that they are in a position to make, and .intend to make, due provision to meetthe liability when the proper time arrives. I am unable to agree with honourable members who say that all the details of the financial scheme of the Government should be brought down together. I have a dis'.inct recollection that when the honourable member for Ballarat was in office in 1905, a Bill was suddenly sprung upon us at the end of the session to provide an enormous amount for the payment of sugar bounty in Queensland. I do not remember that there was anything in the Budget that year which gave even an inkling that such a measure was to come before Parliament.",62
437,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The Commonwealth was returning a large amount to the States then.,62
438,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The right honourable member for Swan was a member of that Government. I venture to say that if any honourable member had sufficient leisure and industry to search the records of the House, he would find that the honourable member for Ballarat and his colleague, the right honourable member for Swan, have not always adhered to' the doctrine which they have propounded to-night.",62
439,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I cannot find a departure from it, and I am looking for one.",62
440,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"May I be allowed to say that, in my judgment, this matter has gone sufficiently far, and that the Committee ought to be content with the assurance of the Prime Minister that the repeal of the Naval Loan Act is in accordance with the policy which he propounded to the people, and which was endorsed by them; that he is going to carry out that policy in all its essential details, and will disclose to Parliament at the proper time the manner in which he proposes to raise the funds necessary to pay for the ships which are being constructed ? Mr W. II . IRVINE (Flinders) [9.27]. - B y way of personal explanation, I should like to say that the honourable member for Coolgardie has chosen to refer to my action when I was Premier of Victoria, with the object of proving that it was in some way inconsistent with the attitude which I haye taken up as to this matter to-night. It is perfectly true, as the honourable member said, that I did bring in, as part of my financial and general policy, a proposal which had never been before the country, and which at the time it was disclosed was known only to my colleagues and myself. But I did not confide that policy to those who were supporters of the Government to the exclusion of those who sat on the Opposition side of the House. Moreover, if my memory serves me aright, I think the honourable member will find that I brought in that portion of my policy as part of the general and full statement of the whole scheme of policy, which is precisely the thing that we desire the Government to do in this case. With regard to the statement which I made today, I venture to say-no t from my own knowledge, but from statements made in the press and elsewhere by members of the present majority in this House-that in all its main essentials the policy of the Government was submitted to and endorsed by the party as a whole.",62
441,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,This is not a personal explanation. It is new matter.,62
442,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Does the honourable member say that this is a personal explanation ?,62
443,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I am afraid that it is not.,62

I wish to say that I think I have a right to comend. plain of the way in which the Prime Minfleet ister has treated me on many occasions with regard to die River class of vessels.

Now I he comes back to this House and repeats the same statement, notwithstanding that it has been denied half-a-dozen times. ter. I venture to say that the Prime Minister himself has never been treated in that fashion by any honourable member side. The subject was referred to in connection with the discussion on this very 6660. topic in the last session of Parliament. I will quote what took place regarding it. The Prime Minister was standing here, delivering one of his speeches against the naval loan proposal of the late Governto ment. He then referred to this matter of the River class of vessels and tried to a joke about it. He assumed a elevated and patronising attitude, said I had formerly said that vessels of this class were unsuitable for service in tralia, and added that I should be given"" for a serious error which I had made concerning them. I then saidMy statements stand today; I do not draw one. Then the Prime Minister saidThat is the joke of it ; but the Minister Defence repeated that these river class vessels were unsuitable for service in Australia. Thereupon I said I say that they are most unsuitable as except as auxiliaries to a larger fleet; that is, to a large fighting fleet. The orable gentleman was not satisfied with that. I then said I should be glad if he would find a quotation to which he had referred, and if he would also quote what the miralty said about these local defensive flotillas.",62

He says that we ask for information, honand make the criticisms which have fallen from us, merely to cover our retreat. He tells us tiiat our policy is the policy of the Labour party, and has been their Adpolicy for years. As I understood their policy, it contemplated the building of about twenty-three small vessels, to cost the about half what the proposed fleet unit cost. Our proposed fleet will be fifteen times stronger than the honourable member's fleet would have been, will cost as much, will have a different objective, and will differ entirely as to its intentions and purposes. I am glad that Government is going to carry out the present naval policy, but it is the policy initiated by the party now sitting in Opposition, and arranged for with the Imperial Government. The honourable member perdeclined to adopt it. It is the Government, not the Opposition, which is retreating. I do not pretend to know all that is to be known about defence, and have never put forward any such pretensions, but I have yet to learn that the Prime Minister knows much about it. I do not remember any public speech of his which evidences his possession of even an elementary knowledge of the subject. Yet he talks of others as if he were an authority, and speaks in the most patronising way.",63
456,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The question is not what the Prime Minister knows of defence.,64
457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I am trying to show that the policy of the Opposition haj been consistent, and that the Ministry has been forced to adopt it. I am glad that Ministers are going to carry out our policy. But surely I may ask how many tenders have been accepted? I have yet to learn that a question like that cannot be pvit during the discussion of a naval loan policy. Such questions are answered instantly by Ministers in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister either does not know anything about the matter, or is apeing a high and mighty behaviour which he thinks ought to characterize one in his position. I find nothing in his speeches to give us even an inkling of what the Government financial policy is to be, though he has not hesitated to say that Ministers will be embarrassed.  father to the thought "" with the honourable member.",64
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I am quoting the Prime Minister's own words. lowing his usual method of declining to discuss any proposition he may submit to the House, he simply told us that he will be embarrassed by the course which he intends to take. He said that he will pay for the Fleet out of revenue, and will be embarrassed thereby, but he does not tell us how he will extricate himself from his embarrassment. He said I do not think it will be possible to raise the money",64
459,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member is not in order in quoting from Hansard.,64
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I think that I am in order in quoting from a report ot the present debate. The Prime Minister said I do not think it would be possible to raise the money required in three years, but we may be able without borrowing to so adjust the payments as to meet our obligations in five years. Those remarks only deepen the mystery The honourable gentleman said either too much or too little. It is an elementary principle of parliamentary procedure that when one financial proposal is set aside Parliament shall be favoured with an alternative. The Government is carrying out the naval policy of its predecessors, but the Committee is in the dark as to how that policy is to be financed. Failing to get an answer from the Prime Minister, I suppose we must refer to the speeches of less responsible members of the party. One of them told us that the landlords are going to pay for defence/",64
461,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member must not refer to the Hansard report of the debate on the second reading of the Bill.,64
462,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Surely I am at liberty to quote from the Hansard report of the discussion on this Bill?,64
463,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,No .,64
464,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member should ask his chief.,64
465,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The honourable member, whose remarks I was abo.ut to quote, saidWe will-take a little bit out of the rich man's pocket and put. it into the pocket of the poor man. Dr MALONEY. - The honourable member having been twice told by the Chairman that he must not quote the Hansard report, is surely out of order in doing so.",64
466,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The honourable member has not read from the Hansard report since I told him that he could not do so. Fol- Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member for Melbourne should not take frivolous points of order. Judging from statements made in the House, it would seem that the naval policy and questions of defence are subsidiary to the consideration how to make the big man pay. That subject comes up in every debate.",64
467,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the clause. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I am discussing alternative proposals.,64
468,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member must not do so.,64
469,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"It is about time that the Prime Minister put an end to this mystery. He has begun in the wrong way, and before he has been conducting the business of the country very long, he will find it better to think out his plans thoroughly than to rush into the breach, as he has done in this instance, to give effect to a foolish promise to the people, and to do what he has told us to-night does not make a pin's worth of difference to the Government policy. The honourable gentleman has been wasting the time of the House for days past in connection with this matter. He has said that this legislation makes no difference whatever. It is about time we discussed some of the important matters that will make a difference to the country, and to the pledges given by honourable members from the platform.",64
470,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Wentworth) [9.46] - The Prime Minister appears to be under the impression that the questions I put to him have not a serious basis. I can put my position with regard to this Bill clearly before the honourable gentleman. When the Act which is now sought to be repealed was under consideration nine months ago, I said that I did not believe that borrowing for defence was a sound policy. I expressed then my reasons for holding that view, and said that my only reason for consenting to the proposed loan for naval defence purposes was the. extreme urgency of the defence question. On the second reading of this Bill I took up identically the same position. I said that if the Government could provide a means of financing their proposal so that the Fleet unit could ' e constructed as quickly as it would have been under the policy of the late Government, no one would be better pleased than I. Now I find that the Prime Minister has, apparently, some difficulty in informing the Committee whether or not he intends to proceed with the policy of the late Government so far as the construction of the Fleet unit is concerned. If he can only assure me that there will be no delay whatsoever in the construction of the unit in its entirety, I shall have no further opposition to offer to the passage of this Bill. I have not opposed it up to date, but as a member of the Committee I am unable to decide whether the Naval Loan Act ought to be repealed or not, unless I am given such an assurance as I have asked for from the Prime Minister. In the absence of such an assurance, it seems to me to be my duty to oppose the repeal of the Act, as a protest against the action of Ministers.",65
471,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I have said again and again that we shall make our defence effective.,65
472,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,It is a question of the time it will take.,65
473,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member cannot get the policy of the Government now.,65
474,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"I am not asking for the policy of the Government. What I ask is whether there will be any delay in the construction of the unit. Will the construction of these vessels be delayed by the repeal of the Naval Loan Act? Will that involve that provision for Australian defence will be put back for a day, or a month, or a year? If we are assured that it will not. I believe that the Committee will be ready to consent to the repeal of the Act.",65
475,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,I think the honourable member's question has already been answered.,65
476,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is no doubt referring to a state-' ment by the Prime Minister that, so far as this Bill is concerned, it makes no difference to his Government.",65
477,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,There is something in the last number of Hansard on the subject.,65
478,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"If there is, I shall be delighted to hear what it is. If we can be given such an assurance as I ask for, I believe the majority of the Committee will be delighted to see the Naval Loan Act repealed.",65
479,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,"Swan) [9.49] On the 15th March last, a tender was accepted for the construction of the armoured cruiser. Dp till the time the present Government assumed office tenders had not been accepted for the other vessels of the unit. This was not because there was any desire for delay, but because a great deal of time would be taken up in the construction of the armoured cruiser, and the smaller vessels could easily be constructed before the date at which the whole unit was to be completed-in July of 1912. The late Government resigned office about the end of April. Since that time three months has elapsed, and I have put to the Prime Minister the simple question whether tenders have been accepted for any of the remaining ships in the interval.. My question deals with a matter of fact, about which there need be no secret. I am not asking for information as to how the vessels are to be paid for. The Prime Minister has not, however, enlightened the Committee even on that point. He may probably be able to pay one or two instalments out of the Treasurer's Advance, just as he is meeting the first instalment of £70,000 which was due on the 30th June. I cannot understand the reticence of the honourable gentleman in refusing to say whether tenders have been accepted on this. for any of the other ships. He must know whether any tenders have been accepted for the remaining ships, and they have not, he is surely able to say when they will be accepted. As a rule, the acceptance of tenders is announced in the newspapers, and as no announcement has appeared of the acceptance of any tenders - for the construction - of the remainder of the ships, we may be justified in assuming that none have been accepted.",65
480,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,The honourable member has not been in order since he to speak.,66
481,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH SERVICE,Then I shall not pursue the matter further. I think have some right to protest against the retithing cence of the Prime Minister in regard to matter which is merely one of fact. Clause agreed to. Title agreed to.

This is a very short measure, the consideraSuch tion of which was postponed for the conby ^Parliament. venience of the honourable member for digo.

Motion (by Mr FISHER) .proposed - That the House do now adjourn.  rose [9-.57J--During the week, I asked the Minister of Trade and Customs his intentions in regard to reciprocity between New Zealand and rhe Commonwealth in conI nexion with the wine industry. If someis not done, this industry, which is a very important to a great many people in the Commonwealth, will be entirely crushed out. I have here section 9 of the New Zealand Customs and Duties Act 1908, as Where any country, being part of the British Dominions, reduces or abohshes, or proposes to do so, the duty on any product ox manufacture of New Zealand, the Governor is authorized to enter into an agreement to reduce or abolish on any articles, the produce or manufacture of such country, to an extent that the estimated revenue so remitted shall equal as nearly as possible the remission by that country. agreements, however, require ratification BenThat shows that New Zealand is prepared enter into negotiations for reciprocity, on a basis which is fair in every sense of the It might be relevant, as showing present state of affairs, to quote figures relating to our trade with the Dominion. 1909, Australia paid New Zealand a oldstun of £12,836 on 51,347 gallons of wine imported by the Dominion, at the rate On the same quantity of wine, South Africa would pay £5> 34, at 2s. per gallon, the present rate T of duty. The balanceagainst Australia amounts to the very substantial sum of £7,702. As away out of the difficulty, I would suggest that' New Zealand should reduce the duty on Australian wine to that is now paid by South Africa, namely, 25. per gallon; and that, as a quid pro quo, Ausshould remit the duty of i d . per lb. that on New Zealand blue cod, and of 2s. per need cwt. on New Zealand oysters.",66
486,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TARIFF RECIPROCITY WITH NEW,"Why not make the reciprocity general?  suggest these two items, as a way out of the difficulty, seeing that they will very nearly balance each other. In 1909, the duty on blue cod imported by Australia realized £ 5 , 6 2 7 ; and that of oysters, £ 8 1 0 ; or a total of £6,437, s against the £7,702 already mentioned. acceptance of this proposal would place South African and Australian wines very nearly on an equal footing. I have a few figures here which tend to show that, under present conditions, the wine industry in Australia, so far as New Zealand is concerned, is being crushed and destroyed. The quantity of wine imported by New Zealand from Australia in 1908 was 62,971 gallons, valued at £22,112; while in 1909 the quantity was 51,347 gallons, and the value £18,620; showing a considerable falling off. In the case of South Africa the quantity of wine imported into New Zealand in 1908 was 4,283 gallons, valued at £ 1 , 1 4 6 ; while in 1909 the quantity was 17,536 gallons, and the value £5,404.",66
487,Mr SINCLAIR,TARIFF RECIPROCITY WITH NEW,"Is that owing to the difference in duty ?  very much like it. I am raising this question, not only for the parochial reason that it affects a great many of my constituents, although that does give me very serious concern; but also because I regard it from the national pointof view, recognising the injury that it does to the industry in several of the States; and I say that the matter calls for the serious attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs. I know that he has it under review; and 1 sincerely trust that every effort will ly> made, to deal with it at an early date.",67
488,Mr TUDOR,TARIFF RECIPROCITY WITH NEW,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.6] - The matter of a reciprocal treaty with New Zealand has been under consideration for many years. ! When the late Mr Richard Seddon was on ;his last trip to Australia, I believe he, and the honourable member for Ballarat, tried - to arrange some such reciprocal treaty as - that which the honourable member for Indi has mentioned to-night; but, although this House, in 1906, adopted the treaty as placed before us, the New Zealand Parliament threw out our proposals.",67
489,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TARIFF RECIPROCITY WITH NEW,Because we wanted to strike too hard a bargain.,67
490,Mr TUDOR,TARIFF RECIPROCITY WITH NEW,"I am not sure of that. Since that time, there have been two or three other proposals; and I think that, even is late as last year, the then Prime Minister was in communication, with the Prime Minister of the Dominion with a view to arrive at some particular items; because a treaty could not be made on one or two items alone. The difficulty is that we are producing practically everything that New a Zealand produces, with one or two excepThe tions; and we are producing; also, a number of commodities that New Zealand is not. New Zealand is very anxious that we should place oats.on the free list; but I do not think the farmers of Australia would like us to allow New Zealand oats to come in free to obtain a benefit for the Australian wine industry.",67
491,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TARIFF RECIPROCITY WITH NEW,Ne w Zealand is reducing duties on our produce now of her own free will.,67
492,Mr TUDOR,TARIFF RECIPROCITY WITH NEW,"I am not aware of that; but this matter was mentioned by the Minister of External Affairs about twelve months ago, when he brought up the ques-' tion of South Australian wines. Since then, the South African wines have been going into New Zealand in increasing quantities ; and our own wines have been pushed out, simply on account of the differential Tariff, which is 5s. against Australia, and 2s. against South Africa. I assure the honourable member that if .anything can be done, not only to bring about a better understanding between the Commonwealth and the Dominion, but to arrange anything in regard to trade that will not press too severely on any one section of the community, the Government will be pleased to look into the matter and see if it can be arranged. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.10 p.m.",67
