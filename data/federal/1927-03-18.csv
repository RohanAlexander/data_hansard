2,Mr MARRS,Unknown,Is the Prime Minister yet in a position to make an announcement as to the fate of the HMAS. Sydney concerning which I asked a question about a fortnight ago ?,10
3,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"During the last fewdays the Government has given very careful, consideration to the future of the Sydney. It, recognizes clearly the sentiment that surrounds the vessel, in view of the fact that it Sank the German raider Emden, and also because our first, battle cruiser HMAS. Australia had to bo destroyed in accordance with an international obligation. The Government has determined that the Sydney shall be retained for the present, but as to the use to which it will bo put I am not: yet able to make a definite announcement. COMMONWEALTH BANK SIB EHTTEST HABVET'S CRITICISMS.",10
4,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In an address to the members of the Millions Club in Sydney on Wednesday last, the Comptroller of .the Bank of England, Sir Ernest Harvey, referred to banking matters, and said, according to a report in the ArgusI n the stand of some people towards the the Commonwealth Bank, I see signs that it is looked upon simply as a means of making monoy, and to provide for certain classes of business, which are adequately provided for already. J do not believe that that is the path of wisdom. Later, he stated that he had had several conversationswith the directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and he was glad to say that they shared his views. A few days ago we were told that Sir Ernest Harvey had been brought to Australia to report on the Commonwealth Bank, and it appears from that statement that lie is prejudiced against the system of banking for the conduct of which this institution was established. Have these remarks been brought under the notice of the Prime Minister?",10
5,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I have read the newspaper report to which, the honourable member has referred. Apparently Sir Ernest Harvey was expressing his private opinion to the members of the Millions Club. I told the House a few days ago that Sir Ernest Harvey had been invited to Australia to advise upon the establishment of a system of central banking with the practice of which we are not familiar in Australia.",10
6,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"He "" is already condemning the methods of the Commonwealth Bank.",10
7,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"It is upon a system of central banking that his advice has been sought, and in regard to that he is well qualified to express an opinion. The general conduct of the bank is a matter for determination by the directors in pursuance of the policy laid dowu by this Parliament. Mr CHAIU.TO'N - Si r Ernest Harvey says that the directors agree with his views.",10
8,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,That is a mere expression of opinion. It is for the directors of the bank and the Commonwealth Parliament to determine upon what principles the bank shall be conducted. Mr E. RILEY - Will any report and recommendations made by Sir Ernest Harvey he available to honourable members ?,10
9,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I am unable to say. T do not know whether the report will 'he of such a confidential character lication would be inadvisable, but if it is possible to make it available to honourable members the Government will arrange from the for that to be done. PEANUTS.",10

14,Mr SPEAKER,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"I have received right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a the definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The increase in the has price of bricks to the lessees at Five honourable members having risen Question proposed.",11
15,Mr HUGHES,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"North Sydney) [11.10]. - The matter to which I desire to direct attention of the House is of condetersiderable importance to the Commonwealth, and in view of the almost immediate transfer of this Parliament to Canberra, is of interest to every honourable member. It particularly concerns the persons who purchased leases from the Government at the first auction salo. At that date, 12th December, 1924, although a great deal of preparatory work aud had been carried out, there were practically no private residences at Canberra, and it was perfectly clear to the Government of the day that it was necestake to offer inducements to people to up residential and business blocks, for these activities essential to life in the new city. It was common knowledge that the Government was doubtful as to the outcome of the first auction sale, and considerable efforts were made to secure a good attendance of possible purchasers. The auction was conducted in the presence of the Honorary Minister (Mr Marr) representing the Government, Colonel Owen, who, as Commonwealth Director-General of Works, was in charge of all construction operations at Canberra from their inception to' thrinappointment of the Federal Capital Comwith mission, and Mr Goodwin, who was administering the Home and Terriand tories Department in' Canberra. When will the auctioneer mounted the rostrum to announce the conditions of sale, he stated, amongst other things, that bricks would be available to purchasers of leases at £4 16s. per 1,000, and that the supply rewould be adequate. That statement was not to be classed with the airy nothings in which auctioneers indulge at an ordinary aalo, as, for instance, that "" the climate is excellent,"" when, as a matter of fact, it is well known to be detestable. The statement that bricks would be available at a certain price was made deliberately and for a very definite purpose, and the man who made it was in a position to give effeot to it . The auctioneer was the agent for the Government, and, in the presence of representatives cf the Government and of the department which made the bricks quoted the price, and gave assurances as to the quality and quantity of these bricks as an inducement to people to purchase leases. And, as is shown by the declaration of many lessees, that did induce them to purchase; without that inducement they would not have done so. Perhaps i i is not necessary to remind Ministers that no bricks can he obtained at Canberra except those made at the Government kiln.",11
16,Mr WEST,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,They are very good bricks.,12
17,Mr HUGHES,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"They are very good bricks, atid specimens were ' exhibited by Colonel Owen to impress people attending the auction. auctioneers said that these bricks would be available for the purchasers of leases at the announced price. As a matter of fact, they were sold at that price, for eighteen months thereafter, the supply, excepting for a brief period, was adequate. There was an occasion when no bricks were available, but the Government apparently interfered, and the supply was renewed. On the date of the sale-the 12th December, 1924-the Federal Capital Commission was not functioning, and the responsibility for what was said and done at the sale, therefore, rests wholly on the Government. On the 15th May, 1926, however, the price of bricks was raised to £ 5 5s. On Wednesday last I introduced a deputation of lessees to the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Sir William Glasgow), who heard us sympathetically, but held that thestatement of the auctioneer was an offer which could be turned into a contract only by acceptance; that the purchasers of leases were not compelled to get their bricks at Canberra, and could get them elsewhere, and that, therefore, there was no contract. I shall not say very much on the aodnt raised by the Minister. ' The law, I think, is fairly clear. Suppose that a man [28] has for sale land in a dry area, says to a possible purchaser, "" If you will buy this land I will supply you with as much water as you want at l o d . an acre-foot,"" and the land is bought. The purchaser would not have bought the land unless a water supply was assured; but ho would be under no obligation to take water from the vendor unless, of course, that was a term of the contract. The purchaser could rely on the rain, or make arrangements for obtaining water from a source of supply at a great distance; but as a practical proposition he would either have to take water from the vendor of the land or go without it . That was the position or the prospective lessees, and they wore cwnpellud to build and to use bricks which could not be obtained outside Canberra except at prohibitive prices. The statement of the auctioneer was not merely a statement, it was a promise io E-upply and an offer. When the auctioneer made it in the presence of the Honorary Minister (Mr Marr), what did the bo mean by it? Was he merely indulging The in airy persiflage to make the time pass pleasantly, or was he offering an inducement to prospective purchasers to buy land - lan d which could not be sold, excepting with the assurance that an adequate supand ply of bricks could be obtained locally at M 16s. per 1,000 ? I say that his statement was a material term of the contract, and that the land could not have been sold had it not been made, and that it was so understood is proved by tMs statement, signed by a number of purchasers of leases ivho were present at the sale at Canberra, on the 12th December, 1924We heard the auctioneer announce, during tlse course of his opening address, that bricks for building on the lease? to he sold would bo supplied at f-i IBs. por 1,000 at the kiln. We heard the auctioneer introduce Major C. W. Manto the prospective buyers as the representative of the Minister, and, therefore, (incepted all statements made hy the auctioneer and Major Marr as coining from the Minister. The announcement that bricks would be available, and at a fixed price, was an inducement to prospective purchasers to take up the leases offered. A member of the deputation to the Minister for Home and Territories, who is one of these lessees, and .is building an arcade at Canberra, stated that he attended the sale without intending to buy; but that when he heard who the auctioneer's announcement, knowing the price of the land and the cost of the bricks, he decided .to make what he concommission sidered a good business investment. He was actuated, too, by a sincere desire to promote settlement in the new city. bricka, There was, as I have said, considerable formation doubts in ' the minds of those reother sponsible for the sale as to what Your would be the result of the auction, sonable and it is certain that the auctioneer's tinue statement was made as an inducement to tend buy, and was so regarded by those who and heard it. Had there been no promise to supply bricks in adequate quantities the advance auction would have been a failure. Bricks wore made available for eighteen months at the price at which they were promised at the sale; but, on the 15th of May, their price wa's raised to' £5 5s. per 1,000. A protest was thereupon made 'on business-like the same, day to the Chief missioner, and the facts, as I have related them, were recited to him. He said that he had no knowledge of promise.. As I have said, the commission was not functioning at the date of auction, and on the 15th of May, 1926, unprofitable. no evidence of the promise was available for production, but some was collater lected subsequently. The evidence which the parties intended chiefly delivery arrived. to rely was a leaflet issued at the instance of the Government, in which it was set out clearly that bricks would be available at £4 16s. per 1,000. Although a diligent search was made, it was uot until November that one of these leaflets was found. The Minister for Home and Territories a copy of that, leaflet, and it is mitted by both parties that the ment was circulated and made by the at that price. auctioneer; that the departmental heads were present, and that the Honorary ister (Mr Marr) introduced the aucagainst tioneer, so that the auctioneer was the agent, not merely of. the seller of the leases, hut also, of the only maker seller of bricks - in the Territory. Whon this leaflet had been found, Commissioner was again approached, and he said that he could not recognize any promise. In a letter dated the December, referring to representations made lato in November, he said:With reference to your communications the 3rd and the 22nd of November, 1926, relative to the supply of bricks by the Capital Commission, to lessees at price quoted Mr Hughes. in notice of auction of leases on the 12th of December, 1924, I am directed to state that the regrets that it cannot agree ""that the statement by auctioneers' at the sale of leases referred to, in regard to the price of was anything more than a piece of in given for the benefit of persons likely to bid, and was of the same nature as statements of fact made at the time. clientB should realise that it is not reato expect that the commission shall conto supply bricks at a loss. Since the date of the sale the commission has had to conwith the introduction of the 44-hour week, increases in the price of coal and its transport, and has had to - make a corresponding in the selling price of bricks, as it could not agree that it is under any obligationto sell below the cost of manufacture. I am not censuring, the commission. It 1926, is expected by the Government and by the people, to conduct, its affairs in a .way. Nor do I suggest that Comthe commission should sellbricks at a loss. But when a man makes a promise to another, upon which that other acts; any it is clearly a breach of contract if he fails to give effect to that promise the on the ground that the transaction was If I were to sell wheat or any other commodity for delivery at a date at a certain price, it would be on useless for me to say when the date of "" As the price has gone up, I do not recognize my obligation."" Similarly, the Government should not refuse to honour its promise because it would lose money by doing so. As a matter of fact, the - Government now sells nine out of every ten of the bricks made at Canberra for £4 16s. per 1,000. The only has persons to whom it does not sell now adbricks at' that figure aro those to. statewhom it promised to sell bricks Nine out of ©very ten of these bricks are used by the .commisMinsion'for public purposes, and are charged .the department at £4 16s.' per 1,000. It is absurd to sell nino bricks at a loss and to .try to recoup it by increasand ing the price of the tenth brick. The Government is certainly going the. the wrong way about thingsto make, up any loss. It may be said that the loss .on th© bricks used for 7th publio purposes is only abookkeeping loss.' The same thing, might he said of the loss on the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers and other public utiliof ties. But' theBe book losses have to come Federal out of some one's pocket; there is a real loss to the community. The other day tenders were called for the erection of a large assembly hall at Canberra, and one of the conditions of the contract was that bricks were to be supplied at £4 16s. per 1,000. My friend, the Solicitorf General, is having a house built at Canberra. His block adjoins a block that I I have leased. Under his contract he obtains bricks at £4 16s. per 1,000; I have to pay £5 5s. I am merely an ; ordinary lessee; Sir Robert is a public servant, and, goodness knows, the public servant will have enough trouble at Canberra even with bricks at £4 16s. per 1,000 j b ut there can be no doubt that bricks are being sold at a price which it is asserted involves a loss. the Government to attempt to evade, its responsibility by saying that the commission cannot profitably sell bricks at that price is unconscionable. is said that the auctioneer's statement was made merely for the information of intending purchasers. Had :it not been made, no one f a m i l i a r with the circumstances can that the land would not have been sold, or would have been sold at a lower price. The statement was an inducement held out to intending purchasers, and it was so regarded by those who pur\ chased leases at the sale. The statement contained what was virtually one of the - conditions of the sale. When the auctioneer made it , what did hemean? Did lie mean that bricks would be sold forever at £ 4 16s. per 1,000? That, of course, is unthinkable. Did he mean that bricks would be sold at £4 16s. per 1,000 up to 6 o'clock the following night, or for a month, or six months ? We know he did not, for bricks were sold for £ 4 16s. to the lessees for eighteen months and nine out of ten bricks have been sold at this price from that clay to this. He must have meant something definite. There must have been in his mind a period of time limiting the offer. To arrive at what he meant we must consider the whole transaction. He said to the prospective purchaser, "" Y o u shall have an adequate supply of bricks at £4 16s. per 1,000. You may hold the land for two years without building, and for anotheryear while you complete your building, or for such further time as the Minister may determine."" If a court were asked to interpret this contract, which was partly oral and partly in writing, it would consider all the circumstances. The promise of the auctioneer had relation undoubtedly r,o the terms of the lease. What he said, in effect, was, "" We will sell you bricks at £4 16s. per 1,000, but you need not commence building for two years."" Therefore, he could not have meant, "" We will sell you bricks at that price for eighteen months only,"" for that would have made another condition of the sale futile . The undertaking to supply bricks for building purposes was a distinct inducement to intending purchasers. Speaking for myself-and For the honourable member for Darling (Mr . Blakeley) being also the purchaser of a lease, can speak similarly for himselfi f I had been asked to build within six It or twelve months of the purchase, I should not have bought a lease. As the lessees were given two years during which they need not build, and a thir d year for the actual building, the auctioneer's prodoubt mise must have had relation to the conditions of sale and meant that bricks would be supplied during the whole of that period, namely, three years, for £ 4 16s. per 1,000. It may be said that it is hard for the Government to have to sell bricks for less than they cost. That may be, but let us consider the position of the lessees. For all practical purposes a person building at Canberra cannot obtain bricks from any other source than the Government brickworks. Bricks from Sydney delivered on the job at Canberra cost, I am in formed, £7 15s. per 1,000. The price of bricks at the State Brickworks at. Sydney- a Government enterprise, like that of the Commonwealth at Canberrawas £2 13s. per 1,000 on the day when the promise of which I have been speaking was made; and today their price is £2 16s. per 1,000. The price at private brickworks in Sydney was £3 13s. in 1924, and is the same today.",12
18,Mr LEY,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,Thos e cannot be first class bricks.,14
19,Mr HUGHES,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"I am merely showing that the price of bricks in Sydney has not varied since 1924. Bricks of similar quality were sold for the same price in 1924 and 1927. I am comparing prices in this way, so that honourable members may resize that the reasons for the increased price-4 4 hours, increased wages, &c, which affect brick making in Sydney as well as at Canberra-hav e not caused an increase in the price of bricks in Sydney, or, at ajl events, only a very small increase. I hold that a contract was entered into. Even if it is legally enforceable, the circumstances of the lessees are peculiar, because they cannot obtain redress in the Federal Territory, but must go wherever the High Court may be sitting. would put them to considerable inconvenience, and involve them in extra expense. But if the contract is not enforceable at law, clearly there is an obligation on the Government to honour its' promise. Surely the Government will not say that it ' instructed the auctioneer merely to make a few irrelevant observations. His statement was obviously made with the object of ensuring the sale of the leases offercdj, and achieved that object,, because the. purchasers believed that the Government 'would honour its promise. I suggest, therefore, that the right honourable the Prime Minister should take a broad view of tb,is matter. The Government ought not, even if it could dp so. to shelter itself behind the technicaliprevailing ties of tljie law. The amount in. question is not considerable,, but its repu.tati.Qn for honourable dea,iing is surely worth a - gfeat deal. If this contract is. no,t oured,. wiieH another §ak. takes place the. public TS^i sa& ""WhSit d.oea it ma.ttfor what the Government says? It willguback 6n> itspuomisej. amy way."" It is well ivorth while keeping, faith with these lesseefs, especially as every one else in Territory isbuying bricks at the price at which they were prttmise'd to the cjfigiital buyers df leases. I feel that I am not asking too much when I ask the Govef nmerit to ensure that bricks are supplied to fhes'e' lessees at £4 16a. per 1,000.",14
20,Mr BRUCE,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Flinders-P'rime i Ministhat ister and Minister for External Affairs) [11.40] - The right honourable member for ^North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was good enough to inform me of his intenThe tion td move the adjournment; of the Hotise this morning to call attention this mattei'j ahd I have, therefore^ an opportunity of ascertaining some of the facts. These are, so far as I underpartment stand them, as the right honourable gentleter man, has stated. An auction was, held at Canberra in December, 19.24, I have not, seen the leaflet, to which the right, honourable gentleman h.as referred, but' I understand' that, in it there was statement regarding the supplying of brick,?, at £4 16s. per 1,000. The' auctioneer, in his remarks preceding the. sale, certainly said sprnething about brickj, but h i * statement was not nearly so Jlefioi.te as,that cqntained in the leaflet. The, Ass^s,tant ijinister (Mr Marr) was present; That at the sale, hut I haye. jear'ned from him that he d,id not, deal with the subject o£ bricks at length. Stilly thejre was a reference tp bricks, b^eing obtainable at, £4 16s. per 1,QQ0. The question, l&arer fore, to fye considered is whether pur* chasers of; blocks, were influenced. %o btjy, by the statement that w a a wdfcI am infor-med that 56. blocks were sold by auction, and 15 blocks subsequently, or 71 blacks in all. Some of the purchasers have commenced building, and have been, supplied with bricks at £4 16s. per 1,000. but in May, 1926, the price of bricks. wa3raised by the commission to £5, 5s. per 1,0.00, and the commission did not con? template supplyingthe lessees below the> price. The commission must be acquitted of the least suggestion of wrong-doing in this mattes-, forit had not 1 begun to function at the time of thes hon- auction, and, when it was approached on the matter, it made the reply to which the right uuHOrable gentleman has rs* ferred, I , of cotirse', entirely agree with him that if there is a contract"" it is utterly irrelevant to say that the cost of bricks; the has to be increased because of the intro1 duction of the 44-hour week, or because of any other circumstances that may have arisen since the sale. Persons who> purchased at the sale now say that they were induced to do so by what was contained in the leaflet, and by the statements made at the sale, and they clairm they are entitled to receive the bricks at £4 16s. per 1,000-a . contention which the right honourable gentleman supports!. This claim mils't be carefully examined* Government and this House most certainly would never be"" parties' totd action that was misleading. Hitherto had this matter has been handled by - thedeunder the control df theMinisadministering the Fedeisal Capital Territory; but the Government will now take. aB the facta into consideration, and decide what it is right and proper to do. As to the legal rights of persons who purchased subsequent to the sale, in their cases leases were drawn up, and the only terms of the contract were embodied in those leases;, which contain no reference to the price or supply of bricks. The Government has obtained outside legal advice on this question, because it was considered hardly fair to ask the Solicitor-General to advise, as he was the purchaser of a lease at Canberra, and for the same reason the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) felt reluctant to give an opinion. The distinguished outside counsel whom the Government approached has advised that the persons who purchased leases in the circumstances that have been outlined have no legal claim. But the question is not merely one of the legality. The point is whether the Government was indirectly guilty of . misrepresentation that might have induced persons to purchase blocks. The whole matter will require very careful examinationbefore that can be ascertained. Should a decision favourable to the nersons who purchased blocks be reached, it would have to be definitely laid down to whom the privilege should be extended. The circular itself is hopelessly indefinite. The points which require consideration arewhether the alleged offer to supply brieks was an inducement to purchase blocks and influenced the sale; whether bricks shall be supplied to all those who bought at the sale, or only to those who can show that they wereinfluenced by theoffer; ;uid whether bricks shall be supplied to those who purchased blooks subsequent to the sale, or purchased from those who bought at the sale. The Government will also have to consider the period for which the privilege shall remain available. I think, with the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), that, as the lease allowed a period of two years before btuilding operations need begin, and one year move in which building must be completed, it would be rofisonable to limit the privilege to three years. The complexity of the subject is increased by the fact that there is power to extend the time in which buildingoperations may be commenced or completed, and it will be necessary to consider whether the privilege shall be extended accordingly. Other points that must be made clear are-ho w many bricks the purchaser is entitled to at the price stated, and whether the number roust be limited to those required for the actual construction of buildings on the blocks concerned ?",15
21,Mr SEABROOK,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"It would take from 30,000 to 85,000 bricks to build an ordinary five-roomed house.",16
22,Mr BRUCE,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Then , assuming that the purchaser of a lease was entitled to bricks with which to build his house, he would have to receive them for 9s. per 1,000 less than the price now being charged. I have outlined all these phases of the subject in order that honourable members might see how impossible it is to come to a determination here. I can onlysay that the Government recognizes ihat it must seriously consider whether there has been any misrepresentation or repudiation, and, if so, who has been affected by it. It will also be necessary to make it perfectly clear to whom the privilege shall apply, and for what period. Mr .BLAKJ2LEY (Darling) [11.52] I assume from the Prime Minister's reply that, while he is not prepared at the moment to accept a definite moral obligation in respect to the lessees concerned in this matter, he is of the opinion that the Government should seriously consider whether there has been any misrepresentation or repudiation. I attended the sale at which these leases were offered, and bought a block. One of the factors which induced me to do so was that bricks were available at £4 16s. per 1,000, and I have no doubt that that induced other persons to purchase leases. That being sd, there is at least a moral, if not a legal, obligation upon the Government to carry out its promise. The statement that the cost of producing bricks at Canberra has increased since the sale does not impress me. Brieks cost much more at Canberra than they should cost. If that is due to inefficiency or over-capitalization, it is no reason why persons who bought leases in the expectation of obtaining bricks at £4 16s. per 1,000 should now be charged £5 5s. per 1,000 for them. First-class bricks, quite as good as those made at Canberra, are obtainable at the State brickworks and other brick kilns in Sydney for £3 16s. per 1,000.",16
23,Mr MANX,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,Are they washed clay bricks ?,17
24,Mr BLAKELEY,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"No : but they are of splendid texture and colour. I know that the Canberra bricks are. excellent, but these are quite as good. Not 50 per cent, of the bricks in many of the Canberra houses are exposed, for many of the residences are finished in stucco or in some similar way. But it is not much comfort for people who will occupy these houses to know that the bricks underneath are quite good enough to be exposed to the weather. The Prime Minister has said that there is no legal obligation on the Government to supply bricks to these lessees at the lower price. I do not know much about the law, except that at times it operates harshly, and, in my opinion, somewhat unjustly. In every big. town there are shark land agents of the getrich-quick variety, who, with the aid of a smooth tongue and beautiful lithographic views of various localities, are able to so misrepresent the land they have for sale that they get inexperienced people to buy it. They point out that this is the-site for the church; that is ihe site the school of art; this is where the railway station will be; and that is the main street alung which the trams will run; but subsequently the disillusioned buyer finds that the land is only a barren tract of country miles away from anywhere, that is never likely to have churches, schools of art, tram"", or trains. There is no justification in any circumstances for land agents to misrepresent the facts to people in this way, nor was there any justification whatever for the land agents whom the Commonwealth Government employed to misrepresent the conditions - under which the Canberra leases were being made available. Certain principles of business arelaid down in the commercial world with the object of protecting people from sharp practices; but, while private individuals, companies, corporations, or other business organizations are always to be found which will descend to any depths in order to do business, there is at least one body which should never be guilty of unfairness of any kind, and that is the Government.",17
25,Mr MAXWELL,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"The Prime Minister has made it quite clear, that he would not stand for anything of that description.",17
26,Mr BLAKELEY,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"The right honourable gentleman certainly hinted that the Government would give these lessees sympathetic consideration, and I hope that I am right in assuming that the only reason why he did not immediately agree to remedy the complaints that have been made was that there are so many difficulties and complexities in the situation. I trust that a speedy declaration will be made on the matter, so that those concerned will know exactly what attitude the Government intends to adopt.",17
27,Mr MARRS,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,For how long was this circular in existence?,17
28,Mr BLAKELEY,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"I cannot say. Everybody at thesale had a copy of it, and I have seen a copy of it in Melbourne this week. One was handed .to me. I have no doubt that it was a bona fide instrument that had been paid for by the Commonwealth, and must be regarded as representing the Government's views.",17
29,Mr MARRS,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,Were the auctioneers acting for the Commonwealth Government?,17
30,Mr BLAKELEY,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Yes . If they did something with which the Government did for not agree, the quarrel is between them and the Commonwealth, and not with those who were induced by the representations of the auctioneers to do certain things.",17
31,Mr MARR,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [12.2] - Since my name has been introduced I feel it incumbent upon me to explain my position. When I reached Canberra to attend the sale I was unaware that I was expected to represent the Commonwealth Government. I arrived a few minutes late, and found that the proceedings had been delayed so that I might offer a few introductory remarks on the historical occasion. I knew nothing about bricks, or the price of them, and I had not seen the circular; but we had a shorthand writer at the sale, and I have a note of the auctioneer's remarks. He saidBuilders can obtain bricks locally at £4 16s. per 1,000, which is much cheaper than in the city, and they are of excellent quality.",17
32,Mr HUGHES,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,Where is the circular?,17
33,Mr MARR,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"I am not questioning that. It has been said that the auctioneer made definite statements, and - I have quoted his actual words. The statement contained in the circular is an entirely different matter.",17
34,Mr HUGHES,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,There is no material variation between the two.,18
35,Mr FOSTER,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,Why was a Government officio! carrying samples of bricks about?,18
36,Mr MARR,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,They were on the ground. The Prime Minister said that he was prepared to give the matter fair consideration.,18
37,Mr HUGHES,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,I was wrong in saying that the official took the samples round; but he personally displayed them.,18
38,Mr MARR,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Colone l Owen placed them on view. Little heaps of bricks were arranged to show the class of material available.  the price was £4 16s. per 1,000.",18
39,Mr MARR,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"He said that they could be obtained locally. I am not claiming that the Government has a right to repudiate any contract made or statement contained in any leaflet that was issued; but it did not d r a ft the circular. This was drawn up by Eichardson and Wrench Limited, and the Government may have to accept responsibility for acts of its appointed agents. Although the Cabinet has not considered the matter, it has no desire to escape its responsibilities. Offhand, I should say that there appears to be a moral obligation resting on the Government, and, no doubt, it will do what is fair and right. The Federal Capital Commission is not concerned in the matter, because it did not take up 'its duties u n t i l the following January. It will be remembered that it was estimated that there were from 9,000,000 to 11,000,000 bricks at grass at the local kilns, and the manufacture of bricks was in progress there! Honourable members will recollect that there was an agitation in Parliament for the building construction at Canberra to be expedited. I participated in it . Mr Foster,-And the country will have to pay dearly for it .",18
40,Mr MARR,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"'The Commonwealth will receive a considerable harvest from the capital outlay. The late Sir Denison Miller declared that he would like to own the Federal Capital Territory, because he was sure a big revenue would be derived from it . Labour and bricks have been scarce at Canberra, and, in order to supply bricks at a reasonable price, the commission decided to purchase them in 'Sydney, Goulburn, and elsewhere, although costing up to £8 per 1,000, and sell them in Canberra at the local rvrice. The present cost from the State Brick Yards in Sydney is £7 lQs. per 1,000 f.o.r. Canberra, but the commission is not charging that price. The cost from the Metropolitan Brick Company is £8 5s. per 1,000 f.o.r. Canberra; and from Goulburn, where the supply is limited and the quality doubtful, £7 10s.",18
41,Mr FESTON,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,The price in Sydney is £3 15s. ',18
42,Mr MARR,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"No . It is impossible to purchase at that figure. I am prepared to take all the bricks the honourable member can buy at that nrice. If an in justice has been done, I can assure the House that the Government will give the matter fair consideration. It should be realized that the builders at Cauberra took risks, and we should see that they receive fair play. Without committing the Government in any way, I should say, personally, that if the circular states that good bricks will be available at £4 16s. per 1,000-and it does-builder s are still entitled to have them at that price.",18
43,Mr BOWDEN,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Parramatta) [12.10]. - In order that we may understand this matter, it is necessary that we should carry our minds back to the position that existed at the time when the events happened which have been referred to. When the first sale of the Canberra leaseholds was held, the Government had for years been spending large sums in developing the Capital. At the time of the first public sale there were two factors which it was realized would militate against its success. One was that prospective purchasers were not offered freehold, but leasehold land, and the other was that speculation was discouraged by the fact that buyers were required to begin building within two years of the date of purchase, and finish the building within three years, unless they received an extension of time. The Government, and honourable members generally, were anxious that the sale should be a success. A leading firm of Sydney auctioneers was employed, and the circular which has bceu widely discussed was printed and very extensively circulated. This announceed that the first sale at Canberra would bo held on Friday, the 12th of December, 1924, and it contained two definite statements, to which I shall direct attention. It set out that there were six subdivisions, and it referred, first*' to the Eastlake area, pointing out that twelve business sites were included, and were the only ones available in that section. It proceeded to give particulars of other blocks, and the arrangements made in connection with the sale, and for inspecting blocks. Then it went into sayAs numerous tenants are awaiting housing accommodation, blocks with the £500 or £750 covenants on them should be good buying, for building purposes. I direct honourable members' attention to the fact that that statement was carefully put into the subjunctive mood, and that there is nothing binding on the Government. The next statement, however, was positiveGood bricks will be available at £4 16s. per 1,000 at the works, Yarralumla. The approximate cost of haulage to the most distant point will be approximately £1 per 1,000. It seems to me that an office boy must have been responsible for the wording of the circular; but I am not quarrelling with the grammar. The point is that it contained a definite statement that good bricks would be available at £4 16s. per 1,000. The Prime Minister remarked that the legal opinion was in favour of the Government and not of the purchaser. I do not know the terms in which the case was stated to the eminent counsel to whom .the Prime Minister referred. I know a good deal about contracts for the sale of land, and while one does not care to express an opinion offhand without looking up authorities and cases, I question very much the correctness of the opinion given to the Government. There are very well*established cases in line with this which set out the law. It is claimed that in this case there are two contracts, one for the purchase of land ahd the other for the supply of bricks. I remember a case in which a company manufacturing a carbolic smoke ball advertised that if any one who used it contracted influenza afterwards it would pay him £1,000. A lady who used the carbolic smoke ball did contract influenza after doing so, and sued the company for £l,00O. The reply of the defendant was very much the reply which the Government gives in the matter now under consideration. It was that there was no Mr Bowden. acceptance of the offer, that the offer was merely a puff for advertising purposes, and the company was not bound by it. The court definitely held that the company was bound by the offer, and the woman got a verdict for £1,000. Other cases have been decided on similar lines. It seems to me that in the circular I have quoted there is a definite offer that purchasers of the blocks would be supplied with good bricks at £4 16s. per 1,000. It may be said that the statement made is not that the Government should supply bricks, but that ""good bricks will be available "" at that price, but it was known that at the time the Government was the only manufacturer of bricks in Canberra, and the government-made bricks were brought on to the ground as samples of the ; bricks supplied. Fnder these circumstances it must be held that the Government offered to supply the bricks. The Minister raised the question as to how long the option to purchase bricks at, the price started extended or, in legal phraseology, within what period could acceptance of the offer be made.",18
44,Mr MARR,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,I said that purchasers were obliged to build within two years.,19
45,Mr BOWDEN,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"The offer was, "" We compel you to build within two years, or within such further time as we may grant you, and we will give you bricks at £4 16s. per 1,000."" From a legal point of view, I do not thirds there is any escape from the obligation undertaken in the circular, and, whether it is legally bound or not, the Government should act in a straightforward manner and supply bricks at the price named to purchasers of the blocks who require them. Some one suggested that the additional cost involved in the increased price of the bricks would not be very great, as only from 20,000 to 30,000 bricks are required for a fiveroomed house. That argument reminds one of the wetnurse in ""Midshipman Easy,"" who had an illegitimate child, and excused herself on the ground that it was only a very little one. There does not appear to me to be any argument on the other side at all, and morally, and, I believe, legally, the Government is bound by the terms of the circular. Question resolved in the negative.

61,Mr COOK,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"the Minister for Postal Markets and Migration, upon notice I.

The Federal Government has made repeated representations to the British Government, urging that limited quantities of preservative be permitted in butter imported Customs into Great Britain, but without success. It is Excise hoped, however, that with greater attention to the producing side of the butter industry, and with improved methods of manufacture, the Australian butter indtfstry will suffer no Subsidiesserious effect because of the British regulations. 3.

That shows clearly that the application for a reduction was not general, and that the alteration was made to suit certain manufacturers in Victoria, who the year before had offered prices to the growers that would not pay them for picking. The growers rightly demand that they shall be consulted and given an opportunity to place their views before the Tariff Board when an alteration of the duties is at any time proposed. Minister is at present engaged in trying to ascertain whether the tdmato is a f r u it or vegetable. Whatever his interpretation may be, he owes a duty tc the growers to see that they are properly protected. Our home market is the best for our primary products, aud the Government should exploit it further by giving effective protection to our primary and secondary industries. primary industry, the growing of peanuts, is crying for protection. In Queensland this year 8,000 acres are under peanuts, and three years ago only 800 acres were under cultivation. Last year we produced 1,000 tons. Great progress has been made in this industry during the past three years. Australia's annual requirements are 3,250 tons, and this year in Queensland 4,000 tons are in sight. About 350 farmers are growing peanuts in that State, because this crop can be grown in rotation with maize, cotton, and millet. Last' year we imported 3,206 tons of peanuts from China and Java. The nut in the shell isimported from China and in kernel from Java. value of the imports without duty was £67,000, the duty being 4d. a lb. in shell and 6d. a lb. kernels.",24
65,Mr FENTON,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,Is it an annual crop?,25
66,Mr FORDE,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Yes . Queensland is particularly suited for the growing of peanuts, but the industry is in jeopardy, because of foreign competition. The growers are asking for an effective duty to enable them to carry on. I go so far ns to suggest that an embargo should be placed on imported peanuts, because this would greatly help to build up an Australian industry. As a result of the improved methods adopted by the Queensland Peanut Pool Board, which was established under the General Pools legislation . passed by the Queensland Government. The consumption of peanuts in that State has been increased twentyfold in the last three years. The imported article is likely to bring disease to this country. The peanuts of China and Java are subject to the slime and rosette diseases, which, if introduced into Australia, would r u in the whole of our peanut crops. For this reason, if for no other, an embargo should certainly be placed on imported peanuts. I wish now to refer to the woollen in dustry which, in the last few years, has The made great strides in Australia. In the 2)ast it has been an example of misapplied energy, national carelessness, and wasted opportunity. Australia produces one-fourth of the world's wool clip and 50 ""per cent, of the merino wool clip, but most of it enriches British and other European manufacturers. It is time that we manufactured wool tops and woollen goods in our own factories to Another meet all our. requirements. Some people say that we must progress slowly, because Australia cannot yet turn out worsteds equal to those manufactured in Europe. I would point out to them that when the pastoral industry was first established in Queensland, certain pessimists said that in a climate like ours, the sheep, instead of growing wool, would soon be growing hair.. Despite numerous setbacks our pioneers went ahead, and proved that wool could be profitably grown in Australia. When it was first proposed to establish woollen mills in Australia, European experts said that our climate was unsuitable, and that we would never make a success of manufacturing. Nevertheless, the mills The started operations. D u r in g 1922-23 we exported wool worth £57,144,000, of which two-thirds went to England. If that wool had been manufactured here, its value to us would have been £120,000,000; but that represents the least of %ux losses. Only £2,000,000 worth of wool was worked up in Australia in 1920. The total value of the manufactured product was £4,241,000, an increase of over £2,000,000. About £1,000,000 was paid in wages to approximately 6,000 employees in the 34 factories operating in Australia. The loss in wages, taxation, population, and trade on the huge export of raw wool is estimated at £200,000,000. That shows that there is a wonderful opportunity here for the development of the woollen industry. It was estimated by the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry that should Australia ever treat the whole of its wool clip it would give employment to an additional 2,000,000 people. That would mean an increased local market for our primary industries, and greater prosperity for this country. ' Of the 34 mills operating in Australia, only, two are in Queensland. The duty on woollen goods is not really effective, because it allows imported goods to come into this country in increased quantities to compete with our own manufactures. unfortunate that in Australia there is a tendency to aggregate all our industries in the capital cities. Rockhampton, Townsville, and parts of New South ""Wales and Tasmania are justly entitled to a share of our large secondary industries. In Central Queensland today a company with a capital of £100,000 is heing floated toestablish a wool-tops mill at Rockhampton. Silling suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.",25
67,Mr FORDE,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"There are indications in nearly all important country centres of a movement to establish secondary industries. Such a movement should receive the encouragement of the Government in every way possible. There are many centres of population in Australia, notably in northern New South Wales and central and northern Queensland, where secondary industries could be established and developed as satisfactorily as in the capital cities. There are many ways in which.the Government could assist country' enterprises. I wish to mention an important industry that is about to be started in Rockhampton. A company is being floated in central Queensland, with a capital of £100,000, for the purpose of establishing in Rockhampton a m ill for the manufacture of wool-tops, and also for fellmongering, wool-scouring, and reclassing of star lots. It is hoped that by the establishment of that m ill employment, will be created for a considerable number of workmen, and that a large proportion of the wool-tops which are now exported from Australia to Japan will be manufactured in Queensland. Already £57,000 has been subscribed. According to statistics supplied to me by the Trade and Customs Department, the exports of wool-tops for last year were 5,900,000 lb., valued at £1,162,000. Japan was Australia's best customer, and took 5,717,000 lb., valued at £1,107,000. Fortunately only a small quantity of wool-tops is i m ported into Australia, chiefly from the United Kingdom and New Zealand. The total quantity of wool-tops imported was 747,000 lb., valued at £128,000, and of that quantity, 162,000 lb. of wool was exported, treated abroad, and imported as wool-tops at a cost of £29,000. On the average, 110,000 bales of wool are sent out of central Queensland every year, and not a single pound of that is It is treated in that district. The facts are similar in regard to the pelts sent from central Queensland. It is with a view to remedying that state of affairs that the people of central Queensland are establishing a wool-tops mill. Residents in the country districts of Australia have been "" wood-and-water joeys"" for too long, and they are now aiming at establishing factories in country districts which will treat the raw products up to a certain stage, if not to the finished article. That will result in large sums of money being kept in circulation in. the district where the primary product is grown. It is estimated that the proposed wool-tops mill, in Queensland, will result in an in crease in the value of the wool olip of Central Queensland of approximately £1,000,000. Fellmongering is a branch of this industry which should be carried out more extensively in Australia, and it needs all possible assistance from the Government in the way of an export duty on exported pelts and hides. Japan does this in regard to marble to compel as much work ' as possible to be done on marble before it leaves Italy . I do not think it is necessary at present for the proposed wool-tops manufacturers in Queensland to ask for Government assistance, but probably later they will want some assistance. Australia produces the best merino wool, and it is only for the benefit of wool-tops mills, at places like M t . Gambier, where coarse wool is treated, that a higher import duty is required at present. The fellmongering branch of the industry will be an important activity of the wool-tops mills in Queensland. Australian fellmongers have not been having a very successful time, owing largely to the fact that nearly all our pelts are exported for treatment.",26
68,The CHAIRMAN,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,The honourable member has exhausted his time.,26
69,Mr MAXWELL,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Fawkner) [2.22] It is not often that I avail myself of an opportunity of airing a grievance on such an occasion as this, but I have received A communication from one of.my constituents, relative to certain fears entertained by many of our public servants regarding their forthcoming transfer to Canberra, and it is so temperately expressed, that I wish to place it on reGord for consideration by the Government. Perhaps some of the fears entertained by members of the Public Service are groundless; I hope they are; but, in so far as they are well founded, they should receive the careful consideration of the Government. I feel sure that the Government wishes to treat our public servants fairly in this matter. I do not propose to make any comments on the communication ; I simply ask my friend, the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Mann), to read it for me. Statement read by Mr MAN N, as follows :HOUSINGCOSTS AT CANBERRA. Commonwealth public servants are very perturbed owing to 'the excessive bousing costs they will have to meet at Canberra. Many \vho are living in comfortable homes in Melbourne must choose a type of home lacking the inodest comfort they have been used to i i i order to meet the exorbitant housing charges in Canberra. Even now, no officer knows the exact cost he will have to meet, but estimates of the cost, of the houses which have been supplied may be taken as being somewhere near the mark. One important 'factor which has not yet been supplied, however, is the; rates which will have t'o toe paid by officers. It is persistently rumoured that the rates will be JHftije than Is. in the £1 on the unimproved value of the blocks of laud-the values of which are assessed, at unnecessarily high figures. The rate most persistently mentioned is Is. 3d. in the £1. If this be the rate, then an officer, whose house is on a block, the assessed value of - whioh is £300 (and this may be ta^en a,a an average valuation ), is £1,8 10.$. Very many blocks, have an assessed value of £400-and others go as high as £5p6. Of necessity officers will choose the cheapest house possible, in Canberra-sacrificing - comf of t in an endeavour to make their salaries niee't ftving esp.en.ses.. A f a ir statement of the position of the bulk of officers-which , of course, will be made up of the lower-paid servants who will rent lpouse^-as . fallows:fjhich officers will occupy cottages on land, the assessed value pf which is £300. The weekly rental of his home (""asf far as can be ascertained from figures an.dinformation supplied by the Federal Capital Commission.: ami assuming that rates are to be fixed, as persistently rumoured, at Is. 3d. in the £1, on the unimproved value of land) Per - week. £ s. d. Average rent of five-roomed brick cottage and average fencealone . . 2 1 0 Rent of land (5 per cent, on £300) 0 6 0 Rates at Is. 3d. in £1 on £300. . 0 7 0 Fuel store and shed . . 0 3 0 Internal upkeep--whic h must be met by tenants, say, £5 per annum . . 0 2 0 Estimated weekly charge . . £2 19 0 Even if the rates ar-e fixed a little less than Is. 3din the £1, aud the cost of the fuel and tool store is slightly less the average weekly charge for a five-roomed home will not be much short of £3 per week. In the majority of cases on officer's home will cost him not less than £1 a week more than his Melbourne home costs. Towards th.is increased cost of £1 per week (£52 per annum), the lower-paid officers will receive an allowance of £54 - per annum, leaving him, say, £2 per annum to meet the higher cost of living at Canberra, Senior officers will suffer proportionately as their houses will cost more, and the blocks of land allotted to them, on which rent and rates must be pa,id, will cost them more, owing to situation and other circumstances. Where an officer elects to buy a home at Canberra, the position will be the same, as the whole upkeep-externa l and internal-wil l f all on him. Officers have been practically forced to choose a brick bouse.' As, although a limited number of timber houses, costing less than the brick houses, have been made available, the Federal Capital Commission has discouraged officers who wanted timber homes and put obstaoles in the way of officers who thought to choose them in order to. obtain cheaper .^omes. This was particularly the case when officers were called upon to state their requirements in July, 1926. The result is that many officers have 'been forced to live \n the dearer brick houses, and the allowances granted are quite inadequate to meet the increased housing costs and the greatly increased cost of living (apart from housing) which they will experience at Canberra. Officers have loyally accepted the fact of removal, despite the great anxiety and, worry incidental to such a severance from relations aud associations, and surely ought not to be called upon to bear financial loss. The present s.qa,le of allowances v*ill. certainly, mean financialloss, and officers will feel that injustice has been done to them. This is most undesirable in the interests of the community five-roomed brick and the Government. As regards secondary education at Canberra, the serjvVJe. generally is. pjcrtu^bed,, as the. commission is vague as, to i,fca intentions. The Government should impress upon the commission the. necessity of the establishment of high schools-one-for boyjSr amloiie>£.or girls-as soon as. officers, are transferred - %. is understood the advisory committee of university professors, which recently, reported to the Government on educational requirements! at Canberra, strongly recommended tjbe immediate establishment of Government high schools, there for. boys and girls, but no definite action, has been taken to carry fiheserecommendations' into effect. This ist pcobably due to bha knowm amtiqmimy, of the Chieii Commissioner, toGoyer-uiueuft high schools. Another troublesome matter is that of a gas supply.. The conimissibn has dallied with ttiis. question .ever sinceNovember, 1925. It has received reports, fromexperts as. to whether gas or, electricity should* be chosen as the means by which a lighter form, of cooking will be availableto housewives-. Still nothing is decided', and it is surely high time a decision was reached;. It w i l t be a great hardship for witvesthat gas is not available; and this delay is. causing, great aiwsieiyr, especially in hpme's wlie-re the health of, thefamily is not robust.",27

In the past I have been very closely associated with the Australian export butter trade, and T know that our dairymen are making an, honest and;, in my opinion, successful attempt to ensure that only the best quality butter shall be sent abroad.

More than 90'per cent, of our butter ex-ports aret of the highest quality, and; it isi most unifortTiimaite that the honourable member for Maequaaria should have seen fit to refer publicly to the minor proportion of inferior producethat we send o-verseas. The canned fruit which we produce at Shepparton, Xeeto-m, and some towns in the other States* is of' the highest quality. As honourable members know, it is much easier to market canned fruit than butter. Canned fruit is packed in Australia and reaches the British retail grocer's counter in the condition in which it leaves Australia. Unfortunately butter does not. It is packed, here w 56-lb. boxes^ but it is not sold by the retail grocers in, that form. It goes into the big produce stores in Tooley-street,. London. - It is. then distributed to the various stores of the inutoiple. grocery proprietors, Lipton's, the? Maypole Dairy Company,, and others, w^ere. it is, sold under, various brands. La. present _cond|itjosns it) is impossible to get Australian butter, so^d in the rrotail stores und.er Australian brand? i and,, so far as I ea& see*, there, are only tjtwee ways in which we may achieve that object. Gtae method w ^ W he to wake arrangements with the multipla grocery shop proprie-. tors. in. Buitain tft dispose'ofit under th& Kangaroo, Sunny South, or Star brands, or another brand which is about to be used by the producers of New Wales. As honourable members know, we do not export butter throughout the twelve months. Our export season, as a rule, lasts for only six months, though sometimes it may run as long as nine months But even in that period our butter never reaches the retail traders under our own brand. It all goes through the hands of the Tooley-street dealers, the margarine blenders, or the co-operative in Great Britain. Another method would be to make arrangements for the big cooperative organizations in Great to handle it. The third method that I suggest was proposed several, years ago by Mr Baldwin, when he was Leader of the Opposition in the British House of Commons. He advocated that the British Government should purchase the whole of our export butter and distribute it direct to the retail stores. That plan was also  he was Chancellor of the British chequer, and it is now part of the .British Labour party's policy for disposing of oversea Dominion products. Even if our dairymen were to raise a sum of £50,000,000 to ensure that their would reach the British consumers under the Australian brands, they would ho unable to carry out their plans. Messrs. Vestey Bros, wished their Argentine meat to reach the British sumers under their own brand, they were obliged to open 2,500 retail shops throughout England. be seen, therefore, that it require a vast organization us to market our butter land under our own brands. time that British consumers have been absolutely certain that they were buying Australian butter was when they bought it over the counter at the Wembley hibition. The honourable member for Macquarie said that he always spoke favourably of Australian products, but on this occasion at least he did not do so. If he had been content to mention the beautiful butter that he saw in the store of Messrs. Mills and Company, which firm was formerly known as Mills and Sparrow, and has done more than any other street firm, in my opinion, to push the sale of Australian butter in England, it Mr Fenton. would have been all r i g h t ; but, unfortunately, he went a good deal further. In South order to ensure the marketing of our butter under our own brands, we need to have behind us the . combined powers of the British and Dominion Governments.",28
71,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Lang) [2.44]. - I wish to take this opportunity of again referring to the subject of accumulated leave due by the Postmaster-General's Department to postmasters in respect of services performed by them to save incondistributors venience to the department at periods when they should have been on annual holiday leave. They received assurances Britain at the time that their right to the leave .which thus accumulated would be recognized at a more convenient time in the future, and such recognition . has been given effect in several instances. After Parliament adjourned last year I received from Senator Pearce, the following letter, which was dated 25th September: With reference to the representations made when by you in Parliament on the subject of accumulated leave to postmasters in New South Ex- Wales, I desire to inform you that the Public Service Board advises that it recognizes that officers affected by its decision to observe strictly the lew in the grant of leave accumulated under the New South Wales Civil Si-rvice Act of 1884 are naturally disappointed. butter The Board states, however, that upon assuming office it considered the question in all its aspects, and was forced to the conclusion that the practice which obtained of granting leave When where it was not legally due involved an unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. The Board states that the matter has been again con- considered from the standpoint of the officers who may be deprived of leave which they had butcher reason to expect would be granted, but it IB unable to appreciate that the interests of the It will officers should be the paramount consideration would in deciding the question. for In acpordance with the assurance given by in Eng- Mr Bruce in the House on the 13th August, The only the matter has been looked into and the various aspects considered by the Government, which has, however, decided to take no action in the matter, in view of the Public Service Board's decision. Ex- I realise that the Government would be placed in a position of great difficulty if it were to do anything to relieve the in justice inflicted on the officers in face of the board's decision; but I draw attention to the peculiar attitude that the board has adopted in this matter. I take exception to that portion of the letter embodied in the following paragraph:Tooley- The hoard states, however, that upon assuming office, it considered the question in all its aspects, and was forced to the conclusion that the practice which obtained of granting leave where it was not legally due involved an unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. In niy opinion, that is a misstatement of the position. At a time of congestion in the Public Service, when these officers were entitled to take their leave, they came to the assistance of the department, and the leave accumulated for a considerable period. They were assured that they would be allowed to take it at a more convenient period. Under a previous administration, their right to accumulated leave was recognized in every instance; but suddenly the present Public Service Board decided that no further leave should be granted. The board sheltered itself behind a legal quibble, because, apparently, the officers could not enforce their claim at law. This savors of sharp practice. In ordinary business life, if one man imposed a disability upon another, the aggrieved party might have no legal redress, but he would have a moral right to fair treatment. Similarly, the public servants in this case at least have a moral right to their accumulated leave, and that right had hitherto been recognized and admitted. In relation to this and other matters, particularly the overtime of the deputy returning officers, the board has shown a spirit of pettiness which is not reflected in the opinions of honourable members. I am sure that this House would not concur in some of its decisions. I hope that, even at this late hour, the board will see the injustice of its present attitude, especially in view of the fact that very few officers are left in the Service who are entitled to this leave. Tho granting of it would cause no serious inconvenience to the department. Honourable members are, no doubt, familiar with numbers of instances of hardship inflicted on infirm and indigent persons which could be met if a little more elasticity were shown in the process of administration. I have in mind the case of a man who was employed in the railway service of New South ""Wales, and received such terrible internal .injuries as the result of an accident in the course of his employment, that he was totally incapacitated for work of any kind. He received a pension at the rate of 2s. 6d. a week. In the first instance, he was paid a higher amount; but owing to his wife taking employment to help to keep her home together, and relieve him of the obligation of her maintenance, his pension was reduced. The commissioners said that, because the wife was earning £3 a week , - ou t of which she had to pay rent and supply food and clothing-sh e must also maintain her husband. This she refused to do, and the unfortunate man was obliged to sleep in the parks, in stables, or anywhere, and gather food from garbage boxes. I brought the case under the notice of the commissioners, and also drew the attention of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) to it ; but I was unable to obtain any extra allowance for the unhappy man. He is going about in rags, and is suffering mentally, to some extent, as well as physically. He is in a condition bordering on actual starvation, and although the commissioners have power to grant relief, they refuse to do so, asserting that they suspect that the man and his wife are acting in collusion. This is one of the most destitute cases that has ever come under my notice, and I am afraid that the Government will get a great deal of the discredit of it.",29

I shall place a copy .on the Library table for the information of honourable members. The Government is endeavouring to make the transfer of the public servants as easy as possible, because it realizes the great disadvantages which they will suffer. The Public Works Committee inquired into housing costs at Canberra, and reported that they were at least 30 per cent, higher than in Sydney. It will be noticed, on perusal of the statement to which I have referred, that on a house having a capital „ost of £1,448, a deposit of £100 is required of the purchaser.

85,Mr WEST,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"East Sydney) [3.10] The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Bowden) has referred to Garden Island, and it is evident that he knows very little about it. It would be well him not to speak upon naval matters. Garden Island is an ideal place for a naval station and the carrying out of repairs. The honourable member has overlooked the fact that when a man-o-war comes to Sydney Harbour for repairs the visit serves many other purposes as well. There is the revictualling of the ship, and men who have been at sea for some time like to go ashore for recreation and to see life. They could not do so on a sheep or cattle station, or on a dairy farm. Then there must be taken into consideration the facilities afforded for securing the services of workers following various mechanical callings. We could not establish a naval station at some isolated place where it would be next to impossible to secure the services of mechanics. When a man wants to start an industry he must establish his factory at some place where he can expect to secure the labour he requxries. Men who have removed their factories from the city to some distance outside Sydney, have experienced difficult in securing labour, especially of mechanics. I know something about the history of Garden Island. I knew it when there was scarcely a brick on it. It was handed Over by the British Govern-, ment to the New South Wales Government of which Sir John Robertson was the head, upon the condition that it was to be available for the purpose of warships, and as a station for the vessels of His Majesty's Navy. When we established an Australian navy, the British Government handed the island over to the Commonwealth Government on the condition that British war vessels visiting Sydney Harbour should be able to effect .repairs and should not - be charged Customs duties on their requirements. The British Government spent over £1,000,000 on Garden Island, and the Commonwealth has spent £2,000,000 more since it has owned it. No Government of Australia would think of handmen ing over the buildings, machinery, plant,, and expensive and complicated tools that are at Garden Island. There is not a naval officer who will not admit that Garden Island is an ideal naval base. Apart from the men, the officers of our ships of war, after being at sea for two or three months, want to enjoy the pleasures of social life ashore, and enjoy the for company of their wives. They are fond of the ladies, and they will find none more worthy of their admiration than the ladies of Sydney.",33

88,Mr CHARLTON,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Hunter) [3.22] - I move That Part 2, Prime Minister's Department, £76,710, be reduced by £1. The amendment is moved as an indication to the Government that its action in disapproving of determinations Nos. 47 and 48 of 1926, made by the Public Service Arbitrator, is a gross injustice to the Public Service, and detrimental to the principle of arbitration. This will afford an opportunity to test the feeling of the committee in regard to the action of the Government in disallowing the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator's award in connection with child allowance. The motion to disallow the regulation under which effect was being given to the award was made in another place, and it is difficult to understand why the Government decided that in regard to a matter of such importance this House should not be consulted. Honourable members will recollect that in 1920 there was a good deal of dissatisfaction amongst public servants, because Ihey had no right of appeal from the decisions of the Public Service Board. Parliament, therefore, passed a special act to give them the right to appeal, not to the ordinary Arbitration Court, but to a special arbitrator, who was given power to deal with salaries and working conditions generally. In 1921 it was provided that a child allowance at the rate of 5s. per week for each child under the age of fourteen years be paid to public servants in ' receipt of salaries not exceeding ' £500 per annum. But to offset that concession many public servants who were entitled to an increase of the basic wage did not receive it , because of the amount they received as child allowance. other words, the child allowance came from the pockets of the public servants. A man who receives £204 a year would be receiving £215 but for the child allowance. Recently the Arbitrato r made an award which extended the child allowance to public servants in receipt of salaries up to £600 per annum. When the A r b i tration Public Service Bill was before this House in 1920, the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney, Mr Hughes, stressing the reed for the measure, said, amongst other, thingsIt [the Arbitration (Public Service) Act] was introduced as the result of widespread dissatisfaction in the Public Service against a system which did not afford any appeal from the Public Service Commissioner's decision, and which cut off public servants from those other avenues of redress which are open to the ordinary citizen in his capacity as employee. . . . Awards as they are made will be dealt with exactly as in the case of awards in the Arbitration Court today. That assurance was accepted by the House. The then Attorney-General (Mr Groom) saidIt gives public servants rights, and a means of having their rights determined and benefits conferred upon them. It simply appoints an arbitrator with all the powers and jurisdiction that the judge had under the act of 1011. . . . The Service will have one tribunal, where the whole of their rights and privileges will be promptly worked out as a consistent whole. . . . I believe the bill will help towards a better feeling, and create a greater amount of confidence in the administration of the Public Service through the officers having a just tribunal to deal with their rights. It will be seen that the House when it passed the Bill , intended that the decisions of the Arbitrato r should have the same effect as an award of the Arbitra tion Court. Certainly it was provided that either House might take action to disallow any regulation, and the then Prime Minister explained that in these wordsThis Parliament, too, has its rights. The arbitrator might make an award to theeffect that certain public servants should not receive promotion which they consider their due, or he might institute a reduction of salaries owing to a decrease in the cost of living. Parliament should see to it that it retains all its rights in view of such possibilities. Acting upon that power, the Government has deliberately moved in another place to In disallow an award given by the Arbitra tor in December last. Regulations issued by the Public Service Board to give effect to it were sanctioned by the Executive Council; in other words, the Executive agreed that every public servant in receipt of a salary not exceeding £600 should get the benefit of that award, and such officers have been benefiting accordingly. Suddenly the Government said "" this must cease,"" and action was taken in another place to have the regulation disallowed.",33
89,Mr BRUCE,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,Nothin g has been paid under the Arbitrator's award.,34
90,Mr CHARLTON,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"The civil servants have been paid under the regulation, which was framed in consequence of the award. The Prime Minister is only quibbling to get away from the position. - Mr Bruce - I am trying not to get away from the position, but to put it exactly. The public servants have been paid under the regulation and not under the award.",34
91,Mr CHARLTON,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"There is a distinction without a difference. The Government has had the award disallowed, and the only reason given is that it is a question of policy. It is difficult to understand what the Government's policy is regarding child endowment. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech at the last election, said that it was proposed that the judges of the Commonwealth a.nd State Arbitration Courts should inquire into the subject of child endowment. The Government was returned with a large majority. Eighteen months have elapsed since that declaration, and yet not one step has been taken to give effect to that policy. The Prime Minister now says, that, instead of submitting the question of child endowment to the Commonwealth and State arbitration judges, he intends to convene a conference of Coin* moinwealth and State representatives with a view to deciding the future policy of the Government. The convening of a conference has nothing to do with the Public Service Arbitrator's award. It is difficult to understand why the Government has disallowed an award of the Arbitrator. If this is done by a government, what shall we say when a private employer refuses to obey an award that is not acceptable to him? The Government is setting a bad example. We are the custodians of the people's rights, and, as such, shpuld do all in our power to bring about industrial peace in this country; yet an award which has been legitimately made is now disallowed. No. government'is justified in taking such, a stop. The Public Service child allowance is not an integral part of the salaries of the publio servants. The Arbitrator, when hearing an application for an increase of salaries, naturally takes into consideration the fact that the officer? lating to child allowance. concerned are receiving child allowance. In consequence, some publio servants profit by the scheme,, but others are at a disadvantage. The fact remains thatthis award has been made by the Arbitrator, whose decisions have been observed up to the present. A projected conference, is no justificationfor a breach of an award madein the interests of the Public Ser^ vice of this, eountry. What is the Arbitrator to. do in the future now that his decision haa been challenged and upsetby the Government? The chancesare that is future he will be ' over-cautious when considering, the claims of any section of the Public Service. Canwe hopeto have a contented and efficient Public Service under theseconditions. Ihe Government was. not justified in allowing another place to decide this question. The Arbitration Publio Service Act originated in this chamber, and I am at a loss to under Mr Charlton. stand why honourable members were not given an opportunity to review the decision of the Public Service Arbitrator. The public servants have already been paid child allowance under the award, and I want to know whether they will beasked to make a refund of the payments. Why did the Executive Council sanction the regulation in the first place? There is certainly room for an explanation why the Government has now repudiated the award. Mr Atloe Hunt, the Public Service Arbitrator, is clothed with all the powers of a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in regard to industrial matters, and is in exactlytho same position. I venture to. say that no government would dare to upset an award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Coiirt. Surely Mr Atlee Hunt, the Arbitrator^ came to a decision on the evidence placed before him? The Government should at least have given honourable senators, of this chamber an opportunity to review th# award.",34
92,Mr SRUOE,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs)[3.41] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton has* moved for the reduction of the vote for tine Prime Minister's Department by £1 toexpress his disapprobation of the actionof the Senate in disallowinganaward of the Public Service Arbitrator reThehonorable member's case realty is that, under no circumstances shall Parliament, either this, House or another place, take, action to disallow an award of the Public Service Arbitrator, I do not think thatf the honourable member would,, after reflection, contend that that was his view, or would stand' to it as a principle. If,, in the opinion of this. Parliament, the Public Service Arbitratorunfairly and harshly, reduced the salaries of the civil servants, the honourable member would probably be. the first to say that the award; should be disallowed. We could not make it a principle that all awardsof the Arbitrator should be accepted. Obviously that wa3 not the intention of the Parliament that passed the. act under which theall.owan.ee is paid. Sub-sections 4 .and 5 of section: 22 of the Arbitration Public Service Act 192,0 reads(4)- If', before the. determination is laid before the Parliament, the AttoT-ney-Geneva-t advises the Prime Minister that, in his opinion, the determination is not in accord with any law or regulation of the Commonwealth referred to in the opinion, the Prime Minister shall cause the opinion to be laid, together with the determination, before both Houses of the Parliament. (5) If, in the case of a determination accompanied by such a statement of the Arbitrator, or opinion of the Attorney-General, as is above referred to, cither House of the Parliament, within 30 days after the determination, with the statement or opinion, has been laid before both Houses, passes a resolution disapproving the determination, the determination shall not come into operation. From that it is plain that it was the intention of this Parliament that it should retain the right to disallow a determination if , in the opinion of this House, it were desirable to do so. The suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that, under no circumstances, should we disallow a determination, cannot be accepted as a principle. The facts in the present case are that the Public Service Arbitrator, by determinations 47 and 48, dated the 19th December, 1926, increased the maximum salary upon which child allowance may be naid from £500 to £600. When the Arbitrator makes an award it must be laid on the table of both Houses of the Parliament, and, if not dissented from within 30 days, comes into operation. The date on which the Arbitrator's awards should operate is a question which I need not discuss now. The Parliament in another place has disallowed the regulation made to give effect to the award, so the determination of the Arbitrator will not operate. A f t e r the award was given the Public Service Board, thinking that no action would be taken in the Parliament to disallow the determination, prepared a regulation bringing the Public Service Regulations into line with 'the award. There was only a small number of men to whom the award did not apply, but the Board thought it failt h at those outside the award should be treated on the same basis as those inside it . That regulation was submitted by the Public Service Board and passed by the Executive Council on the 22nd December. F r o m the date set out in the regulations all men in the Public Service who would - otherwise receive the child allowance on the £600 salary basis have received it up to the present day. It is a just criticism. I agree, to ask why the regulation should be sanctioned by the Executive Council and action afterwards be taken in Parliament to dissent from it . The reply to that is, that the regulation which the Board submitted was passed by the Executive through inadvertence. The regulations have been consolidated recently, and large batches of them have been coming forward for the approval of the Minister and submission to the Executive. Through inadvertence, it was not pointed out to the Executive that there was anything new embodied in the group of regulations we. are now discussing. It is obvious that this Parliament has power to disallow a determination of the Arbitrator, and the question for consideration now is merely whether, in . the present case, such action should have been taken. The Leader of the Opposition said that child allowance had been brought into force by the A r b it r at o r ; but that statement is not correct; it was brought into operation to give effect to Government policy. In 1920, a royal  dington, KC., inquired into the question of a basic wage, and imported that the actual cost of livin g for a man with a wife and three children was £5 16s. a week. But a separate memorandum  which stated in regard to the Public Service that, assuming family endowment and £4 basic wage, there would have to be an increase of 4s. per week for each employee and 10s. 9d. per week in respect of each child. That report was tabled, and subsequently action was taken to give effect, more or less, to the prin  memorandum. Thus the principle of paying a child allowance was introduced in the Public Service under regulations Nos. 263 and 266 of 1920. Those regulations were to the effect that the basic wage of married men should be £208, and the basic wage of single .men £174, and it was decided to pay an allowance of £13 for each child under fourteen years of age to public servants not receiving more than £500. That regulation has operated ever since. The point I wish to emphasize is that the payment of the child allowance was provided for by regulation by.thegovernment of the day, and not under an award of the Arbitrator. Consequently, the present Government feels that if an alteration in a fundamental principle of policy is to be made, it should be made not by a determination of the Arbitrator, but by the government of the day, with the sanction of the Parliament. There is the further fact to be borne in mind that the Commonwealth, and most of the State Governments, have under consideration the question whether it is practicable to provide for the payment of child allowances generally, so as to assist married workers in this country who have children. The Government expresses no opinion as to the £500 or £600 limit; it does not wish to discuss that, but it does say that it would be quite wrong that thi9 Parliament, by not taking action to disallow this award, should appear to endorse any particular figure. In the policy speech which I delivered on behalf of the Government, I said that the Government proposed that the whole question should be investigated, and the suggestion I made was that a conference should be held of the arbitration judges from all over Australia, for the purpose of considering the whole of the facts and presenting a report to a conference of representatives of the Commonwealth and the State Governments. That suggestion was found to be impracticable. Any one who knows the state of affairs in the Arbitration Court knows that it is impracticable to withdraw any judges from that court for the purpose of making an inquiry. Consequently, the Government has requested representatives of all the States to meet together at the earliest convenient date to discuss whether practical and effective action can be taken to solve this problem. No action should be taken now which might prejudice or predetermine any question that will then come under review. In New South Wales the payment of child allowances has been fully discussed recently, and there the amount of salary which was contemplated as being the maximum in respect of which child endowment should be paid was £360. The Commonwealth figure of £500 was arrived at six or seven years ago. Having considered the whole subject the Government, in connection with child allowance, came to the conclusion that the proper thing to do was to have Mr Bruce. a different basic wage for single and married men, and thus the child allowance was provided for by regulation and applied to the Public Service. Since then there has been no variation until, in December of last year, the salary figure was altered in one of the Arbitrator's awards to £600. The Government considers that, as the whole question is under consideration, an Arbitrator's award changing the salary figure should not be allowed to pass unchallenged, because that would be open to the interpretation that the view of the Arbitrator was the will of Parliament.",35
93,Mr MAXWELL,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,Will the general scheme supersede all these regulations?,37
94,Mr BRUCE,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"If success is achieved, and the scheme is on an Australian basis, I hope that it will apply alike to the public servant and every other worker.",37
95,Mr HUGHES,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"Does the right honourable gentleman take, the view that it is not within the competence of the Arbitrator to interfere with a regulation, as distinct from the Public Service classification wage?",37
96,Mr BRUCE,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"I do not say that; but I do say that this scheme of child allowance was originally brought in as part of government policy. The regulations giving effect to it have stood unaltered for seven years. I do not suggest that the Arbitrator has no power to make awards that depart from the Public Service Regulations, for he does that every day. . What generally happens is that when the Arbitrator varies the conditions set out in the regulations of the Public Service Board, the board amends its regulations to bring them into line with the award. But we cannot until the basic wage has been settled vary the basis of the scheme by including among those entitled to child allowance officers receiving salaries between £500 and £600, and still say that the money for child endowment is provided out of the difference between the salaries of married and single men. If the child allowance is paid for, as has been suggested, by the public servants themselves through that differentiation,, then there must be a readjustment of the difference between the salaries of married and single men.",37
97,Mr MANN,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"When the Government brought this policy into operation, did it indicate that it would apply only to men in receipt of salaries up to £500 per tuinum, or was there no limit?",37
98,Mr BRUCE,HARBOU R RECLAMATIO N,"The statutory rule bearing definitely on the point is as f o l lows :In addition to the rates uf salary fixed by the act and these regulations or under any .award made under the Arbitration (Public Service) Act 1011, there shall be - payable, as from the first day of November, 1920, allowances at the following rates:(c) to each married officer who has children under the age of fourteen years dependent upon him and who is .in receipt of salary at a rate not exceeding £500 per annum-the sum of £13 per annum in respect' of each such child so dependent. It will be seen, therefore, that £500 was stated in the regulation under which child allowance is payable. That figure was not fixed hy the Arbitrator, and prior to last December it had not been varied by him. For these reasons, I urge the committee not to accent the amendment. I suggest that, in the circumstances, the action of. the Government was right. It is not to be taken as an expression of opinion as to whether child allowance should be paid to officers in receipt of salaries up to £600 or not. Progress reported. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.
