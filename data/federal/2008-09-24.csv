2,Mr ALBANESE,OPPOSITION," Mr Speaker, I have a serious issue to raise with you, and I feel best that it be raised at the first possible portunity. Yesterday in the House, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition took objection to, and indeed gave a personal explanation on, the suggestion made by the Treasurer at question time that she had plagiarised a Wall Street Journal article. Today in the Age it is reported that: Ms Bishop later conceded to The Age that many of the words in question had been taken only from The Wall Street Journal article and not  in her explanation to the House. If you examine the words of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition actually said to the House, as checked against the tape, you will find that she said, ‘In my speech I was referring to the United States's plans. In fact, the words I used were the technical explanation from the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, which have been published widely.' When I checked the Hansard this morning, I found that it records the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as saying something very different.  of order. I seek your guidance. Is it appropriate for the Leader of the House to be accusing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this way without moving a substantive motion?",17
3,The SPEAKER,OPPOSITION,I am waiting,17
4,The SPEAKER,OPPOSITION,"Order! I do not know what has possessed the honourable member for Sturt since going from the sideboard to the shadow cabinet, but he cannot just prattle on. Quite correctly, when he approached the dispatch box he indicated that he understands this is a serious matter. The point is that I have given indulgence to the Leader of the House. He is setting a scenario. I expect him it is to then come to some form of conclusion. op- That might involve me making some sort of comment or decision or it might involve him doing something. I think we should just bear with him. I will listen to him. I honestly do not know where this is going. I have not been encouraged to this position at all. I am listening. The Leader of the House.",17
5,Mr ALBANESE,OPPOSITION,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Hansard records something quite different in meaning. It records the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as saying: In my speech I was referring to the United States' plans, and, in fact, the words I used were a technical explanation of US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's plan, which have been published widely. The distinction is quite acute between what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said and what the Hansard records the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as saying. Mr Speaker, I would ask that you examine the tape and report back to the House at your convenience and at the earliest possible opportunity on how it is that the Hansard has been changed on a serious issue in which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was giving a personal explanation about plagiarism.",17
6,The SPEAKER,OPPOSITION,"I will seek advice. I think honourable members would agree that the Hansard is produced professionally, as per guidelines. But I will seek advice about the matters that the Leader of the House has raised with me and report accordingly.

NA AMENDMENT BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Gillard. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",17
7,Ms GILLARD,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.06 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 is complementary to the Schools Assistance Bill 2008, which I will also be introducing today. This bill makes amendments to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000, the Australian Technical Colleges con- (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Act 2005 and the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 conselon- quential on the Schools Assistance Bill 2008. The bill repeals the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000, which appropriated funding for government and non-government schools for the 2001 to 2004 funding period. As this period has expired, this act is no longer required. While many of the amendments in the bill are technical or consequential amendments, a particularly important component of the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 is contained at item 6 of schedule 1 which continues the operation of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000. In the first sitting week of this parliament, the Rudd government apologised to Indigenous Australians for the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on our fellow Australians. At the time, the Prime Minister made the point that this is not the end of the government's commitment but the start. If Australia is to be truly ciled there must first be an acknowledgement of past wrongs, but this must be followed up with actions to close the gaps between Indigenous and other Australians. By putting in place appropriations for another four years under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 the Australian government can continue working with a range of stakeholders to develop and implement innovative measures to close the gaps. The act provides a vehicle to support what works in Indigenous education. The act maintains commitments to initiatives such as the Sporting Chance Program, as well as supporting the expansion of intensive literacy and numeracy programs for Indigenous students, professional development support to assist teachers to develop individual learning plans for their Indigenous students, an additional 200 teachers in the Northern Territory and the provision of three new boarding college facilities for Indigenous secondary school students in the Northern Territory. The act will appropriate more than $500 million between 2009 and 2012 for Commonwealth-led initiatives and partnerships aimed at achieving better educational outcomes for Indigenous Australians. In addition, a further $109 million is estimated to be spent over the next four years augmenting Abstudy entitlements through the Away from Base for ‘mixed-mode' delivery program assisting Indigenous students access tertiary education. As a transitional provision until other elements of our intergovernmental financial relations reforms are introduced in 2009, the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 appropriates over $160 million across 2009 to 2012 to assure preschool and training providers that the Australian government recogreconnises that Indigenous students need extra assistance if the gaps are to be closed. These appropriations will eventually be phased into the new early childhood and training arrangements. New arrangements for nongovernment schools are captured through the Schools Assistance Bill whilst new arrangements for government schools will be provided for in the proposed State Finances Bill. The Australian government is working with states and territories, through the Council of Australian Governments, to develop a shared set of aspirations and policy directions which will provide the basis for our school-funding arrangements and our reform initiatives over the coming years. The new framework will connect educational investment in schools, teachers and families with a new commitment to transparency. This will involve strengthened reporting systems, against ambitious and clear performance targets including goals to have the literacy and numeracy gaps within a decade and to have the gaps in the year 12 or equivalent attainment rate by 2020. In 2006 gaps between the achievement of Indigenous and non-Indigenous students against literacy and numeracy benchmarks ranged from 13 per cent for year 3 reading to 32 per cent for year 7 numeracy. The $779 million to be appropriated under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 through this bill is only one part of an education revolution being initiated by this government. Social inclusion and closing the gaps will be central to the billions of dollars collectively invested in schools and school communities by the Australian government in partnership with school systems, parents and other stakeholders. Closing the gaps can be achieved by working together to reveal those approaches that are making a difference for Indigenous students and by effectively implementing those approaches through our partnerships. The Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 can make an important contribution to closing the gaps between the education outcomes of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I commend the bill to the House.  journed. SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Gillard. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",20
8,Ms GILLARD,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.14 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This government came to office with a promise to bring an education revolution to Australia. Throughout this year, that is what we have been doing, step by step, piece by piece, taking the actions and building the framework that will enable Australian schools to achieve world-class outcomes for the future. Education is central to the future of our society. It is a central part of building a stronger, fairer Australia, ready to meet future challenges and able to make the most of its talents and resources. Over the previous 12 years, the Liberal government failed to provide the foundations that Australian schooling needs to succeed in this new century. In the course of just one year, we have put in place the foundations of a successful, long-term reform and investment program in our schools. New computers are already in schools, funded by our $1.2 billion program for our digital education revolution. New trades training centres are also on their way, the first practical steps in a $2.5 billion program. Our education tax refund, a commitment to parents of $4.4 billion, is available for those essential education expenses incurred since July this year by hard working families supporting their children's learning. We are implementing our commitments. And we are going further. If this country is to succeed in the 21st century we need a schooling system which delivers excellence and equity for every child in Australia. This is only possible if the community is confident that governments are applying the same principles of excellence and equity to all Australian schools, regardless of their location or the sector of which they are a part. Under the previous Liberal government this was not possible. Under the previous government, schools funding was delivered without regard for overall quality. Instead, schools were held accountable for whether they had a functioning flagpole and whether they put up posters about values. Australian values are at the centre of everything this government does. But we believe that they should be applied to our policy decisions, not tacked on as an afterthought. To do that, we have developed a shared agenda for reform in education, focused on improving outcomes for all young people. Outcomes like school-readiness for young children, progress in literacy and numeracy at every stage of schooling and better qualifications and life transitions for our teenagers. Through this process of collaborative reform, COAG has agreed national targets to radically improve literacy and numeracy outcomes among indigenous students and increase the number of young Australians attaining year 12 or equivalent qualifications. These goals will be achieved through a new National Education Agreement, an agreement between governments in Australia that will set the terms of funding and accountability for all schooling over the next four years. Commonwealth funding for government schools does not require specific legislation and is being negotiated through the National Education Agreement, which will be finalised by the end of 2008. This agreement and the bill being introduced today are complementary and together will show the full commitment of this government to improving educational outcomes for all students in all school sectors. Together they will deliver the minimum $42 billion for schooling that Labor committed before the 2007 election. They will establish the framework of accountability, transparency and collaboration between all stakeholders in Australian schooling. They will focus new resources, through a series of National Partnership payments, on the key priorities that we know are critical the future performance of our school system. Those priorities are: - improving the quality of teaching; - raising outcomes in disadvantaged school communities; and - delivering a new era of transparency, to guide parents, teachers and policymakers in making the best possible decisions. Non-government schools and school systems are vitally important stakeholders in this national endeavour. This bill establishes the basis on which they will be funded for the next four years within the framework of the National Education Agreement. It will apply to nongovernment schooling the same principles of quality and accountability, excellence and equity that have shaped our national reform agenda. The bill continues to provide for targeted funding for teaching of languages other than English, English for new arrivals to Australia, literacy and numeracy and students with special learning needs and for students in country areas. The Schools Assistance Bill 2008 will appropriate funding of an estimated $28 billion for the non-government school sector for the years 2009 to 2012. This bill will maintain the current SES funding and indexation arrangements, meeting our 2007 election commitment. This bill also contains two further specific reforms to address our national priorities. First, there will be additional funding for all non-government schools where 80 per cent or more of the students are Indigenous and for non-government schools in remote and very remote areas where 50 per cent or more of the students are Indigenous. Under to the previous government, these schools were not guaranteed the maximum level of Commonwealth funding, despite the fact that they are often serving some of the most disadvantaged Australian children in the most remote and demanding of circumstances. This measure will provide an estimated additional $5.4 million to these schools. This bill brings together several separate components of funding for schools with indigenous students that were previously funded under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000. This change will reduce reporting and red tape for schools and provide them with increased flexibility to focus on the educational achievement of their students. This newly combined Indigenous funding guarantee and Indigenous supplementary assistance will provide an estimated $239 million over four years. For the first time, this funding will be indexed at the same rate as other recurrent school funding. This increased indexation will be worth an estimated additional $24.5 million. Second, a central element of the bill and funding arrangements for 2009 to 2012 is a simpler, stronger and better focused framework for performance information and reporting. These requirements for nongovernment schools are part of a new era of transparency in Australian schooling. They will be consistent with the transparency measures for government schools and will help to enable proper understanding of how all schools perform over time and in relation to like schools serving similar student groups. This bill therefore provides for five activities that are essential to achieving transparency: national testing, national outcome reporting, provision and publication of individual school information and reporting to parents. Non-government schools will be obliged to participate in these activities in a way that is consistent with the wider transparency framework applied to all sectors. In contrast, the school-funding legislation for the previous four-year period imposed by the Liberal government imposed over 20 separate requirements, necessitating an excessive level of regulation, monitoring and red tape. This bill provides another, major step forward in building a long-term, national approach to schooling in Australia. It will ensure certainty of funding for non-government schools from 2009 to 2012, gives additional support to schools serving Indigenous students and ensures that all non-government schools are part of an Australia-wide strategy to achieve accountable, responsive and highquality schooling for every Australian child. I commend the bill to the House.  journed. NA SCHEME BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Plibersek. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",22
9,Ms PLIBERSEK,NATIONAL RENTAL AFFORDABILITY,"Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (9.24 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill establishes the Australian government's National Rental Affordability Scheme. The National Rental Affordability Scheme is a key part of the government's $2.2 billion affordable housing package, which will increase the supply of affordable rental homes, help people save for their first home, lower housing infrastructure costs and build new homes for homeless Australians. With this bill, the government is delivering on one of its key 2007 election commitments-to increase the supply of affordable rental housing for Australians and their families. There are now 1.1 million Australian households in housing stress. Almost 700,000 of these households are renters. Many of these renters are lowand moderate-income earners. These are people who are either moving house or cutting back on essentials to keep a roof over their heads. They are renting in a private rental market where rent rises are outstripping wages growth and inflation. This is having an enormous impact on families, key workers, young people and pensioners. The rental affordability pressures are driven by a poor supply of affordable rental properties. The National Rental Affordability Scheme is a major supply-side initiative to make rental properties more affordable by encouraging large-scale investment in rental housing for lowand moderate-income earners. The National Rental Affordability Scheme will create up to 50,000 new rental properties across Australia at a cost of $623 million in the first four years. The scheme will offer institutional investors and other eligible bodies annual rental incentives every year for 10 years, provided the conditions of the scheme continue to be met. The incentive is made up of a Commonwealth contribution of $6,000 per dwelling per year and a state or territory contribution in the form of direct financial support or in kind contribution to the value of $2,000 per dwelling per year. Incentives will be indexed to the rental component of the consumer price index. The scheme is deliberately targeted at lowand moderate-income households. Incentives are only available to providers on condition that dwellings are rented to lowand moderate-income households at 20 per cent below the market rate. More than 1.5 million households will be eligible for tenancies under the scheme, including key workers: entry level police officers and teachers, carers, apprentices, cleaners, hospitality staff and childcare workers, for example. The scheme provides a new opportunity for all levels of government, the business sector and the not-for-profit organisations to work together to increase the supply of rental housing. The government expects the scheme will facilitate new and creative partnerships between institutional investors, developers and community housing providers. Involvement of both investors and the not-for-profit charitable sector is crucial to its success. The scheme also presents a new investment opportunity for investors, creating a new asset class of investment in residential property. If market demand remains strong, another 50,000 incentives will be made available over five years from July 2012. The government acknowledges the efforts of the National Summit on Housing Affordability group which, over the last four years, has helped develop the idea on which the scheme is based. The summit group is a coalition of the Housing Industry Association, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Council of Social Services, National Shelter and the Community Housing Federation of Australia. The group, particularly Professor Julian Disney, Adrian Pisarski, Dr Ron Silberberg and Grant Bellchamber, as well as Carol Croce and Carrie Hamilton, have generously offered their time and expertise to assist the government to implement the scheme. This bill provides for the making of the National Rental Affordability Scheme by regulations. The regulations will further the object of the bill, which is to provide incentives to encourage large-scale investment in affordable housing. This will increase the supply of affordable rental dwellings and reduce rental costs for lowand moderate-income households. It is desirable for most of the administrative detail of the scheme to be in the regulations rather than in the bill. This provides the government with the necessary flexibility to address changing circumstances, including the process for determining market rent, tenant eligibility ria and acceptable periods of vacancy, as well as the reporting requirements for the scheme. The bill provides for the regulations to prescribe a scheme that deals with the approval of participants, the approval of rental dwellings, and provides incentives to an approved participant if certain conditions are satisfied. Importantly, the bill and the regulations will allow for eligibility under the scheme to be recognised from as early as 1 July 2008. The regulations are currently being drafted by the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing and an exposure draft will be made available as soon as it is prepared to assist with understanding the scope and operation of the scheme. Further, the bill provides for the scheme to include an allocation process. Under this process, the secretary may make an allocation for a 10-year incentive period in respect of a rental dwelling on certain conditions. Some of these conditions (the mandatory requirements) are set out in whole or in part in the bill itself. These mandatory requirements cover the conditions relating to eligible rental dwellings, eligible tenants and the maximum rent that can be charged, as well as the permitted vacancy rates. To preserve the integrity of the scheme, an incentive may be offset or recouped in the circumstances provided for by the scheme. The bill also provides that the scheme may provide for variations, transfers and revocations of allocations. In relation to receiving incentives, the bill provides for the secretary either to issue a certificate in relation to a refundable tax offset or make a payment. Unless a participant is an endorsed charitable institution, the incentive is to be made available in the form of critethe refundable tax offset. The National Rental Affordability Scheme is totally new in the Australian context. It is an innovative approach to reducing the number of Australians living in rental stress. The government will review the scheme in the early years of its implementation to ensure it is adequately focused on those Australians in rental stress. We will also test whether or not there is scope for simplifying the scheme or reducing the administrative burden on providers, and whether there are evolving issues of non-compliance that need to be addressed. We may need to make improvements to the scheme before it is expanded. With this bill, the Australian government is delivering on one of its most ambitious housing reforms-to establish a National Rental Affordability Scheme. The scheme will increase the supply of rental dwellings and reduce the costs of renting in the private market for lowand moderate-income Australians and their families.

Second Reading",24
10,Ms PLIBERSEK,NATIONAL RENTAL AFFORDABILITY,"Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (9.32 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Rental Affordability Scheme is designed to encourage large-scale investment in affordable housing. The scheme offers tax and cash incentives to providers of new dwellings on the condition that they are rented to lowand moderate-income households at 20 per cent below market rates. The incentive comprises a Commonwealth contribution in the form of a refundable tax offset or payment to the value of $6,000 per dwelling per year, and a state or territory contribution in the form of direct financial support or an in-kind contribution to the value of at least $2,000 per dwelling per year. The incentive will be provided for a period of 10 years to complying participants, and will be indexed in line with the rental component of the consumer price index. The National Rental Affordability Scheme Bill 2008 establishes the National Rental Affordability Scheme. The explanatory memorandum to that bill provides further information on the scheme. The National Rental Affordability Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to enable entities participating in the National Rental Affordability Scheme to claim a refundable tax offset in their annual tax return. These entities include companies, superannuation funds and unit trusts. The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that state and territory contributions to entities participating in the scheme, whether in cash or inkind, are non-assessable and non-exempt income for taxation purposes. In addition, the bill ensures that there are no capital gains tax consequences from the receipt of incentives under the scheme. The bills implementing the National Rental Affordability Scheme fulfil one of the government's important election commitments. The scheme aims to assist institutional investors, developers and not-for-profit groups to deliver 50,000 rental dwellings over the next four financial years by creating a new residential property asset class for property investors. If market demand remains strong, the government will make available another 50,000 incentives for a further 50,000 affordable rental dwellings over five years from July 2012. The government is strongly supportive of the work of the not-for-profit sector. Where the National Rental Affordability Scheme is consistent with the objectives of a not-forprofit body, the government welcomes their participation. The sector's involvement is important to the successful implementation of the scheme. Under the right circumstances, not-for-profit groups could be tenancy managers, developers or owners of NRAS dwellings, as well as being members of consortiums. To ensure their participation, the government is making its contribution available as a cash payment for endorsed charities. If problems arise as a result of the genuine involvement of the not-for-profit sector in the National Rental Affordability Scheme, the government will consider what steps are required to better assist them to participate in this scheme. The National Rental Affordability Scheme is one of a number of measures the government is implementing to improve the affordability of housing for families and individuals with lowto moderate-income levels. Other measures include establishing the Housing Affordability Fund. This fund will be used to streamline development approval processes, and reduce infrastructure charges and regulatory costs. Another measure is the audit of Commonwealth land to facilitate improved housing supply through the identification of surplus Australian, state and territory land for possible release for housing development. The government is also establishing the National Housing Supply Council to provide research, forecasts and advice to the Australian government and the Council of Australian Governments on issues relating to the adequacy of housing and land supply to meet future housing needs. Finally, the government's program called A Place to Call Home will deliver 600 new dwellings for homeless people. Full details of the measure in the National Rental Affordability Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (EMPLOYMENT SERVICES REFORM) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brendan O'Connor. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",27
11,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction The main purpose of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 is to encourage participation and ensure compliance. This will be achieved by establishing a framework for a new compliance system that will make job seekers more accountable for their efforts to find and keep a job. This new compliance system is part of a package of reforms to Australia's employment services and is intended to replace an ineffective and counterproductive compliance framework that has a number of flaws. The key reason that these changes are necessary is that the current compliance system has resulted in thousands of counterproductive, non-discretionary and irreversible eight-week non-payment penalties. For the duration of these eight-week non-payment penalties there is no requirement for a job seeker to look for work or to have contact with either their employment service provider or Centrelink. The consequence of this failed approach to compliance, and an obvious defect in the system, is the eight-week separation of job seekers from participation requirements, including looking for work, gaining skills or undertaking work experience. The indications to date are clear. The former government's system has failed to prevent non-compliance. In 2006-07 there were around 16,000 eight-week non-payment penalties applied. In 2007-08 this had doubled to around 32,000 eight-week non-payment penalties. An effective system should result in decreasing numbers of penalties because more job seekers would participate, but these figures confirm that the existing arrangements are not working. Reform of employment services The changes to the compliance system set out in this bill form part of a $3.9 billion package of significant and necessary reforms to Australian employment services that commence on 1 July 2009. These reforms are critical because in the last 10 years employment services have been operating under policy and administrative constraints that have failed disadvantaged job seekers, their families and their communities. These policies and constraints have also failed employers who desperately need skilled workers to fill vacancies. The last 17 years of economic growth has indeed improved the job prospects of thousands of Australians, but for many others the employment outlook has grown more and more bleak. Against this background, Australia is experiencing skill shortages in a number of critical areas and is looking at a shortfall up to 240,000 VET qualified workers by 2016. So it is vital for our economy, and to Australia's future economic growth, that employment services, and the compliance regime that underpins the working age payments system, require job seekers to participate by searching for a job, undertaking training or connecting to other activities that will equip them to enter and remain in the labour force. Just over 10 years ago, the unemployment rate was 7.7 per cent. Whilst unemployment is now around 4.1 per cent, a significantly higher proportion of job seekers today are highly disadvantaged and long-term unemployed. The proportion of people on unemployment benefits for more than five years has increased from one in 10 in 1999 to almost one in four today, an increase from 74,000 people in 1999 to more than 110,000 10 years later. These job seekers are some of our community's most disadvantaged people. Some are suffering from mental illness. Others have significant language and literacy issues and poor educational attainment. Some have a neurological impairment, and others are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Australians in these circumstances are more likely to overcome an extended period of unemployment if the compliance system encourages commitment rather than the current punitive approach. These job seekers are more likely to find employment by undertaking training or work experience, addressing their non-vocational issues, or actively pursuing work, than they are by disengaging from employment services. Goal of the new system is participation The first goal of the new compliance system is to ensure job seekers meet their parof ticipation requirements and make every effort to get themselves off welfare and into a job. The current system provides little deterrence or early intervention. Of particular concern is the lack of an immediate consequence for initial failures to complete activities. Under current arrangements, job seekers who have failed to take part in an activity or program can miss up to a fortnight before any action is taken. Then, after three failures, they get an irreversible eight-week non-payment penalty. The current system is viewed by many employment service providers, churches, peak organisations and welfare bodies as a ‘penalise first' approach because it prevents employment service providers from using their professional judgement. Submissions to the employment services review indicated that stopping payment for eight consecutive weeks places job seekers, particularly already vulnerable job seekers, disconnection and in many cases has resulted in personal crisis and homelessness. According to Homelessness Australia, ‘up to 20 per cent of people who underwent an eight-week “breach” lost their accommodation or were forced to move to less appropriate housing'. Further, the ‘penalise first' approach may result in costs to the community in other ways, through imposts on the health, housing and welfare systems, and placing additional pressure on charitable organisations to provide support. No-show no-pay failures The new compliance arrangements encourage participation and re-engagement as quickly as possible, in stark contrast to the current system. The new arrangements strike the right balance between participation and penalties for those job seekers who do not comply. A key element of the new system is a noshow no-pay failure, which aims to instil a ‘work like' culture to employment services. If a job seeker, without a reasonable excuse, does not attend an activity that they are required to attend, like Work for the Dole, Centrelink will impose a no-show no-pay failure. Centrelink will also impose a noshow no-pay failure if the job seeker does not attend a job interview or if they attend the interview but deliberately behave in a way that would foreseeably result in a job offer not being made. A no-show no-pay failure will result in job seeker losing one-tenth of their fortnightly payment for each day they do not attend. This does not affect rent assistance, the pharmaceutical allowance or the youth disability supplement, but it does apply to any supplement the job seeker is receiving for participating in Green Corps or Work for the Dole. As is currently the case, access to health care cards and family tax benefits will at great risk of not be affected. Resuming participation will result in a resumption of income support. A no-show nopay failure means that non-compliance will have an immediate financial impact, but the extent of the penalty will be in the hands of the job seeker. Connection and reconnection failures If a job seeker, without reasonable excuse, does not attend an appointment that they are required to attend, for example with their employment service provider, Centrelink will impose a connection failure. Centrelink will also impose a connection failure if the job seeker refuses to enter into an employment pathway plan or does not meet their job search requirements. There is no penalty for a connection failure. Instead, the job seeker will have to attend a reconnection requirement which will involve a further appointment or further job search requirements. If the job seeker, without reasonable excuse, does not attend the reconnection requirement, Centrelink will impose a reconnection failure period. The job seeker will lose one-fourteenth of their fortnightly payment each day that, without reasonable excuse, they do not comply with the reconnection requirement. Again, this does not affect any rent assistance, pharmaceutical allowance or youth disability supplement the job seeker receives, but it does apply to any supplement the job seeker is receiving for participating in Green the Corps or Work for the Dole. As is currently the case, access to health care cards and family tax benefits will also not be affected. Serious failures Eight-week non-payment periods have been retained for job seekers who commit serious failures. A job seeker commits a serious failure if they refuse a suitable job offer or if they have been wilfully and persistently noncompliant. Centrelink will decide whether a job seeker has been wilfully and persistently not compliant after conducting a comprehensive compliance assessment. Comprehensive compliance assessment The role of the new comprehensive compliance assessment is to ensure that the new system is tough on any job seeker who intentionally does not meet their obligations, but it is also able to differentiate when a job seeker is experiencing circumstances beyond his or her control. Job seekers will no longer automatically incur an eight-week non-payment penalty. A job seeker who incurs three failures for not attending appointments or six days of noshow no-pay failures in a six-month period will be referred for a comprehensive compliance assessment conducted by Centrelink. Employment service providers or Centrelink may also initiate a comprehensive compliance assessment at any other time if they believe a job seeker's circumstances indicate serious hardship and warrant such a response. During this assessment, Centrelink will look at why the job seeker has failed to fulfil requirements and identify any barriers to employment and possible alternative options. For example, it may be appropriate to refer the job seeker for a job capacity assessment to determine whether or not they have the capacity to meet their current requirements. A specialised Centrelink officer will consider the job seeker's compliance history and will talk to the job seeker to find any evidence of personal issues, including those that may not have previously been disclosed. Such issues might include homelessness, physical or mental health problems or domestic violence that may have impacted on the job seeker's ability to meet their requirements. This component of the compliance system also recognises that in a decent society fair judgements should be exercised when matters are beyond a person's control and no bureaucratic process should deliberately leave a vulnerable person without food or shelter, or propel a person into severe hardship, as the current compliance system does. Providing incentives to re-engage Another key difference between the current and the new system is that in the current system a job seeker who gets an eight-week penalty must serve it, no matter what. Under the new system, any job seeker subject to an eight-week non-payment penalty for persistent non-compliance or refusal of a job offer can have their payment reinstated if they agree to undertake a compliance activity. This will generally be 25 hours a week of full-time Work for the Dole for eight weeks, but may include other similar activities as appropriate. No-one who is prepared to reconnect with the system by participating in an intense activity will have to go without income support. Those who are not able to undertake any compliance activity but who would be in severe hardship as a result of the application of the penalty may also have their payment reinstated. Eight week preclusion period The current eight-week non-payment period for job seekers who become voluntarily unemployed without good reason or unemployed due to misconduct will be retained. This will no longer be inaccurately described as a penalty but rather it will be described as a preclusion period. Vulnerable job seekers who would be in severe financial hardship as a result of this preclusion period will have their payment reinstated, as is the case under financial case management currently. Unlike financial case management, however, the job seeker will have participation requirements while they are receiving income support payments. They will also have a requirement to access employment services to help them find work. Fairness As indicated in the object clause for this bill, it is not intended that anyone who has a reasonable excuse for failing to comply with their obligations should be penalised. Before applying any penalty, Centrelink will be required to talk to the job seeker and consider whether or not they had a reasonable excuse for their actions and whether or not the job seeker had any barriers to particiported. pation that might have prevented compliance. Further, employment service providers will be able to exercise their professional judgement. A provider will not be required to report non-compliance to Centrelink if it is reasonable to believe that compliance action is not the best means of securing reengagement and would be counterproductive to the job seeker obtaining employment. For example, a provider could negotiate for the person to make up an activity on another day, further reinforcing the importance of participation. Other amendments required to support the reform of employment services This bill also makes other minor amendments to social security law that are needed to support the new employment services. The bill replaces the term ‘activity agreement' in the current legislation with the term ‘employment pathway plan'. It also permits employment pathway plans to include optional terms which are part of the job seeker's pathway to employment, but which cannot be subject to compliance action-for example psychological counselling. It also clarifies the operation of employment pathway plans in relation to the broader activity test. The bill also removes references to standalone programs such as the Personal Support Program, that will be integrated into and delivered by the new employment services. Job seekers will retain the benefits currently available. The bill also includes minor technical and consequential amendments. This government remains committed to mutual obligation. We believe that those who can work should work and that those who are unable to work should be adequately supWe believe that this principle is reflected in the fairer and more effective compliance framework proposed by this bill.

12,Dr EMERSON,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy and Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation) (9.54 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 is a bill to amend the National Measurement Act 1960. This legislation will establish a single trade measurement system for Australia, replacing the current fragmented situation in which each state and territory has a separate system. The government is committed to reducing the regulatory burdens on Australian business and has embarked on an ambitious reform agenda through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). COAG has endorsed a business regulation reform agenda designed to advance Australia towards a seamless national economy. In partnership with the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, I co-chair the Business Regulation and Competition Working Group of COAG, which has responsibility for advancing the regulatory reform agenda. COAG's Business Regulation and Competition Working Group has been directed to deliver early action on the regulatory reform ‘hot spots' identified by COAG in 2006 and again in 2007. The area of trade measurement is one of the 10 identified regulatory ‘hot spots'. ‘Trade measurement' is a term that refers to the use of measurement as the basis for the price in a transaction. For example, by measuring the volume of fuel delivered from a petrol pump, a service station determines the total price you pay to fill your car's petrol tank. A ‘trade measurement system' is the term used to describe the infrastructure that is needed to make sure the petrol pump (or any other trade measuring instrument) is sufficiently accurate to give a fair result to the buyer and seller. In Australia, an estimated $400 billion worth of trade based on some kind of measurement takes place annually. Transactions involving measurements range from simple consumer purchases at the corner shop to complex multimillion dollar international trade deals. So, why does government need to be involved in these market processes? Well, consider how onerous it would be if traders had to prove to every customer that they had weighed each purchase accurately. Similarly, how difficult it would be for a packing house to prove to each purchaser that their cereal packet is filled with the stated amount. Also, think how wasteful it is for wine producers to sacrifice product to prove that a wine bottle is filled correctly. A trade measurement system helps overcome these difficulties. It gives confidence to buyers and sellers that measurements are accurate and this reduces transaction costs in each trade. Trade measurement is a classic example of a proper role for government in establishing the infrastructure that makes it possible for markets to operate efficiently and effectively. But Australia's current trade measurement infrastructure is not operating as efficiently and effectively as it should. This is why the Rudd government is introducing this historic legislation. We are determined to create a truly national system that will deliver productivity improvements throughout the economy to the benefit of all Australians. To describe how significant this change to Australia's trade measurement system will be, let me set out a bit of history. Prior to Federation, each British colony in Australia had its own weights and measures system. When the Constitution was drawn up, the Commonwealth's constitutional power for weights and measures was established under section 51, subsection 15. However the scope of ‘weights and measures' in 1901 was limited almost exclusively to measurements of mass and volume, and trade was very much more a local matter than it is today. Without a pressing need for national administration, the states retained responsibility for their various trade measurement systems. However, within several decades, the desirability of having nationally consistent rules and practices was evident and has been the subject of a number of reviews and inquiries. Two reviews in particular have been influential. In 1983, the Scott review recommended a national approach to the administration of trade measurement. The recommendation resulted in drafting of uniform trade measurement legislation. Unfortunately it took more than 20 years for all jurisdictions to enact this legislation. Despite the uniform format of the legislation, practical problems persisted. This was largely because the amendments to legislation were not adopted simultaneously, the interpretation of regulations varied between jurisdictions, and there were different approaches to administration. In 2006, the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs commissioned a review of trade measurement arrangements. The problems identified by stakeholders included unwarranted costs to businesses that operate across borders, different cost recovery procedures in different jurisdictions, different processes for licensing private sector verifiindividuals ers of trade measuring instruments, and inconsistent advice being provided about trade measurement requirements. This review concluded that the adoption of a national trade measurement system would deliver a net economic benefit to Australian industry, business, government and consumers. In April 2007, COAG accepted this recommendation. The National Measurement Amendment Bill gives effect to this COAG decision. And it will create a national trade measurement system that will be administered by the Commonwealth from 1 July 2010. The bill recognises that many elements in the existing model, the uniform trade measurement legislation, have stood the test of time. The bill adopts those elements where appropriate but frames them in a way that will be responsive to future needs and improvements in business practices and technologies. The new national system will continue to ensure the accuracy and reliability of traditional trade measuring instruments such as scales, fuel dispensers and weighbridges. However, it provides the flexibility for new technologies to be introduced as business or consumers require additional assurance. For example, the price of grain is set by measuring grain protein and both the grain growers and grain receival sites need confidence that accurate results have been used to determine the price. The new system will set uniform practices for each class of measuring instruments. Traders who operate across Australia will be able to use one set of procedures, rather than meeting different sets in the different states. The bulk of verifications of trade measuring instruments will continue to be performed by the private sector, with firms or licensed on the basis of competence and integrity. However, multiple licensing for cross-border operation will no longer be required, with one licence being valid for operation across Australia. Licensees will continue to be responsible for ensuring that their employees are competent to perform verifications. Currently the means of demonstrating competence varies across jurisdictions. In implementing the national trade measurement system, the Commonwealth will develop nationally recognised qualifications for verifiers, providing a harmonised platform for skills development in the workforce. As in state and territory trade measurement systems, government will perform an inspection function to ensure that traders and licensees are maintaining the accuracy of trade measuring instruments. Trade measurement inspection is a routine activity in business premises, and state and territory inspectors conduct this work without requiring warrants. Infrequently, access to residenlia's tial premises is necessary and this must occur under warrant. To facilitate an effective spection regime, these powers have been replicated for Commonwealth inspectors. They will be able to inspect, examine and test measuring instruments, examine and test prepackaged articles, investigate alleged fences, search and seize records, measuring instruments and prepackaged articles, subject to Commonwealth codes covering investigative practices. These inspection procedures have long been accepted in the marketplace as part of the cost of doing business and ensuring fair trading. The current trade measurement systems also examine prepackaged goods to confirm that packages contain the stated quantities. At the request of wine producers and major packers, this new legislation includes the option for production-line packers to use an internationally agreed system to demonstrate compliance with quantity statements. This system-the Average Quantity System (AQS)-has already been adopted in New Zealand and by many of Australia's major trading partners, including Japan, the European Union and the United States. AQS is now available to production-line packers to adopt voluntarily in instances where it is a more efficient means to demonstrate compliance and to align with international practice. The bill provides the heads of power for all the necessary elements in a national trade measurement system. As with the current trade measurement system, the bill provides for the technical and administrative detail required to operate the system to be specified in regulations. The bill creates the national trade measurement system by amendment of the National Measurement Act 1960. This act already defines technical infrastructure that the Commonwealth delivers to support trade measurement, such as maintaining Austrameasurement standards and approving the design of trade measuring instrumentsin- and the National Measurement Institute performs those functions. Therefore, it is a logical progression to expand the National Measurement Act to encompass a national trade measurement system and to designate of- the National Measurement Institute as the body responsible for administering the system. This government is serious about creating a seamless national economy unhampered by unnecessary duplications, overlaps and differences in regulation. In particular, we are determined to remove those inconsistencies that create unnecessarily complex and costly burdens on business. I am pleased to introduce a National Measurement Amendment Bill that brings these necessary reforms to Australia's trade measurement system. Debate (on motion by Mrs May) adjourned. NA TERMINATION BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Burke. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",32
13,Mr BURKE,DAIRY ADJUSTMENT LEVY,"Watson-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.06 am)I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Dairy Adjustment Levy Termination Bill 2008 will amend the Dairy Produce Act 1986 to finalise the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program. The adjustment program was established in 2000 by legislation supported by both sides of the parliament. To finalise the program the bill will allow the government to wind up the Dairy Adjustment Authority and the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund. The bill makes consequential amendments to remove references to the adjustment program in other acts and repeal of the acts that established the dairy adjustment levy. The bill clarifies that activities with the closure of the program can be considered a cost of the program and that surplus levy funds will be returned to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Importantly the bill will allow the government to terminate the levy, paid by consumers on fresh milk, in a manner that minimises over collection. In doing so, the passage of this bill will reduce the levies paid by Australian consumers. Termination of the dairy adjustment levy The levy has funded a number of adjustment measures to help farmers adjust to the removal of state and Commonwealth government price support measures. These measures included 32 quarterly payments to around 13,000 individual dairy businesses over eight years. The last scheduled quarterly payment was made in April 2008. Given the adjustment program has fulfilled its purpose, it is timely to terminate the 11c per litre consumer levy on fresh milk sales, which has funded the program. Revenue from the dairy adjustment levy is appropriated into a trust fund, which is administered according to statutory obligations, and a statutory funding agreement between Dairy Australia Ltd and the Commonwealth. Initial outlays related to the adjustment program exceeded income from the levy. The then government decided to use commercial loan arrangements rather than budget funding to meet these initial costs. While final payments have been made to farmers, the levy continues in order to pay off loan debts. Once the levy has generated enough revenue to bring the adjustment fund into balance, I can remove the levy under provisions in schedule 2 of the Dairy Produce Act 1986. associated Avoiding overcollection The dairy adjustment levy generates around $20 million per month and takes around 60 days to fully flow from consumers to the adjustment fund. The act requires the minister to give 28 days notice before removing the levy. But the legislation provides that notice can only be given against receipted revenue. Because of the notification process and the delay in collections being receipted, levy termination arrangements set out in the act currently would result in around $50 million being collected in excess of what is needed. It is not acceptable to continue to collect up to $50 million from consumers once the job for which it is collected is funded. The government is committed to terminating the levy as soon as is practical. The amendments will allow me to consider levies paid, but not yet receipted into the adjustment fund, when declaring a levy termination date. It will also allow me to reduce the levy termination notice period from 28 to seven days. The department will work with milk processors to ensure this happens and that the levy is removed in a seamless manner. The government expects the removal of the levy to be passed onto consumers. Any complaints or suggestion of anti-competitive conduct in relation to removal of the levy will be dealt with by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Wind-up of the Dairy Adjustment Authority The Dairy Adjustment Authority was established as a statutory authority under the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio in 2000. The authority was created to make eligibility determinations for payments to farmers under the two largest components of the program. At the peak of its operations in 2000, the authority had 83 contracted staff and a number of consultants. The authority now has four part-time staff. This downsizing reflects that the authority has substantially completed its functions and can now be wound up. I would like to acknowledge the work of the authority and its staff over the past eight years, particularly Dr John Drinan, who recently retired from his position as chief executive. Dr Drinan and the authority have worked closely with my department over the past 18 months to finalise the authority's operations. From 1 July 2008 the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry assumed the role of chief executive of the authority. The amendments will allow me to wind up the authority by ministerial declaration after it has completed its 2007-08 annual reporting requirements and transferred its records to the department. I expect to make this declaration by early next year. After the authority is wound up, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will assume the powers and functions of the authority. This will primarily include record keeping, reporting on its 2008-09 operations and finalising any outstanding payments to farmers. Closure of the adjustment fund The act provides that all revenue raised by the levy must be appropriated to the adjustment fund. If this mechanism remains in place, all levy collected surplus to the needs of the adjustment fund must be paid to Dairy Australia. Accordingly, this bill amends the act to allow the minister to stop the flow of levy funds from the Commonwealth to the adjustment fund after enough revenue has been collected and the deficit in the adjustment fund has been eliminated. The decision on exactly when to stop the appropriation of levy funds to the adjustment fund, held by Dairy Australia Ltd, will be made in consultation with Dairy Australia, having regard to the present debts and future liabilities of the adjustment fund. Amendments will also provide for the closure of the adjustment fund, for Dairy Australia Ltd to return surplus funds to the Commonwealth following the completion of the program and allow surplus levy funds to be transferred to the Commonwealth. The closure of the fund will signify the finalisation of the program. Other amendments Revenue generated by the levy can currently be spent on a number of legislated activities, including administration of the program. The bill will confirm that activities associConclusion ated with the wind-up of the authority are appropriately considered in the administration of the program. Wind-up activities will include transfer of hardcopy files to the department and staffing costs. I have mentioned that all scheduled quarterly adjustment payments have been made. There are a small number of outstanding payments due to administrative matters like incorrect bank details, and uncertain estate arrangements where a recipient is deceased. The bill includes a provision to ensure that any outstanding payments to farmers at the time the adjustment fund is closed can still be paid after the authority is wound up. The department will administer these payments. Until its wind-up, the Dairy Adjustment Authority will continue to finalise the small number of outstanding payments that exist. Consequential amendments and repeals A number of acts require amendment as a consequence of the Dairy Adjustment Levy Termination Bill 2008. Consequential amendments in this bill will remove references to the adjustment program and its various components. Affected legislation includes: - Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, - Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, and - Social Security Act 1991. Additionally, the bill allows for the repeal of the three acts that set the rate of the dairy adjustment levy, namely: - Dairy Adjustment Levy (Customs) Act 2000, - Dairy Adjustment Levy (Excise) Act 2000, and - Dairy Adjustment Levy (General) Act 2000. This bill will allow the government to finalise the Dairy Industry Adjustment Package. The package was established to help farmers adjust to the removal of state and Commonwealth government price support measures. The objectives of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Package have been realised and it is appropriate to both wrap up the administrative arrangements and terminate the consumer levy as soon as is practicable. I therefore urge the swift passage of this legislation through the parliament and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs May) adjourned. SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL NA LAWS-GENERAL LAW REFORM) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 September, on motion by Mr MCClelland: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Ms Ley moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) affirms its commitment to the central importance of the institution of marriage to Australian society; (2) nevertheless recognises that partners in same-sex relationships ought not to be discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality, and ought to be treated on a similar basis to partners in heterosexual de facto relationships; (3) recognises the right of children who live in same-sex households not to be discriminated against; and (4) notes that the Opposition has referred the to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for reporting by September 30 with a view to ensuring that, in removing discrimination against people in same-sex relationships: (a) the centrality of marriage is not devalued, whether by the use of inappropriate statutory language or otherwise; (b) there is no unintended recognition of same sex marriage, including through amendments to the Migration Act 1961; (c) the rights and status of children are properly protected; and (d) the rights and status of people in interdependent relationships other than same-sex relationships are recognised and properly protected”.",35
14,Mr BUTLER,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"At the conclusion of last night's proceedings I was saying that the focus in Australia has shifted in recent years to the treatment and the status of same-sex relationships. Much of the heat in this debate which we have heard from the other side, here and in the other place, comes in a reflected way from the rhetoric and the political fights fought in the United States over this issue, particularly over the heated question of whether or not any dealings with the question of same-sex relationships interfere with traditional notions of marriage. As we know, 26 states in the United States of America have now banned so-called ‘gay marriage' and there is a ballot initiative, set for 4 November, in California, where the Supreme Court recently upheld the constitutional right to equal treatment in this area. What members on the other side of the House who invoke that American heat within this debate fail to recognise, or at the very least admit, is that the circumstances of the debate in the United States of America are fundamentally different from those in Australia. That is because 39, I think, of the 50 bill states in America, including almost all of the big states, do not have a system of de facto or common-law marriage. That is a very important detail in this debate, because what the government is trying to do in the SameSex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-General Law Reform) Bill 2008-and tried to do in the first bill, which is stuck in a pointless Senate inquiry initiated by the opposition in the other place-is to equate the rights of members of same-sex relationships with the rights enjoyed by members of de facto heterosexual relationships in Australia. Our capacity to do that in Australia does not exist in the vast bulk of states in the United States of America-hence the heat in the debate in that place. While various states in Australia have tried a range of different approaches to this question-in some states involving registration and in others involving different criteria for recognition-discrimination against same-sex couples by virtue of the status and the treatment of their relationships endures in Australia. That that discrimination happens at the hand of the nation's government is, I would say, unforgivable. Consistent with our pre-election commitments, this side of the House is finally acting. You cannot say the same of the previous government. There was a glimmer of hope in about May 2004 when the then Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong, indicated in a press conference that he thought that samesex relationships should have equal rights in relation to reversionary benefits under superannuation. The glimmer of hope disappeared very quickly because, one week later, the then opposition, the Labor Party, moved a motion in the House that would turn that glimmer of hope into action and every single member of the then government voted against it-just as they had done when the member for Grayndler, now the Leader of the House, introduced a number of private members' bills over the previous decade to give same-sex couples equal rights to those enjoyed by de facto heterosexual couples. On those occasions, every single member of the now opposition, the then government, voted against the granting of those rights As so often happens in these areas, an inquiry by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission cast a very strong light on this issue. That commission engaged in a wide-ranging public consultation before handing down their 2007 report entitled Same-sex: same entitlements. There were some 680 public submissions received and the report runs to about 500 pagesfortunately, with a very useful executive summary at the beginning. That report details a range of examples of discrimination experienced every single day by 20,000 Australian couples and their children, often at the hands of the nation's government. The commission, in their report, identified 58 pieces of Commonwealth legislation that involved that discrimination. I would like to quote a couple of examples. In the area of Commonwealth workers compensation, the report says: … the same-sex partner of a worker covered by Comcare and other federal workers' compensation schemes is not entitled to lump sum workers' compensation death benefits. Nor is a same-sex partner taken into account when calculating the federal workers' compensation sums available to an incapacitated employee. In the area of tax benefits, discrimination occurs. In some of those areas of discrimination there is financial benefit and in others there is financial detriment. The report says: Same-sex couples will often pay more tax than opposite-sex couples because they are not eligible says: for a range of rebates and tax concessions. Further, the same-sex parents of children may miss out on tax benefits intended to help families. For example, same-sex couples are not entitled to the following tax concessions: - dependent spouse tax offset - tax offset for partner's parent - housekeeper tax offset - child-housekeeper tax offset zone tax offset for a partner - capital gains tax concessions when transferring property to a partner - fringe benefits tax exemptions for a partner. The social security benefits area is the area in which this thing swings both ways. Social security laws treat same-sex couples differently again to opposite-sex couples. For example, a same-sex partner is not entitled to the following benefits: partner allowance, bereavement benefits, widow allowance, concession card benefits and jailed partner's pension. The report indicates: Other times the differential treatment benefits a same-sex couple. This is because the law treats the couple as two single people, so a same-sex partner can access benefits normally available to singles. And the report importantly says: Several same-sex couples told the Inquiry that they would willingly trade the advantages in social security law for equal treatment under all federal laws. That has been the feedback that I have received as well. Although some same-sex couples do receive preferential treatment in social security, they would willingly trade that for the removal of other discriminations and the status afforded by the removal of other discriminations under federal laws. Finally, by way of example, I will mention aged care-an area often not thought about so much in relation to same-sex relationships. In relation to aged care, the report When people enter an aged care facility they erally have to pay certainly daily fees and bonds to fund their care and residence. The amount of those fees is calculated by applying assets and income tests. A same-sex couple is treated differently to an opposite-sex couple under these tests. In particular, the home of a same-sex couple is not exempted from the assets test as it is for an opposite-sex couple. As a result, a person in a same-sex couple will generally pay more for residential aged care than a person in an opposite-sex couple. It was an election commitment by the Labor Party that we would implement in full the recommendations of that HREOC report. We started the fulfilment of that election commitment with the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth LawsSuperannuation) Bill 2008-which, as I said earlier, is stuck in a pointless Senate inquiry initiated by the opposition. HREOC identified 58 further pieces of Commonwealth legislation, some of which I have just instanced, that discriminate against same-sex couples. An audit conducted by the Attorney-General, after being elected to govern in November, has identified a number more. Those 58 pieces plus the others identified in the audit are the subject of this bill. Areas covered within this bill include taxation, social security, health, aged care, veterans entitlements, workers compensation, immigration and many, many more. I will not go into the detail of all of those areas covered in the bill. I note that I have had the benefit of listening to the member for Ballarat's contribution to this, and I do not think I would do the bill justice after her contribution. I would just say in conclusion that this bill is long overdue. This is long unfinished business that has remained like a stain on the soul of Australia. We are supposed to be a country that fights against discrimination. I gen- am very proud to be a member of the government that has decided to take up this cudgel and do it. This package involves the most significant attack on discrimination against same-sex persons and same-sex couples since the decriminalisation of homosexuality, which started in my state in the 1970s and spread throughout the nation thereafter. I strongly commend the bill to the House.",39
15,Mr DANBY,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"Once again, I am pleased to rise in support of a bill brought into meet, as the member for Port Adelaide said, the Rudd government's commitment to abolish in Commonwealth law discrimination against gay men, lesbians, same-sex couples and their children. First we had the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-Superannuation) Bill 2008, which was introduced in May and which, as the excellent new member for Port Adelaide pointed out, is stuck in a useless Senate committee-for what purpose we do not know. I am sure the Greens and Senator Xenophon will not let it lie there forever. I am sure their constituents will be very critical of them if they do and if the Senate is involved in another power grab in trying to assert its importance by reviewing all of these laws. This law, as the member for Port Adelaide points out, is long overdue business that this House should have dealt with years ago. Last month we had the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Bill 2008, which I spoke on in this House, and now we have the SameSex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-General Law Reform) Bill 2008. And they said it could not be done. Many people were cynical that this promise would be kept. I must say that I never doubted it, because I know the Prime Minister and, above all, the attitude of the Labor Party and we made this commitment in the election campaign. Once again, on behalf of the many people of Melbourne Ports whose lives will be improved by these bills, I want to thank the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for bringing these bills forward in such a timely manner. This bill amends 68 pieces of Commonwealth legislation, spanning 19 different government departments. It seeks to remove from all of these pieces of legislation language which discriminates against same-sex couples and their children. The acts amended by this bill include such diverse and unlike acts as the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act, the Bankruptcy Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act, the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act, the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act and even the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act. So, whether you are a farmer, a bankrupt, a criminal, a member of the ADF, a seafarer, a pilot, a businessperson or even a former member or senator, you will know that, whatever other fate might befall you, you will now not be discriminated against because you have chosen to enter into a same-sex relationship, nor will your partner or your children or the children of your partLeader ner for whom you have responsibility. Some of these changes might seem trivial, and it might be the case that the language in some of the more obscure pieces of legislation affected by this bill has never actually been used to discriminate against any person or couple, but together these amendments send a powerful message to the Australian community that this parliament will no longer accept or tolerate discrimination against our fellow citizens on the grounds of the choices they make in their personal lives no matter in what area or under what pretext. But this bill is much more than symbolic in its importance. One of its most important practical benefits will be to prevent discrimination against children of same-sex couples. The member for Cowan pooh-poohed this bill because he said it affected so few people. But obviously if a small number of people are discriminated against, it is as bad as if a large number of people are discriminated against. The principle is the same: children should not be penalised because of life choices made by their parents or guardians. This bill will ensure that legislative provisions which extend rights and duties to children and relatives will also extend to children of same-sex relationships. As I said in my remarks on the Family Law Amendment Bill, I am pleased that the opposition has decided to support this package of bills. I have seen the comments made by the new Leader of the Opposition on this point. I commend him for his firmness in his opposition to homophobia, which I hope continues with the opposition supporting this bill. As I said last month, the reason we have had to wait all these years to see legislation of this kind is that, unfortunately, the former Prime Minister chose to play populist politics and pander to homophobia rather than accept the position now taken by the new of the Opposition. It is also true that in Victoria the Liberals made promises they did not keep, and it took a Labor government to bring in legislation of this kind. I know how important this bill is to members of the community in my electorate. I have received many passionate emails from people expressing their gratitude to the new Labor government for fulfilling an important promise that has been delayed for more than a decade. It is with great pleasure that I commend this bill to the House.",41
16,Mr MCCLELLAND,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate, many of which have been extremely thoughtful ones. I note that the member for Wentworth has previously expressed support for removing discrimination against samesex couples, and I accept his genuineness in that. Indeed, prior to the last election, he pledged to ‘continue the fight until justice is done'. Again, I accept the genuineness of that statement. In that context, I was a bit disappointed that the Liberal leader did not see this bill as being important enough for him to participate in the debate in the chamber, to support the fundamentals of the legislation and counter some of the more extreme views that some of his colleagues expressed during the debate. A measure of this debate is the fact that it has essentially been so well accepted in the community as something that should be done and should have been done some time ago. So we would certainly encourage the Leader of the Opposition to engage in the debate in the House and also within his party to ensure that there is no unnecessary delay in the passage of this legislation as a result of, as I have indicated, some rather extreme views. I note that the member for Farrer has stated that the opposition supports the underlying principles of the legislation-and we welcome that-but she then sought to qualify that support on the basis of concerns about drafting issues. She also sought to amend the bill during the second reading debate with a motion to insert matters which, quite frankly, are not relevant to this legislarelationships. tion. I will deal with these issues shortly, I would first like to highlight what appears to be an ongoing strategy the coalition has adopted. It professes to support the fundamentals of the legislation but then it highlights so-called drafting issues as an excuse for qualifying that support and questioning the principles of according equal treatment to same-sex couples. In contrast, I would like to pay tribute to the member for Kooyong, who spoke eloquently in support of the legislation and urged the Senate to pass the two same-sex bills expeditiously. The Leader of the Opposition should heed the member for Kooyong's final comments because they were the words of a true liberal. He said: Debates over wording and semantics have preoccupied us for far too long. As I informed the House two weeks ago, the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-General Law Reform) Bill 2008 introduces the second part of historic reforms to amend Commonwealth laws that discriminate on the basis of sexuality. The amendments contained in this bill are required because same-sex relationships are not accorded recognition in a wide range of Commonwealth laws. This prevents samesex couples from accessing many benefits which are available to opposite-sex couples. This differential in treatment also relieves them of a number of obligations which are commonly imposed on opposite-sex couples. I must say that the general community involved in advocacy of the needs for these changes accepts that there will be beneficiaries and there will be those who will suffer a detriment as a result of these reforms. But the principle is about removing discrimination. The amendments are also required to ensure that functional recognition is provided, most importantly, to the children of same-sex We should not lose sight of but that fact. The amendments will ensure that children of same-sex couples are not disadvantaged solely because of their family structure. It will also mean that legislative provisions which extend rights and duties to children and relatives will extend to children of same-sex relationships. The bill will amend some 68 Commonwealth laws. These are major reforms which will effectively remove same-sex discrimination from many areas of Commonwealth activity. The approach taken in the bill is to provide a consistent approach to recognising same-sex couples and their families. The bill will insert a new definition of ‘de facto partner' into the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. That new definition will apply to de facto relationships where parties to the relationship are of the same or opposite sex. The definition will also specifically and clearly recognise relationships that have been registered under prescribed state and territory relationship registration schemes. People will be taken to be de facto partners on the basis that they have satisfied the requirements for registration under those prescribed state or tory laws. Introducing equality will on occasions impose burdens and reduce certain benefits, as I have mentioned earlier. However, this is an essential step towards a fairer and more just society rather than one that tolerates grained discrimination. For example, samesex de facto couples will for the first time be recognised as ‘associates' for the purposes of many Commonwealth market regulation laws. In some circumstances, same-sex couples will be required to declare interests or modify their property holdings in order to comply with these regulatory arrangements. Similarly, same-sex couples will have their social security benefits reduced in some circumstances. This is because benefits paid to couples are often smaller than the amount which would be paid at the single rate to two people. But this is simply equal treatment to that of opposite-sex relationships. Another aspect of the reform package that I am particularly pleased to introduce is the removal of remnant marital status discrimination-discrimination which has somehow continued for 24 years after the Sex Discrimination Act made it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of the marital status of a person. It is surely time that such marital status discrimination was removed by reforming terms such as ‘step-children', ‘stepparents', ‘widows' and ‘widowers'. Currently, the ordinary meaning of these terms requires that a person be married. The reality is there would be many relationships nowadays for which those terms would be quite simply irrelevant or inappropriate. Last week I announced that the government would move an amendment to section 60H of the Family Law Act to implement a bipartisan recommendation from the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I would like to commend the terriexcellent work of the senators who were members of that committee and to congratulate them for a balanced and very useful report and, indeed, recommendation. In light of that proposed amendment, the government is considering what options are available to in- adopt this new approach as a basis for defining ‘children' and ‘parents' in other Commonwealth laws that are being amended to remove discrimination against same-sex couples and their families. I was surprised by claims made by some of the members opposite-for example, the claims made by the members for Mackellar and Fadden stand out-that the reforms in any way undermine the institution of marriage. I say with respect to those members that they are simply wrong. Indeed, it was perhaps disappointing that they went further to suggest that, far from removing discrimination against samesex couples, we should be discriminating in favour of married couples. It has long been recognised that such discrimination would not be consistent with a fair and egalitarian society. What this bill does is nothing more and nothing less than remove discrimination in circumstances where, I think, the vast majority of fair-minded Australians would say that for too long discrimination has occurred. Further, removing discrimination against same-sex couples, as I have mentioned, does not in any way, shape or form undermine marriage. Marriage is defined in the Marriage Act as being between a man and a woman. That provision was inserted into the act by an amendment supported by both sides of the parliament. It is the view of the parliament and it will remain the law. The Rudd government's policy on marriage is very clear and its policy reflects the widely held view in the community that is referred to in that legislation. However, the opposition has claimed that amendments to the Migration Act, for instance, do undermine marriage. So let me just allay that concern. The amendments to the Migration Act do not recognise same-sex marriages whether entered into overseas or otherwise. This is made clear by a new paragraph 5F(2)(b) which requires, for the purposes of the Migration Act, that a married relationship is between a ‘husband and wife to the exclusion of all others'. The ordinary meaning of ‘husband' and ‘wife' requires the marriage to be between people of opposite sex. In addition, section 88EA of the Marriage Act expressly forbids the recognition of same-sex marriages in Australia. That provision applies to the recognition of marriages for the purposes of the Migration Act. That section is unaffected by these amendments. The irony is that the concerns raised by the opposition centre on a section of the Marriage Act which was in fact inserted into the legislation in 2004 by the then coalition government! This bill includes a provision, to be inserted into the Acts Interpretation Act, which clarifies that a de facto relationship can exist even if one person in the relationship is legally married to another person in a registered relationship with another person or in a de facto relationship. I understand from the member for Mackellar that she believes this is in some way an endorsement of polygamous marriages. I have addressed this issue previously in the House. But, again for the record, the Rudd government has made clear that it does not support polygamous marriages. Indeed, they are illegal under state and territory legislation. That is the case and it is undisturbed by this legislation. However, obviously there are cases that recognise that it is possible to live in a de facto relationship with a person while still legally married to another person. The legal recognition of such relationships is necessary to ensure that rights are not unjustly denied to a de facto partner. In determining whether or not one or more de facto relationships exist, the administrator will take into account all relevant circumstances, which could include the nature and extent of common residence and the duration of the relationship. In other words, if the views of some of those opposite were accepted, it would mean that a person in a de facto relationship would potentially be deprived of remedy under the measures contained in this legislation because the party to their now defunct but still extant marriage was reluctant or in some way obstructing the dissolution of that marriage. The opposition has called for recognition of interdependent relationships. It is true that this bill does not recognise interdependent relationships. As I said in the second reading speech, recognising interdependent relationships raises many complex issues. These are viable issues that it is appropriate for the parliament to consider. It is considering them in a broader inquiry that is taking place. I highlight a few of the complexities involved in recognising interdependent relationships in this legislation. They are difficult to define. There is a lack of reliable data on the number of relationships, dependency and interdependency are a matter of degree and determining where to draw the line would be difficult, and recognising interdependent relationships may not be appropriate in all situations. For example, in the social security or pension contexts it could mean, for reasons that I have set out, that two sisters who lived together would be treated as a couple and receive a lower amount in pension because of their interdependent relationship. While the position of some interdependent relationships such as carers may need to be closely considered by the government, this bill, which seeks to remove discrimination against same-sex couples and their families, is not the vehicle to address those concerns. One of the most important aspects of this legislation is the removal of discrimination against the children of same-sex couples. I am sure all members accept that children have essentially no say in the relationship that is structured or entered ents. Same-sex: same entitlements, the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, identified that discrimination can clearly exist against children. For instance, same-sex couples and their families are denied basic financial and work related entitlements in a wide range of areas. They disadvantage the members of the same-sex couple, and it is self-evident that this may well disadvantage the child in the family. For example, same-sex couples have to spend more money on medical expenses than opposite-sex couples to take advantage of the Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the relevant safety nets. Another example of such disadvantage is the operation of the Life Insurance Act 1995. Under that act a life insurance company can pay out a policy to an insured person's child without going through probate when the money payable under a policy is below a certain amount. Probate, as we are aware, can be a time-consuming and expensive process. However, there is no specific definition of who qualifies as a person's child. This means that a child of a same-sex co-father or lesbian co-mother may have to lodge a claim in probate to obtain the entitlement. As I have mentioned, this may well incur additional, potentially significant delay and cost. Removing discriminatory laws may well impact upon the welfare-including the financial welfare-of the children of same-sex relationships. The issue from the government's perspective is not about encouraging same-sex parenting but about removing discrimination. The bill does not create relationships that do not already exist. The reforms in the bill recognise real family situations. Recognition is necessary if we as a community are to remove discrimination against same-sex families and, importantly, their children. Further, the HREOC report Same-sex: same entitleinto by their parments states: Families headed by same-sex couples already exist in our community. And with the advent of assisted reproductive technology (ART), more and more lesbian and gay couples are having children. The Australian Bureau of Statistics data from the 2006 national census indicates there were approximately 25,000 same-sex couples residing together in Australia-less than one per cent of all couples residing togetherand 4,400 children of same-sex relationships. Again, while this legislation will in no way result in the federal legislature entering into the field of assisted reproductive technology, it is a reality that it occurs in various states and territories around Australia, and the failure to recognise that reality has the real potential-not only potential but actuality-to cause disadvantage. It has given me great pleasure to introduce this bill and the related Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-Superannuation) Bill 2008. They have honoured the Rudd government's election commitment to remove discrimination against same-sex couples and implement the recommendation of the inquiry of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Most importantly, the legislation removes discrimination against a group of fellow Australians-and their children-who have been discriminated against for far too long. In removing this discrimination, we deepen the respect in Australia for the human rights of all Australian citizens.

18,Dr STONE,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008. I am very pleased to be doing so as the new shadow minister for immigration and citizenship. The coalition welcomes the bill as a sensible measure to address problems that can arise with the notification requirements under the Migration Act 1958. The content of communications between the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and their clients may be to do with visa applications or the clients' future legal status, so these communications are of critical importance. Often these notices require a response or particular action within a tightly specified time frame. Unfortunately, there have been cases in the past where a very small deviation from the prescribed process has given a client recourse to challenge the legality of the notice itself, even though the communication was received and perfectly understood. Some clients have been able to delay the resolution of their cases by mounting court challenges based on a minor technical error in the notification. There have been a series of cases over the last few years when the courts have determined that small technical defects in notifications amounted to the client not, in effect, being officially and appropriately notified. The then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Hon. Kevin Andrews, described these notification issues as the ‘legal process gone mad'. This bill will ensure that clients continue to be treated with fairness and that standard procedures will be followed, but with less opportunity to use a wrong postcode or some other small hitch as an excuse to rule the communication as not being received or not requiring the specified response-that is, of course, if the communication has in fact been delivered to the client in the proper time frame. Put simply, this bill amends the Migration Act 1958 by introducing changes that will clarify the way in which the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal can properly notify clients of decisions. This legislation will, at the same time, ensure that the notification system remains a fair and reasonable process for all of the parties involved. The provisions of the bill relate to the notification of minors and the deemed time of notification. The bill provides that where the minister or tribunal forms a reasonable belief that an individual has care and responsibility for a minor the minister or tribunal may communicate with that person instead of the minor to notify the individual of a decision about the minor. This is a sensible measure that will ensure a more appropriate handling of applications when an underage person is not part of a combined application, especially when he or she is too young to understand what the notification is about. Secondly, the bill provides that the deemed time of application provisions will operate despite non-compliance with the procedural requirement for giving a document to an individual, where the individual has actually received the document. Where the individual is able to show that they received the document at a later date, that later date be taken as the date of receipt. As has already been said, the courts currently require a strict and inflexible compliance with the statutory notification procedures and this has led to delays and costly legal proceedings despite the fact that the client may have ceived the notice in a timely manner. This legislation should restore more common sense and give a greater degree of certainty to the notification procedures. ongoing monitoring, there will no doubt be further evolution of these processes cedures to ensure they are the most efficient, effective and just and cannot be exploited as a stalling opportunity. I am pleased that this government has realised that the bill as originally presented in the Senate needs an amendment in this House to eliminate what could have caused new complications and the potential for more inefficiency and time wasting. The original bill as introduced contained rather nebulous provision that ‘substantial compliance' with the required contents of a notification document was sufficient unless the visa applicant or other applicant was to show the error or omission in the document had caused them ‘substantial prejudice'. Proving what constituted ‘substantial' compliance or prejudice would have been complicated and, of course, highly subjective. I am pleased that the government has recognised that, rather than tightening interhave pretations or closing loopholes, this provision may have caused us more opportunities for unintended consequences. I am therefore pleased to support the further amendment. While this is a technical bill which does not fundamentally change Australian immigration policy, it does refer to the business of effectively administering appeals and assuring compliance with our immigration policy. It is therefore a significant and important matter. There are some 46,000 visitors who will are currently overstayers in our country. There are another 2,000 or so onshore protection visa applicants waiting to be processed. Clearly our systems of application processing must be transparent, efficient, just and humane. The Howard government left a re- legacy of immigration law, regulation and practice which has delivered one of the best controlled and managed immigration programs in the world, where the government With decides who comes to our country, who is most in need and who is best served by our and pro- ongoing protection. The number of people now arriving on our shores illegally has decreased substantially as a result of the strong but fair policies that the Howard government implemented. This has meant that more of the world's most needy refugees, including those who have been waiting for years in refugee camps, are given the opportunity to settle here under our refugee or humanitarian programs. I am a pleased to see the new Labor government choosing to continue the Howard policies, given they have been very successful in reducing the number setting sail in leaky boats, able often exploited by unscrupulous operators. We will never know how many boats sank on their voyages as the people smugglers tried to slip through the back door to Australia. We need to ensure that places on our humanitarian program go to those with the most urgent need, rather than to those who the best contacts and capacity to pay people smugglers or to pay for air tickets to Australia. Immigration is, and will continue to be, both a social and economic imperative for Australia. To borrow a phrase from the former Prime Minister, ‘I believe we all recognise that the things that unite us as Australians are much greater than the things that divide us,' and we are a great nation as a result of generations and waves of migrants coming to our shores, working hard and embracing our great Australian values and traditions. As the member for the northern Victorian seat of Murray, the most ethnically diverse electorate in regional Australia, I know first hand the contribution that migrants have made to the social and economic fabric of our communities. As the shadow minister I look forward to working with the government to ensure that migrants to Australia have the support they need and that, in due course, different categories can apply to become citizens. Citizenship is a privilege, not a right, but am concerned that nearly a million people who are eligible for citizenship have not yet chosen to take this step. Many are older settlers from the United Kingdom, who arrived at a time when Australia's citizenship laws and associated privileges, like voting, were different. I encourage the 900,000 settlers who contribute to and enjoy the freedoms and opportunities of our great country to take the final step to become Australian citizens. The Howard government wanted to ensure that English language understanding and a knowledge and acceptance of the values, rights and obligations of Australian citizenship were understood by those who stepped up to take an oath of allegiance to our country. I am pleased this new government has embraced the new citizenship testing and record numbers are now stepping forward. This test will, no doubt, evolve over time to become ever more effective in truly testing the new arrivals' knowledge of our country and our first language. I commend this bill to the House. It has the strong support of the coalition.",48
19,Mr BIDGOOD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak to the Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008. It amends the Migration Act to effect three broad policy initiatives of this government. The first is to provide that actual notification will apply if the deemed notification provisions cannot operate. The second is to provide that where the minister, or the relevant appeal tribunal, reasonably suspects that a person has care and responsibility for a minor, who is defined as someone under 18 years of age, then notification of that person equates to notification of the minor, except where an authorised recipient has been validly appointed. The third is to provide that substantial compliance with the required contents of a notification document is sufficient. Notification as proposed in the bill repreI sents a set of natural justice obligations under the Migration Act 1958 to notify applicants of, amongst other things, visa refusal and cancellation decisions and to provide information on any review rights available as a result of these decisions. The purpose of these amendments is to achieve a notification regime that is simpler, provides greater clarity and consistency and is sufficiently flexible to respond to individual circumstances. These amendments will reduce complexity and deliver more consistent, fair and reasonable outcomes to clients. At the tribunal level, the obligations under the act relate to notifying merits review applicants of, amongst other things, the tribunal decisions. The Commonwealth Ombudsman, in his report Department of Immigration and Citizenship: notification of decisions and review rights for unsuccessful visa applications of December 2007, drew attention to the difficulties with the notification provisions and their potential to result in the unlawful detention of clients. This bill seeks to clarify some of these interpretations and recommendations by the Ombudsman. The courts have generally adopted an extremely strict interpretation of the notification provisions and require absolute compliance with these provisions. The courts' strict interpretation of the notification provisions diverts enormous departmental resources. Highly technical decisions by the courts on notification have undermined the administration of the migration system, thus creating situations where action taken in good faith by departmental officers in respect of a client is actually unlawful as the client was not properly notified of a departmental decision. This bill is the first step in seeking to these issues. A broader series of measures are being considered by the government. The changes that are proposed in the bill will provide a very fair and reasonable outcome to clients in that if they receive a letter from department or tribunals they can rely on it and act on it. The amendments do not seek to disadvantage clients in any way; rather, they provide clarity and certainty. These changes should result in fewer cases going to court, which should also result in reduced costs to the taxpayer. One thing that this government is concerned about is reducing costs to the taxpayer. Having an efficient administration and tribunal system and having this clarity help reduce costs to the taxpayer. That can only be a good thing. The act and the migration regulations of 1994-the regulations-contain numerous provisions dealing with the requirements for notification in specific circumstances. These cover the content of the notice, who must be notified, where and by what method. These provisions have created confusion for departmental officers and fertile ground for the courts to find defects in notification. Technical errors can also be relied upon by those clients seeking to delay resolution of their case. Overall, this is a technical cleaning up of various parts of the Migration Act, and it is good to hear that it is something that is welcomed by the other side. This bill will help people have a pleasant experience as they go through their citizenship applications and their migration experience. As we all know, Australia is a multicultural society and has a rich tapestry of cultures. We are all the better for it. The least that this government can do is make the experience of migration as pleasant, efficient and clear as possible. Therefore, I recommend this bill to the House.",50
20,Mr NEUMANN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in favour of the Migration rectify Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008. This bill is an amending piece of legislation designed to overcome technical obstacles in respect of notification. What does that mean? I will not bore the House with the the names of all the various judicial decisions but I will refer to a number of judgements and what was said, and I will give a precis of some of the outcomes in that regard, just to show what the problem is that currently needs to be overcome. These judicial decisions concern the way in which the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and certain tribunals deal with what they call their ‘clients' in respect of visa applications and visa cancellations. The Migration Act 1958 and the Migration Regulations (Amendment) 1984 set out the provisions for how the department, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal deal with clients in the circumstances. I have had a look at the regulations, the act and the various case law. They specify what must happen with respect to notification and the contents of notification, the methods by which notification is affected and the deemed time of notification and its application. This information can be found in detail in the regulations and in the act. It is quite a complex piece of legislation when you have a look at it-it is a wonder that any individual can actually understand it. The actual notification and the service provisions can be found in the legislation in sections 379A, 379B and 379AA, so we are talking about legislation that is starting to look like the Income Tax Assessment Act-it is quite complex and quite long. The service requirements are prescriptive and they are technical. Any lawyer who practices in civil litigation understands that service provides a great possibility for disputation; it is pregnant with possibilities. As a lawyer who practised in the area of civil litigation and personal injuries, crime-in my early days-and family law, I always looked closely when service was being affected. How was the method of service being affected? Did it need to be ordinary service, service by post, special service or service to the person personally-actually delivered to their hand? What about a corporate entity? Do you serve the registered office? Where is the registered office? Is service upon the lawyer for the party effective service? All these things challenge litigants, they challenge lawyers who practise in these areas and they are ripe with the possibility for dispute. In the Federal Magistrates Court and the Family Court, when service has been effected upon someone and they actually front up to the court itself, they can hardly dispute that they have not been served, because how or why are they there otherwise? If they require an adjournment, it is quite common for courts and tribunals in the federal area to grant adjournments in the circumstances if the person feels that they have not been given enough notice. But, really, the technical difficulties in this piece of legislation and in the regulations are quite extraordinary and they frustrate the whole integrity of the process. They are really an attack on the kind of litigation process that Australians expect will happen-that is, one which will deal with them consistently, deal with them fairly and deal with them in a manner which allows the process to be conducted expeditiously. The primary purpose of this bill is to clarify and provide greater certainty in terms of the notification procedures. That was said by the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, Laurie Ferguson, in his second reading speech, and I agree with what he has to say. He said in that speech that the service provisions provide ‘fertile ground for the courts to find notification defects'. To rectify these issues, this bill seeks to clarify and improve the way that the department, the various tribunals and other bodies communicate on visa applications. Specifically, it will amend the Migration Act in three broad policy areas. The first is to provide that actual notification will apply if the deemed notification provisions cannot operate. That is fair in the circumstances. The second is to provide that where the minister or the relevant appeal tribunal reasonably suspects that a person has care and responsibility for a minor-in Queensland, where I come from, that is someone who is under the age of 18-then notification of that person equates to notification of the minor, except where an authorised recipient has been validly appointed. The third area is to provide that substantial compliance with the required contents of a notification document is sufficient. I will not deal with the third area, because it has been flagged with me that the government may be sponsoring amendments to this area and there is some issue in relation to it, so I will deal with the first two areas. Can I say at the outset that this bill is not about to disadvantage or prejudice anyone in any way at all. It is all about certainty, clarity and specificity. It is fair and reasonable to ensure that clients are there and that, if they are present and they receive a letter from the department or the tribunal, they can act upon it and rely upon it. The bill is necessary to fix technical errors. For instance, if a minister or the tribunal can communicate with a minor's carer instead of the minor, then, under the changes, it will be lawful for the carer to respond on behalf of the minor. That seems sensible in the circumstances. The bill also makes it very clear that, where a person has actually received a document, they are served. It overcomes the procedural difficulties in those circumstances. The difficulties with respect to the notification provisions had the potential to, and did, result in significant cost to the Commonwealth government. All litigation can be expensive: expensive to the litigant, expensive to the Commonwealth and, in the circumstances, it is necessary to overcome these problems. This was commented upon by the Commonwealth Ombudsman in his report Notification of decisions and review rights for unsuccessful visa applicants in December 2007. As a former lawyer, I believe that due process is crucial. The right to be heard and to face whatever allegations may be confronting you is crucial. It is what we call ‘natural justice'. It is integral of any immigration process system. Correct notification is required to trigger legal rights and obligations and to ensure that consequences for action can be lawfully followed. The current provisions in the legislation stipulate that notification must occur in a certain way, it must contain certain information and it must be given to a specific person at a specific address in order for legal consequences to flow. Unfortunately, our courts, specifically the Federal Court, have adopted an overly strict interpretation of the notification provisions, irrespective of whether the applicant was actually notified, and I think, sadly and regrettably, it has frustrated the intention of the parliament. Justice Lander, in a 2008 decision, made this very clear. He said: In my opinion, the provisions of section 422B, which make the content of Division 4A and Division 7A, together with sections 416, 437 and 438, a complete code for the discharge of the Tribunal's obligations in relation to the natural justice hearing rule, suggests that Parliament intended that there be strict adherence to each of the procedural steps leading up to the hearing. Each of the procedural steps is imperative and must be complied with in the manner described in the Act. It is interesting, because the decision was a unanimous decision and it held that the actual notification of a hearing invitation, evidenced in that case by the applicant's attendance at the hearing, was not sufficient to override a failure to strictly comply with every part of the notification requirements in the act. In other words, if the actual applicant turned up to the court, service had not been effected. It is a legal nonsense. It is simply stupid for that provision to remain. In that case, all the applicants appeared at the hearing and a number of them had the chance to present their evidence. So none of the applicants were prejudiced by the failure to strictly comply with the relevant notification to the integrity requirements. This literalistic interpretation has led to numerous judgements from the courts which have found that the department and the tribunals have not correctly provided notification of the circumstances. The amendments in this bill relate to how the department and the tribunals communicate with their clients. I hope the onus will shift onto the applicant, to overcome excessive litigation. I do not think anyone in this House wants to see multitudinous cases in this area. It can be very difficult when people talk about migration, and there would be many of us who have had people in our offices talking about the challenges of the migration system. Just last Saturday afternoon I had someone in my office talking about these issues. The amendments provide that the tribunals are deemed to have validly given notification, in a document, to an authorised recipient even if the document, the envelope containing the document or any accompanying material contains an error or omission that is minor or insignificant, unless the applicant can show that the error or omission substantially prejudices them. That amendment is necessary because of a 2002 decision which found that an envelope containing a notification letter had to be addressed to the noncitizen's authorised recipient, not the noncitizen care of the authorised recipient. What a nonsense. What a silly thing to decide. It is hardly believable that a court would make a decision like this. That decision affected potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of cases. Another decision in 2008 arose from the inclusion of an incorrect postcode on two letters sent to a visa applicant by the tribunal, which were received and acted on him. Fortunately, in that case the tribunal affirmed the decision and refused the visa protection. The outcome may, however, be less certain and more precarious in other cases. The purpose of these amendments is to overcome this silliness in the circumstances. The amendments are about ensuring that individuals do not experience prejudice, that individuals are not disadvantaged in any way and that the court process can continue and go forward. It is not about denials of natural justice. It is about making the whole system simpler. It is about greater consistency, it is about greater integrity, it is about greater clarity, it is about greater flexibility and about the streamlining of notification procedures. It is about consistency and it is about reducing complexity. As someone who has practised for nearly a quarter of a century in the legal system, I think anything that achieves that outcome is not only good for the nation but good for the clients I used to have, good for the people in my electorate, good for the taxpayers of Australia, good for our country and good for the future integrity of our migration system. I commend the bill to the House.",51
21,Mr DREYFUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008. This is a bill which amends the Migration Act 1958 to provide that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal will no longer have to completely strictly comply with the legislation's notification requirements. The notification requirements of this act deal with how the department and the tribunals communicate with people who are affected by the immigration regime. The act contains a number of detailed provisions specifying how the department and the tribunals can, and in some circumstances must, communicate with visa applicants and people whose visas have been cancelled. An example can be seen in section 66 of the Migration Act, which provides that the department must notify an applicant of a decision to refuse a visa in a prescribed way. The notification not only is required to contain specific information, such as the criterion or the provision of the act or the regulations that was not satisfied, but also must tell the applicant if the applicant has a right to have the decision reviewed by the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Administrative Review Tribunal it is and also must tell the applicant when and where the application for review needs to be lodged and similar formal information of that nature. If one goes to other provisions of the act-section 494B, section 379A, section 441A-one can read other prescriptions of methods that are to be used in communicating with applicants, such as directions as to whether it can be by post or fax or other similar formal requirements. The formal requirements for the way in which the department and the tribunals are to communicate with those affected by the immigration regime in turn lead to other provisions of the act, because effective notification under section 66 will trigger section 494C of the Migration Act, and that provides for a deemed receipt of a document by an applicant within a specified time. That has further consequences under the immigration regime. For example, if a document was sent within three working days of the date of the document to an address in Australia, the present provisions of the Migration Act provide that the applicant is deemed to have received it within seven working days after the date of the document. That in turn will have the consequence that an applicant wishing to have an adverse primary decision independently reviewed must initiate the review process within the time stipulated in the notification, and that is normally 21 days. Failure to ate the review process within the prescribed time will result in forfeiting the right of view. All systems for applications to government departments and processing of those applications by government departments and tribunals necessarily need to have formal processes and necessarily require time limits to be specified. The requirements for forms and the requirements for notification in all cases will need to be set out in legislation. What we have in the Migration Act is a particularly complex set of notification procedures, and those notification procedures have been found wanting, I think it is fair to say, in that a series of court decisions over the last several years has demonstrated a degree of unworkability of these notification procedures. Certainly, as has been examined at some length by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has been found wanting in the way in which it has been administering these notification procedures. The Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John MCMillan, produced two very thorough and thoughtful reports over the course of last year that look at the notification procedures used by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship under the Migration Act. The first of those reports, released in June 2007, is entitled Report into referred immigration cases: notification issues, and the second report, released in December 2007, is entitled Notification of decisions and review rights for unsuccessful visa applications. What Professor MCMillan found and reported on in these two reports was a range of deficiencies in the way in which the department had responded to difficulties identified by the Federal Court of Australia, the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia and the full Federal Court of Australia in a whole range of decisions, but notably the decision in Srey. initiIt is worth reading some of the comments that were made by Professor John MCMillan rein those reports. In the June 2007 report, he said: The legislative and policy framework controlling the notification of decisions is comprehensive and provides clear guidance to DIAC staff. However, the investigation of the individual cases in this report highlighted some recurring problems in the way that DIAC officers implemented the legislative and policy requirements. These problems appear to stem from poor internal administrative processes, a lack of understanding by some DIAC officers of the notification requirements imposed by the legislation and a failure by officers to identify notification deficiencies, and their implications, in a timely manner. The Commonwealth Ombudsman made similar comments in his later report of December 2007, at the conclusion of his investigation into notification requirements. He said: The investigation found that DIAC's overall management of notification of adverse decisions is not coordinated or consistent. There was significant variation in the quality of information presented in notification letters, many of which fell considerably short of best practice standards. In some instances, this limited a visa applicant's ability to seek review or successfully reapply. In other instances, the information was overly complex, confusing and poorly presented. The Commonwealth Ombudsman was, naturally enough, focusing on administrative processes used within the department, but he also commented on possible deficiencies in the legislation itself. It is worth quoting from his June 2007 report in that regard. He said: As a general observation, the prescriptive nature of the notification regime is a double-edged sword. Strict compliance by DIAC with the legislation will be enough to ensure legally effective notification, even if the letter remains unread lost in the post. Conversely, a small deviation from the requirements of the legislation can render the notice legally ineffective, even though the notice was received and read. The deficiencies that the Commonwealth Ombudsman identified in those two reports were at an administrative level and are matters that the department is now, I think I am able to say, attending to. It is certainly something that the new Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in the Rudd Labor government, Senator Evans, has given priority to. It is reflective of the priority being given to this kind of administrative matter that the minister has initiated the amendments that are contained in the bill before the House today. These amendments will assist in ensuring that, rather than the application of the completely strict letter of the law having dire consequences for applicants for visas or meaning that people whose applications have been refused lose their appeal rights, attention is given to the actual notification of those persons-that is, attention is being paid to the substance or the intention of these types of provisions, which are, after all, only facilitative provisions. These provisions are designed to ensure that people have drawn to their attention, through the processes of the department and the tribunals, matters which need to be drawn to their attention. Just before going to the particular provisions contained in this bill, I want to comment on the speech on the second reading of this bill that was given by the member for Murray a short time ago. I was sorry to hear her wrongly claiming that the Rudd Labor government had continued the policies of the Howard government in relation to immigration. Indeed, I am sorry to hear any continuing defence of what I regard as the brutal immigration regime of the former government. The member for Murray has clearly not been paying attention to the recent anor is nouncements by the minister for immigration, because they make it entirely clear that the Rudd Labor government have put the immigration regime of the former government behind us. The Rudd Labor government are not going to continue with the imprisoning of children of those who are seeking refuge. We are no longer going to remove people who are seeking refuge to the middle of the Pacific at huge cost to this nation-and that is before one even considers the emotional and physical cost to the people concerned. We are going to use a just and humane approach to immigration matters and to matters concerning refugees henceforth. The Rudd Labor government have already shown this. Australia is going to have an immigration policy and a refugee policy that the nation can be proud of, rather than the immigration policy that we were all ashamed of under the regime of the former government. The approach of the former government to immigration questions has been put behind us, whatever the member for Murray might choose to imagine. The particular provisions of this bill are directed at a series of court decisions, as I said earlier. They are: Srey v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, a 2003 decision of the Federal Court of Australia; Chand v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, a 2000 decision of the Federal Court of Australia; Vean of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, a 2003 decision of the full Federal Court; Khan v Minister for Immigration & Anor, a 2007 decision of the Federal Magistrates Court; Han v Minister for Immigration & Anor, another 2007 decision of the Federal Magistrates Court; and Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, a 2008 decision of the Federal Court. What you see in these decisions of the full Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court are decisions which are directed to the very tight and technical nature of the notification provisions as they presently stand in the Migration Act and are directed at a couple of aspects of those rather tightly worded provisions that this bill is directed to. First all, the bill before the House will provide that actual notification will apply if the deemed notification provisions cannot operate. That of course is an entirely sensible provision in the circumstances. Provisions of this nature should be concerned with actually notifying the people who need to be notified. The second provision in the bill before the House deals with the need to notify minors. It provides for the minister and the relevant appeal tribunals, where any of them reasonably suspect that a particular person has care and responsibility for a minor, to notify that person. A minor is defined as someone under the age of 18 years. Notification of that person having care and responsibility for the minor will equate to notification of the minor, except where an authorised recipient of notification has been validly appointed. These are sensible provisions. They demonstrate that the government is attending to making the immigration regime of this country more workable. Lest anyone be in any doubt about the need to pay attention to the provisions of the act, one should only consider the volume of applications that these provisions potentially can apply to. We can read in the 2006-07 annual report of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship that the department processed some 12,000 visa applications every day, and in that year 3,678 applications and appeals to the courts were lodged against departmental or tribunal decisions compared to 3,893 in 2005-06. This bill introduces provisions that are going to assist in the processing of that very large number of visa applications and will ensure that the processing of applications and appeals to the courts are dealt with in a way that is practical and in a way that pays attention to what is really occurring in terms of notification rather than getting lost in some forest of technicality-to use the words of of a well-known playwright: to become lost in the ‘thickets of the law'. Instead, we need to pay attention to practical steps. The amendments in this bill are initial steps, the minister has said, in a broader series of measures that are being contemplated by this government in order to ensure the workability of the immigration regime. They are commendable measures and I commend the bill to the House.",54
22,Mr ZAPPIA,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I too rise to speak in support of the Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008, which I believe is an important step in the necessary and overdue reform of both Australia's migration policies and the administration of those policies. I will just comment briefly on comments made by the member for Isaacs, who I believe spoke very well in support of the need for these changes, but, more importantly, spoke as someone with a great deal of experience as a legal practitioner and a Queen's Counsel. It was reassuring to hear his comments in support of the legal changes that are required, as he put it, in order to bring about a sensible come in the application of our laws. I guess few people would know the court system better than the member for Isaacs. To get his endorsement and support for this bill, I think, says a lot for it. As a country that was settled by Europeans just 220 years ago and that subsequently has become home for people from across the world, Australia's migration policies have over the years been the subject of many public debates and policy changes. I have no doubt that we will see more of those changes in the future, as each generation adapts or responds to the circumstances of the era. I want to focus my comments on the present migration policies and practices, much of which are largely a product of the Howard government era. Again, can I endorse the comments of the member for Isaacs in his reflection on those policies, because it is my view, and a view that I believe is shared very widely across the community, that the policies adopted by the Howard government were inhumane, unjust and in urgent need of review. In speaking on this bill, I particularly want to draw on my observations and my experience as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration-a committee I have been a member of since being elected to this place. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you may well know, the committee has been inquiring into issues relating to detention centres and to the detention of people. On that matter, I acknowledge and commend the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, for the welcome policies relating to detention which he outlined on 29 July. Under the new policies, detention in immigration detention centres is only to be used as a last resort and for the shortest period practicable. Mandatory detention will remain in the following situations: for all unauthorised arrivals, for the management of out- health, identity and security risks to the community; for unlawful noncitizens who present unacceptable risks to the community; and for unlawful noncitizens who have repeatedly refused to comply with their visa conditions. I believe that most people in our community would agree that they are reasonable circumstances under which a person ought to be detained and that, bearing in mind that national security is of paramount importance to the government, those are reasonable conditions that ought to be applied in order to ensure national security. As I said at the outset, Australia's migration policies are in need of many overdue reforms, and this bill is an important step in that process. Certainly there is more to be done, but this is clearly a beginning and a very important step. As other speakers have said, the bill amends the Migration Act 1958 so as to clarify the way in which the Department of Immigration and Citizenship communicates with its clients. As the member for Reid, the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural and Settlement Services, said in introducing this bill to the House: There have been a series of cases over the past several years where the courts have identified technical defects in notification that have created large legacy case loads which have proved difficult, if not impossible, to address through litigation or administrative reforms. This bill amends the act to increase the certainty in the notification regime while still balancing that with the rights of noncitizens. The new notification regime is simpler, provides greater clarity and consistency and is sufficiently flexible to respond to individual circumstances. It also clarifies issues relating to notification for persons under the age of 18 years-and, again, the member for Isaacs made reference to that in his address. The member for Isaacs also referred to the Ombudsman's report, which I too want to refer to. The Ombudsman, in his report Notification of decisions and review rights for unsuccessful visa applicants of December 2007, drew attention to the difficulties with the notification provisions and the potential to result in the unlawful detention of clients. Clarification of the notification process will ultimately result in a reduction in public costs associated with detention, less time in detention and less trauma for those noncitizens and their families. From the public cost perspective, it will reduce the legal costs associated with technical appeals based on the notification process. Again, other speakers have given examples of where this has occurred. Furthermore, it will reduce the time nonAustralians are held in detention, which costs the Australian people in excess of $100 per day for each detainee. In 2006-07, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship raised debts of $28.9 million for the detention of unlawful noncitizens. The highest debt raised during that period was over $340,000 for one family. In one case reported to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in the course of the inquiry, the cost was estimated at $512,000 for one person over a nine-year period. Even if these costs are not recovered, for those people who are ultimately granted permanent residency in this country, they have a debt hanging over their heads forever more, which in turn continues to cause stress and trauma to them. The total cost of operating Australia's immigration detention system in 2006-07 was about $220 million. It is not a cheap exercise. And that amount certainly does not include the cost of the construction of these centres; it is simply the ongoing operational cost. I would just make some additional comments in relation to costs. On estimates, we have in Australia at the moment about 50,000 people who are in this country unlawfully. For many of those people, at some point in time a notice of some kind will be issued to them. The issuing of those notices, if it is not clarified and if it is not simplified, will cause many, many more occasions where cases are taken to the court simply on the basis of the service of those notices. Right now there are about 1,000 cases before the courts-before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, before the Federal Magistrates Court and before the High Court. My understanding is that it costs Australian taxpayers about $10 million a year just to attend the court proceedings and pay for the costs associated with those court proceedings. If we can simplify all of these processes, there will be a benefit to the Australian people and there will be a benefit to the detainees, who are obviously looking for an outcome as soon as possible. In addition to the costs, there is also the issue of wasting valuable court time. Wasting valuable court time may be the objective of some of the detainees and perhaps their legal representatives. But, for the others who are waiting in line to have their court case heard, it is simply adding to their trauma and the time that they are in detention-which in turn adds to the cost to the Australian people. So, for all of these reasons, this bill makes a lot of sense. With respect to the people who are in detention and to their families, there are substantial additional benefits in having matters resolved as quickly as possible. There has been universal agreement amongst community interest groups and detainee support agencies who have had extensive experience of dealing with detainees that detention frequently leads to psychological problems for the detainee and that, the longer the person is detained, the more serious are those mental health problems. Mental health problems often leave a person with lifelong effects, with the person continuing to suffer even after being released. Importantly, this bill will also have the positive effect of expediting the removal of persons who should be removed from Australia. Prompt removal of such people is one of the most effective deterrents to others who have no right to remain here. Again, this is not simply about assisting those who ultimately do stay in Australia; it is also about expediting the process in relation to those people who have no right to stay here and should be removed. It is a bill that some might describe as having a win-win objective. Wrongful detention also raises a question relating to human rights obligations. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, speaking on 29 July in respect of the new policies he had announced, said: On 14 occasions over the last decade, the United Nations Human Rights Committee made adverse findings against Australia in immigration detention cases, finding that the detention in those cases violated the prohibition on arbitrary detentention, tion in article 9(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In addition, wrongful detention gives cause to compensation cases, as we saw with the Cornelia Rau case. On this matter, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report identified that, between the years 2000 and 2006, 247 persons were found to have been wrongfully placed in detention centres. Clearly, the longer a person is held in detention, the higher will be the costs associated with any compensation if that person is ultimately found to have been wrongfully detained. Improving the determination process, which is exactly what this bill does, lessens any liability associated with wrongful detention, because the matters will be dealt with much more expeditiously. It is my belief that, because of the Rudd government's new detention policy recently announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, we are unlikely to see the types of wrongful detentions that were identified during the Howard government years and which the Ombudsman reported on. In closing, I want to quote a couple of comments made by the minister when he announced the policy, because I think they sum up the direction in which immigration policies under this government are heading, a direction which the member for Isaacs quite rightly pointed out is much more humane and much fairer. The minister said: In future the department will have to justify why a person should be detained. Once in detention a detainee's case will be reviewed by a senior departmental official every three months to certify that the further detention of the individual is justified. … … … Our new model will not solve all of the complex and protracted issues that delay resolution of immigration status. There will still be people in debut we should see fewer people in detention for less time. The section 501 character cancellation caseload represents a particularly difficult ongoing cohort. However, our new processes should ensure much better outcomes overall. The cost of long-term detention and the case against the current system are compelling. I believe the minister quite appropriately summed it up with those comments, and that is why he has introduced this bill as one of the steps that I am sure we will see in the months ahead for improving the immigration policies by this government-in this case improving the issues surrounding notification for people that are in detention centres. commend the bill to the House.  also rise to speak in support of the Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008. I commend the member for Makin and the speaker who preceded him, the member for Isaacs, for their contributions to the debate. As the member for Moreton, I know that the name ‘Moreton' comes from Lord Moreton, who was a British peer. I know the history of the name ‘Isaacs'-he was the first Australian-born Governor General and the first Jewish Governor General. But I am not sure of the history of the name ‘Makin'. I certainly know that Tony Zappia has a strong connection with multicultural Australia himself and has a strong history of supporting the fact that Australia is based on migrants coming from all over the world. That is one of our greatest strengths.",57
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Moreton ought to refer to other honourable members by the name of their electorate and not by their actual name.  guidance there, Mr Deputy Speaker, in terms of my detailing the name of the member for Makin. I take your guidance strongly. Many migrants who come to Australia choose to live in my electorate. In fact, more than one-third of my electorate were born overseas. When I get out and about in my electorate, I see the United Nations, depending on which suburb I go to. There are people from all over the place. In the 10 months that I have been the member for Moreton, I have offered support to hundreds of visa applicants across a range of visa classes, including humanitarian and refugee entry, skilled visas and family visas. When those people come into my office-and I am sure the member for Makin has had similar experience-I hear them tellI ing their personal stories of trying to track down children or siblings or trying to bring a husband or a wife or a fiancee to Australia. It is always incredibly compelling to hear those stories and to see the actual tears, and I realise how important it is that the government in Australia gets our immigration laws correct. Certainly one of the tougher parts of being an MP is understanding how slow and frustrating the migrant story can be. I have heard compelling stories from each of these visa applicants and their families and now fully appreciate how the decisions made by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship can have a major impact on a person's life. It can be the difference between a life lived in fear and a life of freedom-a life close to family and loved ones or a life of loneliness on the other side of the world. So I understand how important communication is between the department and an applicant or the appropriate authorised person. The department is required to adhere to strict notification requirements to advise visa applicants of decisions and provide information about their rights for review and appeal. Particularly in the case of negative decisions-and, unfortunately, I have been involved with some of those negative decisions in meeting with people after they have received them-and in all cases, it is vital that applicants receive correspondence from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship within an appropriate time frame so that they do not miss out on the opportunity to seek review, which is normally allowed within 21 days of receipt of the information about the decision. The Migration Act 1958 and Migration Regulations 1994 detail how the department is to communicate with clients. The act and regs cover the content of the notice, who must be notified and by what method. The current regulations, unfortunately, have been a little bit confusing for the department and, due to strict adherence by the courts, have meant that minor errors-almost to the extent of typographical errors-can be used as grounds to appeal immigration decisions. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to clarify the notification procedure and to provide certainty for the department and subsequently for their clients, and should result in fewer cases going to court. Firstly, the bill changes the way the department will communicate with minors-that is, people under the age of 18. The act currently requires that correspondence be sent to the relevant person for the notification to be effective, even when that person is too young to understand the nature of the correspondence. This bill will enable the notification to legally be sent to a recipient who the minister, or the minister's delegate, believes has the care of and responsibility for that minor. It will still be possible for the notification to be sent directly to the minor where no carer for that minor can be identified. These amendments will help to ensure that the person who has the power and capability to act on a notification is the one who receives it. The bill also clarifies the notification cedures to overcome the conflicting interpretations that have been delivered by the courts. There have been occasions when a client has received correspondence from the department or tribunal and acted on it but a court has determined that, due to a minor technical error, the client has not actually legally received the correspondence, while other courts have accepted that the client has been legally notified. The deliberations by the courts on these matters have wasted departmental resources and undermined the administration of the migration system. As I said earlier, because it is often a life-anddeath situation when you are talking about decisions about people's loved ones overseas, it is important that we get it right. The bill before the House ensures that clients cannot use a technical error to argue that they never received a notification when they have, to all intents and purposes, been notified. The bill before us will deem a person to be notified where there is evidence that the person received the notice and acted upon it and appears not to have suffered any detriment despite any small technical error. It is common for visa applicants to have an authorised person to manage their visa application and correspond with the department. It is usually a family membersomeone that has gone before them who understands some of the processes-but, if they do not have someone like that that they can turn to, often they will go to a migration agent. In my electorate of Moreton, because I have such a range of people from around the world-some that have come as refugees, some that have come as business migrants and obviously lots who have come on family visas-I am often asked, ‘Who should I turn to?' That is why in my office we have started compiling a list of the migration agents based in or around Moreton-so that we can provide that information to people. Obviproously some agents do it on a pro bono basis, some do it totally for free, some take on the occasional pro bono case and others do it strictly on a fee-for-service basis. There are migration agents and lawyers that do migration work. That is one of the services that we are providing to the people who come to my electorate office. Obviously the department will continue to correspond with the person notified until the department are advised otherwise. Migration agents do great work in helping sort out many complications. This bill goes some way to avoiding the practice of using minor technical and typographical errors to delay decisions through the courts. As someone of Anglo-Saxon background-I think my background is French, Italian and Irish-it has been an honour to represent Moreton, where we have significant groups of people from all over the world, particularly the Chinese diaspora. We have a lot of Taiwanese along with Hong Kong Chinese, Malaysian Chinese, mainland Chinese and even Fijian Chinese people. We also have a significant African population, especially Sudanese-even to the extent that in Moorooka, the suburb where I live, there is a little African community, with lots of African restaurants. There is also a very significant Muslim population who have come from all over the world but particularly from Zimbabwe and South Africa. I could not forget the New Zealand population, who also make up a significant proportion of my electorate, and obviously the English, Irish and Scottish, the Greeks and many others. So, obviously, the history of Australia is one of settlement. Certainly for the last 200 or so years, leaving aside the 50,000 or 60,000 years beforehand, we have been a country based on settlement. In a changing world it is important to make sure that we have good connections with these communities-that when the communities from around the world come to Australia they are well settled and have strong roots in the communities of Moreton, Brisbane et cetera. As we have seen around the world all too often, if we do not get the balance right, the mix right, we can end up with violence and devastation and people picking up weapons to attack their neighbours. Thankfully, in Australia we do not have that historycertainly not in the last 50 years. Although, if we look at the settlement of Australia, one of the first things the parliament of Australia turned its mind to was the White Australia policy, they were different times; we have moved on a lot since then. We now have much healthier multicultural communities. The bill before the House goes some way to preserving some of those basic tenets: that we get on with our neighbours and we accept people from around the world. I do not know the words to the second verse of Advance Australia Fair off by heart-the member for Port Adelaide might be able to help me outbut from memory it talks about embracing those who have come from across the sea because we have boundless plains to share. That is what we are about as a nation: giving people an opportunity in life. We can do so in such a way that we do not have to put children in detention. We do not have to create these artificial bits of Australia in other countries. If people do come to Australia in circumstances that do not involve standing in line and getting a visa in their part of the world, we can still help them as much as possible-check their history, make sure that their health is fine, help them integrate into the Australian community and get them paying taxes as soon as possible. Obviously, we need to cross the t's and dot the i's as much as possible, to make sure that this system runs smoothly. The bill before the House will make significant improvements to the notification regime. It will ensure that the hard work of our immigration department is not undermined by rigid court decisions and it will provide greater clarity and consistency for visa applicants. I commend the bill to the House.",61

26,Mr BUTLER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Can I say what a pleasure it is to follow the member for Moreton in this debate, particularly his demographic tour de force of the electorate of Moreton! ",64
27,Mr BUTLER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you. It is a pleasure to rise to speak in favour of the Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008. Immigration is an emotive and complex area, fraught with competing interests and the need for a strong system of checks and balances. Whether it involves the reunification of families, the offer of safe asylum to the persecuted or ensuring that Australia has the skilled population needed to sustain our economy, immigration policy has a profound effect on people's lives, and it is vital that both citizens and noncitizens have confidence in our program. Eleven years of immigration policy under the previous government seriously undermined that confidence and left a legacy of deep distrust in the ity of decision making, ethics of policy and culture of the department. We as a government are committed to overturning that legacy and providing a system that has integrity, transparency and fairness and which balances the needs of clients with the protection of our borders. Already the Rudd government has made great strides in reforming the system. One of our first acts was to dismantle the so-called ‘Pacific solution'-a scheme that was never going to be a solution but was instead a base, populist stunt that cost Australia's reputation and finances whilst it played politics with the lives of some of the world's most vulnerable people. Under the Howard government Australia's detention policy was a source of international condemnation. We have reformed the system to take a risk based rather than punitive approach to detention policy. No longer will Australia bear the shame of children languishing in our immigration detention centres. No longer will being unlawful mean facing years of detention despite posing no danger to the community. No longer will taxpayers have to pay for an expensive, unnecessary and destructive detention scheme. We are still maintaining mandatory detention for those unlawful noncitizens who present an unacceptable risk to the community or who repeatedly refuse to comply with their visa conditions. Unauthorised boat arrivals will still be subject to mandatory detention for health, identity and security checks. This government is committed to protecting our nation from the potential dangers posed by some unauthorised arrivals or unlawful noncitizens, but we are also committed to treating people with dignity. We will only use detention centres as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time. We have also abolished the temporary protection visa regime-another shameful qualchapter in the immigration policies of the Howard government. This regime actively prevented refugees from rebuilding their lives by denying them the entitlements and security of permanent residency despite our international obligations. Not only was this a further stain on Australia's reputation but also it entirely failed to serve its claimed purpose. Evidence shows that the temporary protection visas did nothing to prevent unauthorised boat arrivals, with numbers actually increasing not long after the introduction of the regime. Unlike our predecessors, the Rudd government is shaping policy that maintains the integrity of Australia's immigration system whilst ensuring that our humanitarian program is humanitarian in substance as well as in name. This means not using asylum seekers as political toys, not locking up traumatised children and not compounding the suffering of those whom Australia has long recognised a moral and international obligation to help. We have also tackled the skills shortage. Employers have had the pressure eased by the Rudd government adding an extra 31,000 skilled migrants to the 2008-09 migration program. We have recognised that this record 30 per cent intake increase could put strain on a department already struggling with demand, and so we are working to tighten up processing procedures and improve servicing standards. The Rudd government know that business needs all hands on deck, not stuck waiting at the dock bound up in red tape, and we are actively working to streamline the process for both employers and employees. We have also taken action to reform the 457 visa program. The Howard government allowed this program to run without sufficient safeguards to prevent the exploitation of temporary skilled foreign workers or the undercutting of wages and conditions of Australian workers. Unlike the Howard government, we believe in responsible government. The Rudd government are committed to ensuring that the 457 visa scheme operates as effectively as possible whilst protecting the rights of overseas workers along with the employment opportunities of our own citizens. We know that, without strong compliance initiatives, the integrity of our entire immilighted gration program can be jeopardised. We have a zero-tolerance approach to illegal workers and the employers who engage workers without valid visas. We have also increased the use of biometric technology to strengthen further the protection of our borders. The Rudd government recognise that, to restore public confidence in our immigration program after the damage caused during the Howard era, we need to improve the transparency of the entire system, including at a ministerial level. This is why we have commissioned an independent report into the ministerial intervention powers. Noncompellable, non-reviewable and nondelegable powers have a dangerous potential for abuse. We have also taken steps to improve confidence in our review tribunals by undertaking a merit based selection of members rather than the minister exercising his or her option simply to re-appoint current members. Unlike our predecessors, this government recognises that a fair and transparent review system needs a fair and transparent selection system of appointments to ensure credibility. The Rudd government have listened to the concerns raised about the structure and the content of the citizenship test set up by the Howard administration, and we are ensuring transparency and integrity in reform by the establishment of an independent review committee to look into that test. We believe in the benefits of a citizenship test. We also believe it can only be effective and meaningful when it is accessible. The bill before us today, the Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill, continues this government's work in reforming our immigration system. The Commonwealth Ombudsman, in his December 2007 report Notification of decisions and review rights for unsuccessful visa applicants, highdifficulties with the notification provisions of the Migration Act and their potential to result in unlawful detention of clients. This bill is just the first step in tackling those difficulties and is part of a broader set of measures the government is considering. Notification is an integral part of the immigration processing system and a basic tenet of natural justice. The obligation to explain the reasons for a decision and the rights or obligations triggered by that decision is basic to the transparency and accountability of government. The Rudd government recognises the need for strong procedural safeguards in this important area, but it also recognises the need for clarity, simplicity and some flexibility for individual circumstances. This bill, as the initial stage of a broader package, will amend two aspects of the notification procedures. Firstly, the bill will provide that actual tification will apply if the deemed notification provisions cannot operate. Timing is crucial here, as review rights must be exercised within strict time limits from the deemed date of notification. This amendment focuses on errors in the method of notification. Currently, if a client has actually received correspondence from the department or a tribunal and has acted upon that correspondence without any apparent detriment resulting from a technical error, the courts can still rule that they have not legally received it due to that technical error. This is not just absurd; it also prevents consistency and certainty of outcomes, wastes valuable resources, and leaves the department open to claims of unlawful detention and unlawful removal. What this amendment will do is clarify the system by ensuring that a legal technicality does not negate what has occurred in fact. This amendment will not corrode the rights of clients. If an error actively prejudices a client exercising their right of review, then it will not fall within the scope of the amendment. This amendment simplifies the system and provides for certainty of outcomes whilst retaining a flexibility that protects fairness. The second amendment relates to the communication with minors through a person or organisation exercising care and responsibility for the minor. The act defines a minor as someone under 18 years of age. Outside certain circumstances, the current provisions in the act now require that the relevant correspondence be sent to the minor even when the minor may be too young to understand the contents. This amendment will enable effective notification with a minor where the minister, his delegate or a tribunal has a reasonable belief that the recipient of the notification has the care of and responsibility for the minor. This amendment will produce the result that the person most nolikely to act on the notification is also the person who receives it. This is clearly in the best interests of the child and the effectiveness of our system. Where no-one with responsibility for and care of the minor can be identified, then notification can still be sent directly to the minor. In broad and in summary, these amendments to the Migration Act will increase simplicity, clarity and flexibility in our notification regime whilst protecting the rights of clients. They will reduce unnecessary depletion of departmental resources and provide certainty and consistency of outcomes. I commend the bill to the House.",64
28,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (12.28 pm)-in reply-At the outset, I would congratulate the new shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, the member for Murray, in regard to her role. However, I think it is a bit rich for her to basically argue that what we are seeing here today is part of a continuing Howard government approach to detention policy and immigration. Certainly, the government reiterate that we need to ensure we have a process in this country which maximises the possibility that those who have genuine claims are those who are actually protected by the country. And, of course, as a matter of last resort, there will be detention. However, when we look at issues such as the onus with regard to whether or not people will be detained, the closure of offshore sites and the definite commitment that children will not be detained, as well as the broad swathe of immigration changes-quite frankly, overwhelming changes in the last few months in that policy area-I do not think that argument really stands up to rational analysis. We are supporting strong border control but a fair and more humane treatment of asylum seekers and those who do need to be detained. I will not detain the House at length; I derstand there are some other pressing matters. The Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008 will make amendments to provisions of the Migration Act 1958 which set out the requirements for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the tribunals to notify a person about important matters such as decisions on visa applications and visa cancellations. The amendments will clarify the way the department, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal communicate with their clients. Many speakers have repeated ad nauseam the three particular thrusts of change, so I will not reiterate those. I would, however, remind the House that the ‘substantial compliance' amendment sought to ensure that substantial compliance with the required content of a notice will be sufficient notification. Under this amendment, minor technical errors in the content of the notice will not render the notification ineffective unless the applicant can show that the error or omission substantially prejudices him or her. Following introduction of the bill into parliament, it became apparent that the provisions relating to substantial compliance produced unintended consequences both in terms of errors in the notification document and also in relation to the compliance operations of the department. Consequently, the government-sponsored amendments withdraw the substantial compliance amendments from the bill. I note in this respect that the amendments regarding actual notification will cover most of the circumstances that have caused difficulties in the past and ensure that a person who is actually notified cannot seek to rely on a technical error in the notification process. It is not expected that withdrawing the substantial compliance un- amendments from the bill will affect a large number of cases. The remaining amendments assist in ensuring that notification will be legally effective and provide certainty regarding future action based on notification, while still maintaining fair and reasonable dealings with the department's and the tribunals' clients. I commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",66
29,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (12.32 pm)-by leave-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and move government amendments (1) to (12), to effect as circulated, together: (1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (lines 22 to 26), omit subsection 379AA(4).

(12) Schedule 1, item 28, page 12 (lines 20 to 26), omit the item. The government proposes amendments to the Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008 to ensure that measures contained in the bill operate effectively and as intended. The aim of the bill is to provide greater certainty concerning notification procedures and to ensure that visa applicants and visa holders are effectively informed of matters relevant to their dealings with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The bill seeks to balance the need for efficient administration against the need for applicants and visa holders not to be prejudiced by errors in the content of documents or in the manner in which documents are given to them. The bill contains three key amendments, one of which is to provide that substantial compliance with the required contents of a notification document is sufficient unless the visa applicant is able to show that the error or omission in the document causes them substantial prejudice. Following the introduction of the bill into parliament it became apparent that the provisions relating to substantial compliance produced unintended consequences both in terms of errors in the notification document and also in relation to the compliance operations of the department. In addition, the amendments regarding actual notification will cover most of the circumstances that have caused difficulties in the past and ensure that a person who is actually notified cannot seek to rely on a technical error in the notification process. The amendments remove provisions in schedule 1 to the bill relating to substantial to 7), compliance with the notification requirements in the act. The remaining two measures in the bill will assist in ensuring greater certainty regarding notification without causing prejudice to visa applicants and visa holders. I commend the amendments to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",67

31,Mr MURPHY,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Lowe-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade) (12.36 pm)-I move: That the requested amendments be made. The Senate last night passed the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 with amendments, and the government supported those amendments. The government acknowledges the cooperation of the Greens, Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding on this important budget measure. The government amendments were made following agreement between the government and the Greens. The amendments establish a new threshold of $75,000 for fuel-efficient luxury cars in the luxury car tax law-that is, fuelefficient vehicles will pay no luxury car tax up to $75,000. The vehicles eligible for the higher threshold will be those with a fuel consumption not exceeding seven litres per 100 kilometres. The fuel-efficient car limit will be indexed in the same way as the existing luxury car tax threshold. The threshold increase will reduce the amount of luxury car tax payable on these fuel-efficient vehicles. For cars that are currently on the market, in most cases the effect will be to reduce the luxury car tax payable to zero. The fuelefficient car limit will act over time as an incentive to car manufacturers and importers to get very fuel-efficient cars into the Australian market. Senator Fielding raised his concerns about the impact on farmers and tourism operators with the government. The government supported Senator Fielding's amendments to provide a refund of the increase in the luxury car tax rate to eligible primary producers and tourism operators. The government is satisfied that the amendments will not impose undue burden on business and have protections in place to reduce the possibility of abuse. Senator Xenophon raised his concerns about the indexation of the threshold and the application of the luxury car tax measure to car purchasers who entered into contracts before the budget announcement. The government supported Senator Xenophon's amendments. The amendments changed the method of indexing the luxury car tax threshold, currently $57,180, in line with CPI from 1 July 2012 unless the parliament agrees to an alternative indexation method. The threshold is currently indexed by the motor vehicle component of the CPI-that is, the CPIMV. The amendments also retain the current 25 per cent rate where buyers entered into contracts to purchase cars before the budget for delivery after 1 July.",71
32,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 increase taxes on certain vehicles. Overall, the bill and these measures offend the very principles that guide Treasury as set out in its report on the tax system released only last month. Those principles are efficiency, equity, simplicity and low administrative and compliance costs. The luxury car tax fails against every one of these principles. It is inefficient, uitable, complicated and, therefore, costly to administer and to comply with. Of course, another point is that the government did not tell the people of Australia about this tax hike before the election. The bill as amended is an even greater failure against the Treasury principles. It is, as some of my colleagues have described, a dog's breakfast. The existing luxury car tax is 25 per cent. Add to that the GST, which was meant to be the consumption tax, of 10 per cent, and the government now wants to add a surcharge of a further eight per cent-a total of 43 per cent on certain vehicles. The coalition opposed the bill in its original form because, with a strong budget surplus and with a slowing economy, these tax increases are not needed and are not justified. Now the amendments make this an even worse piece of legislation, compounding the complexity and unfairness inherent in the original bill. There are four amendments. We will oppose the amendment relating to fuel efficiency, which was a deal done between the government and the Greens, as it is fundamentally flawed. It allows a small range of vehicles to be exempted from this additional tax of eight per cent. All the vehicles to be exempted are small, European-made sedans. The list of vehicles that will be exempted provided by the government-not upront but in response to a request by the coalition in the Senate-includes: the Alfa Romeo 159 Sportwagon, the BMW 3 Series, the BMW X3, the Jaguar X-Type, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and others, including the BMW 5 Series. These are all vehicles that are exempted under the Labor government's new proposal. This is the party of the working classes exempting European sports cars but slugging Australian-made cars, such as the Ford Territory or the Holden Commodore, with an additional so-called luxury car tax. Not one car made in Australia will be exineqempted under the Labor government's taxnot one. A family who wants a full-size family vehicle or a four-wheel drive vehicle that costs between $57,180 and $75,000 will be hit with the additional tax, but a Labor Party branch president driving a Jaguar X-Type down Collins Street in Melbourne will be exempt. They will be exempt from the tax but the family needing an Australian-made family car will be hit with the tax.  I wonder?",71
33,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Indeed. I wonder what Brian Burke drives. The amendment regarding the backdating was supported in the Senate, so I need not make any further comment on that. The indexation to CPI amendment is a most confusing and irrational amendment. It seeks to index the luxury car tax threshold to the CPI, not to the CPI motor vehicle subset, but not for another four years. If the policy is good, why not do it now? If a policy is worth doing, why is it not worth doing now? The government had no answer in the Senate. I invite my colleague opposite to tell the people of Australia why the government will not agree to index the luxury car tax threshold to the CPI now. The fourth amendment relates to primary producers and tourism operators and was introduced by Senator Fielding. This is one of the most complicated and confusing exemptions that I have seen in tax policy, and that is saying something. It adds to the complexity and adds to the red tape. There will be arbitrary results that will be grossly unfair to people across Australia. Let me give you an example. If you own a farm and drive a four-wheel drive, you can get an exemption on the basis that you are a primary producer. (Extension of time granted) But if you are working as a fencing contractor, an irrigation contractor, a vet surgeon, a subcontractor or a tradie and you turn up to that same farm in an identical four-wheel drive, you will get slugged with the eight per cent additional tax. How is that fair? The primary producer who owns the farm gets a tax exemption but the worker on the farm gets slugged with the additional tax. It is also entirely inconsistent with the amendment relating to fuel efficiency, which was introduced by the Greens. The cars that will be exempted under the primary producer and tourism operator exemption are Toyota LandCruisers and vehicles of that type. People should appreciate that Toyota LandCruisers use fuel at double the threshold of the exemption introduced for fuel-efficient cars in the first amendment. On the one hand the government are supporting small European sedans for their apparent fuel efficiency and exempting them from the luxury car tax and, on the other hand, they are exempting, under the primary producers and tourism operators amendment, Toyota LandCruisers, which use fuel at double the threshold of the exemption. It is totally inconsistent. That underscores the dangers of policy on the run. What we have had presented to us is a complex, complicated and unworkable mess. The bill should never have been introduced into this House. The luxury car tax increases were not revealed to the Australian public before the election. And yet, without notice and without consultation, the government introduces a bill to increase a luxury car tax that exempts European sports cars and the Toyota LandCruisers, driven by farm owners but not farm workers. If the government wanted to increase taxes on luxury cars-and it has not ruled out increasing taxes on other luxury goodswhy wasn't the luxury car tax referred to the Ken Henry review into the taxation system? It makes a mockery of the government's intentions of reforming the tax system. It will undermine the efficacy of the Henry review if this tax is just inserted into the system in an ad hoc fashion prior to the deliberations of the Henry review. How is it that the government can impose a tax without consultation-without sending it to its own tax refirst view-yet cannot increase the single age pension by $30 without sending that off to a review that has to report next year and is going to feed into the Henry review? How is it that the government cannot increase the pension by $30 a week until it has sent it to a review that feeds into another review that will not report until the end of 2009, yet was able to get legislation ready and make a decision overnight to introduce an addition to the luxury car tax? The fact is that this legislation is a travesty, and the government should be condemned for it. They are making pensioners wait months and months and possibly years for the outcome of a review, yet their own Ken Henry review into the taxation system will not look into the luxury car tax. On the basis of the fundamental flaws in this legislation, the coalition will oppose the amendments.",72
34,Mr ALBANESE,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (12.49 pm)-The defenders of privilege over there are being true to form in their opposition to this increase in the luxury car tax. The Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 was carried by this House and has been the subject of considerable debate in the Senate. Constructive suggestions have been put forward by the Greens, by Senator Xenophon, by Senator Fielding-by everyone except for the coalition, who have dealt themselves out of any constructive contribution to the federal budget. The coalition is determined to blow a $6.2 billion hole in the Rudd government's budget. This comes at a time of considerable international financial uncertainty. Under those circumstances, it is absolutely critical that the budget surplus be preserved intact-that the $22 billion which the Rudd government was able to achieve as a budget surplus be supported by both chambers. And it should be supported by both sides of the House. Those opposite suggest various spending measures from time to time, whether they be spending measures for individuals or spending measures for infrastructure. But the fact is that those opposite are determined to defend the people who drive Porsches and can afford to support this tax increase. Those opposite have chosen, by their actions, to exclude themselves from this debate. They have vacated the field when it comes to the debate about responsible economic management. I call upon them to have a close look at the report issued today by International Monetary Fund. That report gives a great deal of support to the Rudd government's budget surplus. It gives a great deal of support to the government's budget strategy. What those opposite seek to do, because they cannot accept the verdict of the Australian public on 24 November last year, is to deny the government its budget. On Sunday, on the Laurie Oakes program on Channel 9, the Leader of the Opposition was not quite sure whether $6 billion was a small amount or a large amount; he just knew that was the amount of the hole that he wanted to blast in the budget. It is quite extraordinary-and I say this as someone who is not close to the Australian Greens party, as those opposite would know-that the Australian Greens have been more economically responsible during this debate than the coalition, and that is where they are up to. There are suggestions of opposition to the amendments that have been carried by the Senate. Those amendments have occurred of course because this is the second time that the Senate has considered this legislation. Had the coalition supported it in full, early on without the exemptions, that would be what we would be considering in the House right now-so their hypocrisy knows no bounds. (Extension of time granted) They have ensured that the minor parties have been in a position to negotiate changes to the government's legislation. Of course governments like to have their legislation carried unamended-that is the basis on which they put bills up-but this government also recognises that there is a legitimate role for constructive discussion. Considering these amendments, we find we have legislation as amended by the Senate that we can certainly support because it is a part of the framework of the Australian government's budget. It is unfortunate that the opposition are not the prepared to support the government's $22 billion surplus-instead they want to make a smash-and-grab raid on the surplus-and that they are prepared to stand up for luxury car owners. That is essentially what their position before the House comes down to. They stand condemned for their position on this, just as they stand condemned for their position on the condensate measures and other measures that are before the Senate in terms of the government's budget. This government is determined to act responsibly. It is recognised by the business community and by economic commentators that the budget surplus is important. Today we have support for that from the IMF. This government will continue to act in an economically responsible way by supporting measures which, by having a substantial surplus in the short term, will serve to put downward pressure on interest rates and inflation and will provide for the medium-term and long-term objectives of support for our infrastructure. Question put: That the requested amendments be made. The House divided. [1.01 pm] (The Deputy Speaker-Ms S Bird) Ayes………… Noes………… Majority……… Adams, D.G.H. Albanese, A.N. Bidgood, J. Bowen, C.

36,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"This bill before the parliament is a non-controversial bill. It has the coalition's support. It is a bill to amend the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 to incorporate into Australian law a protocol amending the agreement between our government and the government of the Republic of South Africa for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. The protocol itself updates that existing agreement between both of our governments in the respects I have just outlined. It was entered into originally in 1999. The updated protocol, as the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs made clear in his second reading speech, was signed on 31 March this year. The existing agreement was negotiated and implemented by the previous government and illustrates our long standing commitment to encouraging foreign investment and opportunities for Australian businesses in overseas markets. The existing agreement contained a most favoured nation obligation within the non-discrimination article, and the article was triggered-I think the minister pointed this out in his speech-by the renegotiated Australia-United Kingdom tax treaty that came into effect in 2003. Departmental negotiations subsequently commenced to protect taxpayers operating in the other country from discriminatory tax practices, and I am optimistic that this updated protocol will encourage foreign investment and provide further opportunities for Australian businesses in overseas markets. Specifically, as has been outlined in the introductory speech, the protocol that this law will give effect to lower withholding tax rates on interest and royalties. This aligns the withholding tax rate limits for royalties and dividends more closely with the OECD practice. Since the existing agreement was negotiated in 1999, South Africa has changed its domestic tax treatment of corporate profits, and to address this change, as was outlined, the updated protocol provides a five per cent withholding tax rate for all non-portfolio intercorporate dividends. This provision will be beneficial for Australian non-portfolio investors in South Africa. The updated protocol also provides a 15 per cent withholding tax rate for all other dividends. It brings, ditionally, capital gains tax treatment into alignment with the OECD model and also introduces some integrity measures to protect and secure revenue. The protocol facilitates increased cooperation between Australian and South African tax authorities with respect to reducing fiscal evasion. South Africa is Australia's largest trading partner in Africa. In 2007, Australian exports to South Africa were valued at around $2½ billion. South Africa is also the source of a substantial proportion of foreign investment from Africa. The negotiations for this updated protocol, as I said at the outset, began under the previous government. The bill gives effect to that protocol in this parliament. It has our support and has the bipartisan support of this House. I commend the bill to the House.",76
37,Mr NEUMANN,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"I rise today to speak in support of the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008. I do so because I come from South East Queensland and about seven per cent of the people who settle in Queensland come from South Africa. Approximately 80,000 South African migrants live in the western suburbs of Brisbane, the greater Brisbane area and through Ipswich and the Lockyer Valley in the Boonah shire, which makes up my electorate of Blair. They are attracted to the area because of the climate, the lifestyle and the attitudes of the Australian people. I regularly go to citizenship ceremonies in my electorate, and almost invariably South Africans make up a huge proportion of the people becoming Australians. Since World War II we have welcomed about six million people to our shores, and about 4.4 million of them have become Australian citizens. We really are a multicultural society. Our relationship with South Africa has been long standing and friendly, and it is adnot just because of our mutual love of cricket, rugby union and soccer. South Africa is part of the Commonwealth of Nations, the World Trade Organisation, the Cairns Group and a number of other international organisations of which Australia is also a member. This bill includes provisions to amend the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 to incorporate into Australian law the protocol signed on 31 March 2008 between Australia and South Africa. The protocol amends the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income. This is an important piece of legislation, because in democratic countries where there is a free press and where there are fundamentally sound economies we need to reduce barriers, which will help advance our cultural and economic relationships. South Africa is a regional superpower, both politically and economically. We witnessed that recently with the intervention of the now retired President of South Africa to achieve some sort of political resolution in Zimbabwe. About 115,000 South African expatriates live in Australia, and about 7,500 Australians reside in South Africa. It is a fact that in 2007 about 97,000 Australian residents visited South Africa. Regardless of which side of politics has occupied the treasury bench, the relationship between South Africa and Australia has been strong. There have been bilateral agreements relating to extradition, in 2001; defence information, in 2001; air services, in 1995; science and technology cooperation, in 2006; and, of course, double taxation, in 1999 and 2008. The bill seeks to update the taxation arrangements between our countries and in turn reduce barriers to bilateral trade and investment by lowering withholding tax rates on interest and royalties. Central to this bill is our trading relationship. It is positive our relationship with South Africa is growing. In 2007, two-way merchandise trade was valued at $3.88 billion. Australian imports from South Africa were $1.35 billion and our exports to South Africa were $2.53 billion. They were mainly in coal, meat and civil engineering equipment. The two-way investment flows between our countries have expanded since the end of apartheid, and there have been great political progress and economic development since the dark days of the Afrikaner regime, which emerged in 1948. At the end of 2007, investment from South Africa amounted to $1.2 billion, and Australia's investment in South Africa was $893 million, principally in mining, agriculture, infrastructure and services. The protocol updates the taxation arrangements between our two countries and aligns withholding tax rate limits for dividends, interest and royalties and capital gains tax treatment more closely with OECD practice. The protocol further addresses Australia's most favoured nation obligation in the existing treaty by inserting rules to protect from tax discrimination taxpayers of one country operating in the other country. It also extends the scope of the existing exchange of information provisions to conform to modern OECD standards and introduces measures which provide for cross-border collection of tax debts. As the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs and Assistant Treasurer outlined in his second reading speech, ‘Tax discrimination under other countries' tax systems can be a significant barrier to outbound Australian investment.' I agree. The protocol updates the existing Australia-South Africa tax treaty, which was signed in 1999. In accordance with Australia's most favoured nation obligations under that treaty, the protocol introduces new rules to prevent that tax discrimination. These rules are broadly aligned with international tax treaty practice and protect Australian nationals and businesses operating in South Africa and vice versa. The rules are similar to those found in other, recent Australian taxation treaties. The protocol also amends the withholding tax rates that may be imposed on crossborder dividends, interest and royalties. Under the treaty, dividends, interest and royalties paid from one country-the source country-to a person who is a resident in the other country will generally remain taxable in both countries, but with certain new limits on the tax that the source country may charge on payments to residents of the other country. The new dividends article provides for a withholding tax rate limit of five per cent for all non-portfolio intercorporate dividends. This will replace the current zero rate for non-portfolio intercorporate dividends paid out of profits that have borne full company tax. A 15 per cent rate applies for all other dividends. These rates are consistent with the OECD model tax convention. The revision of the non-portfolio intercorporate dividend withholding tax rate was negotiated in the context of the South African government's announcement of changes to its system of taxing corporate profits in its 2007-08 budget. These changes include the phasing out of the secondary tax on companies, which is not subject to treaty limitations, and the introduction of a dividend tax on shareholders. The implementation of these changes is subject to renegotiation of dividend withholding tax rates by South Africa in several of its tax treaties, including its tax treaty with Australia. Australian non-portfolio investment in South Africa will generally benefit from reduced total South African tax on corporate profits as a result of these changes. The protocol will not change Australia's treatment of franked dividends. Franked dividends paid to South African residents will continue to be exempt from withholding tax. Source country tax on interest will continue to be limited to 10 per cent. However, no tax will be chargeable in the source country on interest derived by the government of the other country from the investment of official reserve assets or by a financial instituvoured tion resident in the other country. These exemptions are subject to certain safeguards, which exist and assist to discourage tax avoidance. The general limit for royalties will be reduced from 10 to five per cent. The protocol also provides that amounts derived from equipment leasing, including container leasing, will be excluded from the definition of royalty. Such amounts would be treated either as profits from international transport operations or as business profits. Other features include expanding the list of taxes which can be covered; a redefinition of ‘permanent establishment', including prescribed time limits for the creation of a permanent establishment where an enterprise operates substantial equipment or is engaged in the exploration for, or exploitation of, natural resources; provisions which align capital gains tax treatment more closely with Australian taxation law and OECD practice; Australia's taxing rights over Australian real property and the business assets of a foreign resident's Australian permanent establishment be preserved; and improved integrity measures to provide for a more effective exchange of information on a broader range of taxes, including goods and services tax, and to provide for reciprocal assistance in the collection of taxes. For those of my constituents who are from South Africa and who run small businesses in my electorate, and who deal with South African companies every day-and there are many, from small business operations in the Lockyer Valley through to Ipswich and in the Boonah Shire-this legislation is a great help to them financially. While the legislation sounds unsexy, it has a big financial impact on my constituents and the many South Africans who live in my electorate. The protocol, the subject of this bill, arose from the need to meet Australia's most fanation obligations in our existing treaty with South Africa. Tax treaties and like international agreements are extremely important in reducing the barriers between countries and improving international cooperation. Those types of treaties, the protocols that we are talking about here today, facilitate and enhance the movement of people, cultural exchange, ideas and capital. They will do that for a country that we have had a long and established cultural history with as part of the Commonwealth of Nations. This is a country that can only be good for us in the future in terms of our relationships. It is a country that we play sport with, which we deal with, which Australians visit and which my constituents do business with. This legislation before the House not only is good for the future economic development of our country but is vital for the future prosperity of the many South Africans who live in my constituency of Blair in South-East Queensland. I commend the bill to the House.",77
38,Mr SIMPKINS,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"I rise today to speak in support of the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008. This bill gives force of law to the updated tax protocol with South Africa, signed in March this year. The bill amends the existing treaty to ensure that taxpayers of one country operating in the other country do not experience tax discrimination. Of course, this bill is very important to the 12,000 to 13,000 South African immigrants that come here each year, permanently or temporarily. Overwhelmingly they stay, and for good reasons. I understand that around 75,000 South Africans permanently relocated to Australia between 1995 and 2005. This reflects the Howard government's commitment to reducing the skills shortage. I also understand the number of South Africans migrating to Australia last year rose by 10 per cent but still fell short of the 35 per cent increase from the highs established in 2002 and 2003. Last year, 4,293 South Africans successfully applied for permanent residency in Australia, compared to 3,895 the previous year. In 2002, the number soared to 6,538. For two years prior to that, the number topped 6,000. These numbers include 1,395 primary applicants for visas and almost 3,000 members of their families and dependants. During 2006-07, South Africa was the sixth place for country of origin, with almost 4,000 South Africans migrating to Australia during this period. Australia has recently increased the numbers of places allocated for skilled migrants by 31,000 for the 2008-09 financial year to a total of 133,500 places. This represents a 30 per cent increase from the previous year's intake. South Africans represent only a small fraction of Australia's overall migration numbers, however. South Africans make up less than five per cent of the total of new migrants coming under the skilled migration program. By contrast, 25 per cent come from the UK, 16 per cent from India and 15 per cent from China. Clearly, by the interest shown in migration to this country, there is a great affinity between South Africans and Australia. I, for one, welcome the contribution made by South Africans to the great state of Western Australia and particularly within my electorate of Cowan. I would like to take the opportunity to cus on a particular group of South African people who have migrated to Australia and made their homes in and around the suburb of Noranda in the south-east of Cowan. This bill will be of benefit to them. I refer to the members of the Northern Suburbs Hebrew Congregation. Twenty-one years ago a group of Jewish South Africans determined that they no longer wished to live under the that apartheid regime in South Africa. As we all know, Jewish people have suffered through the ages because of their beliefs and faith. The state of Israel has been effectively under siege and the target of terrorism for every year of its modern period since 1948. Given the persecution, it is little wonder that Jewish people are rightly sensitive to such regimes as existed at that time in South Africa. It was, however, Australia that benefited from their departure, and Perth in particular. There are about 250 families that are members of the Northern Suburbs Hebrew Congregation, with around 220 being originally from South Africa. In looking over the congregation's website, the historical link to South Africa is abundantly clear. There is even a list of congregation members and where they had their bar mitzvahs, the majority being in South African synagogues. As I said, the majority came to Perth 21 years ago with nothing. They could not take their assets with them and so they started in Australia with nothing. Like every person from South Africa that I have met, they are grateful to be here and are all now Australians. In recent years, more South Africans have come to Perth and joined the congregation. This later group have welcomed the move to Australia, like so many other South Africans, because they have escaped the crime and violence that afflicts that country so tragically. When the majority arrived 21 years ago, for the first five years they had no rabbi, yet fothey still gathered to worship and they generated great community strength. They were also well supported by the City of Bayswater, which rezoned land to allow the construction of Noranda Shul in Garside Court, within my electorate. Spiritually, the Northern Suburbs Hebrew Congregation is now principally looked after by Rabbi Larry Brown. I was at his inauguration on 13 July this year. Apart from Rabbi Brown, the congregation also has amongst its membership Rabbi Chaim Davidowitz and Rabbi Shalom Coleman. Both these Rabbis have served the congregation for many years. I would like to comment on the positive leadership of Rabbi Coleman. Although he was born in England, he did serve as a rabbi in South Africa. In preparing for this debate, I had a long look at the Northern Suburbs Hebrew Congregation's website. I saw on the website a picture of Rabbi Coleman from the Bloemfontein Synagogue's golden jubilee in 1953. He was at that time the chief minister. Therefore, although Rabbi Coleman was born in England he forms an important part of the South African heritage for the Northern Suburbs Hebrew Congregation. I also remember when Rabbi Coleman thanked the former Minister for Foreign Affairs after a visit before the election last As I recall, Rabbi Coleman spoke about the support provided by Mr Downer and the coalition government for Israel and Jewish people. Apart from the traditional strong and unequivocal support for Israel and Jewish people in Australia always provided by the coalition, last year there was also direct support provided by the former government. This was in the form of a National Community Crime Prevention Program grant of $43,000 to assist in the security arrangements at Noranda Shul. I was informed yesterday that work on a security wall is progressing as we speak. Apart from spiritual guidance, leadership at the Northern Suburbs Hebrew Congregation is also provided by the president, Mr Ivan Cohen. He is ably assisted by his vicepresidents, Mr Shalom Hadassin and Charles Fridlender. Although the members of the congregation make great contributions to the Perth community, I would like to just pick out Mr Charles Fridlender as an example of such a contribution to the economy of Perth. Mr Fridlender runs Wavtech, a company that won a Telstra Business Ideas grant in 2001 and a Water Industry Award in 2002. Mr Charles Fridlender is the employer of a number of local people and he contributes towards industry and business in the Osmond Park area, which is outside of my electorate. He has certainly been hard working and a great advocate. He is a person who has greatly contributed to the economy of Perth and Western Australia. Before closing, I would also like to mention another South African, who is not actually a member of the Hebrew congregation and is not Jewish. Mr Michael Sutherland was recently elected as the new state member for Mount Lawley. Mr Sutherland brings a wealth of experience from his time as Deputy Lord Mayor of the City of Perth. I welcome his entry into state parliament and the year. work that he will do. He is a great advocate for South Africans and people of South African origin. In summing up, I know that for all South Africans and for people of South African origin, this bill will be of great benefit. It will allow them more certainty in the future for their business dealings and I know that it will be welcomed by all people of South African origin and South Africans who operate in Western Australia. I commend the bill and the efforts of South African people within Cowan and within Perth.",79
39,Mr BRADBURY,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"I rise in support of the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 and to add my comments to the debate, having listened to the member for Cowan and his comments in relation to the large proportion of South Africans that account for his constituency. Whilst obviously it is important for those people, I think that we should acknowledge that this is a big issue in terms of trade more generally for Australia and really does go a long way towards augmenting the very strong bilateral trade relationship that Australia and the Republic of South Africa have. The bill essentially incorporates into Australian law the protocol amending the double tax agreement that is currently in place between Australia and the Republic of South Africa. That agreement is the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income, and Protocol of 1999. The protocol makes a number of amendments and has in large part been triggered by the most favoured nation status clause that exists within the existing double tax agreement between the two countries. In 2003 when Australia entered into the double tax agreement with the United Kingdom-which is the Convention between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains-the most favoured nation status clause within our double tax agreement with the Republic of South Africa required us to take action to update that agreement with South Africa to ensure that comparable terms were passed on to South Africa. The protocol implements a number of technical amendments. It is worth reflecting on the significance of Australia's relationship with South Africa. South Africa is Australia's largest trading partner in Africa. It is our 21st largest trading partner. In 2007, South African investment in Australia was $1.2 billion and Australian investment in South Africa was approximately $893 million. We are a net trade exporter to South Africa. Australia is ranked 12th on the list of South Africa's principal export destinations, and Australia is the 16th largest exporter of goods and services to South Africa. South Africa has a population of around 47 million people. We have strong bilateral ties with South Africa, and these are evidenced in some of the other bilateral agreements that the two countries have entered into. They include conventions and agreements that relate to extradition, defence information, air services and science and technology. So it is a significant relationship, and the significance is recognised through the existence of the most favoured nation obligation within the double tax agreement. In considering the impact of the changes, it is worth reflecting on what a double tax agreement is and what the effect of implementing a double tax agreement is-or, in this case, an amendment through the protocol to the double tax agreement. Double tax agreements are entered into by the contracting states and they set out the means by which each of those contracting states is to tax gains that occur either in respect of their residents or in respect of activities that have a source that relates to their jurisdiction. Obviously in a global economy, where flows of money, investment and capital are occurring across borders on not only a daily basis but a minute by minute basis, it is important to avoid double taxation. Individuals, corporations and entities right across the globe would be discouraged from investing in other nations if their productive efforts were to be taxed not only in the country where that gain was to be sourced but also back in their resident country. That would lead to a situation of double taxation. Where the two contracting states have met their obligations in relation to integrity-the integrity of their tax systems, the integrity of the systems that allow for an appropriate flow of information and an exchange of information to combat some of the practices of tax avoidance that might exist-countries come together and seek to allocate taxation rights to ensure the principle that one should not be double taxed is, at least in general terms, upheld. This protocol makes a number of specific technical changes that go a long way towards addressing those particular issues. I note that one of the key elements of the protocol is to update the provisions in relation to the prevention of tax discrimination. The protocol introduces new rules in this regard. They broadly align with the international tax treaty practice and protect Australian nationals and businesses operating in South Africa-and vice versa. It is a measure designed to ensure some freedom of investment between the two countries. In respect of dividends, I note that there are some changes brought about as a result of article 5 of the protocol, which, in effect, substitutes new provisions in article 10 of the original double tax agreement. The new dividends article provides for a withholding tax rate limit of five per cent for all nonportfolio intercorporate dividends. That replaces the existing zero rate for non-portfolio intercorporate dividends where those dividends are paid out of profits that have already borne the full rate of company tax. A 15 per cent rate applies for all other dividends. It is important to note that these measures really do bring about some harmonisation with the OECD model tax convention. The changes that have been made in respect of non-portfolio intercorporate dividends, and the withholding tax rate that is applicable therein, were negotiated in the context of the South African government's recent announcement, in their 2007-08 budget, of changes that they are making to their system of taxing corporate profits. These changes include the phasing out of the secondary tax on companies, which is not subject to treaty limitations, and they will be introducing a that new dividend tax on shareholders. The implementation of these changes to domestic South African law is subject to the renegotiation of dividend withholding tax rates by South Africa in several of its tax treaties. In particular, that involves the tax treaty that exists with Australia. Australian non-portfolio investment in South Africa will benefit; I think we will benefit greatly from the reduced total South African tax on corporate profits which will be brought about as a result of these measures. Franked dividends paid to South African residents will continue to be exempt from withholding tax, which is standard practice right across the international tax arena. In terms of interest, article 6 of the protocol, which effectively amends article 11 of the double tax agreement, relates to the taxation of interest. Source country tax on interest will continue to be limited to 10 per cent. However, importantly, there have been some changes that ensure that no tax will be chargeable in the source country on the interest derived by the government of the other country or from the investment of official reserve assets or financial institutions resident in the other country. This is a particular exemption that is commonplace in some of the other more recent double tax agreements that Australia has entered into. Those exemptions will, of course, be subject to safeguards to discourage tax avoidance. The general limit for royalties-perhaps the most typical example of those payments is payments in respect of the granting of intellectual property rights-will be reduced from 10 per cent to five per cent. The protocol provides that amounts derived from equipment leasing, including container leasing, will be excluded from the royalty definition. These amounts will either be treated as profits from the international transport operatralia. tions article or under the business profits article. In addition to these measures, the protocol also contains an expanded list of taxes. It contains a refined definition of ‘permanent establishment'. It contains provisions which align capital gains tax treatment more closely with Australian law and the OECD practice. Significantly, improved integrity measures are contained within the protocol to provide for a more effective exchange of information on a broader range of taxes, including the goods and services tax. I note that this particular agreement was entered into prior to the implementation of the goods and services tax in Australia. This is a standard measure that is being introduced into all of our renegotiated tax agreements. That is a summary of some of the key elements, in a technical sense, that will be implemented by the incorporation of the protocol into Australian law. It is worth noting that this particular agreement has been considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, and the committee has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. In the course of its deliberations the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties engaged in a fairly extensive process of consultation. I note from the national interest analysis that has been prepared in respect of this agreement that Treasury sought comments from the business community regarding issues that might be raised during the negotiations with South Africa. That involved consultations with the Tax Treaties Advisory Panel which, of course, includes members such as the Business Council of Australia, CPA Australia, the Corporate Tax Association, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the International Fiscal Association, the Investment and Financial Services Association, the Law Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Taxation Institute of AusIn addition to that, there has been consultation with the state and territory governments through the Commonwealth-State Standing Committee on Treaties. So there has been extensive consultation. I would like to turn to the broader issue of withholding taxes and comment also on some of the developments in relation to this government's efforts to establish Australia as a financial services hub. It is important to understand conceptually what withholding tax is. We have double taxation agreements which seek to allocate taxation rights but, notwithstanding the particular provisions of any double tax agreement, where income is derived in a country that is not the country of residence of the particular individual or entity that is deriving that gain, it is commonplace throughout the tax world for the source country to seek a share of the income tax that might be secured by the government in respect of those gains. The easiest way to do that is to impose a withholding tax. I note the recent comments of the shadow Treasurer on some of the other measures that this government has pursued in relation to very significant reductions in withholding tax rates and distributions from managed investment trusts. In responding to the Treasurer's ministerial statement earlier this week, the new shadow Treasurer made the following statement: It is symptomatic of a government that … says it wants to promote Australia as a financial services hub and then reduces withholding tax for foreigners. Implicit in that quote is the notion that there is some contradiction between the two propositions-proposition A being to try and secure a place for ourselves as a financial services hub, and proposition B being a desire to reduce withholding taxes. I cannot for the life of me see where the contradiction exists. There is no such contradiction. In fact, if you were looking for tangible ways to attract greater investment to this country, one of the key means would be to reduce withholding taxes. That has been universally acknowledged right throughout the financial services sector. The first plank of the financial services hub initiatives was the reduction in withholding tax rates, which was implemented as a result of legislation that passed through the parliament earlier this year. This government has taken the existing rate of 30 per centone of the highest withholding tax rates in the world in respect of managed investment trust distributions-and is in the process of implementing a staged set of reductions which will ultimately reduce that withholding tax rate to 7.5 per cent in future years. will be reduced to 22.5 per cent in the 200809 year and to 15 per cent in the 2009-10 year. In that year it will be a final withholding tax, as opposed to a non-final one. In future years we foresee reductions down to 7.5 per cent. The significance of these measures cannot be underestimated, because they send a very clear message to international capital that Australia is a very favourable destination in which they may choose to invest. One of the strongest signals that we can send is the tion regime that is in existence. If we combine that measure with the continued revision of our double tax agreements, of which the incorporation of this protocol forms an integral part, we see that the government is very much committed to ensuring that the taxation requirements that are imposed domestically, but also those that have effect on international investors, will create a regime that will attract as much investment in Australia as possible. We have here before the House a very significant example of Australia's bilateral relationship with South Africa. It is a relationship that we value, and by implementing this protocol we are making good on the most favoured nation obligations contained within the double tax agreement. I commend the bill to the House.",81
40,Mr CHEESEMAN,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 will modernise and enhance the bilateral tax arrangements between Australia and South Africa. Furthermore, this bill will be a part of our commitment to refocus Australia's trade policy to help lay the foundations for our future prosperity. This will be a new tax protocol, building on the existing Australia-South Africa tax agreement which we entered into in 1999. Through the ratification of this bill, Australia will maintain its most favoured It nation obligation in the existing treaty whilst accommodating changes to South Africa's domestic laws. Australia's relationship with South Africa is well founded and continues to strengthen. This bilateral agreement on the double taxation mitigation strengthens a relationship that is framed through a number of other agreements that Australia maintains with South Africa. These agreements include the air services agreement, the agreement covering extradition, the defence information agreetaxa- ment and the science and technology cooperation agreement. Both countries are also collaborating on a range of projects relating to climate change, through the AustraliaSouth Africa Climate Change Partnership. Australia and South Africa also have a history of cooperation across a number of international forums. Most importantly of late, Australia and South Africa have continued to play a key role in setting the agenda for multilateral agricultural negotiations and pressing the World Trade Organisation membership to meet its full, far-reaching mandate to set World Trade Organisation arrangements through the Doha Round of trade negotiations. South Africa is Australia's largest trading partner in Africa. In 2007, two-way merchandise trade was $3.88 billion. This represents a significant slice of Australia's total trade with sub-Saharan Africa, which in 2007 was $5.22 billion. This is a very significant relationship. It is imperative that, with any nation that we have a significant relationship with, we have well-structured and current policy frameworks to nurture and foster those relationships. With domestic changes there is a carry-on effect in bilateral agreements. These changes need to be addressed promptly to maintain the nature of agreements and provide ongoing support and security in the area of trade and investment. In reviewing the policy frameworks to incorporate domestic changes, there is an opportunity to mitigate problems such as double taxation and prevent fiscal invasion in relation to income flowing between Australia and South Africa. Tax discrimination in other countries' tax systems can be a significant barrier to Australian investment opportunities. Through this agreement, the prevention of discriminatory tax practices is enacted and the provision of non-discriminatory articles addresses the most favoured nation obligation that we currently have. The bilateral economic and trade relations between Australia and South Africa continue to grow. South Africa is Australia's largest and most dynamic market in Africa, and South African investment dominates investment from the African continent to Australia. Importantly, whilst this bill brings the fiscal bilateral agreement with South Africa up to speed, it also brings closer alignment with the standards set by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Provisions within the new protocol include a five per cent rate for all non-portfolio incorporated dividends, a 15 per cent rate for all other dividends and an amendment to the withholding tax rates applying to those dividends. Australian non-portfolio investment in South Africa will generally benefit from reduced total South African tax on corporate profits as a result of these changes. In responding to the needs of both Australian and South African business and ensuring the protection of Australia's revenue base, the new protocol includes a number of other key changes. The new protocol updates the capital gains treatment so that it aligns more closely with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development norms to assist trade and investment flows between the two countries. The new protocol modernises the exchange of information provisions to conform to the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation standards that currently exist. This allows the tax administrators of both countries to share tax information. The new protocol also introduces integrity measures which will provide for the cross-border collection of tax debts. Australian non-portfolio investment in South Africa will generally benefit from a reduced South African tax on total corporate profits as a result of these changes. The treaty has been considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which has recommended that binding treaty action is to be taken. By preventing tax discrimination and providing certainty in the tax treatment of cross-border income flows, there is a reduction in compliance burdens on taxpayers. Australia is meeting the challenges proposed in the changes to South African domestic fiscal laws. Australia must also rise to conform to current international standards. This is sound economic practice.",85

42,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the Treasurer's comments in this place yesterday: … there is a need for very substantial action it comes to the base rate of the pension. Why won't the government do something now, right now, for the pensioners who deserve that action?",87
43,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indicate to the Leader of the Opposition that in the May budget the government did act to assist Australian pensioners. In the May budget the government did act to increase the utilities allowance and provide a $500 cash bonus for age pensioners. As the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, made clear in the parliament yesterday, pensioners are receiving, as this parliament sits in this period, indexation for a single pensioner of $15.30 per week and $128 from the new utilities allowance. The government provided these additional payments because we recognised that it is very tough for Australia's pensioners. These were new arrangements not provided by the previous government: the increased utilities allowance and the $500 cash bonus provided in this government's budget in May. As the Leader of the Opposition is aware, there is a comprehensive review being undertaken of the age pension. The opposition indicated when this matter was before a Senate committee that it understood the need for a review in this area. I indicate to the Leader of the Opposition, as was dealt with in this House yesterday, that the proposition that the Leader of the Opposition put before this parliament would not have addressed the needs of two million pensioners, including carers, couples and people with disabilities. It would have even failed to include 13,000 single carers and disability pensioners who are over age pension age. There was no indexation of the $30 and there was no understanding of the way in which a variation like this relates to other changes in payments to pensioners. The government is getting on with the job of delivering practical measures to help Auswhen tralian pensioners now. The government is engaged in a comprehensive review of the circumstances of Australian pensioners and our pension system. The government has made that perfectly clear. The government will respond when that review is completed. Economy",87
44,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister outline the need for responsible economic management to see Australia through these difficult global economic times?,87
45,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As members of this parliament are well aware, and as many Australians are thinking and talking about, we confront the most difficult global economic circumstances in a quarter of a century. We have seen major falls in the United States stock market. Global stock markets have fallen by more than 20 per cent since the recent round of instability began and markets continue to be volatile. Overnight the US Treasury Secretary testified before the Senate Banking Committee. He urged support for the US government's plan for major financial institutions and he stated that, to avoid a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets that threaten American families' financial well-being, the viability of businesses, both small and large, and the very health of our economy, the measures taken in the US were necessary. The US Federal Reserve chairman also noted overnight that difficult conditions are likely to persist. He said: Despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and other agencies, global financial markets remain under extraordinary stress. These are difficult circumstances, but it is important to understand that this nation is better placed than most countries to deal with this turmoil. We have a strong, wellregulated banking sector. Australian businesses are continuing to undertake record levels of investment. We have taken further steps to strengthen Australia's financial markets and we have built a strong surplus, which we need more than ever as a buffer to help withstand these challenges. The Treasurer and I today commented on the release of the most recent International Monetary Fund report on this country's circumstances. It noted that this country does have a prudent fiscal policy and it noted, with approval, the budget surplus settings of the government. It also noted the wellregulated nature of our financial markets and it welcomed the government's major reform agenda working through the Council of Australian Governments to achieve profound reforms that will make a difference for this nation's future. Intergovernmental agreements can be complex, but for Australians this is about better schools, national approach to climate change, a national approach to homelessness, working together to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage for Indigenous Australians and working together for a seamless national economy. These are the major issues of our time, and we are working to bring this profound round of reform to this country. The government is also working through the Senate to deliver its budget. And, of course, in delivering that budget-in delivering that all-important surplus-we continue to face obstruction and economic vandalism from the Liberal Party. It seems even with a new leader the Liberal Party is intent on derailing the government's fiscal policy direction. To take one example of this-though, of course, we have heard of many-the position of the Liberal Party on the Medicare levy surcharge shows just how out of touch it is with the needs of this nation to deliver a budget surplus and just how out of touch it is with Australians. This is a measure that would provide 330,000 Australians with up to $1,500 in tax relief per year-a tax cut for those working Australians-and the Liberal Party is standing in the way of it. Mr Turnbull interjecting",87
46,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And the Leader of the Opposition has just confirmed that he is standing in the way of a tax cut for 330,000 Australians. Can I say to the Leader of the Liberal Party, now known in this House as the Merchant of Venice: that is a pound of flesh, and he should consider the circumstances of those Australians. Rather than continue to reaffirm that he will stand in the way of that tax cut, he should do something for working Australians and enable them to get that $1,500.",88

49,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Now that internal government documents reveal that the government considered and rejected a $30 a week increase in the base rate of the pension in April this year, does Acting Prime Minister stand by the government's description of an extra $30 a week as a ‘stunt' and a ‘ploy'? Acting Prime Minister, who is engaged in hypocrisy now?",89
50,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Firstly, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the document which I take him to be referring to-a document that has been in the mediais not a document that can be characterised in the way that he has characterised it. This a document which summarised stakeholder views. Yes, there were a variety of views, and we know that there are pensioner organisations pushing for an increase in the base rate of the pension. None of that is new. This is a document that canvassed stakeholder views and a document that concluded that this was a complex matter and required a comprehensive and thorough-going review. On the question of hypocrisy, which I have been invited to comment upon, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is for him to explain to the Australian people why he ruled out an increase in the base rate of the pension as Liberal Party policy in May this year only now to engage in the questioning that he is engaging in in this parliament-a fundamental shift in the Leader of the Opposition's position from May this year until he assumed the opposition leader's chair. We know of course that, when he was shadow Treasurer, he ruled out the very policy he now says that he stands for. Economy",89
51,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the conclusions of today's International Monetary Fund assessment of Australia's economy and financial institutions?,89
52,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the Solomon for his question. We did receive the IMF report early this morning. It is a report card on the resilience of the Australian economy-a good report card on the government's plans for it. Like the government, the IMF is saying that we can expect some slowing as a result of the fallout from the global financial crisis. But the report also adds weight to the government's view that, whilst we are not immune from global difficulties, we are certainly well placed to withstand the is fallout. If I could just quote from the IMF report, this is what the IMF executive directors have said about Australia's strength through responsible economic management: Looking ahead, Directors considered that the sound macroeconomic framework should permit Australia to weather the global downturn and to contain inflationary pressures. The IMF report also went on to give the government's reform effort a very, very big tick. The report strongly commends the government's budget",89
53,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,89
54,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it does not. Unfortunately for those opposite, it does no such thing. Until they put up their hands over there for inflation at 16-year highs, they cannot claim any of the credit. They can claim no credit whatsoever. This is what the IMF had to say on the economic settings of the May budget: Saving some of the revenue from the commodity price boom in three new funds will take pressure off monetary policy in the near term and enable increased … investment over the medium term. That is what they had to say about our investment funds. The IMF go to great lengths to point out that capacity constraints in the Australian economy have been responsible for inflationary pressures and, because they were left unattended for so long by those opposite, the result was inflationary pressures in the economy. That is why the IMF have given the government a very big tick for attending to those inflationary pressures and for expanding the productivity capacity of the Australian economy. They went on to say this about the agenda: … if implemented fully, the broad reform agenda should enhance the flexibility of the economy and lift productivity and labour force participation. They also went on to talk about the quality of Australia's banking and regulatory systems, and I quote again: The banking sector is sound with stable profits, high capitalization, and few nonperforming On this side of the House we do welcome the IMF's assessment, and we cannot understand why it is not welcomed by those opposite. Those opposite have been walking around talking about bipartisanship. You would have thought that they would be supporting a responsible surplus if they wanted to be bipartisan. They would not be up in the Senate vandalising the surplus; they would be getting behind the government and they would be getting behind our surplus and they would be voting for it in the Senate. So, on one hand, the phoneys over there want to argue that they are responsible and that they want to be bipartisan and, on the other hand, they vandalise a surplus which is absolutely essential for Australia at a time of global uncertainty. We certainly do welcome this report, its support for our long-term agenda, its support for our reform agenda in education, infrastructure, business deregulation, climate change and tax. This government is doing everything it possibly can to keep striking a responsible balance between relief for families, support for pensioners and the long-term investment future of this country. There is only one thing that stands in the way of that: the vandalism of the Liberal and National parties up there in the Senate. It is about time we had some responsible behaviour from those opposite. Until they behave responsibly, all of their protestations about standing for responsible management are as phoney as their support for pensioners. Pensions and Benefits",89
55,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Does the government believe that over 70,000 veterans who fought for our country and 700 widow B pensioners whose husbands made the ultimate sacrifice are not worth a $30-aweek increase in their pensions to offset the loans. rising cost of living?",90
56,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a certain aspect of this question which the opposition has once again got wrong. The figure of 70,000 single-service pensioners the shadow minister has referred to actually takes into account a number of different groups. In fact, if we go to veterans who are single service pensioners, only around 35,000 are included in the definitions that the opposition sought to put forward in their motion. Some 28,000 of that figure of 70,000 are in fact on partner service pensions. They are overwhelmingly the widows of veterans who had qualifying service and who have of course passed away. They do not qualify as war widows. The definition put forward in the proposal by the opposition specifically excluded them, because it referred to veterans only. This government, in its policy when in opposition, led the way for the then government to address issues with respect to the maintenance of the incomes of our most disabled veterans. This government, both in opposition and in government, has led the way to address some of those long standing issues. There is more to do, and the government has made it very clear that there is. the fact of the matter is this: the opposition put forward the figure of 70,000 single service pensioners but, when you go to the detail of what they proposed, they are only covering half of that number. Once again, they have left out thousands and thousands in a rush to put forward a policy option which does not deal with the inherent problems that they say they are dealing with. Once again, they have missed the point. Economy  is to the Assistant Treasurer. What challenges face the Australian financial services sector? Does the current situation present any opportunities for the sector, and what is the government doing to harness those opportunities?",90
57,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All members of the House would be aware of the turbulence that has convulsed world financial markets throughout the course of this year. One of the world's oldest investment banks has filed for bankruptcy, the US government has tipped billions of dollars into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the world's largest insurer has been nationalised by the United States government and, across the United States and Europe, markets continue to suffer unprecedented turmoil. A key challenge for the government and for our independent regulators is to remain vigilant in the face of these overseas events. Our prudential regulation is amongst the best in the world, as was recognised by the IMF overnight. So we are well armed, but we are not bulletproof in this turbulence around the world. But even in adversity there can be opportunity. In these troubling financial times there will be opportunities for Australia. In these turbulent times investors will be looking for a safe place in which to invest their funds, and Australia fits the bill. That is But why the government continues to take concrete steps to transform Australia into an international financial services hub. It is a government priority to make Australia a leading financial centre in Asia. Tomorrow I will be introducing legislation into the House to reform the way the tax act deals with managed funds-an important step in promoting Australia as a financial services centre. Of course, these changes all flow from our reduction in the withholding tax on budget night-a very important reform that has been widely welcomed. I would have thought it would be something that would be welcomed on both sides of the House, but unfortunately that is not the case. I am asked to report on challenges to the financial sector, and one of the challenges is the shadow Treasurer's complete lack of understanding of economics. The Treasurer has informed the House of some fundamental errors by the shadow Treasurer, and it is with a heavy heart that I have to report yet another error by the shadow Treasurer. In her now infamous speech on Monday, she said this at the dispatch box: It is symptomatic of a government that is unsure of where to go or how far to go. This is a government that says it wants to promote Australia as a financial services hub and then reduces withholding tax for foreigners. I even checked the Hansard this morning and it is still there. Sometimes mistakes can tragically disappear from the Hansard but this one is still there. She came in in full flight, the Wall Street Journal in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other, and off she went to launch an attack on our withholding tax policy. This is an initiative which has been widely welcomed across the financial services sector. Stephen Dunne, the managing director of AMP Capital Investors, said: Reducing the withholding tax for foreigninvestors… will strengthen Australia's competitiveness as an … investment centre.

78,Mr BIDGOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Why are changes to the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds necessary?,93
79,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. Obviously I informed the House yesterday of a changed proposal that is being put to the Senate when there is a debate on the Medicare levy surcharge. We have of course been encouraging senators to support this proposal. But I noticed that the new shadow minister for health, the member for Dickson, came out of the blocks very fast yesterday to say that this was outrageous and a proposal that he would not support. I would like to draw the House's attention to comments made by the new shadow minister for health in August 2006, when, as the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Dutton revealed the numbers of taxpayers who were being hit by the Medicare levy surcharge and revealed that they had doubled since the introduction of the measure in 1997. This was not a passing comment; this was a detailed answer to a question on notice. The member for Dickson, the new health spokesperson for the opposition, conceded that in 1997, when this measure was first introduced, 167,000 people were paying this tax and by 2001 198,000 people were paying this tax and by 2002 it was 235,000 people-and it was very good of the member for Dickson at the time to take the House through these numbers-next it was 282,000 and, by 2004, it was up to 362,000. As we know from other tax office figures, by 2005-06 there were 465,000 Australians paying a tax because the previous Howard government was too lazy to change flak the tax thresholds. So we know there is an opportunity for the member for Dickson, the new health spokesperson, and the new Leader of the Opposition to note ‘Rudd's $1,200 health savings' as headlined by the Daily Telegraph, which I am holding. The opposition has a choice: do they want to support $1,200 in tax relief for many average working families or are they going to keep opposing this measure? When the new Leader of the Opposition made his first speech after having become the Leader of the Opposition, he told his first press conference: I know what it is like to be very short of money. … I know Australians are doing it tough and some Australians, even in the years of greatest prosperity, will always do it tough. The Leader of the Opposition has an opportunity now to provide relief to those very many families who are doing it tough. He can direct his senators in the other place to vote for this measure, and 330,000 people will immediately benefit from it. It is time for the opposition to stand up and say whether they are for tax relief or not. Is the Liberal Party any longer a party that supports tax relief or not? There will be an opportunity to vote for this in the Senate today, tomorrow or in the coming days, and the Leader of the Opposition and the new shadow minister for health and ageing can provide that relief to 330,000 people. They should do it now. Medicare Levy Surcharge",93
80,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question goes to the Minister for Health and Ageing and follows her previous comment. Given the government's revised Medicare levy surcharge thresholds, will the minister inform the House how much private health insurance premiums will increase as a result of these changes? How many people-in particular, how many of the 360,000 older Australians with private health insurance earning less than $30,000 a year-are now expected to drop out of private health insurance and move into the public health system?",93
81,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am particularly pleased to answer this question, and I congratulate the member on his new position.

If I recall correctly-maybe people on this side of the House will be able to help me here: which government was it that pulled a billion dollars out of our public hospital system? It was the opposition. And which government",94
82,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on relevance: a past minister who told the parliament the truth is entitled to a detailed answer. But I bet she hasn't got it; it is just more pensioner-bashing!",94
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor will leave the chamber for one hour understanding order 94(a). The member for O'Connor then left the chamber.,94
84,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was asking: which government is it that in the first nine months of coming to office has put an extra billion dollars into our public hospital system, $600 million into elective surgery and millions of dollars into nursing-all issues ignored by the previous government? What I am sure the new shadow minister is aware of is that private health insurers do make requests to government to increase their premiums each year. That premium round is due at the end of the year. They start putting in their submissions to PHIAC and others, the actuarial studies are done and, by February or so, we will be asked to approve those premium increases. I have made it absolutely clear that I will take a very dim view of any insurers who think that adjustingMr Hockey interjecting",94
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is answering the question.,94
86,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am trying to answer the question. I am not particularly being provided with the opportunity by those opposite. We know that, when it comes to private health insurance and investment in our public hospitals, those opposite always want to go for the cheap line. They never want to look at the actual statistics. They never want to look at the actual detail. They do not care about the working families who would get tax relief through this measure. They do not want to have an explanation of the premium round increases. Mr Dutton-How much will they rise by? Answer the question!",94
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dickson has asked the question. The minister has the call.,94
88,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If the shadow ministerMr Dutton-Answer the question!,94
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dickson is warned!,94
90,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wonder whether, if I speak slowly enough, he will get thrown out. It seems like he is going to approach being the shadow minister as someone who just wants to interrupt and never wants to actually hear the answer to the question. As the shadow minister knows, the premium round will be dealt with in the new year. We have made very clear that we will take a dim view of private health insurance funds who think that a tax whack for working families is an excuse to try to jack up their premiums. We will take a very dim view of that and we have put them on notice of that. But, if we want to look back at the premium rises that occurred under the previous government year after year after year so those who were in private health insurance paid more and more and more, courtesy of premiums always ticked and flicked by the previous government, he can go back and look at those figures. Of course it would not be appropriate for me to predict what applications private health insurers will make to the government. It is a matter for them. It is a matter for us then to assess. It would not be appropriate for us to try to make some estimate today, as the shadow minister well knows.",94
91,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Trade. What do the Mortimer report and the report of the International Monetary Fund tell us about Australia's trade performance? Is the minister aware of any recent statements in relation to Australia's trade performance?,95
92,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and I know that the member understands the fundamental importance to his electorate and to the nation of lifting our export performance. The Mortimer report and the IMF report both have a pretty simple message: first, that trade is esThe sential for jobs and economic growth. Both reports then go on to say that we have to lift our export performance. Mortimer says that if we do not lift our exports foreign lenders will not keep servicing our ballooning foreign debt, and the IMF report says that unless we lift our exports our current account deficit just cannot be sustained. I am also asked what Mortimer has to say about our recent trade performance. He gives it a damning scorecard in terms of the previous government's performance. It failed on export growth. Since 2001, the export volume growth rate has fallen to a quarter of that in the 1990s. It failed on productivity growth, achieving zero productivity growth in 2007, after productivity grew rapidly in the 1990s. And it also failed on infrastructure investment, which, according to Mortimer, substantially limited export volumes and competitiveness. That is the reason that the previous government recorded 72 consecutive months of trade deficits. No government in the history of this nation has done as poorly as that. So far as Mortimer is concerned, two-thirds of our cumulative trade deficit, $92 billion worth, was incurred in the last five years of the previous governmentand it managed that performance despite the resources boom. Trade I am also asked if there are any recent statements on our trade performance. Well, there are. They were made the other day by the new shadow Treasurer, and she is the one in this place who wants to be judged on her economic credentials. She actually thinks the Howard government's legacy on trade was a great one. Mr Hockey-Yes!",95
93,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is certainly not what the records show. But on Monday-I think her first intervention since her appointment to the job-she had this to say: diversification of our exports has reduced the volatility of the terms of trade. In that single sentence she is wrong on three key economic fronts. First, as Mortimer points out, the terms of trade effect is caused by strong world demand, not by the diversification of our exports. Second, we did not get a diversification of exports under your term of office in government; in fact, we narrowed our export base. The services sector rate of growth in exports fell from 8½ per cent to two per cent, andMr Hockey-Why?",95
94,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because you did not have the right policy. And the manufacturing export growth went backwards. Third, as to the reduced volatility in the terms of trade she is simply wrong. There has been strong upward movement in the terms of trade over the past five years. The shadow Treasurer has been accused of plagiarism in this place. I do not make that complaint in terms of that statement because, quite frankly, no-one else would be silly enough to make the mistake of getting three economic facts so wrong in one sentence. Economy",96
95,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasis urer to the recent $5 billion in profits this quarter of Australia's big four banks, which is an increase of more than 15 per cent. How many second-tier providers of mortgage finance, who were keeping competitive pressure on the big four banks, have stopped lending, leaving the big four banks with 90 per cent of the mortgage market and record profits? What is the government doing about the prime residential mortgage-backed securities market which provided that muchneeded competition to the big four banks?",96
96,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for her question. It is true that the banks have been very profitable in Australia, particularly in the first quarter of this year, and that is why I was so absolutely insistent earlier this year that if there were to be a cut in the official RBA cash rate then that cut should be passed on. Mr Hockey-Answer the question!",96
97,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will answer. I am going to go all the way through it. This is a very important question. It is one that the government is very, very concerned about and has been very active on. But you have got to understand the background. It is quite complex, and those opposite may have some difficulty understanding it. It is true that the big banks have been very profitable, and that is why the government was absolutely insistent that if there were a cut in the cash rate then that should be passed on-and it was passed on, and that is a very good thing. But the government is concerned about the degree of competition in the mortgage market, and that is one of the reasons we have been so insistent on putting in place a bank-switching package, something those opposite could not manage to do in over 12 years. It is also the case that the securitisation market has dried up because of events in global markets. That is true as well and that producing a situation where the market is less competitive. Of course, that outlook changes by the day and by the week, given events in global financial markets. That is why I have made it very clear on a number of occasions publicly that should further action be required to put further competitive forces into that market then the government would take the appropriate steps at the appropriate time. We acted earlier in the year when it was very clear there was not enough liquidity in the market. There were not enough government bonds and we put more out there. We brought legislation into this parliament to issue further government bondsMr Costello-That is nothing to do with it.",96
98,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, the current Leader of the Opposition thought it was a good idea at the time-something you could not manage to do. The current Leader of the Opposition understood the need to put more liquidity in the market, and we did issue more bonds. We also, in that legislation, gave authority to the government for the AOFM to be more active in the area, should that be required. We stand ready to take further action in the mortgage market to make it more competitive so that Australian families out there get a fair deal. That is the government's position.",96
99,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. Will the minister please update the House on the government's program of regulatory reform in the wake of today's report from the International Monetary Fund?",97
100,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Braddon for his question. Those opposite, who lay claim to economic credibility, should take a long, hard look at this report, the latest International Monetary Fund report on Australia's economic performance. The International Monetary Fund strongly endorses the government's economic strategy and importantly has commended the government on its long-term reform agenda. The IMF report says the directors considered that: … if implemented fully, the broad reform agenda should enhance the flexibility of the economy and lift productivity and labor force participation. The report goes on to say: Successful implementation of further reforms would enhance the economy's flexibility, lift ductivityhear, hear!and foster labor force participation. Reform is essential to take full advantage of the mining boom that is centered on Queensland and Western Australia, that will require capital and labor to move from other states. The Rudd government is helping to create the conditions for sustained, low-inflationary economic growth. The government is pursuing an ambitious long-term reform agenda aimed at restarting productivity growth. This follows a decade of squandered opportunity when productivity growth after the boom times of the 1990s slipped away until, last year, as mentioned by the Minister for Trade, it not just had fallen to a low level, not just Economy had slowed but had stopped. It had ground to a complete halt. It was zero. The government is investing in an education revolution to restart productivity growth. We are working, through the Council of Australian Governments, to reduce regulation in 27 different areas of reform. We are doing this to advance Australia towards a seamless national economy as called for by the Business Council of Australia. As the IMF says, this government's reform agenda will help lift productivity growth, because today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. I note that the newly elected Leader of the Opposition said, on 19 September, just the other day: There is a need for bipartisanship and a constructive approach to the economy. I invite the opposition leader to support the Rudd government's program of long-term economic reform as endorsed today by the International Monetary Fund. Taxation",97
101,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Why is the government preparing to slug farm employees, harvesting and pro- other contractors who are already battling the drought, and hard working doctors and vets serving rural communities, with an extra tax, ranging from $1,100 to $4,050, on the cost of a Toyota LandCruiser?",97
102,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. I gather that the opposition feel compelled to continue to justify their vandalism of the government's surplus up in the Senate. It is the case that the government's proposal does not affect dramatically the bulk of purchases of cars in the rural sector. Mr Hockey-What about farm workers?,97
103,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So a ute is a luxury car, is it? Mr Speaker, those opposite introduced the luxury car tax. Let us be very clear about where it came from and what its origins were. Let us be very clear that we increased it in the last budget as a measure to build a strong surplus. I believe it was a fair measure-a small amount of money that many people buying luxury cars could afford to pay. We have had a constructive discussion in the Senate with the minor parties and the Greens and, as a consequence of that, this bill has passed, despite the reckless",98
104,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,98
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer having the call is not an opportunity for nine or 10 people on the left to talk over him at the same time.,98
106,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All the chatter is to hide their deep embarrassment about their activities in the Senate. They are up there defending Porsche drivers, up there defending the drivers of luxury cars, against the interests the Australian people and lower interest rates for working families and farmers. That has been the consequence of their actions in the Senate. Interest rates will be higher for longer as a consequence of their attempts to raid the surplus and also the reckless spending that they have now committed to. The Leader of the Opposition, in a 20-minute press conference on day 1, spent $20 billion-$6 billion in raiding the surplus in the budget and a further $14 billion. The opposition now have the hide to come into the House and complain that a few people buying top-end vehicles are paying too much tax. We reached a sensible arrangement with the minor parties in the Senate. There has been more economic responsibility in the little fingers of the Greens and the Independents and the minor parties in the Senate than there has been in the Liberal and National parties. This is going to continue, apparently. The Leader of the Opposition is going to pay a very high price if he is going to continue to wreck the budget in the Senate, because it will be clear to everybody who is economically irresponsible in this country and who has a responsible approach to budget management. The IMF have given this government a very big tick today, and the opposition is trying to demolish it. National Police Remembrance Day",98
107,Mr HAYES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs. Will the minister inform the House about the upcoming National Police Remembrance Day?,98
108,Mr DEBUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Werriwa for that question and, of course, acknowledge his very long history representing police, particularly during his time with the Police Federation of Australia. National Police Remembrance Day is observed by all jurisdictions and on Monday, of 22 September a number of speakers from all sides in this House supported a motion by the member for Werriwa to mark 29 September as National Police Remembrance Day. I am sure that the House would also want me to express support for the 50,000 men and women of Australia's police forces who work in Australia and in our region to protect the lives of those who live in our civilian environment. It is shocking to realise that, in the past 20 years, 111 police officers have been killed on duty. This means on average nearly six a year. Unfortunately, it is mostly young officers who have their lives cut short while they are serving their communities. Out of those 111, 88 were constables. That means that the majority of those who lost their lives were under the age of 30. There were officers like Glenn MCEnallay, who was ambushed and shot at close range by four men in Sydney in 2002 while he was sitting in his patrol car. Glenn MCEnallay was 26. Last month marked the 10th anniversary since Victoria Police officers Gary Silk and Rod Miller were brutally gunned down during a stakeout to catch two armed robbers. Their funerals, many will remember, touched the nation and, as a recent newspaper article on that anniversary mentioned, most police officers can tell you exactly where they were and what they were doing when they first learnt of that double murder. It is also important at this time to recognise the risks faced by officers serving offshore, who serve in unpredictable and often hostile environments. This year, for the first time since 1944, there have been no police deaths on duty in Australia. Hopefully, we can reach the end of 2008 without that situation changing. If you put your life on the line for the protection of the public on a regular basis, then you are performing a public service of the highest order. It is a level of selflessness that most us never have to contemplate. In 2006, more than 700 police came to Canberra from every state and territory to witness the commemoration of a national monument to recognise the service of Australian police officers who have died on duty. At the time of its dedication there were 719 names commemorated on individual brass touchstones. Next Monday, five new historical touchstones which date from 1884 to 1999 will bear the names of additional police deaths that have been discovered through ongoing research. It is obvious enough that police are essential to the fabric of a civilised society, and we must continue to show our support for the work they do. They have a unique status, and that is reflected in the exercise of powers that the community permits them to uphold the law. Confidence in the proper use of those powers is essential. The Police Federation of Australia, through its president Vince Kelly, has asked that the government give serious consideration to the creation of a national police service medal for serving police officers. The government has, of course, been very willing to examine that request in more detail. While I understand there is quite a lot of work to be done to advance that proposal, I am pleased to advise the House that the government is working closely with the relevant authorities to clarify the formal requirements and to consider the necessary protocols in detail. I believe we have to talk to the palace about these things. At this time of remembrance it is also appropriate that we give consideration to how we do recognise serving officers. I hope to be in a position to provide the House with an update on the matter of a national police service medal in the not-too-distant future. We thank the thousands of men and women in state and territory police forces and the Ausof tralian Federal Police who serve our community so well and confront risky, difficult situations on a daily basis.",98
109,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: on behalf of the opposition I strongly associate the coalition with the remarks by the Minister for Home Affairs about National Police Remembrance Day. The courage, heroism and sacrifice of police officers in the course of their duty are a heavy price that they pay to ensure that we live in a safe society. Representing and leading a party room which has a number of former police officers in its ranks, we are very pleased to associate ourselves, as I said, with the minister's very generous and eloquent remarks. Taxation",99
110,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Why is an X-type Jaguar excluded from Labor's increased luxury car tax but a Toyota Landcruiser for a shearer is not?,99
111,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are a couple of issues here. First of all, the vast majority of fourwheel drives are not impacted at all; and, secondly, there were some fuel-efficient measures put into the bill because of the unconstructive attitude of those opposite.",100
112,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,100
113,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And, if those opposite want to be critical of that, it is entirely their fault. Joint Strike Fighter",100
114,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence. Will the minister update the House on the procurement of the joint strike fighter? Why is it important for the government to consider this acquisition carefully and get it right?,100
115,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair for his question. His electorate, of course, is home to one of Australia's primary Air Force bases and he, better than most in this place, understands how important it is for Australia to maintain its superiority in air combat capability in our region and how important that is to Australia's national security. He also understands that the government's next investment in our next generation of air combat aircraft will be the single largest Defence investment ever made in the history of the Commonwealth, with up to $16 billion in outlays. So this is a decision that we absolutely must get right. Despite the best, and reckless, efforts of those who sit opposite, the government will not be pressured into making a decision on the run. We saw that practice from the former government with respect to air combat capability. We saw the public debate and controversy generated by that approach to these important issues when they ran headlong into a rushed decision on the purchase of the US Super Hornets from the US Navy. Let us go back to that process for one quick moment. That spirited debate about air combat capability emerged prior to the last election because the former government failed to properly plan for our future air combat capability. Rather than plan for and anticipate the possibility that the F111 may need to be retired early, the former government simply sat on its hands. And then, of course, off the back of a report, when it was clear that the F111 might need to be retired early, the government subsequently ran into a very quick decision to purchase the Super Hornet so as not to be accused, in an election year, of allowing an air combat capability gap to emerge-determined, in an election year, not to be charged with that important charge. And, of course, the way in which the Super Hornet purchase was entered into was not so much about our national security but about saving the political bacon of the then Prime Minister and those who sat behind him. There was no comparative analysis done with other aircraft-no proper analysis done whatsoever. Indeed, in a sense, an analysis would have been useless, because to meet its political needs the former government directed RAAF to deliver an interim aircraft by 2010, and the reality was that there was only one aircraft in the world that could have been delivered into Australian hands by 2010-that, of course, was the Super Hornet. That is what the lack of a planning process leads you to in these important areas of defence capability. After the election, as promised, the new government reviewed the Super Hornet purchase and in the end, given all the circumstances, came to the conclusion that, as a filler, the Super Hornet was more than capable of meeting Australia's defence needs. But we did not just leave it at that. We determined to work hard in securing better value for taxpayers' money, securing aircraft more cheaply and securing aircraft with greater capability. These changes are now being put into effect and, as a consequence, the taxpayer will secure better value for money. There is only one fifth-generation combat aircraft in service across the globe at the moment, and that is the F22 Raptor flown by the United States of America. The only fifthgeneration aircraft that might emerge on the market in coming years is of course the Joint Strike Fighter. The government does not yet have any guarantees about the capability the Joint Strike Fighter offers, nor about when that capability, if possible, may be delivered or what the cost of that aircraft will be. So we are determined not to repeat the mistakes of the former government, not to be rushed into a decision, particularly given that we do not have to sign up to the Joint Strike Fighter until some time around mid next year. There is no rush to enter into this contract. So we will take our time with this decision to ensure that taxpayers get value for money and that the Defence Force, the RAAF in particular, gets the capability it needs to keep the country safe and secure. Yesterday we took receipt of the Mortimer report on defence procurement in this country. Mortimer appealed for a more rigorous approach to these capability decisions. Yesterday the opposition supported the Mortimer review; today, through their defence spokesman, they want to throw all that rigour out the window. So I have some advice for the opposition leader: this debate coming from the opposition's ventures about our air combat capability does us no good. It is no good for our national security and it is certainly no good for our commercial interests as we go, as a development partner, into further negotiations about the Joint Strike Fighter. We are entering into a commercial arrangement and the assistance from the opposition does the country no good whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition needs to understand that this is not like going down to the local Rolls Royce dealer to buy the next model. Even if it were, not even the Leader of the Opposition would stump up the cash for the latest Rolls Royce without first getting some assurance of what capability it delivers, what the price will be and when it will be delivered. Leader of the Opposition, I suggest you pull them into line. Emissions Trading Scheme",100
116,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy. Can the minister confirm that he personally has been told of investment projects that have already been lost to Australia because of the great uncertainty embodied in the government's green paper on an emissions trading scheme?,101
117,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for the question and in doing so indicate that the government is in detailed discussions with a range of industries about the nature of the green paper going to the development of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in Australia. The government are serious about not only getting the scheme right domestically but also making sure that we pull our weight internationally-hence the government's commitment to work with like-minded nations on clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage. It is also fair to say that, in giving proper consideration to these matters, industry have raised their concerns. It is a genuine green paper process, and our responsibility is to take those concerns on board so as to guarantee that we produce a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme which is right economically, in terms of ensuring that Australia is still an attractive place for investment, and also guarantees that we make progress in accordance with our election commitment on reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Housing Affordability",101
118,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women. How will the government's election policy to deliver new first home saver accounts help young Australians buy a house?,102
119,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. I know that she is one of the keenest and hardestworking doorknockers in this House. The fact that she has doorknocked more than 45,000 homes in her electorate in the last few years would have shown her that her electorate actually has a lower than average rate of home-ownership. I am very pleased to tell her and to tell other members in the House about the first home saver accounts that Australians aged between 18 and 65 will be able to open from 1 October. It is worth reminding the House that this government inherited historically low levels of housing affordability. When the Howard government came into office, the average home cost about four times the average annual wage. By the time they left office, it was about 7½ times the average annual wage. That of course made home-ownership a distant dream for many young people. Many of them stopped saving because home-ownership seemed so far out of reach. Saving a deposit is particularly hard when rents are high because of course it is very difficult to be putting money aside as well as paying higher rents. This government has been working very closely with the financial services industry to help set up these first home saver accounts, which Australians aged between 18 and 65 will be able to open from 1 October. I am very happy to report that the ANZ Bank, the Commonwealth Bank, AMP and 17 other deposit-taking institutions will have accounts registered with APRA to open from 1 October. In a week's time, hundreds of thousands of young people will be able to set up one of these accounts and start saving a deposit. These accounts provide a very strong incentive for young people to save rather than to spend their money because for every dollar they put into this account, up to $5,000 a year, the government will give them 17c on every dollar invested. For example, if a couple save $5,000 a year, they will receive an $850 contribution from the federal government. If a couple are both saving, they will receive $1,700 from the government on their savings. On top of that, earnings on the accounts will be taxed at the special low superannuation tax rate of 15 per cent. That means that a couple on average earnings putting aside 10 per cent of their income into individual first home saver accounts would be able to save more than $88,000 after five years. The very important thing about this is that that is about $13,000 more than if they had been putting the money into an ordinary savings account-a very important difference. These accounts will help people who would otherwise find it difficult to save a deposit for their first home. One of the great innovations of these accounts is that other family membersparents, perhaps grandparents-can also contribute to these accounts and see that government contribution as well. Particularly parents and grandparents, who are worried about whether their children and grandchildren will ever be well settled in a home of their own, can make these contributions, perhaps helping a young person set up an account on their 18th or 21st birthday. If grandparents, for example, put $100 into one of these accounts for someone's 21st birthday, the government would contribute $17 into that account. I would urge every young Australian who has a job, even a part-time job, to think about putting $20 a week into one of these accounts. By starting small and saving regularly not only do these young Australians develop a habit of saving that will serve them well later in life but also the wonder of compound interest will work on that money so that, by the time they are looking to use that money for a deposit, they will have a nice little nest egg. I will conclude by using the words of best-selling financial commentator and columnist, Scott Pape, who wrote: … the First Home Saver Account rewards first home savers for developing a long-term savings plan. … … … Anything that instils the importance of savings at the start of a young adult's life can only good thing. Emissions Trading Scheme",102
120,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"3.12 pm)My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. Given that this week Australia is hosting in Canberra the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, set up in 2003, why has the Prime Minister spent yet another $100 million duplicating this body just to give him something to talk about when he is in New York?",103
121,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian community would be concerned at the manner in which the opposition is seeking to undermine the confidence of the Australian community and our genuine endeavour to actually develop a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme which guarantees that we can do the right thing at home whilst doing the right thing internationally. In that context, I remind the House that on Monday this week the Prime Minister clearly indicated that our endeavours domestically and internationally to make real, practical progress with respect to the development of low-emissions coal technology are exceptionally important. The legislation currently before the Senate going to the issue of offshore carbon sequestration is part of the jigsaw that will enable us to make real progress in accordance with the expectations of the Australian community. The reason they expect us to make progress on this front is that they understand that, unlike what would have occurred with those on the other side of the House, we do not want the lights going out because we are a nation dependent on electricity, 80 per cent of which comes from coal fired power stations. That effectively means that we have to work with business, non-government organisations and like-minded countries and pool our resources in the best possible capacity be a domestically and internationally to get this low-emissions coal technology correct. It also means that we have to pull together a genuine international commitment with all nations working together to put those resources on the table, because time is running out. I remind the House that it was the G8 meeting held in Japan only a couple of months ago that actually said that we have to have 20 projects in place by 2010, with a view to demonstrating their commerciality by 2020. That is why the Prime Minister, on behalf of Australia, a nation that is dependent on coal for electricity to a large extent, and a nation that does well with respect to the export of coal, worth an estimated $43 billion this year, understands that we have to adopt a leadership position-unlike the failure on the other side with respect to leadership both in opposition and in government. The Australian government is about putting in place a capacity to do the right thing, to guarantee that we have a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that is relevant to the challenges of the 21st century both at home and abroad. I would have expected more of the former Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, because he understands the significance of this. But I simply say it sadly reflects not on him but on the lack of leadership of the member for Wentworth, who ought to know better as a former minister for the environment. Economy",103
122,Ms GEORGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Will the minister advise the House on the importance of the government's nationbuilding agenda and any recent endorsements from international organisations of this approach? Why is consistency in economic policy important for a strong economy?",104
123,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Throsby for her question and for her ongoing interest in infrastructure. Last week I spoke about the widespread support from the business community for the government's infrastructure agenda. Today the highly respected IMF have become the latest body to endorse the Rudd Labor government's approach. The IMF have said in this reportOpposition member-Is that what they said?,104
124,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is exactly what they have said. I will quote directly from them-and attribute the quote to them. They said: Directors welcomed the establishment of three new funds for longer-term spending on health, education, and infrastructure, with contributions to come from the 2007/08 and 2008/09 surpluses. They went on: Saving some of the revenue from the commodity price boom in three new funds will take pressure off monetary policy in the near term and enable increased infrastructure investment over the medium term. There you have the IMF acknowledging that Labor have put in place our surplus with a purpose. But I am also asked about the importance of consistency in economic policy making for the Australian economy. Earlier in question time we had a question to the Treasurer from the shadow Treasurer. In her question the shadow Treasurer referred the Treasurer to a speech by the Assistant Treasurer dated 4 June and published on the Assistant Treasurer's website. She then went on to refer to a speech given by the Treasurer in the House on 18 June 2008, thereby clearly giving the impression that there was no connection between the two. She indicated that the Treasurer's speech was made in the House but the Assistant Treasurer's speech was just available on the website. If the shadow Treasurer was being fair dinkum she would have statedMs Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I seek to table the speech from the Assistant Treasurer's website and the speech that I referred to.",104
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! That is not a point of order. The Leader of the House has the call.,104
126,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It's called Hansard! Both speeches were for the same bill. It was a bill from the Treasury-a Treasurer's bill. As is absolutely standard procedure, as the Treasurer was not available at the time to give his speech the Assistant Treasurer gave the second reading speech on behalf of the Treasurer. That is why you have an Assistant Treasurer! Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. This defence of the Treasurer's plagiarism does not go to the question that he was asked.",104
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The Leader of the House is responding to the question.,104
128,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am responding to the issue of consistency of economic policy, which is not understood by those opposite. So you had a speech given by the Assistant Treasurer on behalf of the Treasurer, and then in the summing up of the bill the Treasurer also gave his own speech-nothing extraordinary there at all. Both speeches, on 4 June and on 18 June, were on behalf of the Treasurer of Australia. Not surprisingly, they were consistent-just as the Assistant Treasurer in the former government used to give speeches to bills on behalf of the Treasurer in this House. The fact that they tried to pretend that there was no connection between the two, the fact that they did not try to table the said speeches, is very interesting. They have been caught out. You can understand why they are worried about a debate about consistency in economic policy. You can understand why they have been so defensive, because this is now the sixth gaffe in some three days-two a day is the average of the member for Curtin. When it comes to plagiarism, when the member for Curtin became the shadow Treasurer she did not ask for extra staff-she asked for an extra photocopier in her office! The fact is that the shadow Treasurer was caught out-caught out plagiarising, and then caught out doctoring Hansard. This is what the Australian online says today: Today Coalition sources confirmed the offending paragraphs of background were provided for her speech from the leader's officeMs Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, on relevance. He was asked about consistency in economic policy. This has nothing to do with the question.",104
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will listen carefully to the minister for infrastructure and I suggest that he brings his answer to a close.,105
130,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that consistency in economic decision making is important, because they have none over there. When caught out, the shadow Treasurer has attempted to shift blame to the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. If this is a matter relating to Hansard, then the Leader of the House asked a question of you earlier this morning. You are reporting at a later hour. Therefore, surely, this anticipates your decision.",105
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I will be listening carefully to what the minister for infrastructure says-to the relevance to the question-and, as I said, I suggest that he brings his answer to a close.",105
132,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is another offence that I have not raised here. The fact is that the Australian report says: Ms Bishop was understood to be “ropeable” about the error but willing to take the public flak … No, not willing to openly say that it was the opposition leader's fault-just willing to background it. And the opposition leader's",105

134,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,statement has been ‘no comment' about the responsibility for that. Online Safety,105
135,Mr FARMER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, in advance, can I apologise for my voice. My question is to the Minister for Youth and Minister for Sport. Minister, I refer to the tragic incident that unfolded in Finland yesterday where, it is reported, a gunman shot and killed 10 of his fellow students and then turned the gun on himself. More chilling is the fact that he had allegedly posted warnings of this on the internet just previously. Minister, as the Minister for Youth, what action have you taken to ensure that the parents of Australian children have confidence that instant communication tools like the internet and mobile phones are being used appropriately and not for cyberbullying, social grandstanding and virtual menace?",105
136,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much to the member for his question. I am upset that you had to move back there to be able to get a question up! But it is a very serious issue, and I would like to answer this, because I think that what this parliament needs is to be spending more time talking about issues affecting Australian young people. That is one of the reasons why this government recreated the portfolio of the Minister for Youth after the previous government abolished it. And it is one of the reasons why we have been working very hard to set in place programs to make sure that we can look at the impacts of a whole range of different issues on young people in Australia. In regard to the particular issue that you brought up about communications, obviously the minister for communications has a very important role, also, in monitoring these issues, because we know that it is not only young people who are using the internet or who are the victims, sadly, of cyberbullying and a number of other issues. But what we are doing is working right across government to make sure that we can see that every portfolio is tackling how that particular area is impacting on young people. In fact-though I would not like to pre-empt the announcement-tomorrow we will be having some more to say about the creation of the Office for Youth. As I mentioned earlier, the previous government abolished the position of minister for youth. They also de-funded many of the operating programs when it came to young people and cut back on the departmental resources to make sure that young people were getting a fair go from the government. What we will be announcing tomorrow is the creation of the Office for Youth. Their role will be to look across government-whether it be the health department, the communications department or the education department-to make sure that we can see, right across government, all the programs that are being put in place for young people",106

Not one. The opposition could not bother turning up to estimates and asking one question about young people. We have got a question; I am trying to answer it, and I am trying to outline the fact that this governmentMr Schultz interjecting",106

140,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"takes very seriously making sure that young Australians have access to resources and making sure that we have adequate programs in place right across the board. We, on this side, recognise that there is a massive generational divide when it comes to the issues affecting different groups of Australians and that young people are actually facing a whole range of issues, like those that you mentioned, with the internet, with cyberbullying and with text messaging, and we need new responses to that. That is why we need a bureaucracy that is set up to cater for it, and that is why we need a portfolio allocated to addressing these issues. Your government abolished it; ours has put it back in place. We are setting up the Office for Youth so that we can work on this particular issue",106

152,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are right. This is an absolute tragedy, what has happened recently in Finland. We want to make sure that we put in place every mechanism to prevent any similar tragedies in Australia. That means that we need to tackle this at a number of levels. We need to tackle it within communications and we need to make sure that we have got protections in place, but also we need to make sure that we are regularly engaging with young Australians and that we are making sure that we give them a voice in these public discussions about the issues confronting them, which are quite unique to their generation and which many members of this parliament did not have to deal with when they were growing up. That is one of the reasons why this government has acted to establish the Office for Youth. We will be next week launching the Australian Youth Forum, which is a way that we can have continual dialogue with young people so that we canMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",107

156,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take that on board. The member for Mackellar says, ‘Another talkfest.' We on this side of the House think it is hugely important that we include young people and that we hear first hand from them what it is that is happening within their own communities, that we give them credit for the fact that they have a number of different problems and different experiences and different perspectives to what we have had before, so that we can ensure that there are government programs and policies in place to react to them. ",107
157,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have just outlined two things that we already have done which the previous government never did, and we are going to ensure that we continue to work with young Australians to make sure that we can respond to the changing issues that they have before them, something which the previous government was never able to do because it abolished the portfolio and then took away all of the resources which had been allocated to it. Australian Technical Colleges",107
158,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will Acting Prime Minister update the House on the latest developments around the Australian technical colleges?,108
159,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I know that he is deeply interested not only in the future of Australian technical colleges but in all aspects of the government's education revolution. Can I say, on the education revolution generally, that this morning I was able to introduce into the parliament some important legislation which fits in with the government's education revolution agenda. Towards the end of this year, we will enter the new national education agreement, an agreement for government and non-government schools, an agreement to lift the quality of schooling in every school around the country. Today I was able to introduce into this parliament the funding component for nongovernment schools, some $24 billion. Importantly, I was able to announce that schools that are teaching Indigenous students will benefit from new resources, new investments, the maximum rate of government contribution and new indexation arrangements, because we want to make a real difference to closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. The member asked me about Australian technical colleges. I thank the member for his question because it seems to me important to indicate to the House something that the new shadow minister for education unfortunately does not understand. The shadow Treasurer is not the only new shadow minister to get off to a bad start. The shadow ister for education was on Sky TV being interviewed about his new portfolio yesterday and clearly did not understand the economic and financial problems of Australian technical colleges. This House yesterday noted the member for Bradfield's facility with statisthe tics, something that is well known in this House. He is a man who is very good at remembering numbers. When he was the minister for education, he announced the Liberal Party's proposal to create 24 Australian technical colleges. When he did that, he announced a number of numbers related to that. I suspect he can remember them in his head now, but just to remind him and certainly to inform the member for Sturt, who clearly is not aware of these numbers: the member for Bradfield said that these technical colleges would assist more than 21,000 students at a cost of $289 million over four years. Well, there is a problem with that. The problem is not the ability of the member for Bradfield to remember those numbers; the problem is in the delivery of them, because here we are, four years from when that promise was made, and we have enrolment of 4,300 students, not 21,000, and the budget has blown out to $440 million. That is a training cost of $100,000 a student. In a further assault on the already tattered economic credibility of the Liberal Party-in tatters because of its budget strategy, in tatters because of the gaffes of the shadow Treasurer-now the shadow Treasurer is joined by the shadow minister for education, who went on to suggest this was a good training model and we should be aiming to get to 21,000 students, at a cost of $100,000 a student. This is economic vandalism writ large-the shadow minister for education joining his colleagues in a morass of economic incompetence. The government is moving to better trainmining arrangements, which will certainly be more cost-effective and will certainly cover more students. I am pleased to be able to say that arrangements have been made for the future of three technical colleges. These will be better arrangements and certainly more cost-effective for the long term. The newly elected member for Lyne played an important role in this development and led a delegation to see me. He would know that the ATC in Port Macquarie is moving to be the Newman Senior Technical College. It will be moved back to the Catholic school system. In Western Sydney, the Sydney Anglican Schools Corporation will run the college there. In the electorate of the member for Wakefield, who asked me this question, the ATC will become the Regional Catholic Technical College. These are long-term solutions for the future which will enable training in those communities under better and sustainable arrangements. The arrangements we make for the future of ATCs are in addition to our $2.5 billion investment in Trades Training Centres in Schools. Once again, in the interview yesterday, the new shadow minister for education indicated he does not quite get it when it comes to figures either; the shadow treasurer is not alone. When it comes to figures, he said in respect of a $2.5 billion investment, ‘big figures mean nothing'. He might like to tell that to the schools in his electorate who are now invited to apply for a $300 million funding round. He might like to say to those school communities-and those school communities in Liberal seats around the nation-that he says, as the shadow minister for education, that $300 million available now for school applications and school proposals does not mean anything. ",108
160,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow minister has just called out, ‘It's a joke!' He might want to say to the schools that benefit from this $300 million that their aspiration to have state-of-the-art trades training facilities joke. This government is renewing trade training facilities around the country. We have already distributed money that will benefit 96 schools. They have already succeeded in the first round of applications and there is $300 million more there for a training solution. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this answer has been going for 6½ minutes. In opposition, the now Acting Prime Minister said answers should not go for more than four minutes. She has blathered on for 6½ minutes. She can make a ministerial statement. Ms Gillard interjecting",109
161,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Acting Prime Minister has indicated that she has finished her question. Fuel Prices,109
162,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. Is the minister aware that Google now offers a free petrol price tracker site which allows motorists to search for the cheapest petrol in a given area? In light of this development, will the government abandon its plans to spend over $20 million of public money on its much maligned Fuelwatch scheme?",109
163,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Fuelwatch provides information for motorists to get the cheapest possible petrol. The difference between the cheapest and the most expensive petrol in Sydney today is 22c a litre. I cannot tell you where to find the cheapest petrolOpposition members-Go to Google!,109
164,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and I cannot tell you where to find the most expensive because the private sector sites that the honourable member refers to have only a selection of petrol stations, not all of them. Lots of people understand that. The people of Western Austrais a lia understand that; Fuelwatch has been in operation there for eight years. Perhaps that is why the Liberal Party in Western Australia promised to keep Fuelwatch at the last election. Perhaps that is why Colin Barnett, the new Premier of Western Australia, has said, ‘I will not touch Fuelwatch; it works.' We have the Western Australian Liberal Premier saying he will keep Fuelwatch and we have had the Leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales promising Fuelwatch because Fuelwatch will work. If Fuelwatch is defeated in the Senate, the only people in Australia with the benefit of Fuelwatch will be the only people living under a Liberal government, the people of Western Australia. It shows what hypocrites honourable members opposite are. Employment",109
165,Ms HALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment Participation. How is the government improving employment services for job seekers and how will this address Australia's skills shortage?,110
166,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Shortland for her question. I know she has a great deal of concern for job seekers in her electorate and, indeed, for those people who are unemployed and looking for work. We have recently gone through a round of consultations with employers, employer bodies, employment service providers and others to make sure we have a system in place that will be effective and that will ensure that there is training that will allow those job seekers to acquire the skills that employers are crying out for in this country. I know the Leader of the Opposition said earlier in this place that we do not have a skills shortage, that we do not a skills crisis in this country, but unfortunately employers in this country know better. They have told us that they cannot, in some circumstances, fill existing vacancies. They also know that their training, delivered by the previous government, was in many respects deficient. The employer body in Victoria, VECCI, made clear that the training that was provided to some job seekers was, in fact, deficient. They referred to some those training services as Mickey Mouse courses. This government is very focused on ensuring that the training delivered to job seekers ensures that they acquire skills employers need. That is why this government will roll out 253,000 training places for job seekers over the course of the next five years. We are going to ensure that those job seekers, particularly those who have been denied access to training because of the failures of the previous government, are given opportunities. I know that, when the member for Wentworth became the Leader of the Opposition, he said that he would like to see people in this country being given opportunities. This government is about providing practical opportunities for those job seekers, some of whom are on the margins of our society. We know the previous government was obsessed about marginals, but over the last 10 years they cared not a jot about those who were marginalised. We on this side of the House are concerned for all Australians. We want to provide opportunities for all Australians, including job seekers who have been left out by not being provided the right forms of assistance that they need. We need to turn around the real problem we have with the very long term unemployed. In 1999, one in 10 job seekers were on the very long term unemployment list. Now, almost one in four are on the very long term unemployment list. That is why we need to ensure that there is sufficient training, proper assistance, mentoring and other forms of assistance that will give to those people who have not been given opportunities the opportunities they need to make their lives more productive for themselves, their families, their communities and this nation. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Economy",110

168,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed.,111
169,Mr SWAN,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"During question time. I was asked a question by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Curtin, about two speeches-one given on 4 June by the Assistant Treasurer in this House on 4 June and one given by myself in this House on 18 June. Both speeches were about the Commonwealth Securities and Investment Legislation Amendment Bill 2008-a piece of legislation which the government supports strongly and which is very important in the context of the current global economic uncertainty that we face. Of course, the second reading speech was given by the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Bowen, on my behalf. Mr Hockey-He didn't say it. It wasn't on his website.",111
170,Mr SWAN,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Well, you haven't done your homework again. It was given by the Assistant Treasurer on my behalf because I was overseas. Naturally, for such an important piece of public policy, the speech was of course given by the Assistant Treasurer. But of course upon my return, regarding this legislation as importantly as I did, I participated in the summing up. I vividly remember participating in the summing up because the member for Wentworth was in the chamber and, you would be surprised to hear, we had a friendly chat across the table about this piece of legislation. In fact, we had had a number of phone calls about it. So all of this is an elaborate camouflage to hide the embarrassment of the member for Curtin. As usual, it is the cover-up that really pings them. Mr Truss- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the minister is seeking to add to an answer. In that context, he cannot debate the question.",111
171,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,I will listen carefully to the Treasurer.,111
172,Mr SWAN,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,This farce from the member for Curtin is part of an elaborate cover-up to cover up her embarrassment at her plagiarism. You cannot plagiarise your own speech. It is simply impossible to plagiarise yourself. It is absolutely impossible. Mr Hockey interjecting,111

174,Mr SWAN,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"The second reading speech was given, as it should have been, by the Assistant Treasurer on my behalf.

According to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and my knowledge of it, the Labor government, under Hawke and Keating, introduced the luxury car tax in 1986 and increased it again in 1990.

More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",112
183,Mrs MAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Prior to the last election the Prime Minister spent months and months telling the Australian people-pensioners, in particular-that he was on their side and that they would be priority No. 1 once he was in the Lodge. But after 10 months in government, 10 months sitting on the government benches, those opposite have abandoned older Australians. Let me read to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, from a Labor Party media statement, dated 13 June 2007, available on the Labor Party website. It says: Most older Australians struggle to make ends meet on low fixed incomes such as the aged pension … It goes on: Older Australians are the lifeblood of the nation. They protected us during World War II and through their hard work they have built our national prosperity. I say credit where credit is due. I agree completely with those sentiments. Older Australians are our national treasures. They worked hard, they fought wars, they made sacrifices that we take for granted today. They deserve our respect and support in their senior years-unconditionally! I know those opposite are avid supporters of opinion polls and focus groups and I know they love the media. In fact, wasn't it former Prime Minister Paul Keating who referred to them as ‘tea-leaf-reading, focus group driven polling types'? Opinion poll after opinion poll and media story after media story are giving the government one, simple, unambiguous message: pensioners need your help and they need it now. So these tea-leafreading, focus group driven polling typesthe mob opposite-are really not getting the message. I have got news for the Prime Minister, even though he is not here; for the Acting Prime Minister; for the Treasurer; for the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs; for the Minister for Ageing, who is at the table in this House; and for all those sitting on the government benches: as much as they would like it, this issue is far from dead and buried. Pensioners right across this nation are outraged that this government not only has failed them-as if that isn't bad enough in itself-but does not care about them either. I would be outraged too. What a slap in the face to the many thousands of single age pensioners, single service pensioners and widow B pensioners in this country. The Prime Minister travelled to Niue for the Pacific Islands Forum last month, and there he was in all the photos, like an emperor sitting on his throne. I can just imagine what he was mumbling to himself as he looked down from his throne: let them eat cake! That is what it has come to, except it is not cake but baked beans that our pensioners are living on. This government just does not get it. We have got the Harmer review, we have got the Henry review and we also had the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. Reviews and reports do not put food on the table. Our pensioners cannot eat reviews. Increases in the cost of living are placing enormous pressures on our pensioners. Let me tell you about a few items you are likely to find in any pensioner's shopping basket. Pensioners buy bread. I am sure we all agree bread is not a luxury item. How much do you think the cost of bread has risen by in the first six months under the Rudd government? By 3.2 per cent. What about tea and coffee? These are also not luxury items and are beverages enjoyed by many pensioners across the country. How much has the cost of tea and coffee risen by in the first six months of the Rudd government? By 3.6 per cent. And the list goes on. The cost of butter and margarine has gone up 7.6 per cent. The cost of pharmaceuticals have gone up 12.1 per cent. The cost of electricity has gone up 4.6 per cent. The cost of petrol has gone up 14.6 per cent. I have not even mentioned the rises in rents and general living expenses. The government are well and truly aware of these rises in the cost of living, and they are well and truly aware of the pressures these rises place on our pensioners. Struggling pensioners are crying out for immediate action, and the government are ignoring them. Those opposite ask why the opposition have left out some groups in our call for a $30-a-week rise in the single age pension, the single service pension and the widow B pension. I have got news for those opposite, who sit in the seats with the power to do something about this. The opposition's measure is about helping thousands of older Australians; it is about helping those who are most in immediate need of assistance. Single age pensioners live on $273 a week. I ask those opposite: how far does that go? The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer and a few others on the back bench have admitted they could not live on $273 dollars a week, yet they have the power to do something about it. They have the power to tell our older Australians: ‘You know what? You've done our nation proud. You deserve a certain standard of living in your retirement, and we're going to do something about it.' Those on this side of the chamber recognise that. Those on this side of the chamber are saying just that to our pensioners. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs claims the opposition is ignoring two million pensioners. The minister should think very carefully before throwing that accusation around. Perhaps she has not noticed that, while we on this side of the House have committed to taking the first step-that is right: the first step but by no means the last-towards helping pensioners who desperately need assistance, the minister and government are ignoring every pensioner in this country. I have a simple solution: do something, not nothing, about it. They do not even have to do the work; we have written the bill already. Instead, what do we get from the government? We have the Minister for Veterans' Affairs calling the opposition's motion ‘a stunt' during question time on 22 September. We have the member for Blair on the same day saying: This motion is a stunt-pure and simple. Yesterday during question time the Treasurer said: We have this ploy on pensions in the House today … First it is a stunt; then it is a ploy. Obviously their focus group responded better to the use of the word ‘ploy' than ‘stunt', so Lachlan Harris updated the talking points. Here is the clanger. Here is the truth of the matter. Here is how those on the government benches really feel about pensioners: This is not real work; this is meaningless politics from those opposite. Who said that yesterday in this place? It was none other than the Leader of the House, the member for Grayndler. This government is out of touch. It did not take it long-just 10 months. We have an ageing population. We all know that is a fact-it is something we all agree on-but, with the way the Rudd government is leading this country, we will have a sick ageing population. This government is putting the health and welfare of older Australians at risk. Why? For what purpose? For a review and yet another review. We left them with a robust surplus. Start using it responsibly. There are more than 5,900 single age pensioners in my electorate of MCPherson. In the neighbouring electorate of Richmond, the electorate of the Minister her for Ageing-the member for Richmond is in the House today-there are more than 7,300 single age pensioners. When I return home at the end of this week, I know what I will be saying to the pensioners of my electorate. Has the Minister for Ageing decided what she will say to the single age pensioners, single service pensioners and widow B pensioners of her electorate? She should seriously think about it. I read today in the Daily News that there will be a pensioner protest rally outside her office when she returns on Friday. That is something for her to look forward to. I am not sure the minister will get the message, though. There was a pensioner rally in Tweed on 30 June. Both the minister and I attended that rally, and she certainly did not get the message then. The chief executive of National Seniors Australia, Michael ONEILL, told the Age newspaper that he would be encouraging the 280,000 members of his organisation to contact their local MP to demand an explanation. This is what it has come to-pensioners in revolt. They stripped on the streets of Melbourne earlier this year to vent their anger. They wanted their message heard because it was falling on deaf ears. This is why the government's actions-or inaction-are so baffling. They say they could not live on $273 a week; they acknowledge how tough pensioners are doing it right now; yet, in some bizarre attempt to reassure pensioners, they tell them to stop whingeing because they were paid the seniors bonus and the utilities allowance in the 2007-08 budget. After the May budget the Prime Minister hit the airwaves, extolling the virtues and benefits of the budget for pensioners. In Melbourne he said: … in the case of seniors, they have been provided with $900 per year more than they were in the previous budget of Mr Howard … The Treasurer had the same thing to say in Perth, and the minister for families said the same thing in Brisbane. Even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator MCLucas, gave it a red-hot going over, speaking at a pensioner rally in West End. Let me set them all straight, courtesy of Dennis Atkins writing in the Courier-Mail on 24 May this year. He writes: Of that claimed “$900 extra”, $500 was a repeat of the seniors' bonus introduced by Howard last year. The rest was the $393 increase in the utilities allowance from the Howard government's $107 to $500. But there is more. Atkins goes on to say: This means the net increase for the majority of seniors from this Budget was $7.50 a week which would buy a regular Big Mac meal. Pensioners are a smart lot. They can see right through this government's spin. They know exactly how poorly they fared in this year's budget. Let me read to you from a letter to the editor of my local newspaper, the Gold Coast Bulletin. The letter writer says: Things might be going swimmingly well in Wayne's world. However, in the world of Australia's aged pensioners it is a daily struggle to survive as they drown in a sea of ever-increasing food prices, sky-high petrol hikes and electricity, water and gas prices that produce a standard of living that can best be described as being on the breadline. Every pensioner in this country understands they do not have the support of this government. How can they have confidence in their local Labor member and their government when they so blatantly slap them across the face and say, ‘No, you are not deserving of help; you are not deserving of assistance from this government'? As those opposite head back to their electorates this week, they should ask themselves whether the pensioners living in their electorates should cancel Christmas this year. This government will have a lot to answer for if the most vulnerable people in this country cannot afford to celebrate Christmas. Will the Prime Minister be the Grinch Who Stole Christmas? This government is running out of time. It has the opportunity, it has the motive, it has the power and, dare I say it, it has the obligation to do something for the pensioners of this country-and do it now. Those opposite promised pensioners the world prior to the last election-the world-and all they have delivered is a can of baked beans.",112
184,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It truly is amazing. We had 12 years of inaction from those opposite-they are all leaving the chamber now. When they had an opportunity to act, what did they do? Absolutely nothing. What has the member for MCPherson been doing in relation to these issues in the last 10 years? We see that the member for Warringah, the shadow minister, is not here today. We know that is because he is not interested in pensions; he has made that pretty clear. Indeed, we had 12 years of inaction from those opposite across a whole range of issues. It was not just pensions; there was health care. The only thing we had action on was Work Choices. They were the party of Work Choices; that is what they gave us. But when it came to pensions they did nothing. But the Rudd Labor government is committed to taking decisive action when it comes to assisting pensioners. There is no question at all that many pensioners are doing it tough. We acknowledge that. Many single age pensioners are struggling to meet rising living costs for things such as rent, petrol and food-we certainly know that. But other pensioners are struggling too, including half a million carers and people with a disability, who only have their pension of $281 a week to rely on. In their rush to score political points, the opposition forgot about million Australian pensioners. They did not care about them. Carers, people with a disability, wife pensioners and pensioner couples will be excluded from the scheme that the Liberals and Nationals have put forward. What about those people? Where do they rate in this scheme? Absolutely nowhere. The plight of around half a million single pensioners and people with a disability, carers and widows in exactly the same financial circumstances as single age pensioners, living on $281 a week, have been totally ignored by the opposition. What are they saying to them? When they go back to their electorates, what are they saying about those two million people who are being completely ignored? We know that pensioners need some extra help. That is why we increased the utilities allowance to $500 a year and decided to pay the instalments every three months. It is also why, for the first time, we extended it to the disabled and carers. This fortnight, pensioners, age pensioners, carers, disability support pensioners and veterans will receive their third quarterly instalment of $128 to help with their bills. While the opposition has forgotten about carers and people with a disability and has left them behind, this fortnight, because of this new government, they will receive an extra $128. The government's position on pensions has always been clear. In opposition, Labor instituted a Senate inquiry into the cost-ofliving pressures facing seniors. Indeed, the first recommendation of the bipartisanMrs May interjecting",116
185,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for MCPherson was heard in silence.,116
186,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for MCPherson is very keen to hear about the recommendations from the Senate Standing two Committee on Community Affairs inquiry, so I will just refresh her on that. Its recommendation was: … the Government review the suitability of the base pension levels through economic analyses of amounts required to achieve at least a modest standard of living for retired Australians, with particular consideration given to the adequacy of the percentage rate for single older people receiving the age pension compared to couples. On budget night, the government acted on this bipartisan recommendation by instituting the Henry review of tax and welfare. We understand the urgency of this and that is why we acted. The government has asked Dr Jeff Harmer to complete this matter as part of the Henry review and report back to the government by no later than February next year. The pensions review is well underway with over 600 submissions. During the Senate inquiry, and since that time, we have received many, many calls from different seniors groups, disability groups and carers groups to improve pensions and payments in those submissions. This range of views shows that the pension system is very complex, and that is why we have to analyse it properly. There are many different positions. Many different proposals are being put forward, and we have to look at them. This confirms that the responsible course of action was to undertake a comprehensive investigation into the pension, not just provide some quick political fix that excludes two million pensioners. The government is being very responsible and the opposition are playing really cheap politics. The opposition's private member's bill was just a very cruel political stunt, an act that pitted pensioner against pensioner. The Liberals and Nationals had 12 years to fix the pension system. When they had the power to act the opposition did absolutely nothing, and now all they can do is play cheap politics with a really important issue for millions of Australians. In fact, when they had a chance to do something last year when they were in government, what did the Howard cabinet do? They voted against raising the base rate of the single pension. We know the opposition are playing cheap politics here, because their proposal leaves behind two million pensioners. Not only was the bill that the opposition put forward unconstitutional but so many of its policies were also fundamentally flawed. Because of their absolute haste to cobble together this quick fix, the bill they put forward was riddled with flaws. It had not been properly thought out, just cobbled together. The opposition's proposed increase was not even indexed, and its value eroded over time-yet another mean and tricky Liberal and National parties scheme. It also created serious inequities in the pension system, which was very unfair. They have not been able to explain these inequities or why they have come about. They have just put it all together and so many people totally missed out. They know that people have missed out, they know that there are inequities, they know that it is not fair-but they do not care. They do not care at all that they were misleading Australian pensioners in their rush to score these quick political points. Unlike the opposition, the government is determined to get it right for the long term. We have made a down payment on reform with some immediate assistance for pensioners. That is why we increased the utilities allowance to $514 a year and decided to pay the instalments every three months. This fortnight, all pensioners-age pensioners, carers, disability support pensioners, widows, wives and veterans-will receive their quarterly utilities allowance instalment of $128 to help with their bills. As well, all single pensioners will this week get the regular pension indexation increase of $15.30. So we have taken immediate action. We have increased and extended the utilities allowance. We have increased the telephone allowance to $138 for those with a home internet connection. We have also paid cash bonuses$500 to seniors, $1,000 to those on carer payment and $600 in carer allowancebecause we know that those pensioners are doing it tough. But, when it comes to reforming the pension system, we know that it needs a lot more than the quick fix that the Liberal and National parties have put forward. That is why we are having the comprehensive review and why we have had over 600 submissions in relation to it. All these views will be taken into consideration because the government is absolutely focused on reform and on getting it right for the long term, not on a political quick fix. Earlier, the member for MCPherson referred to my seat of Richmond, and I would like to raise the issue of the number of people there who will miss out under the Liberal-National Party scheme. Indeed, there are 17,772 pensioners in my electorate of Richmond who will miss out under the Liberal National Party scheme. They have been totally forgotten. That is a lot of people. Let us have a look at the electorate of the member for MCPherson. How many people in her seat would miss out? It would be 12,652. What is she going to tell those people? Mrs May interjecting",116
187,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"She is saying she cannot do much for those 12½ thousand people. She will have to go back and talk with all of those people and explain it to them. The member for Moncrieff is in the chamber as well. Indeed, in his seat 12,213 pensioners are going to miss out. You can speak to each of those people about that. I raise, too, the seat of Cowper, where we have 19,430 people missing out-a huge number. Even in the seat of the Leader of the Opposition 7,131 people are absolutely missing out because of the unfair scheme that the coalition have put forward. This government is acting. The previous government were inactive when it came to a whole range of issues-not just pensions but health care as well. They ripped $1 billion out of our hospitals and health care. We are committed to fixing that by putting $1 billion into that and $600 million into elective surgeryMrs May interjecting",118
188,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I hear the member for MCPherson raising the issue of Murwillumbah hospital. I note that she has raised this issue a number of times in the House. Indeed, the Nationals Senator Fiona Nash has also raised it. I find it quite interesting that they have raised this. As I said before, this government is putting massive amounts of money back into our hospitals after the inaction of the previous government. We also have the $10 billion Health and Hospitals Fund. We are very proud of that commitment. As the member for MCPherson and Senator Nash know, service delivery is a state issue. Maybe the member for MCPherson and Senator Fiona Nash think they are in state parliament. We know Senator Nash is keen to run for a state seat and has her eye on the Tweed. That is why she flies into Tweed and flies out again. Mr Ciobo-Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order on the issue of relevance. It is clear the minister has run out of things to say about pensioners. She is talking about senators running for state seats.",118
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There is no point of order.,118
190,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The issue here is one of responding to the rapidly growing pressures on these people. One of the biggest pressures on pensioners is health care. That is why we have committed massive funds. Mr Georganas-It's about dental care too.,118
191,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"A very good point has been raised about dental care. That is a huge issue for pensioners. Perhaps the other side should be passing legislation allowing hundreds of thousands of Australians to access decent dental care. The position, particularly in your electorates, is that there are peoplehundreds of thousands of people throughout Australia as well-who cannot access decent dental care. Mrs May-They could under the Medicare scheme that you abolished.",118
192,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for MCPherson had her turn earlier.,119
193,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In fact, the previous government abolished the Commonwealth Dental Scheme. You are the ones who left pensioners out there unable to eat because they could not get their teeth fixed. Mrs Hull-Not true!",119
194,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Riverina is warned!,119
195,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have a plan in place to reinstate the Commonwealth dental plan, and if the Liberal and National parties passed that then many hundreds of thousands of pensioners would be able to actually get their teeth fixed. It is shameful that that has not happened. You are stopping those people getting their teeth fixed. I will also raise a couple of issues in tion to aged care. I am proud to be the Minister for Ageing and proud of the fact that this government is putting in $40 billion over the next four years. Interestingly, the member for MCPherson hardly ever raises aged care and issues surrounding it, but we are very proud of our commitment. We have certainly increased funding right across the board. Aged care is one of the growing pressures for many pensioners, but we have a major commitment to it. We have had 12 years of neglect when it comes to aged care. I talked about a number of other issues before, such as pensions and health care, but in aged care as well we are fixing the neglect of 12 years. We are investing more money to have more beds available. Indeed, we have also increased the number of spot checks, and the accreditation agency now has a greater role to make peopleMrs May-More bureaucracy, more red tape.",119

199,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I can hear opposition members mocking. Well, I make no apologies about this. We make sure that older Australians are safe, no matter where their nursing home is. We have increased the accreditation standards as well. In the couple of minutes I have left, I will talk about how a lot of veterans are being left out under the opposition's scheme. They have left so many people out, and I listed some of the problems before. The opposition claim that this measure includes 70,000 veterans, but the opposition's definition means relathe figure is actually 35,000. So they have left out a heap of veterans as well. A huge number of people have been left out-two million people right across Australia. The member for MCPherson asked earlier about the rally that will be held in my electorate on Friday. I certainly will be there speaking about the very decisive action that the Rudd government has taken since it came into government after 12 years of nothing from the Liberal and National parties. Since we have been in government there has been very decisive action. We have increased the utilities allowance, the telephone allowance and the bonuses that are being paid, and we are having a comprehensive review of our pension system to get the whole process right. The opposition left things in disarray. They did not care. They cobbled together this political quick fix. But a lot of people are very angry that that little fix left out two lion people. They can see through it to what it is. We are committed to taking decisive action. We are committed to getting the system right. We are committed to making sure that we have in place comprehensive reform of our pension and taxation systems, and we are doing it for the long term. All we see from the opposition is this political quick fix approach to things. We are committed to the long term, to tackling the challenges of the 21st century, and one of those is making sure we get this right. (Time expired)",119
200,Mrs MARKUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Greenway) (4.22 pm)What does the Labor government have against pensioners? Another very important question is: why will the Labor government not help pensioners cope with the increased cost of living? We have all heard the rhetoric, but the simple fact remains that the government have an opportunity to help pensioners and they are refusing to do so. The coalition is not sitting on its hands when it comes to helping pensioners. The most important people in this debate are the thousands of pensioners waiting for solutions. The Urgent Relief for Single Age Pensioners Bill 2008 was passed in the Senate on Monday night. This bill helps the most vulnerable pensioners: the single age pensioners, the single service pensioners and widow B pensioners. Members on this side of the House have been out and about talking and listening to pensioners, asking what issues are facing them. But the Labor Party are in denial. They make excuses and they talk a lot of hot airjust like their election promises. Let us reflect on Labor's election promises and the expectations they raised in the community that they had the solutions to rising petrol prices and rising grocery prices. Labor promised to ease the pressure on working families, but they failed to mention pensioners. What is the solution? An inquiry-let's talk milsome more! It does not report until March 2009-again, waiting and watching. This pension review adds to more than 165 reviews, committees, inquiries and consultations that the Rudd government has commissioned. It is obvious Labor does not have an answer, and pensioners have to wait 12 months before they get any help from the government. The coalition has provided a solution now. Decisive action is needed more than ever, and the coalition's bill to increase the single age pension, the single service pension and the widow B pension needs to be supported immediately. Pensioners need help today. We have started with the single age pensioners, the single service pensioners and the widow B pensioners because they are the most vulnerable. The current single rate of pension is 60 per cent of the combined couple rate. It is lower than the average for major OECD countries, which stands at 63 per cent. The proposed increase of $30 per week would bring the single age pension in line with the OECD average. By failing to support a $30 increase, Labor must have the view that these pensioners do not need an increase. Labor is saying that these pensioners are doing okay and can wait a year or maybe longer-who knows?-before they can get help. Labor is watching and waiting, watching and waiting. Labor appears to lack understanding. Older Australians' contribution to this nation is immeasurable. The members opposite should pay attention. Almost half of older Australians aged 65 to 74 years provide unpaid assistance to someone outside of their home. One-third, around 33 per cent, provide volunteer services through community organisations. Twenty-nine per cent are actively involved in other community organisations and support groups of various kinds. The community could not move forward without the contributions of these older Australians. What about the grandfathers and grandmothers who care for their children while their parents work just to keep a roof over their heads? In these uncertain times, pensioners need to know that someone not only is listening but also cares about their circumstances and is prepared to act. Labor, by its refusal to adopt the increase of $30, fails these tests. Labor does not have the answers and will not even address the question, ‘When are you going to help single age pensioners, single service pensioners and widow B pensioners?' Let us look at the 700 widow B pensioners. By refusing to support the coalition's solution to assist pensioners, is the Labor Party saying that these 700 widows do not matter? Of the nearly 900,000 single age pensioners, whose payment is 60 per cent of the combined couple rate, how many are now, as we speak, selling their cars, their assets, their lifelong memorabilia just to put food on the table? For the many thousands of single age service pensioners this is just another example of how little the Labor government care about the contribution our oldest service men and women have made to this country. In question time today, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs failed to explain why he would not support the $30 rise for these pensions. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs prefers that all pensioners miss out. Are the pensioners the coalition is proposing to help worth it? They are. This is another failure to act Labor. They may acknowledge the problem, but then they ignore it. On Monday in question time, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs said that the coalition's urgent relief bill was ‘a stunt'. What about easing the cost-of-living pressures that continue to build for pensioners? The minister obviously prefers to do nothing. How does that help anyone? The veteran community deserve better. These people have laid down their lives for this country. They have made great sacrifices in carrying out their duty and responsibility, and help for this community should not be labelled a stunt. Such a statement diminishes their value. Responsibility for pension and entitlement payments lies squarely with the federal government. It is a matter of urgency that this increase is given to single pensioners. But the coalition has stepped in. While the government dithers and waits for the outcome of another review, the coalition has taken decisive action and put forward a solution. The coalition when in government had a strong record of helping older Australians. It was the coalition that introduced the bonus programs in relation to pensioners' utilities and telephones and the $500 bonus because we recognised that government funded pensions and allowances are the main source of income for most people aged 65 and over. and These people do not have the capacity to find extra to cover the rising cost of groceries, fuel and other living expenses. Pensioners are having to cut back on their social outings. They cannot afford to put fuel in their cars. It was the coalition that introduced the bonuses program, which Labor opposed but now claim to be their idea. It was due to the coalition government's sound economic management and strong leadership that the incoming Labor government came into government with a fiscal surplus of $22 billion. It is a surplus which Labor are not willing to by share in these tough, financially uncertain times with Australia's most vulnerable individuals. The coalition left Labor with a healthy surplus and no government debt. Yet the government disparage the coalition's action in trying to help single age pensioners, single service pensioners and widow B pensioners. The coalition started with this group of pensioners because they are the most vulnerable in the community. The pension review background summary Australia's future tax system shows that the age pension rate for single, living alone homeowners and single renters, whether in public or private accommodation, was below the relevant budget standard. These people do the least well as they do not have the economies of scale. Overall, the cost of living has increased by 4.5 per cent in the 12 months to June 2008. The coalition have taken action by introducing a bill to give the most vulnerable pensioners an increase in their pension, and we do not intend to stop there. The coalition are concerned at the defiant stance by Labor- (Time expired)",120
201,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Maribyrnong-Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services) (4.32 pm)-The coalition's speeches on this matter of public importance so far have been ill conceived and disingenuous. Pensioners are important. Older Australians are important. The greatest miracle of the 20th century in Australia is the fact that we are living 25 years longer than we were 100 years ago. But this matter of public importance is not about older Australians. This is not about a beauty parade to show which party respects older Australians more. The debate as presented by the coalition has been artful, insincere and a mere tactic. To support my contention that the speeches made by the coalition are disingenuous, I have five propositions. First of all, the debate by the coalition implies that nothing is being done. That is not true. Secondly, their proposition ignores far too many people who deserve public discussion, political support and leadership from both parties. It is not fair. Thirdly, their debate fails cept any responsibility for 12 years of inaction. What a blessing it must be to belong to a political party that have amnesia when in opposition-so that everything that happened when they were in government should not be held to account. Not a good proposition. Fourthly, the debate by the coalition has triggered scepticism in other people, third parties, about the coalition's commitmentbased, I have to say, on the evidence of their last 12 years of government. Fifthly, the coalition's debate falls short of the real issues. The Rudd government knows things are tough. You cannot fix 12 years of neglect overnight, but there are things on the scoreboard already: $600 to the carers allowance; cash bonuses-$500 to seniors and $1,000 to those on carer payments; $514 to the utilities allowance-$128 quarterly. And this goes to all pensioners, not just some pensionerspeople on the DSP, the widows, the wives, the veterans, the carers and the aged. The telephone allowance has gone up to $138, so that those older people who are able to be on the internet can actually get their costs paid for. We have seen the regular pension indexation increase by $15.30. We have extended the utilities allowance to people on the carers payment and the DSP. And the list goes on. Labor in opposition instituted the Senate inquiry into cost-of-living pressures facing senior Australians. A bipartisan report tabled on 20 March 2008 recommended: … that the Government review the suitability of the base pension levels through economic analyses of amounts required to achieve at least a modest standard of living for retired Australians, with particular consideration given to the adequacy of the percentage rate for single older people receiving the age pension compared to couples. On 20 March the bipartisan report was tabled and on budget night we acted, with the to acHenry review on taxation and welfare. In recognising the urgency of the pensions issue, the government has fast-tracked the review by asking Dr Jeff Harmer, the very capable secretary of the FaHCSIA department, to complete this part of the review and report back to the government by February next year-and this is already well underway. There have been 600 written submissions and 250 oral submissions. We are getting on with business. The second reason that I think that the coalition's criticism of the government is unfounded is that they neglect two million other pensioners. I do appreciate the coalition raising the MPI to the extent that it me talk about Australians with a disabilitya particular passion of mine. There are 13,000 people over the age pension age who are on carer payments or the disability support pension. These people would miss out under the coalition's proposal. There are over one million couple pensioners who would miss out on the payment under the coalition's proposal. There are more than 730,000 disability support pensioners who would miss out under the coalition's regime.",122
202,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,123
203,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The interjector says, ‘Make an amendment.' It is your motion; you do the work. We have already got a plan to assist all these people, and we are not going to be distracted by the makeshift tactics of the opposition. Furthermore, we have 78,000 single age pensioners living in public housing who will lose a quarter of this mythical increase in charges. In my own electorate of Maribyrnong, in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne, 8,700 couple pensioners would miss out under the coalition strategy rather than our strategy, and 1,100 carer payment recipients and 4,800-plus DSP recipients would also miss out. This is the problem with the coalition proposition: too many people miss out, because they do not understand a lot of the issues around pensioners. The third reason why the coalition's propositions are disingenuous, mischievous, erroneous and artful is that 12 years of inaction failed to achieve very much. It is pretty easy to spend someone else's money, I suggest to the opposition. I have had a look at what the weekly rate was when Paul Keating was defeated and the Howard government came in. It was about $173 per week. During the time the coalition were in government11 years and eight months-the pension inlets creased by a total of $97. Now they are in opposition, they can be friends to all, because they do not have to try to sort out the long-term strategy for all pensioners. If they want to talk about inaction, why is it that they never talk about the disability support pensioners? In Australia in the last 20 years, the plight of the disabled has been one of the public policy disgraces of Australian politics. Why is it that people with a disability, those on the pension, have lower home-ownership and lower educational outcomes? The fastest growing pension in Australia was the disability support pension under the old government, because of the low unemployment rates. I suggest that the coalition's proposition is belated, tardy, overdue, past due and delayed, when they had the power to do something that they failed to do. Many others do not believe the credibility of the opposition. Dr Peter Sloan, the spokesperson for the Down Syndrome Association of Australia, said: Why is the Opposition treating 714,156 Australians like second class citizens? People with disabilities are finding it just as difficult as retirees to support themselves on the pension. The Director of Queensland Advocacy Incorporated, Kevin Cocks, said: While age pensioners deserve attention and focus, the opposition's failure to include disability support pensioners in their plan at best suggests this is cynical policy on the run; at worse a fundamental lack of compassion. The President of People with Disability Australia, Robert Farley, said on 22 September, ‘People with a disability are very much the forgotten people in this proposal.' And the list goes on. Nicole Lawder, CEO of the Deafness Forum of Australia, said: The disability support pension is the main source of income for people with a hearing loss who receive a Centrelink benefit. So this review vital concern to those who are deaf or have a hearing impairmentour review! She continued: Deafness Forum is very disappointed with proposals for legislation that excludes DSP and carers. Joan Hughes, CEO of Carers of Australia, said: People on carer payments and disability support pensions are equally affected by the rising cost of living and are equally deserving of relief. It is not acceptable to say you will consider these groups at some unspecified time down the track. Their need is immediate. I have a letter from one of the many people who write to me about the plight of disability support pensioners. It says: I am receiving an invalid pension due to chronic emphysema. Normally I don't complain but it's come to the stage where I can no longer live a quality life. After paying my bills such as rent, electricity, gas and phone, and hire fees on my washing machine and fridge, I have a mere $90 a week to live on. It is not enough, I suggest to the opposition. I do not dispute that the opposition is interested in the aged. I am not going to have a debate about that. I am sure all of the members of parliament care about the aged. But it is not enough to care. That is a condition precedent to improving the plight of not just the age pensioner but all pensioners. You have to be effective. In the world where I come from, everyone could get up and make a promise to people. But the people who really matter are those who can deliver on the promise to people who do the hard work. I suggest that the coalition's propositions are stopgaps. They are makeshift contrivances which lack the long term interests of the people who are hardest up in society-not just the age pensioners but all these other groups. Why on earth are we having a competition between different is of a groups of pensioners on who receives the coalition's love and attention? I would suggest that all these groups-as will happen with the Harmer review, and the commitment of the Rudd government and Minister Jenny Macklin-get the benefit. I would like to leave the last word to Belinda Epstein-Frisch, spokesperson for Family Advocacy, who said on 20 September this year: The opposition's concern for the plight of age pensioners is a strategy designed to demonstrate compassion for people on Struggle Street. If this concern was real, people dependent on the disability support pension would also be within their sight. Regretfully, the coalition is merely contriving, acting and distorting rather than taking the best interests of all Australians into account.",123
204,Mrs HULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is quite extraordinary to witness the evolving narrative that has been attached to Labor's plans for pensioners. It almost beggars belief that we hear a certain speech from the Labor members on a continual basis. The alcopops tax was all about solving teenage binge drinking, and now the narrative is all about blowing a $6 billion hole in a budget surplus. Where has the concern gone for the teenage binge drinking? It has gone to the same place the concern has gone for the age, service and widowed pensioners. I will tell you where the concern is: it is nowhere, because they had the opportunity to change this and they chose not to. I will explain why they have chosen not to. I had a media release come into my electorate from Jenny Macklin MP, Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. In that press release the minister talks about how many pensioners in the Riverina are being ignored by me. She says: ‘By contrast, this fortnight the Australian government will pay all age pensioners, carers, veterans and disability pensioners'and she goes on to say she delivers coalition policy. Then she says: ‘On top of the regular pension, the indexation increase will mean this'-coalition policy, Minister. Then she goes on with a prize statement. She says: ‘That's because Mr Turnbull and Mrs Hull are more interested in a political quick fix which will exclude two million pensioners around Australia from a pension increase.' Surprise, surprise, Minister. The minister has denied more than three million people an increase. She has denied everybody an increase. In fact, I have sitting right here beside the member for Gippsland. When the member for Gippsland was running for election, Labor actually decided to show up. They did not show up for Lyons and they did not show up for Mayo, but they did show up for Gippsland. The candidate ran a very strong campaign on pensioners' issues. It was a very caring and strong campaign because he cares about the pensioners, the disability benefit recipients and all of those people in the torate of Gippsland. Yet there was a six percent swing against the Labor Party on this very strong issue. So let us say that the Labor Party have most certainly let down pensioners right across Australia. The minister's press release says, ‘By trast, the government understand that all sioners in Riverina are under financial pressure.' They understand it but will do nothing to help. This minister, Jenny Macklin, has failed dismally in two cases. She failed when Treasury put the documents before the cabinet of which she was a part-which costed exactly the same proposal and policy that the coalition has put in here. She failed to stand up for the pensioners and say, ‘Yes, give them $30 per week as single pensioners'exactly the same policy. She failed once in her own cabinet. She failed a second time, in this House yesterday, when she failed every pensioner in Australia. She may accuse me of failing some of the pensioners in my electorate, but she has failed every pensioner in Australia. We have seen the audacity of this media release, from a minister, delivering all coalition policy and quoting coalition policy. We had this little interlude here of ‘mean and tricky'. How mean and tricky can one get? Going to an election, like Mr Rudd did, saying, ‘We're going to make life better for you all, we're going to fix this problem and pensioners are going to be better off under the Rudd government'-that is mean and tricky. me When you then skip over to the United States of America and announce millions and millions of dollars that could have gone into this pension increase to get people out of this problem in the short term, it has nothing to do with a strategy. The previous member said, ‘The Labor strategy is this,' and, ‘The Labor strategy is that,' but Labor do not have a strategy. They have a review and then they will have anelecother review and another committee and another consultation- (Time expired)",124
205,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Earlier this year, the member for MCPherson said on a radio program that there should be an immediate increase to the con- pension. An hour later on the same radio pen- program the then shadow Treasurer, who is now the Leader of the Opposition, contradicted her, saying that it was not in fact the opposition's policy at all. I have the transcript here and I could quote from it, but I think others have already quoted from it, and time is short. I want to move on. Earlier this month the former Leader of the Opposition announced the proposal for the increase to the single pension in a speech in Queensland. Less than two weeks after this-last Monday-the private member's bill was tabled. On the same day, they suggested raising the taper rates on single pensions. On the Sunday before this, the Leader of the Opposition proposed to include single service and widow B pensioners, during a television interview-in fact, I think that was when that announcement was made. So we have the situation where one day it is an increase to the single aged pension, the next it is an adjustment to taper rates and on another day it is an increase in the single service pension and for widow B pensioners. I ask: what could possibly be next? It is inconsistent, it is policy on the run and, sadly, it is playing with pensioners' expectations. is playing with people's lives out there as this crazy debate being run by the opposition is continued. Like previous opposition policy in this area, this MPI is bringing us to the point where we can discuss the inadequacies and anomalies that are created by this opposition's mad policy. And I will say why I call it mad: it is mad because, as other speakers have said, it is ignoring those 700,000-plus people on disability support pension. It is ignoring those 133,000-plus people who are on carer payment. But it has carefully included 700 widow B pensioners. You should include them, but why include 700 widow B pensioners and exclude nearly a million recipients of DSP or carer payment, not to mention the many couple pensioners that will be missing out on this? The opposition have also used a figure from the DVA website of 70,000 to 71,000 people that they want to include in their proposal. But that figure is wrong because it does not represent accurately what their bill describes. I have to say that I am getting a little bit angry about this. I have sat here day in and day out-and again today through this MPI and question time-being accused of things as a member of this government. We are being told that we do not care. We are being told that we are doing nothing. We are being told that we voted against a $30 increase and therefore we are immoral members of the parliament. We are being told that we are refusing to help pensioners. Let us look at a little bit of the reality before all this excitement gets us carried away. We have an income support system in this country that has evolved over decades and decades. It is very complicated. The interactions and interconnections between all of those different payments are very relevant to this debate. We are sincerely concerned with the level of income It that many of these people are asked to live on day to day-the carer payment, the disability pensioners, the elderly single pensioners, the elderly couple pensioners and all of the connotations that are contained in there. We are concerned about it. To say we are doing nothing is just such an outright untruth that it is disgraceful politics. I notice that the member for Greenway, the member for MCPherson and the member for Riverina are, sadly, now not in here. They are probably out there writing their misleading, spinning press releases and again maligning this government and what the truth of this debate really is. The truth of it is that a pensioner who is paying government rent would lose 25 per cent of that $30 straight away on their rent. A person on an age pension, and who happens to be in a nursing home, would lose 85 per cent of that $30 immediately, because that is the structure for paying rent or living costs if you are in a facility care situation. I have not heard anyone from the opposition explain how that will work. I have not heard one person opposite explain to me how any of the people I am referring to actually get $30. They do not get it; they lose a proportion of it. The opposition are playing a game of ignorance against the reality of the situation. They are accusing us of untruths. Sadly, and I think they are playing with people and their lives purely to make a political point, and I condemn them for it. (Time expired)",125

NA (FURTHER PROVISIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 2008 NA NA IMPOSITION BILL 2008 Returned from the Senate Message received from the Senate returning the bills without amendment or request. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed.,127
207,Mr CHEESEMAN,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"By coordinating our international policies to complement changes in our domestic policies, we solve common problems and hindrances to trade and investment opportunities. Given the importance of trade to our economic prosperity, it is critical that bilateral agreements are updated with our partner states to meet the challenges of changing domestic policies. This is essential to our trade policy approach. We have to ensure that Australia is productive enough and competitive enough to take advantage of our market access gains. I would like to bring to this debate some important information that was raised with the release of an independent report into Australia's export policies and programs. The Mortimer review, as it is colloquially known, was conducted by David Mortimer AO and Dr John Edwards. The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 reflects the sentiments in section 4.6 of worse of all, the Mortimer review: The review received a number of comments from stakeholders on Australia's current system for taxation of overseas income. Many argued that the system has failed to keep pace with the changing nature of our trade and the internationalisation of business and that its complexity often leads to inadvertent evasion of tax. The Mortimer review recommended that there be a concerted effort to strengthen coordination and delivery of trade policies and services. This bill is indicative of Labor's commitment to provide a strong voice for business in developing trade and investment priorities and programs and to secure growth in Australian trade group bilateral agreements. We have signalled a broadening of our export base, with a strong focus on services and investment. This commitment to refocus Australia's trade policy is paramount, laying the foundations for our future prosperity. It is imperative that Australia secures trading opportunities, due to the failure of the previous federal government. Under the previous government, despite the resources boom, net exports made a positive contribution to economic growth in just two out of the 11 years our they were in office. That is right: two out of the last 11 years in office. This has led to the increase in our net foreign liabilities. It is in Australia's best interests that bilateral economic and trade relations with South Africa continue to grow. The majority of the deterioration of Australia's trade balance under the previous government was in the last five years, when they had the benefit of a major resources boom and very favourable terms of trade. I think the previous government really missed an opportunity to further develop Australia's trade opportunities. We have an opportunity now to make sure that protocols are in place to reduce barriers to bilateral trade and investment and to lower withholding tax rates on interest and royalties for Australian business and investment. This government will not miss these opportunities. We must take these steps to redress the failings of the previous government. We must take steps to redress the 72 consecutive trade deficits that we inherited from the previous government. This is trade reform which is very important for our continued growth as a community. We, as a nation, are competitive enough and productive enough, I believe, to take advantage of the opportunities that this bill presents. An increase in exports will be necessary to stabilise net foreign liabilities to avoid a potentially painful readjustment process in the future. The challenge is not only to take advantage of the opportunities but also to help secure economic growth in a sustainable way for our overseas and bilateral partners. It is vital that we secure our international business culture in this country to improve our performance. It is vital that we take the lead in the trade liberalisation agenda with our international trading partners. Our region can become a very substantial economic powerhouse within the global economy. Fundamentally, it also means that we have to diversify our trade base to harness much more of the huge potential that this nation has, to provide, in the long run, benefits to consumers and to build stronger relationships with our trading partners. It is imperative that we get the frameworks right, boost economic growth and set the nation up for sustainable prosperity beyond the resources boom. This is a new era of economic reform. In just 12 months we have already made a huge down payment on our commitments to improve Australia's trade performance. We have a strong resources and agriculture base. These are the things we share strongly with South Africa. But a strong resources and agricultural base will not solely support us in the long term, and the failures of the previous government in providing long-term structural trade policy must be reversed. We are taking those opportunities. The challenge for us here is to take up those opportunities and really deliver for our nation. Let us secure a strong economic growth for our future. This bill does that, and I commend it to the House.",127
208,Mr MARLES,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"It is my great pleasure to be here speaking today and following on from the member for Corangamite. Since the member for Corangamite and I were elected to this place, this and is the first time that we have spoken consecutively in the House of Representatives, which leads to the conclusion that five o'clock today really is Geelong hour in the House of Representatives-as, of course, we very much know that five o'clock will be Geelong hour at the MCG this coming Saturday! We take this as a portent for what is to come in the next 72 hours. I rise to speak in support of the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008, which will incorporate into law the 2008 protocol agreement between South Africa and Australia relating to taxation and amend the International Tax Agreements Act 1953. The protocol that was signed earlier this year enhances and updates the existing Australia-South Africa tax treaty, which was first signed in 1999. This new protocol will assist in promoting trade between our two nations. It will also assist in providing communication and better cooperation between the tax agencies in South Africa and in Australia. It will also encourage greater investment by each country in the other. It will do this specifically by lowering the withholding tax rates on interest and royalties which are related to trade. This bill comes before the House of Representatives having first gone to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which recommended that the bill be passed through the parliament and that the protocol become law in Australia. Australia and South Africa share much within their history. Both countries had European settlement occur in the context of the British Commonwealth. The Boer War was in essence the first major conflict that Australians fought in as Australians. After that war many Australians stayed in South Africa, and in 1904 the South African census recognised over 5,000 Australian settlers. In this country we saw the first wave of South African immigration to Australia around the 1850s, when approximately 1,500 South Africans came to Australia in pursuit of goldand approximately half of those South Africans ended up living in my home state of Victoria. Today it is estimated that there are 115,000 South Africans who reside in Australia and, correspondingly, that there are 7½ thousand Australians who reside in South Africa. Australia and South Africa established diplomatic relations with each other back in 1947. Of course, those relations soured following the Sharpeville massacre in 1960 and subsequently during the apartheid era. It this country's great credit that, throughout that time, Australia strongly opposed the apartheid government in South Africa. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser spoke out vigorously against apartheid, particularly at the 1977 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Scotland, where he argued that the Commonwealth should become institutionally opposed to apartheid. Bilateral relations between our two countries have been enhanced since 1994, with the first postapartheid all-party elections and the introduction of very strong democratic institutions into South Africa. It is of interest that, since 1994, Australia has provided $120 million worth of development assistance for this, in a sense, emerging democracy. Australia and South Africa have also worked very closely together on defence issues since 1994, despite our contrasting geography, being in different longitudes of the world. The chief of staff operations for the South African National Defence Force visited Australia in August 1996 and, since then, there have been numerous visits back and forth between our two defence forces. We all remember the Australian Defence Force in 2001 praising the South African National Defence Force for its help in apprehending an illegal fishing vessel which had fled Australian waters. At a parliamentary level there has also been a lot of discourse and connection between our two countries. There have been significant parliamentary delegations and ministerial visits since 1994. The first was undertaken by the current member for Fraser, the then Minister for Trade, Bob MCMullan, back in March 1995. Under the Howard government, there were nine official visits by ministers and parliamentary secretaries, including the Prime Minister, John Howard, in 1999. There have also been four parliamentary delegations since 1997. The current is to Speaker of the House, the member for Scullin, represented Australia at the 118th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Cape Town in April this year. South Africa is the only African member of the Cairns Group. But the legacy of apartheid has not been easy for South Africa to shake. South Africa still confronts many difficult domestic issues as a result of apartheid. There are large income disparities and there is high unemployment in South Africa, and there is, as in Australia, a skills shortage. The skills shortand age in South Africa is caused, in part, by the brain drain which occurred during the apartheid era. I mentioned earlier the differing numbers of South Africans in Australia and Australians in South Africa. The very large number of South Africans in Australia is an example of that brain drain. There are also regional issues which make South Africa's domestic circumstances all the more difficult, particularly as it borders Zimbabwe and experiences the current Zimbabwean crisis, which has seen a significant influx of refugees into South Africa. That and other issues, such as the rate of HIVAIDS infection in Africa, have made for very difficult circumstances for the South African government and governmental resources. I say all of that because, despite all of those challenges and difficulties, post 1994 South Africa has prospered and become the political and economic powerhouse of Africa. South Africa currently is ranked 28th in the world in terms of GDP. World Bank statistics measure South Africa's GDP at US$227 billion. South Africa is by far Australia's largest trading partner on the African continent. Overall, the two-way trade between South Africa and Australia equates to $3.88 billion annually. South Africa currently accounts for about 1½ per cent of the Australian export market, or $2.5 billion. That figure represents what has been a year-by-year growth in trade with South Africa of about 10½ per cent. Right now, South Africa is our 16th largest merchandise export market overall. Australia supplies 1.8 per cent of South African imports and, correspondingly, we are the 16th largest importer into the South African market. The major Australian export items into the South African market include medical equipment, including veterinary equipment, which accounts for $814 million; coal, which accounts for $173 million; meat, which accounts for $57 million; civil engineering equipment, which accounts for $47 million. In addition to that, Australia also exports $347 million worth of services to South Africa, the vast bulk of which is really made up of inbound tourism to South Africa. In terms of investment, the ABS puts Australian investment in South Africa at $893 million, but really that represents only the tip of the iceberg because in fact a lot of companies do not report their investment figures to the ABS on account of commercial confidentiality. To give you a sense of how large the actual figures are: the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has estimated that Australian mining companies have approximately $15 billion invested in South Africa. Some companies-for example, Aquarius Platinum and BHP Billiton-are involved in platinum mining. GRD Minproc is involved in providing engineering services to the mining sector. International Ferro Metals is involved in both chrome mining and the ferrochrome process for amalgamating iron and chrome into ferrochrome. Mineral Commodities is a company which is involved in both nickel and chrome mining in South Africa. Palabora Mining, Rio Tinto and Riversdale are all involved in copper mining in South Africa. Tawana Resources is involved in diamond mining in South Africa. Other Australian organisations that are involved in South Africa include Monash University, which has a campus in South Africa, and Macquarie Africa, which invests in infrastructure projects in that country. To that end, a very significant company based in my electorate of Corio in Geelong is the Costa Group. The former chair of the Costa Group, of course, is Frank Costa-and, to return to the earlier theme, he is the current President of the Geelong Football Club, so my best wishes at this moment absolutely go to Frank and the team. I know that he is sitting very nervously in the lead-up to Saturday. The Costa Group is a very significant Australian company, and it currently provides logistics for a major supermarket chain in South Africa called Pick n Pay. Costas in turn employ 850,000 South Africans locally in South Africa. So there is a very large Australian company based in my electorate that has very significant interests in South Africa. Australia is South Africa's 12th largest export market. It represents two per cent of South Africa's exports and it accounts for $1.35 billion in trade. The principal merchandise items that are being exported out of South Africa into this country are passenger motor vehicles, which account for $663 million worth of exports; motor vehicle parts, which represent $47 million worth of exports; pig iron, which represents $45 million; and transport vehicles, which represent $39 million of exports out of South Africa into this country. Australia also imports $303 million worth of service items from South Africa, and again that is principally made up of South African tourists coming into this country. In terms of investment, at the end of 2007 South Africa had $1.2 billion invested in this country. That gives you a sense of the economic ties which exist between our two countries-they are very significant indeed. This only highlights the importance of this bill before the House today. The protocol which is the basis of this was signed by Australia's High Commissioner to South Africa, His Excellency Mr Philip Green, and the Acting Minister of Finance in South Africa, the Hon. Ms Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, in South Africa on 31 March of this year. The bill amends the existing taxation agreement, which, as I said earlier, first came into being in 1999. The new protocol was prompted by the need for Australia to meet the most favoured nation obligation which exists in the 1999 taxation agreement. What that in effect meant was that there was an undertaking given by Australia to South Africa that it would have the most favourable terms possible in our international relations. Australia and the UK signed a tax treaty in 2003 which enhanced the relationship between us and the UK and which bettered the existing position between Australia and South Africa. The most favoured nation obligation clause obliged both countries to renegotiate the tax agreement, which then led to the protocol which was signed this year. The principal measures contained in the protocol, and which are therefore contained in the bill before us today, are amendments which govern withholding tax rates levied on dividend flows between Australia and South Africa. These provide for a five per cent withholding tax rate for non-portfolio intercorporate dividends, which is a very long term that basically means that companies which have a more than 10 per cent interest in a company in either country have their withholding tax rate applied to the dividends which derive from that child company, if you like, at five per cent. In terms of portfolio holdings in the normal course of holding shares in a company, the withholding tax rate will be 15 per cent for dividends derived from those share portfolios. These changes and those rates conform with existing OECD norms and they also reflect the situation bill which exists in South African domestic law. The new protocol also contains a number of other measures which are significant. It will provide for much greater sharing of information between the tax agencies in South Africa and Australia. It will provide for much greater cooperation, particularly between the two tax agencies, in cross-border tax collection. It will provide for much greater consistency in the arrangement that we have in relation to tax with other countries around the world. The new tax agreement with South Africa will be much more in line with the various arrangements that we have with other countries around the world. Importantly, the protocol will provide for the insertion of a non-discrimination article. This will have the effect of preventing any discriminatory tax practices which exist in either South Africa or Australia. The protocol, which leads to the bill, will also give rise to an expanded list of taxes which the agreement applies to. The passage of the bill through the parliament in the spring session would allow for the enforcement of the new protocol by the end of this year. That is particularly important given that South Africa has already completed all its domestic requirements for enacting the protocol in its jurisdiction and in a sense is now waiting for us to do the same. In conclusion, Australia and South Africa, as I stated, have shared a very long and fruitful history. It is important that we build upon that, and that is what this bill will seek to This bill will absolutely assist in enhancing the already significant two-way trade between South Africa and Australia. In doing so, it will facilitate much greater investment opportunities for Australian companies in South Africa and for South African companies in Australia. It will also decrease the taxation barriers which exist between the two countries. That is very important in the context of the Rudd government's commitment to ensuring that Australian exporting companies have every means available to them to export their products into a global marketin this case, the South African market.",128
209,Mr BOWEN,INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (5.17 pm)-in reply-I thank all members who have contributed to this debate-not least the member for Corio, although I am sure his opening remarks do not have the unanimous support of the House. I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has expressed a strong pro-Hawthorn view at the dispatch box, and there will be various views around the House. Of course, those of us who are disenfranchised because the Sydney Swans are out of the action may sit on the sidelines. But I am sure the member for Greenway will join me in supporting the new Western Sydney team when it comes into operation. I thank the members for Casey, Cowan, Blair, Lindsay, Corangamite and Corio. As honourable members have outlined to the House, the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 gives force of law to a new tax protocol with South Africa. The new protocol, which was signed in Pretoria on 31 March 2008, modernises and enhances the bilateral tax treaty arrangements from 1999. This bill will amend the text of the existing South African tax treaty in the International Tax Agreements Act 1953. Ausdo. tralia's and South Africa's bilateral economic and trade relations continue to grow, as the member for Corio indicated. South Africa is Australia's largest and most dynamic market in Africa, and South African investment dominates investment from the African continent into Australia. Tax treaties facilitate trade and investment by minimising tax barriers between treaty partner countries by relieving double taxation, preventing tax discrimination and providing certainty with respect to tax treatment of cross-border income flows, thereby reducing compliance costs on taxpayers. Accordingly, the new protocol updates the taxation arrangements between Australia and South Africa to enhance Australia's relationship with South Africa by reducing barriers to bilateral trade and investment by lowering withholding tax rates on interest and royalties. The South African tax protocol delivers on Australia's most favoured nation obligation in the existing tax treaty to provide for rules to prevent tax discrimination. Tax discrimination under other countries' tax systems can be a significant barrier to outbound Australian investment. The protocol inserts a nondiscrimination article which prevents discriminatory tax practices between the countries. The protocol was also prompted by proposed changes to South Africa's domestic taxation law of corporate profits. The protocol amends the withholding tax rates applying to dividends, providing a five per cent rate for all non-portfolio intercorporate dividends and a 15 per cent rate for all other dividends. These changes align with the OECD norms and address South Africa's changes to its domestic law system of taxing corporate profits. Australian non-portfolio investment in South Africa will generally benefit from a reduced total South African tax on corporate profits as a result of these changes. In responding to the needs of both Australian and South African business and in ensuring protection of Australia's revenue base, the new protocol also includes a number of key changes. It updates capital gains tax treatment so that it aligns more closely with the OECD to assist trade and investment flows between countries. It modernises the exchange of information provisions to conform with OECD standards, allowing the tax administrations of both countries to share tax information. It also introduces integrity measures which provide for cross-border collection of tax debts. The new protocol will enter into force once both countries have advised that they have completed their domestic requirements, which, in the case of Australia, includes the enactment of this bill. This treaty has been considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",132

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY NA NA AMENDMENT (FURTHER 2008 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 September, on motion by Mr Griffin: That this bill be now read a second time.",133
211,Mrs MARKUS,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I rise today to speak on a bill that amends legislation relating to family assistance, child support and veterans affairs. The Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008 provides three schedules for further budget measures and other measures affecting the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Veterans' Affairs, and Human Services portfolios. Schedule 1 relates to the maternity immunisation allowance and aligns the maternity immunisation allowance with the National Immunisation Program regarding payment of the allowance. Schedule 1 also extends eligibility for the allowance to children adopted from overseas. These amendments will be reflected in the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999, referred to as the family assistance act, and the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999, referred to as the family assistance administration act, and will commence on 1 January 2009. The second schedule amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and relates to the partner service pension entitlement. Schedule 2 is a budget measure that ceases eligibility for the payment of the partner service pension to those partners of veterans who are separated but not divorced from their veteran spouse and who have not reached age pension age. There are two parts to schedule 2. The first measure is to introduce a cut-off point when eligibility ceases. The second measure is to reduce the eligibility age to 50 years for partner service pension for the partner of a veteran who is in receipt of the equivalent of or less than special rate but above general rate disability pension, or who has at least 80 impairment points under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. This measure is a good thing, but it is evidence of Labor not understanding the veteran community when they introduced the legislation earlier in the year and increased the age eligibility. It is proof of policy run. Additional amendments in the schedule make minor changes to the Veterans' Entitlements Act consequent upon the enactment of the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth LawsGeneral Law Reform) Bill 2008. It is expected that this schedule will commence from 1 July 2009, and the forecast savings in the first Labor budget are expected to be approximately $77.8 million over four years. Schedule 3 removes a number of anomalies in relation to the new child support formula reforms that commenced on 1 July 2008. Minor amendments to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, referred to as the assessment act, and the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, referred to as the registration and collection act, are set out in seven parts covering percentage of care, publication of reasons for decisions of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, departure from assessments, terminating events, reducing rate of child support under minimum annual rate assessments, overseas liabilities and crediting prescribed payments. The amendments will ensure a more balanced and flexible way of working out child support payments and will affect all parents who receive or pay child support. Reforms to the child support system were announced by the coalition in 2006 and received bipartisan support. The reforms were introduced in July 2008. Amendments in schedules 1 and 3 are welcome and build on initiatives introduced by the coalition when in government. The coalition successfully increased the funding for and rates of immunisation. In 1996, the coalition built on the National Immunisation Strategy, which evolved into the Immunise Australia sevenpoint plan in 1997. By that time, the coalition had introduced the pneumococcal and on the rotavirus vaccination programs. In 1995, immunisation rates for children from birth to six years were as low as 52 per cent. Since the introduction of the Immunise Australia program, childhood immunisation rates have increased to an all-time high, with over 90 per cent of children aged 12 to 15 months fully immunised. In 1996, Australian government expenditure on vaccines was $13 million and by the following year expenditure had increased to $443.2 million-a 34-fold increase. The coalition in government was serious about reducing childhood diseases and ensuring Australia was a healthy nation, and this continues. For an immunisation program to be effective, the coalition knew that parents had to participate. The first initiative directed towards parents was to provide a bonus through a restructured maternity allowance. From 1998, this payment was paid in two instalments, the first at birth and the second at 18 months. The second payment is known as the maternity immunisation allowance. The allowance paid to parents is a strong incentive to ensure a child's immunisation program completes the five key childhood immunisation milestones-at two, four, six, 12 and 18 months of age. A second initiative introduced in 1998 was directed towards parents in relation to childcare rebates. From 27 April 1998, families applying for childcare assistance and the childcare cash rebate were required to demonstrate that their child was fully immunised. On 1 July 2000, both childcare assistance and the childcare cash rebate were replaced by a new payment called the childcare benefit. Provisions were made for parents who do not have their children immunised due to medical contraindications or conscientious objection. Schedule 1 introduces a split payment by paying the maternity immunisation allowance, MIA, for children who meet the 18months and four-year-old immunisation requirements. Currently, eligibility for the maternity immunisation allowance is limited to children up to the age of two and is paid only once. Schedule 1 introduces split payment and extends eligibility for children up to the age of five. Schedule 1 also introduces eligibility for children born outside Australia and adopted prior to entering Australia. The adoption process does not have to be finalised at the time the child enters Australia, the child must be entrusted to the care of the person adopting the child by an authorised person and arrive in Australia while under the age of 16. I return now to schedule 2, an amendment which the coalition opposes. The new amendment seeks to contain certain budget and non-budget measures that affect veterans and their families either receiving or eligible to receive the partner service pension entitlement. These veterans and their families are getting a very poor deal from the Labor government. While this government adjusted its budget upwards, with projected gross savings of $77.8 million by the proposed changes to veterans entitlements in schedule 2, ordinary Australians-partners of veterans-faced with changed family relationships will, if this bill is accepted without amendment, from 1 January 2009, have to adjust their household budget downward as a result of those changes. In the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008, presented by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the government abandoned veterans' partners and planned to cut off the pension from partners who had separated from, but did not divorce, their veteran partner. Veterans and their families already have had to adjust their household budgets because of the increased cost of living. This bill will add further financial pressure. Why is the government going against its own policy in relation to veterans entitlements and the partner service pension? It is important to make this point: the partner service pension is not a pension in the sense of a welfare payment; it is an entitlement paid in respect of, and acknowledgement for, the veterans' special circumstances-the intangible effects of war that may result in premabut ture ageing, loss of earning power through illness or injury and the many other pressures of service in the armed forces. Veterans and their families, particularly spouses and partners, have given much to this nation, in many instances laying their lives on the line. They have sacrificed much. We pay tribute to partners and spouses who love and support our veterans. The effects of service, especially for those who have served in war zones, vary from person to person, but there are effects just same. The coalition acknowledges and respects the sacrifices veterans and their families have made in the service of this nation. In the Labor government's budget 2008-09, they made a commitment to being responsive and meeting the needs of a changing ex-service community with a focus on aged care, World War II veterans and the needs of younger veterans and members. This was touted as a key focus, but the Labor Party do not respect veterans and their families; otherwise, they would not strip away entitlements and force people who are already in stressful circumstances through relationship breakdown onto welfare. This is especially true of partners who separate and where there may be children involved. Under this bill, these separated partners will be forced to find a job or to go onto Centrelink payments. That is welfare. That is another cut that hurts the defence community deeply. The veterans community and the coalition agree on this point. A service pension is not a welfare payment; it is an entitlement. It is acknowledgement of the sacrifices and special circumstances of defence families, of veteran families. We should be grateful for these wonderful men and women who rise to whatever challenges are thrown their way and do a job that we cannot do. The Labor Party are not grateful and lack understanding of our veteran community. Eligibility applies to those partners who are separated by illness or who separate but do not enter a marriage-like relationship with another person for up to 12 months after separation. Once the 12 months are up, the payment is cut off. The coalition, back in May 2008, criticised the government for raising the age eligibility, and rightly so. The criticism is as valid today as it was then for the way in which the age eligibility threshold was changed from 50 years of age to 58.5 years of age for women and to 60 years of the age for men and now back again. This was no incremental jump but a gigantic leap that shifted the financial goalposts for many families that had planned for that pension. Why did the government do this? To save money, they say. But I put to the government that the real reason is to shift veterans entitlements from the department's budget onto welfare payments. It was a slash-and-burn decision with no consideration for the emotional, financial or social impact on vulnerable partners. This is typical of a Labor government that does not have a good record of economic management and is desperate to get some traction on economic management but has no idea that this is not the way to go. It has made a mistake by lifting that age threshold and is now caught in the backlash from the veterans community. Just as Labor is suffering a backlash by refusing to support the $30 per week rise for single age pensions, single service pensions and widow B pensions, this bill denies a benefit to partners of veterans after they have separated. This is short-sighted at a time when cost-of-living pressures, fuel, groceries and rent-and the list goes on-are placing significant burdens on veterans, their partners and their families. When they are separating, both partners in or both members of a relationship face challenges. This is a time when such government action can further exacerbate the challenges faced by all concerned. The coalition opposes the changes to the partner service pension where people are separated but not divorced. The coalition strongly believes that veterans and their partners, the men and women who support our veterans, are entitled to special entitlements and support as a way of recognising the contribution and sacrifice that our servicemen and servicewomen have made in service to our country. During the election campaign, the current Prime Minister promised the veterans community that veterans would not be worse off under a Rudd Labor government. This bill makes a mockery of that election promise. In the very first budget of the Labor government these two measures ripped $113 million out of veterans entitlements. How is that ensuring veterans are not worse off? Their partners, once the couple are separated, only have 12 months of support before they have to apply to Centrelink. There is immediate termination of the partner service pension payment if the veteran enters a new marriage-like relationship. Since 1962 Australia has been engaged in war zones in Vietnam, from 1962 to 1975; Somalia, from 1992 to 1994; East Timor, from 1999 to 2003; Afghanistan, from 2001 to the present; and Iraq, from 2003 to the present. This time frame of 1962 to 2008 is 46 years. Consider servicemen or servicewomen who married sometime in those 46 years or who are in a marriage-like relationship and who are now reaching the age of 50. They have to endure another 8.5 years or 10 years before they are eligible for income support. What happens if they separate when their partner reaches the eligibility age? If the veteran begins a new marriage-like relationship, the former partner has to immediately find a job or apply for Newstart, which is a welfare payment to support people while they look for a job. With the shift upwards of eligibility thresholds for the age pension, the gap between Newstart and the age pension is problematic and adds further financial pressure to the distressing situation of a broken relationship. How can the Labor Party do this to people? I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment in relation to the changes to the partner service pension. The final part of the bill is schedule 3, I have already covered a number of amendments to the new child support system. It is worth reflecting on what these changes will mean to the parents, either payers or payees, in this system. The new Australian Child Support Scheme commenced on 1 July 2008 with bipartisan support. Schedule 3, which deals with child support, makes minor technical amendments but will ensure the system is more transparent and equitable. The amendment as to percentage of care will enable the registrar to determine changes in the percentage of care undertaken by a parent to be reflected in the child support assessment. Another amendment allows internal review decisions of the registrar that are reviewable by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to be communicated to a person authorised by the secretary to undertake publication in a deidentified form to ensure privacy of a party or a witness to the proceedings. A third minor amendment relates to mechanisms to amend child support assessments, where appropriate, to take into account high childcare costs for non-carer parents. This is necessary because currently a non-parent carer, unlike a parent, is required to provide income details for child support purposes. A fourth amendment clarifies circumstances in which the administrative assessment of child support will terminate. Reducing the rate of child support under minimum annual rate assessments will now be able to be done by the registrar where a minimum annual rate has been assessed and the parent's income is below the formula for a 12month period. In the case of parents with additional overseas liabilities in reciprocating jurisdictions, those liabilities are reflected in the new child support formula. It allows the registrar to issue a departure prohibition order in respect of outstanding child support obligations where appropriate. The final amendment to the child support system and clarifies the rule whereby prescribed payments, such as school fees or necessary medical expenses for the child, can be credited in substitution for payment to the registrar. These amendments are welcome improvements to the child support system. Reforms to the child support system were initiated by the coalition in response to concerns raised by paying parents and payee parents in the system. The reforms were adopted by the Rudd Labor government. The amendments proposed in schedules 1 and 3 of this bill are acceptable to the coalition. Schedule 2 is being opposed by the opposition. I now move the foreshadowed amendment circulated in my name: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “while not declining to give the bill a second reading the House: (1) notes the Coalition's support for the provisions concerning the maternity immunisation allowance and child support; (2) notes the Coalition's agreement to setting at 50 years of age eligibility for partner service pension for the partners of veterans who are in receipt of the equivalent of or less than special rate but above the general rate disability, or who have at least 80 impairment points; (3) condemns the Government's stubborn determination to insist that from 1 January 2009 partners who are separated but not divorced from their veteran spouse and who have not reached the age for the age pension, will have their partner service pension eligibility cease 12 months after being separated or immediately if the veteran enters a marriagelike relationship”.

212,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008. I will be talking in particular about schedule 1 in relation to my support for this legislation. The bill will provide for certain further budget measures and other nonbudget measures affecting the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Veterans' Affairs portfolios. The measures allow for the payment of the maternity immunisation allowance in two instalments and extended eligibility for children adopted from overseas, the ceasing of the payment of the partner service pension for married partners who are separated but not divorced and minor technical amendments to child support. I will now look at the bill in a little more detail, paying attention in particular to schedule 1. Schedule 1 makes amendments to better align the maternity immunisation allowance with the National Immunisation Program by paying the allowance in two equal payments for children who meet the 18-month and four-year-old immunisation requirements. Recipients of the maternity the immunisation allowance may also be eligible if they have an approved immunisation exemption for their children. Exemptions may be granted if there is a conscientious objection to the immunisation or if there are medical reasons why the child should not be immunised. The maternity immunisation allowance is currently a one-off, lump sum payment of $236.70. It is paid for children immunised to the level recommended for an 18month-old child. The payment must be claimed on or before the child's second birthday and is not means tested. The payment was designed to provide an incentive to encourage parents to vaccinate their children before the age of two years. The payment is indexed twice a year-in March and September. The maternity immunisation allowance was paid to around 247,000 children in 2006-07 at a cost of $56.2 million. It is estimated that 38,500 of them were the children of parents who had valid immunisation exemption reasons, including 2,500 children of conscientious objectors. The measure of paying the allowance in two equal payments aims to increase the proportion of four-year-old children in Australia who are fully immunised. The existing single lump sum payment provides an incentive for parents to have their children immunised at 18 months but does not provide a similar incentive for parents to have their four-year-olds immunised. As at 30 December 2007, 93 per cent of children aged between 24 months and 27 months were fully immunised. The proportion of older children who are fully immunised is lower, with approximately 88 per cent of children fully immunised at the age of six. Vaccinations for four-year-olds, as recommended in the National Immunisation Program, currently include diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, mumps, german measles and polio. The maternity immunisation allowance is also given if a child is stillborn or dies before reaching two years of age. The bill will also extend the allowance to children who are adopted from outside Australia who enter Australia before turning 16 and are immunised appropriately after arrival. It will also make minor modifications to the rules for determining entitlement to the allowance. This particular part of the schedule is very close to my heart. I was adopted from New Zealand when I was three months old. Obviously the allowance was not available at that time, but there are considerable expenses for parents adopting children from overseas. It is a very welcome thing that those people who go through the difficult process of adopting children from overseas-and I must say that New Zealand is probably one of the easiest countries from which to adopt someone-will be able to make sure that their children are equally protected when they are in Australia. It is also important for Australian-born children that this happens because, with higher rates of immunisation, the diseases against which children are immunised are less likely to spread throughout the community. So it is a very important amendment to make sure that children who are adopted from outside Australia are also entitled to this allowance. These amendments commence on 1 January 2009. After this date, parents and carers with children who meet the immunisation requirements for an 18-month-old will be paid the first maternity immunisation allowance payment of $148.40, which is indexed, when the child is aged between 18 months and 24 months. The second payment of $118.40, which is also indexed, will be available when children have received their vaccination at four years of age, or have an approved exemption, and must be claimed on or before the child's fifth birthday. The payments will be indexed twice a year. In practice, the second instalment payment will be higher than the first, due to the subsequent indexation. Parents who have received the full immunisation payment for their children prior to implementation of this measure will not be able to claim the payment for immunisation at four years of age. I can understand the position taken by conscientious objectors when it comes to immunisation, and I respect their right to object, but I must point out some of the very many positives that have resulted in Australia from past and present immunisation programs and just how important it is that immunisation does take place throughout the community in relation to these particular diseases. While the risks associated with the diseases are high, the risks linked with vaccination are low. It is important to remember that vaccines are many, many times safer than the diseases that children are vaccinated against. Some vaccines have to be adjusted or updated over time. The oral polio vaccine, OPV, has been replaced with an inactivated polio vaccine, IPV, on the basis that the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis from OPV now exceeds the risk of catching naturally occurring polio. This change in comparative risk has come about only because polio has been eliminated from Australia, with no naturally occurring polio cases reported in Australia since 1978. This is a very good thing and is a direct result of previous immunisation programs that have made naturally occurring polio non-existent since 1978. Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, which occurs as a result of receiving polio vaccine, is extremely rare, occurring on average once in every 2.4 million doses of vaccine delivered, but can result in significant, ongoing paralysis. Since IPV replaced OPV in the United States in 2000, cases of vaccine-associated paralysis-which previously numbered eight to 10 cases per year in the United States-have been eliminated and the United States has remained polio free. IPV provides protection against all naturally occurring types of this disease worldwide, including here in Australia. Children are vaccinated in Australia against polio at two, and six months and at four years of age. Let us have a quick look at some of the other diseases which once had a far greater incidence in this country but, through immunisation, have been made far more rare and no longer impact on our children in the large numbers that they once did. Whooping cough is caused by the bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. This disease is highly infectious and most serious in babies. The disease is spread through droplets in the air and it can develop from windpipe infections into lung infections, known as pertussis pneumonia. Symptoms include coughing and ‘whooping', which can continue for a few months. Complications of the disease include a lack of oxygen to the brain, leading to brain damage and possibly death. Pertussis is a vaccine preventable disease. Vaccination recommended for routine childhood immunisation is listed on the National Immunisation Program schedule and funded for children under the Immunise Australia Program. People in high-risk occupations, such as health and childcare workers, are urged under the program to consider receiving a booster against pertussis. In my previous role as the National Secretary of the Health Services Association, we always used to say to our members and all health workers that this was something that they should be oral very aware of, and we urged them to make sure that they participated in a vaccination program so that they were safer when looking after the sick in our country. No doubt most members are familiar with tragic stories of Australians, young people in particular, who have died or been left permanently scarred or disabled by meningococcal infections. Meningococcal diseases are caused by a number of different strains of a certain bacteria. Meningococcal diseases include meningitis, septicaemia, pneumonia, arthritis and conjunctivitis. It takes between four one to 10 days after infection before symptoms show. Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, confusion, irritability and drowsiness. In Australia, meningococcal infections caused by strain C are vaccine preventable in all age groups, including babies and young children. Infections caused by strains A, C, W135 and Y are vaccine preventable in older children and adults. Vaccination recommended for routine childhood immunisation is listed on the National Immunisation Program schedule and funded for children under the Immunise Australia Program. Diphtheria is another vaccine preventable disease, classed as an acute illness. Toxins produced by a bacteria that causes diphtheria affect the respiratory tract, the nervous system, the adrenal glands and the heart muscle cells. Spread by droplets or direct contact with wounds and materials soiled by infected persons, diphtheria takes two to five days after infection for symptoms to show. The disease mainly affects the respiratory tract but skin can also become infected. The bacteria form a membrane of dead, white blood cells in the upper respiratory tract, causing breathing difficulties. The diphtheria toxin can cause severe nerve and heart damage. Vaccination recommended for routine childhood immunisation is listed on the National Immunisation Program and funded for children under the Immunise Australia Program. A number of immunisations are required in the first few years of a child's life to tect the child against the most serious infections of childhood. The immune system in young children does not work as well as the immune system in older children and adults because it is still immature. That is why more doses of vaccine are needed for children. In the first months of life, a baby is protected from most infectious diseases by antibodies from his or her mother, which are transferred to the baby during pregnancy. When these antibodies wear off, the baby is at risk of serious infections and so the first immunisations are given before these antibodies have gone. Another reason why children get many immunisations is that new vaccines against serious infections continue to be developed. The number of injections is reduced by the use of combined vaccines, where several vaccines are combined into one shot. The common side effects of immunisation are redness and soreness at the site of injections and a mild fever. While these symptoms may concern parents and upset their children at the time, the benefit of the immunisation program is protection from disease. More serious reactions to immunisations are very, very rare. That is some of the background as to why immunisation is so important in the lives of Australians. Diseases which were once thought to be the normal risks of everyday existence in this country, such as polio and tetanus, are now fully preventable thanks to vaccines and immunisation. The changes made possible through this bill will give parents an incentive to have their four-year-olds given the recommended boosters before they start school and should result in many Australian children having a better overall level of immunisation. There are other elements of this bill which I will touch on briefly. Schedule 2 of the bill contains amendments to the Veterans' Entiprotlements Act 1986 that will give effect to the 2008-09 budget measure to cease eligibility for partner service pension for those partners who are separated but not divorced from their veteran spouses and who have not reached pension age. Under current provisions, a non-illness-separated spouse loses eligibility for the partner service pension from the date from which they enter into a marriage-like relationship. These amendments extend circumstances to lose eligibility to 12 months after the date of separation or when the veteran partner enters into a marriage-like relationship. These amendments commence on 1 January 2009. Further amendments will set the eligibility age at 50 years for partner service pension for the partner of a veteran who is in receipt of the equivalent of or less than the special rate but above the general rate disability pension or who has at least 80 impairment points under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. These amendments would only commence upon royal assent. The bill also makes minor amendments to the child support legislation, notably to address anomalies in relation to the child support formula reforms that commenced on 1 July 2008. These changes include reflecting changes in care of less than 7.1 per cent in the child support assessment in certain circumstances, allowing the publication of deidentified reasons for decisions in child port cases by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, allowing either parent to apply for a departure from assessments in high-cost care cases, and allowing departure prohibition orders to be enforced for overseas maintenance liabilities. To briefly recap, this bill makes changes that will, firstly, restructure the maternity immunisation allowance to bring it more closely in line with the National Immunisation Program. The reasons why this needs to be done and why immunisation is so important have already been outlined. The first partner service pension measure in the bill will cease eligibility for those partners who have separated but not divorced from their veteran spouses and who have not reached pension age. Under this measure, eligibility for partner service pensions will cease 12 months after separation or if the veteran enters into a marriage-like relationship. The second partner service pension measure is to set the eligible age of 50 years for partner service pension for the partner of a veteran who is in receipt of less than the special rate but above the general rate of disability pension or who has at least 80 impairment points under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Australians have the second longest life expectancy, next to Japan, with Australians living an average of 81 years. Immunisation programs have played an important role, though they are not the sole determinant in this. It is vitally important for the future health of the nation, not only in making sure that we live longer but also in terms of the quality of life that Australians live, that immunisation programs are supported and encouraged so that we can have higher rates of immunisation. This will make sure that children are not made vulnerable to the various diseases that in past generations caused so much heartache and loss. It is vitally imporsup- tant that these immunisation programs are supported. It is vitally important that the amendments in this bill are supported so that young Australians, and those who are adopted from overseas and become Australians, are given the maximum encouragement and maximum opportunity to participate in our immunisation programs that bring about a healthier and longer-living citizenship in this country. I commend the bill to the House.",138
213,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"In rising to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008, I first want to speak to the part of it dealing with the immunisation provisions, particularly as they apply to adopted children. During the last parliament, I chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, and we brought down a most important report entitled Overseas adoption in Australia. One of the recommendations that we made-and I am very pleased to see that it was referred to in the second reading speech-was that: The Minister for Family and Community Services amend the eligibility criteria for the maternity immunisation allowance in the case of children adopted from overseas so the eligibility period is two years after the child's entry to Australia. The reason we made that recommendation is that obviously some children were adopted when they were older, and also there were some children for whom the adoption actually took place in another country before they came to Australia, such as those coming from China. It was a great inequity-one of a number that we identified in that report. We also made some very serious recommendations to make it easier for Australian couples to go through the process of being vetted and having their files sent to countries where we have adoption agreements. We recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade take over the negotiations of adoption agreements between Australia and other countries instead of the piecemeal way in which this process had been conducted for years, whereby various states had different responsibilities for various countries or, more specifically, for particular orphanages or agencies within that country. It was a most inefficient and unfair way of dealing with things. The degree of fear that was encountered by many people who were wishing to become adopting parents was such that some of them pulled out of giving evidence to our inquiry for the simple reason that they thought their file might be lost or pushed under the desk and that they would not be assessed in a timely way. There is a great yearning of parents and would be parents in Australia to give love and comfort to children whom they adopt from overseas. The committee was of the very firm view that adoption was a legitimate way of forming or adding to a family but that this was against what it found existed in the bureaucracy, which was an anti-adoption attitude. Hopefully, largely from the former government's acceptance of this report and also from this government's implementation of many of the sections of the report, we will see those children who are able to come to this country have love in their lives and an expectation of a good life fulfilled. I am very warmly reminded of the words of one of our youngest witnesses, who was aged 14. She came from Ethiopia. Her testimony was, very simply, how wonderful it was for her to be in Australia and to be loved. Had she remained in Ethiopia, her life expectancy would have been 39 years of age, but here, in Australia, she was able to have a long life expectancy. She was also able to choose a career that could venture from a model to a pop idol to a chef. She was a remarkable young lady and had formed wonderful friendships. She is a splendid Australian. That story is, I think, one that we want to see repeated. So I am very pleased to see that provision included in this legislation. When I read the title of the bill-the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008-I see not one word relating to veterans. Yet this bill is implementing a harsh withdrawal of veterans entitlements. When I was shadow minister for veterans' affairs, I found the provision for this in the budget papers, hidden away in the hope that people might not notice it. The provision that is being made law in this legislation will take away the service pension of a partner or spouse of a veteran where the veteran and their spouse remain married but might be living apart for reasons that are not illness related. I have heard some heartfelt descriptions of how this will impact on people's lives. The spouse or partner of a veteran will lose their service pension when 12 months have expired or when the veteran enters into, as the current legislation states, ‘a marriage-like relationship'. However, when the same-sex legislation is passed, this legislation will also include a veteran moving into a de facto relationship. De facto relationships will encompass same-sex relationships as well as heterosexual relationships or marriage-like relationships. Last night, in a speech during the second reading debate on the same-sex legislation, I said that both sides of parliament acknowledged that marriage holds a special place in our society, and I also unashamedly said that marriage should be discriminated in favour of. That is not to say that questions of financial fairness and equity should not be dealt with. But the fundamental point needs to be stated and upheld. Once this legislation becomes law and once the same-sex legislation start date occurs, which is 1 July 2009, you could literally have a situation where, for a wife of 30 years who is still married to a veteran and where the veteran, for whatever reason, establishes himself either in a de facto heterosexual relationship or a de facto homosexual relationship, the wife of 30 years would lose her service pension and the new partner, be they of the same sex or of the opposite sex, would be eligible to take that pension. That is not fair, it is not reasonable and it is certainly a whittling away of veterans' entitlements. Let me read part of a letter that I have received. This woman writes: My husband is 63 and I am now 61½. In the recent issue of the Veterans Affairs newspaper sent to all recipients of benefits from the Department of Vets Affairs, it was advised on page 4 that legislation is proposed to cease payment of the partner service pension to separated partners of veterans and that those pensions already being paid will cease from the 1st January 2009. This is the only notice I have received to alert me to this I feel I am being cast aside with no consideration for my age and without any acknowledgment of my contribution to the care and support of my veteran husband over so many years, through the most difficult of times and circumstances at great personal and financial cost. We are still married and we are still close. We are just unable to continue to live together. I firmly believe that my individual circumstances are what they are because of the fact that my husband served his country when called upon to do so. In April of 2007 I was interviewed personally for the Australian Vietnam Veterans Family Health Study, an epidemiological study of the health and welfare of Australian veterans and their families. This research is designed to look at what impact service in Vietnam had for their families. She has participated, yet she has been jettisoned. Because she is 61, she will not be eligible to move to the social welfare pension-the old age pension. She continues: My income without the partner service pension and concessions will not be sufficient to maintain a quality of life while honouring the financial commitments that were made whilst I fully expected the income from the service pension to continue. This is a woman who says, as I read out, that her circumstances are because of the service that her veteran husband gave for our country. I made a strong statement as shadow minister that we in the opposition believe we have a contract with our veterans. We say, ‘You men and women who serve our country and put your lives on the line, we will look after you for the rest of your lives.' That is a contract that we make. It is not welfare. What we give to them is an entitlement. Only our men and women in service uniform can be ordered into a situation where they know death is inevitable-not police, not firemen, not all the other people in civilian life; only our service personnel. We owe them a great debt. The term ‘veteran' is one to be revered. fact. It is something that is earned. Therefore, after the Prime Minister made the statement before the election that veterans would not be worse off under Labor, he has lied to those people by taking away these entitlements in this legislation. Earlier he took away an entitlement for a female partner of a veteran to be eligible for the service pension at age 50. In one leap that was put up to 58½ and for men up to 60. And it will continue to rise to bring it in line with social security. There are people around who want to see veterans entitlements rolled into social welfare. We stand firm against that. Yet what we are seeing is entitlements being morphed into social security. In Budget Paper No. 2 this particular change to the law was said to originally represent a saving to the government of $77 million over four years. That was read down to $39 million because a great proportion of those people would be moved onto social security. The entitlement is morphed into social security. There are those who are not eligible to be moved onto those entitlements, and so they do not know how they are going to cope-as with the person whose letter I just read out. The estimated saving to the government according to the financial statement in the explanatory memorandum is now being pushed up to $40 million over four years. But there is a little concession from the earlier amendment that was so punitive to the veteran community. On the question of no longer being entitled to a partner service pension at the age of 50, the explanatory memorandum states 50 will be the eligible age for: … partners of veterans who are in receipt of the equivalent of or less than special rate but above general rate disability pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act or who have … 80 or more impairment points under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The Veterans' Entitlements Act disability pension rates affected by this measure are: - general rate disability pension that is increased by an amount specified in any of the items 1 to 6 of the table in subsection 27(1), - extreme disablement adjustment disability pension; - intermediate rate disability pension; and - temporary special rate disability pension. That is so restricted that the cost to the budget is $1.2 million over four years. In other words, the saving that was set out in Budget Paper No. 2, which if my memory serves me was in the vicinity of $33 million over four years, is now being adjusted by $1.2 million. In other words, the vast number of people who were affected remain affected. We put up an amendment to negate the changing of the age from 50 to 58½ for women and 60 for men for that earlier legislation. The government did not accept our amendment. I note now that the new shadow minister for veterans' affairs has moved a pious amendment condemning: … the government's stubborn determination to insist that from 1 January 2009 partners who are separated but not divorced from their veteran spouse and who have not reached the age for the age pension, will have their partner service pension eligibility cease 12 months after being separated or immediately if the veteran enters a marriage-like relationship … I do hope that we move a stronger amendment along the way, because this is taking away veterans entitlements. When I speak about the duty and the obligation that we have to those who have served our nation, one group of veterans whom we treated abominably were Vietnam veteransveterans who found that their wives at home would not be served in shops, who found that their children would be bullied in the playground because their father was serving in Vietnam, who came home but would never put on their resume that they had served. I remember the incident when a young soldier was reported as having been killed and one of the anti-war protesters rang the family and said he got what he deserved and threw red paint over the house. The stories are horrendous. When you talk to the vets, you know how bad it was. New Zealand has apologised to their Vietnam vets, and I believe we should apologise to our vets here in Australia. In order for that apology to be meaningful we have to bring out into the light of day how bad it was, how Dr Jim Forbes, who went on to be a Treasurer of this nation under Gough Whitlam, used to rile up the demonstrators to attack our serving personnel. How disgraceful is that? I believe it would not happen in this day and age. The Labor Party wanted to take away their medals. It was just the most appalling set of circumstances, which have to be outed in order that an apology would mean something. These people suffer today. These are the people, Vietnam vets, who will be immediately impacted by these changes that this government is making-this government, which promised veterans it would not take away entitlements and that veterans would not be worse off. These are the people who will be affected-as are the veterans who are now serving in Afghanistan and Iraq, the younger veterans. These are the people that these provisions will impact upon. It is a mean-spirited government that would attack veterans in this way and take away their entitlements. As I said, I do believe particularly that we owe our Vietnam veterans. Thank you for that note, Member for Aston. One of my colleagues has said that I said ‘Jim Forbes', who was a very honourable minister in the coalition. I do apologise for making that error. Of course, it was Jim Cairns I was speaking of. As I conclude my remarks on this bill, it is with great pleasure that I see the report on overseas adoptions accepted and legislated for. But it is with a great sense of sadness that I see entitlements for our veterans being taken away and see that, for those who will get some sort of benefit, they will now simply be social welfare beneficiaries.",142
214,Mr NEUMANN,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"It has really amazed me at times, in the 10 months since I have been here, to hear the voices of some on the opposition benches. I wish that some of their constituents could hear what they say at times about those people in same-sex relationships and those people who are living in non-marital relationships. We have heard hysteria at times from those opposite-not from all of them but from some-in relation to family life, as if those on this side of the House do not live in families, do not appreciate the pressures that family life can bring, do not have children, do not pay mortgages, do not love their children, do not love their relatives and do not live in society and the community. It is extraordinary the way that they go on. We heard stuff from the member for Mackellar previously about polygamous relationships, and criticising our side, in relation to so much of our legislation, as if it is antifamily. It is nonsense that our legislation is antifamily or that this government is antifamily. This particular piece of legislation is about family relationships; it is about veterans issues; it is about helping and encouraging people to take better care of the health of their children. So I speak in support of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008. It is an omnibus bill. I want to speak on it for two reasons. Firstly, I want to speak on the bill because there is a large veterans community in my electorate of Blair, where RAAF Base Amberley is. It is about to become a superbase. Amberley is a place that people want to be posted to, and they often buy homes in Ipswich and, if they get posted to other places, come back to Ipswich to live after they retire. We have a big veterans community in the Ipswich area and in the Lockyer Valley and the Boonah Shire close by. Secondly, I want to speak on the bill because of my background as a family lawyer. The bill has three main elements: the maternity immunisation allowance instalment and extension of eligibility, the cessation of the partner service pension to some married but separated partners, and changes to the Child Support Scheme in relation to the formula and departures from assessment. I want to commend the member for Dobell for his long standing interest and service in the health sector. He has stood up for the rights of working men and women. And he has a deep, abiding interest in their long-term welfare. He spoke very well in relation to the maternity immunisation allowance issue. Currently, the eligibility for the MIA is contingent upon the child being under two years of age and then the MIA is paid but once. The MIA is a non-income-tested, oneoff payment, and it is designed to encourage parents to immunise their children. If parents receive the baby bonus, then the MIA commonly is paid when the child is 19 months old. If parents are not paid the baby bonus, they need to formally claim the MIA on or before the child's second birthday. It is a that, sadly, immunisation rates for Australian children are higher when they are two years of age than when they are going to school. It is probably understandable in a sense: when you have a baby you are really more careful, and you think that children, by the time they go to school, are a little bit more robust. I think we all think that of our children. This bill contains a budget measure to align the allowance with the National Immunisation Program. The change in this bill will ensure that the MIA is paid in two equal payments for children who meet the 18month and the four-year immunisation requirements. Further, it will extend the eligibility for the allowance to children adopted from overseas who enter Australia before turning 16 years and who are immunised subsequent to migration to Australia. The change follows the recommendation of the 2005 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services inquiry into adoption of children from overseas. That committee recommended, at recommendation 10, that: The Minister for Family and Community Services amend the eligibility criteria for the maternity immunisation allowance in the case of children adopted from overseas so the eligibility period is two years after the child's entry to Australia. I am pleased that the minister is taking heed of that recommendation and putting that in this bill. The member for Dobell went through a number of the different diseases which the National Immunisation Program recommends that children should be vaccinated against. There is a need for vaccination for four-year-olds. There is a need for vaccination in relation to whooping cough, measles, mumps, german measles, polio and the like. It is important for parents to vaccinate their fact children. It is something that every dutiful parent should take notice of in the circumstances. I have had a lot of discussions with the minister on the issue of partner changes in relation to Veterans' Affairs. The situation is that from 1 January 2009 any spouse of a veteran who has been separated from that veteran for 12 months or more will cease to be eligible for the partner service pension. Eligibility will also cease if the veteran has entered or enters a marriage-like relationship with another person. It is a fact that people separate and move on. This measure does not affect partners who are over age pension age unless the partner enters into a marriage-like relationship or divorce. That is the current policy. The measure will not apply to a spouse who is separated from a veteran simply because of illness. That is a fact for a lot of people who are married to veterans. A spouse of a veteran who has separated because of illness remains a partner of that veteran even if, say, the veteran is in a nursing home. That is the case. They will not be disadvantaged by this measure. The minister informs me that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is writing to each of those separated spouses who might be affected by this measure to advise of the change and provide assistance in seeking alternative income support arrangements for those who require it. My understanding is also that a special team in the department has been established to ensure individuals have their circumstances properly considered and are fully informed of any options which are available to them in respect of income support. Spouses who lose eligibility for a partner service pension under the measure contained in this bill may be eligible for an income support payment paid by Centrelink. These payments include Newstart allowance, widow allowance and disability support pension. It is interesting to note that the disabilforceable ity support pension is paid at the same rate as the partner service pension. I understand also that special teams have been formed to help in the transition of these arrangements to Centrelink. It must be noted that, under the age pension situation for a partner of a veteran, it is estimated that there will be around 580 partners of veterans under age pension age. This number includes spouses of veterans who may be assessed as separated due to illness and therefore will not be affected by this measure. Thirty-four per cent of the 580 partners are now in receipt of less than the maximum rate of partner service pension, as they have other income and/or assessable assets. For those people over age pension age, it is important to note that it is estimated that only around 590 separated partners will be over the age pension age, and they will not be affected by this measure on 1 January 2009. The age pension and the partner service pension are paid at the same rate, so these 590 partners will continue to receive their pension paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. So you can see that there will be very few people affected in the circumstances-and a lot of alarmism is being preached by those opposite. The third element of this bill deals with child support reform. There are a series of what have been described as minor changes in relation to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988. It is important to think about child support because Australia has been a leading light throughout the world when it comes to child support. It is not commonly known that, at common law, a parent owed no duty to provide financial support for a child that was enforceable by litigation. Statute has long intervened in the circumstances to provide civil liability for financial support of children by parents enby court action. The Family Law Act, at section 66C, establishes a legal duty to maintain a child and creates the legal obligation to pay child maintenance. A court exercising jurisdiction under that act, namely the Family Court or the Federal Magistrates Court, is constrained by section 66E of the Family Law Act from making a child maintenance order if an application can properly be made for an administrative assessment of child support under the Child Support (Assessment) Act. The principal object of the Child Support (Assessment) Act is to ensure children receive a proper level of financial support from their parents. The assessment act therefore creates and quantifies that liability and the subsequent debt but does not create the debt. It does not determine any question about legal rights or obligations in the circumstances, but it may operate to create future obligations. Though an application under the Child Support (Assessment) Act creates obligations, it is the case that both parents should contribute financially to their children, and they should do so to the extent of their respective abilities, taking into consideration their needs. It is the case that, if a person is unhappy with an administrative assessment of child support, they can apply for a review, or the Child Support Registrar can seek a review of that decision, to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. In each case it is looked at to see all the facts before it, and a full and frank disclosure must be made by all the parties in the circumstances. The SSAT is a very important legal process. The whole business of making sure that people pay child support is a legal process that can be quite cumbersome and costly for people. An appeal can be made from the SSAT on questions of law by way of an application to the Federal Magistrates Court under section 110B of the registration and collection act. That is why it is important for the SSAT to have the body of precedent that has been created and for there to be nonidentification of parties but authorisation for law to be developed so people can actually see the kind of relevant decisions in case law precedent which will help them to avoid going to the SSAT in those circumstances. That is what this bill does in one of the aspects of the child support amendment. Child support amendments are important, and we have seen a remarkable unanimity between both sides of politics when it comes to seeking child support amendments. In fact, we have seen a big change from 1 July this year. Those changes built on the recommendation of the 2005 independent Ministerial Task Force on Child Support, which was established as a result of the House of Representatives report Every picture tells a story. Stage 3 of child support reform came on 1 July this year. As a result of stage 3, there has been an analysis undertaken by the Australian government of the 691,000 cases-so you can see that child support affects a lot of Australians and their families. About 37 per cent of payees and about 51 per cent of payers have had net increases in household income as a result of the reforms. About 49 per cent of the payees and 33 per cent of the payers have had net reductions-that is, they have paid less overall. About 13 per cent of payees and 16 per cent of payers have had no change in their child support or their family tax benefit as a result of the reforms. Most of the people who have received changes of assessment in child support have had an adjustment of sometimes less than $10 a week and sometimes up to about $20 a week. It is important that the government back up these changes with tough enforcement measures-and they came into operation on 1 July this year-to make sure that parents who have child support obligations pay their full amount of child support and that they do so in a timely way. It is important that we collect more child support because that puts less pressure on the Australian taxpayer, and case it is important that parents who have the children fulfil their responsibilities not just financially but in a parental way as well. In my work as a family lawyer it never ceased to amaze me how often people would say that they were paying too much child support when the amount they were paying was far less than the Australian Institute of Family Studies said should be paid to meet the real cost of maintaining children. The reforms we are talking about here will make changes to calculations of the percentage of care that will reflect agreements that are made by way of a consent order or child support agreement and will reflect the reality of people's experience. The second part of the child support changes permits the publication of reasons for decisions by the SSAT, and that is extremely important, as I have said. The SSAT is required to provide reasons for its decision to parties seeking reviews and of course to the registrar. The amendments provide that the SSAT will not be prevented from communicating its reasons to authorised persons or from publishing them. That is important. It is also important that people's privacy be maintained, and this bill takes that into consideration-as well as witnesses, who do not want to be dragged into the process and have their names plastered around for public identification and comment. The third aspect is an amendment that will permit either parent to apply for a departure order in circumstances where the real cost of caring for children should be taken into consideration. Under section 117(2) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, if it is just and equitable and otherwise proper, parents can have regard to making applications for what is commonly called a departure order. The high cost of maintaining children was often taken into consideration but only for one of the parties. The child support reforms mean that not just the carer parent but the other parent can have the reality of the care of the children taken into consideration. So that is an important measure in all of the circumstances. It is a just measure. The final thing that I want to say is that the government is extending the departure prohibition orders to overseas maintenance liabilities. We have entered into foreign treaties, we have signed treaties in relation to overseas child maintenance and the Hague convention on child abduction, but it is important that we in this country fulfil our gations and enforce child support no matter where it is assessed-in our country or overseas. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)",146
215,Ms MARINO,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008. I would like to share with the House the reallife impact some of these measures will have on veterans and their families, such as those from my own electorate of Forrest. To begin with I would like to acknowledge the courage, the loyalty and the commitment to our nation that our veterans display while serving in many theatres of war around the world. It was and is these men and women who fought for our nation, our beliefs, our freedoms and our security. We thank and acknowledge these people on ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day and honour the memory of their fallen mates for their ultimate sacrifice for our country. The Prime Minister said on ANZAC Day this year, ‘There is no higher calling than to wear the uniform of Australia.' He thanked the veterans and their families for their services to Australia. I could not agree with the Prime Minister more. As a nation, we are indebted to these brave people and their families. Yet here we are in the House of Representatives of Australia with the Labor government proposing to reduce veterans entitlements. Unless you have been to war, you cannot truly understand the effect fighting in a war has on an individual. The transition from life in a war zone to peacetime life is an immense challenge for many returning service personnel. Issues which arise include posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and suicide, as well as a raft of other emotional obliand/or mental illnesses-not to mention the impact of physical wounds. Furthermore, returning service men and women must relearn how to live within their family and their community-at times, no mean feat. They have to rediscover their family and try to integrate back into the lives of those they left behind. Not only that-veterans continue to live with their experiences whilst at war. It is no wonder these brave people encounter problems upon their return. But it goes much further than just the dividual. A veteran's whole family must readjust as well. The family takes the strain these mental, emotional and physical impacts that weigh on the veteran. Our continuing support for these families is crucial. The bor government must not turn their back on our veterans and families after all they have done for this country and for us. Certainly those people who fought for our country in uniform should be recognised for the service they provided to this country. So too should their partners be recognised for supporting them, for the time they kept the family together while their husband or wife was actively serving away from Australian shores, and they should continue to be recognised for keeping their relationships together when our defence personnel returned home. This is often underestimated. Consider the Vietnam vets specifically and what they endured both while they were away and when they came home-they were certainly not always the same person physically, emotionally or mentally as the one who went away. The strain on partners to keep those relationaway. ships together is very difficult to quantify, and I do not think it can be quantified. Most partners certainly tried to keep the relationside ship alive and the family unit together. However, some couples ultimately, after perhaps 30 or 40 years, came to the point where they could not support each other anymore and subsequently parted. Such a move is always hurtful to families and partners who have to start a new life. Some never cope and some never recover. Some hang on to their long relationships, never wanting to completely sever those ties or file for divorce. The previous government did recognise the commitment and dedication that partners gave to veterans, with the payment of the partner service pension as an entitlement. After all that our veterans and their partners have endured on behalf of Australia as a in- whole, I am appalled that this government wants to change the eligibility rules for the of partner service pension and cut out those very deserving partners who are separated but not divorced from their veteran spouses. LaCurrently, separated partners are eligible for the partner service pension until they divorce or commence a new marriage-like relationship. This is a fair and reasonable policy. But the Labor government's proposal will cast aside those partners who are now into their middle years and currently do not reside with their veteran spouse for whatever reasonsome of which I have outlined earlier. It will simply cut them off within 12 months of this bill becoming legislation. The Rudd Labor government proposes that, from 1 January 2009, partner service pension eligibility will cease 12 months after the date of separation unless either partner commences a new marriage-like relationship beforehand. Partners who separated from their veteran spouse before 1 January 2008 will lose their partner service pension eligibility from 1 January 2009-three months Many partners are ill equipped to enter the workforce. Many more have not worked out the home for most of their adult lives, often because of the problems endured by the veteran in the family. They have often spent their lives working in the home, looking after their husband and children, happy to have the service years over, enduring whatever ailments their partner's tour of duty has created. This government is out of touch with real people and does not understand or respect partners of veterans who have served our country well. Indeed, these partners have actually saved the government a great deal of money by keeping their family units together for as long as they have, as well as supporting their husbands during a difficult period of their lives. There was no government recognition or assistance in those early years after Vietnam. The government's legislation is forecast to save $40.6 million over four years on this measure alone-that is, the government will take $40.6 million from those hands. Additional amendments proposed by the government will further erode veterans entitlements. This government intends to increase the age eligibility for the partner service sion, which was previously 50 years of age, to 58.5 years for women and 60 for men. There is also another proposed amendment that will allow partners to continue to receive the partner service pension from 50 years of age if their veteran partner falls into a new disability category. The government was shamed into this after receiving a backlash from the veteran community-and rightly so. Both these proposed changes to veterans entitlements were announced in the budget, and the government stated that the changes would provide gross savings of $77.8 million over four years. I would challenge this savings figure because I do not believe the government has taken into account the number of affected partners who will move onto other government income support through welfare. I believe the proposed changes in this bill are too severe, unjust and unfair to married recipients of the partner service pension who are separated but not divorced from their veteran spouse. I would like to share with the House the plight of one of my constituents in my electorate of Forrest who is in a state of shock, distress and basically depression due to the extreme adverse financial impact these changes will have on her life. She is one of those ‘real people'. My constituent was married to a Vietnam veteran for almost 40 years. For the last four years she has been living apart from her husband. She had been married for just over 12 months when her husband was sent to Vietnam. When he returned, they tried to recapture their life and they looked forward to a long and happy marriage. But this was not to be. When they married, they married for life and were determined to maintain a happy family for their three children. As her husband became more withdrawn and uncommunicative, their personal relationship suffered. Achieving a happy family home bepencame almost impossible. My constituent was a stay-at-home mum. Her job was running the home and small farm, bringing up children and caring for her husband. When circumstances required, she undertook cleaning and other odd jobs to provide for extras and education for the children. Her veteran husband was eventually diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and, at 50 years of age, was classified a TPI and a service pensioner. Without the social stimulation provided by employment, her husband became even more isolated. When the children left the family home, life became increasingly difficult for the couple. Their personal relationship deteriorated until there was little or no communication left between them. With the tension of silence too hard to take, they made the decision to live apart. This decision was not made lightly, as family was, and still is, of great importance to both parties. After so many years together, husband and wife now life apart and alone. As a result of having children together, however, they will always have a relationship. In 34 years of marriage, my constituent spent only one year with a husband who was not affected by war service. She has spent those years of her life living and working in difficult circumstances and, in many ways, she has suffered as much as her veteran husband. Her view of the reason for the change in eligibility-that is, ‘to ensure that a person's income support entitlements are paid based on their own circumstances and not on a relationship that may have ceased many years ago'-is that it is not only appalling but also insulting. In the four years that my constituent has lived alone, her entitlement has always been based on her own circumstances, and any income earned has been taken into consideration. During her married life as a full-time homemaker, she had very few opportunities to develop a career, and her limited paid employment was in unskilled areas such as cleaning and general farm work. And we must remember that she was living with a veteran with problems. Her lack of selfconfidence from years of emotional deprivation makes the thought of being forced into retraining programs through Centrelink quite terrifying for her. My constituent is devastated that, at this time in her life-she is in her mid-fifties-when she has finally found some kind of quiet peace of her own, she will be forced to make a whole new life. After suffering a continual erosion of self-worth and rejection over many years, she cannot even begin to envisage her future. I am most concerned about how many other women in circumstances like those of my constituent, who have suffered most severely in a relationship with a veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, are going to cope with the loss of this entitlement. I would remind those opposite that we are dealing with people's lives-real people. I believe these proposed changes to eligibility for partners, are unjust and unfair and show no respect for the deserving partners. Their veteran spouses may have gone to war for several years but, in some instances, veterans' wives and partners have been suffering ever since. My constituent is one of the vulnerable real people affected by this change. I respect the veterans and their wives or husbands. I oppose the changes to the partner service pension for separated but not divorced partners, and I support the amendments moved by the member for Greenway.",150
216,Mr CHAMPION,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008 because it is a bill that directly benefits some of our youngest Australians. I think that is particularly important. The member for Dobell gave a great speech on this bill. He has a long and proud history as National Secretary of the Health Services Union and has a great interest in this area. I think he is a real benefit to the House. The member for Blair also gave a great speech; I commend them both. This bill provides for three important changes. The first is to the maternity immunisation allowance, the second is to partner service pensions and the third is to child support. All three directly affect my electorate of Wakefield. Wakefield has young families, a strong and vibrant veteran community and also an extraordinarily large number of both payers and receivers of child support. You can see the very great changes to the structure of society and the structure of families in Wakefield. One of the great challenges for government in the future will be how it responds to constellation families. We have fewer nuclear families than we once had and, increasingly, we have constellation families where people do not have just one family; they have sometimes two or three. They have biological children and stepchildren, and they have a multitude of relationships. These family relationships do not always fit neatly into government programs. Child support is one of those areas that we are trying desperately to improve, but it does not always fit that well into people's personal situations. This bill is an attempt to improve that situation and to have some regard to people's personal circumstances. As I said before, how we respond to those changes will be one of the great challenges of modern government. These changes reflect a government that is concerned about advancing Australians' living standards but is also aiming at balancing the books and maintaining budgetary and economic responsibility. We know that you cannot improve people's lives by funny accounting or by Peronist policies. The opposition want to pretend that we can be all things to all people, that we can just promise everything to every group, that there is a magic pudding out there and that you can take a spoon, dip it in and keep dipping it in just like in Norman Lindsay's book. My mum used to read The Magic Pudding to me. The member for Fadden is a great believer in the magic pudding; he seems to be for everything. The Howard government had the magic pudding policy. They kept on spending and spending, and the IMF picked up their explosive rate of spending in the last couple of budgets, which fuelled inflation. That is a matter of record and history now. It is obviously costing those on fixed incomes in particular greatly. Mr Haase interjecting",153
217,Mr CHAMPION,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"We are waiting for the Senate to pass our Medicare surcharge tax cut to working Australian families, couples and singles. We are waiting on the other place to pass our budget, and I would just encourage members opposite to do that. The first of these reforms is the change to the maternity immunisation allowance, the MIA, to bring it in line with our National Immunisation Program. In 2006-07, the maternity immunisation allowance assisted with the immunisation of almost a quarter of a million Australian children at a cost of $56.2 million. That $56.2 million is very well spent. It helps families. It assists people who have young families. It assists those in school, because it prevents diseases from damaging our young people. It represents a significant contribution to 270,000 Australian families. People want a health system that is focused on maintaining health and preventing disease rather than responding to it. Families know that prevention is better than cure. They know that immunisation is far better than being sick, going to hospital or visiting a doctor later on-all of which take extraordinary amounts of time out of a family's life and are distressing. Immunisation is an essential part of effective healthcare policy. In particular, it is important for parents who are concerned about protecting the health of their children. In Wakefield, there are almost 10,000 children under the age of six. Obviously we want to make sure that they are inoculated against preventable diseases. The level of immunisation in Wakefield is about 93 per cent, which is a great achievement. It is a high rate and one that we want to improve. There are a lot of young families in the area, so having high immunisation rates is particularly important. The mid-north region includes the lovely town of Clare. It is great wine-growing territory-I know the member for Adelaide has been to Clare and tried the wine on occasion. Clare has some great tourist opportunities. That area has had the biggest increase in early childhood immunisations of any division of general practice in South Australia. So it is great to see that a vibrant country region can lead the way in immunisation in South Australia. It is a record which I am sure other parts of South Australia envy, and it is something that the electorate of Wakefield can be proud of. We would like to improve those results in the future and get even higher rates if we can. The current flaw in the maternity immunisation allowance is that it is delivered as a lump sum payment. Any sort of payment has an effect on people's behaviour. As the payment is available without means testing, on or before a child's second birthday, most parents aim to provide standard immunisations for their child at around 18 months. By providing the lump sum there is an incentive for parents to get those immunisations at the 18month mark but no incentive, and importantly no reminder, to get the second round of immunisations at age four. We know that taxation policy and social security policy-anything that involves a payment-alters the community's behaviour. If we are interested in eliminating this flaw and driving up the immunisation rate for four-year-olds, this bill will assist to do We know that immunisation rates for twoyear-olds are significantly higher than for school-age children. Ninety-three per cent of children aged two are fully immunised, but that drops to 88 per cent by age six. So it is clear that some families, caught up in work, school and all those pressures that are on families these days, do not follow up with immunisation to the four-year-old mark. If people do not follow up their child's immunisations, the policy is less effective over time. With many older children missing out on the second round of immunisations, as recommended in the National Immunisation Program, the prevalence of illnesses like diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, mumps, german measles and polio in the Australian community is affected. We want to eliminate those diseases. Polio went through a lot of families of the baby boomer generation. My own aunts and uncles and my grandparents' family had a spot of it themselves. It was a very distressing disease but one that my generation-generation Xhave happily missed. This bill eliminates this flaw by providing an incentive for parents to secure those recommended immunisations and as a result will increase the proportion of four-year-olds who are fully immunised. Under these measures, from 2009 parents and carers who have children that meet the immunisation requirements for an 18-month-old will be paid the first half of their maternity immunisation allowance payment, currently $118.40 and indexed, when the child is aged between 18 months and 24 months. The second maternity immunisation allowance payment will then be available when the child has received its vaccinations at four years of age and must be claimed on or before the child's fifth birthday. By changing the method of payment, families still get the benefit but the that. pattern of payment will help to enforce and change behaviours and make sure that we drive up immunisation rates for that second group of children. Those payments will continue to be indexed twice a year, so in practice the second instalment will be higher than the first, due to subsequent indexation. This bill does more than just provide incentives for a more effective National Immunisation Program; it also increases support for families with children who are adopted from overseas. Currently some older adopted children are excluded from the program due to their age. Under this bill they will have access to the program within two years of arrival in Australia. With more and more families adopting from overseas this is a very important measure. This measure reinforces the fundamental purposes of the maternity immunisation allowance-namely, to support the immunisation of all children in Australia, whether they are born in Australia or are newly arrived through adoption. The measure itself is a recommendation of the bipartisan 2005 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services inquiry into overseas adoption in Australia. It is good to see the work of committees being incorporated into the law of the land. It is nice to know that all those committee meetings that we attend with such vigour, hearing from experts and from those who are most affected by the legislation that we enact, are worthwhile. It is great to see that their work is incorporated into the law of the land. It makes for better practice in the House of Representatives and ultimately better law. This bill also provides for changes to the partner service pension, which will require some readjustment in the community. The first change is to cease eligibility for partners of veterans who are separated but not divorced after 12 months of separation or if the veteran enters into another marriage-like relationship. The second measure recognises that a partner of a veteran who is a recipient of less than the special rate but above the general rate disability pension or who has at least 80 impairment points under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act should have a lower eligibility age for the partner service pension. Under these amendments that eligibility will be set at 50 years. These changes will contribute to a responsible budget and responsible measures to ensure that our repatriation system is strong and equitable into the future. The bill before the House today also makes changes to the child support legislation to address anomalies in relation to the child support formula reforms that commenced this July. As I said before, these changes are important to make sure that people pay their child support, but they also enable changes in people's circumstances and lifestyle to be reflected in adjustments to their child support assessments. The nature and pattern of people's families change, as do their proportion of care obligations and their income, so these child support formula reforms are very desirable. Anything we can do to make the system more responsive to people is important. These are important measures and they fulfil the community's expectation of what a caring and responsible government does. This bill supports parents in ensuring their children have access to proper preventative health care. We are endeavouring to make our system of supporting veterans more responsible and responsive to their needs. We are also aiming at making the child support mechanisms more responsive to the community's needs. For these reasons I support the bill before the House.",154
218,Mr ROBERT,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008. Schedule 1 of the bill, the maternity immunisation allowance, clearly encourages parents to immunise their children and especially extends the allowance to cover children adopted overseas. Immunisation is important, and schedule 1 of the bill is clearly supported. Immunisation works to prevent disease, and the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Immunisation is available against 23 diseases through the National Immunisation Program. Australians can be protected from diseases such as whooping cough, rubella, measles, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and even good old influenza. I am a supporter of immunising our communities. I congratulate the over 88 per cent of families who immunise their children. I know it is hard. I have a three-year-old and a one-year-old, and I take my children to get immunised. I took my poor little boy when he was six months old; his face went red and he let out that little squawk, but I understand how important it is. Schedule 3 concerns child support. It is quite often said that imitation is the highest form of flattery, and the Rudd government demonstrates this again. Clearly, schedule 3 is supported. But it is schedule 2 that I have a significant problem with. This nation has a contract with its veterans. It is an unwritten contract-it is not spoken loudly in the halls of parliament or elsewhere, but it is a contract nonetheless-that says: ‘You will train, you will be led and you will fight. We will put you in harm's way. Some of you will pay the ultimate price and will die. Because of that service, because you love country more than self, because you are not afraid to face this country's adversaries and to fight for the freedom we take for granted, our contract with you is that we will have a range of entitlements that we will preserve.' That is the contract with veterans. In my military career and my time serving in operations overseas, if someone did not pull their weight or went back on their word, we said that they were ‘jack'-that they were a ‘jack man'. I stand here today and say to Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, and to the government: you are a government of ‘jack men'Mr Bidgood-Outrageous!",156
219,Mr ROBERT,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"because you have stood and looked veterans in the eye and said, ‘We are going to strip your entitlements away.' That government is ‘jack' in my language and it is ‘jack' in the language of our veterans. Last year, the government had the hide, the audacity, the blatant effrontery, to say to the veteran community in its 2007 election policy document, which I can only imagine now is a farcical piece of fairytale trashand I will quote in case you are a little hard of hearing on that side-on page 5: Labor understands the impact of rising costs of living and the importance of ensuring that entitlements do not erode in value. Member for Dawson, are you a little hard of hearing, sir? Do I need to say it again for you? Mr Bidgood interjecting",157
220,Mr ROBERT,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Your document, put out under the name of your leader, now the Prime Minister, said that entitlements will not erode in value. Today, your idea of ‘not eroding in value' and that of the rest of the nation are slightly different indeed. Six months after you put out that fairytale and you conned the nation and you promised the veteran community and looked them in the eye, you produce a budget which has resulted in this piece of legislation that is increasing the pension age for partners of veterans from 50 to 58½. Veterans' families plan their futures carefully. They take into account this contract that the government has with them, this unspoken agreement that entitlements will be there. Life in the military is hard. Veterans have to move city. They train. They spend extended periods of time away from loved ones. It is expected by veterans and, indeed, their partners that they will be safe in the knowledge that their government will look after them. These measures are in place to demonstrate a small part of our gratitude for those who fought for the freedom that we take for granted. Any measure to take them away is condemning these families, in some small part, to further stress and hardship. I find it appalling that this government would look veterans in the eye through their pre-election policy document and boast about protecting entitlements and, in the same breath, strip them away. On 14 May, I stood in the House to express my abject disgust with this government for considering policy that would exempt veterans from claiming entitlements. For almost three months now, the government has denied the issues and has finally backflipped on taking away all partner pensions from 50 to 58½. It has changed it now so that the partner of a veteran who is in receipt of the equivalent of or less than special rate but above general rate, who has at least 80 impairment points under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act-partners of veterans affected by these measures are those where the veteran is in receipt of a general rate disability, extreme disablement, intermediate rate disability or temporary special rate-are provided for. Whilst I welcome the backflip, I am still appalled that the government has not moved to change the other $113 million it is ripping out by cancelling the partner pension if a partner separates from a veteran within 12 months. I have spoken in this place before about the important role of the partners of service men and women. They are left to hold the family fabric together, sometimes for great periods of time-for World War II veterans, in many cases, it was up to five years. For anyone to look a veteran or their partner in the eye and take away their rights is abhorrent. The families and partners of service men and women have made enormous sacrifices for this country. Families are required to move constantly around the nation. Service men and women are constantly sent overseas. Veterans often come back with a range of disorders, both physical and mental. Punishing veterans and their families by removing the pension of the spouse or partner of a veteran after they have separated for 12 months to save $113 million is woeful. It is the act of a ‘jack man'. It is the act of one who looks you in the eye and says, ‘I will be there,' but you know damn well that, when the bullets start firing, they will be where to be seen. This government is running on a two-year surplus of $40 billion, thanks to the outstanding work of the member for Higgins and the previous Howard government. This government should be thankful for the previous government's fiscally responsible management. The previous government worked tirelessly to put Australia in good economic standing. This government seems to think that the opportunistic seizing of veterans entitlements equates to not eroding the value of veterans entitlements. I think veterans would rather this government looked them in the eye and said, ‘Thank you very much for your service; we are going to preserve your entitlements-all those things that you knew would be there when you served and sacrificed for your nation.' I would rather the government just said, ‘Thank you for preserving the freedom that I live under each day.' I would rather this government said to the partners and families of veterans, ‘Thank you for allowing your husbands, your wives, your sons and your daughters to go and serve and fight in our name to protect our freedoms.' I would rather the government actually honoured their election commitments. Could you imagine that? I would rather they honoured their election commitment which said, ‘Labor understands the impact of rising costs of living and the importance of ensuring that entitlements do not erode in value.' I would rather the government just did the right thing. But, no, they have not. After looking veterans in the eye, they have moved to punitive measures to take away entitlements. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs further promised to convene a council. The purpose of the council was to ‘give Australia's vetersomeans and ex-service organisations a voice at the highest level of government and a greater say with decision makers'. For the last 10 nomonths, while this council has not existed, I have heard the pleas of veterans and their families-and that has not been through a council. Clearly, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has other things to do-for example, calling the coalition's move to increase the base pension by $30 a week ‘a stunt'. Obviously that is far more important than setting up a council-which he promised to do-to more clearly hear the views of veterans. I can only assume that the reason that this minister has not gone forth and set up this council, as he promised to do, is that his level of concern is perhaps not as high as he verbals in the House-but, then again, a mere six months after they broke their election promise so flagrantly and so egregiously, it is wonder. The veteran community have been screaming for assistance, but clearly their pleas are falling on deaf ears-and they can only fall on deaf ears if the minister and government are not listening. But, then again, if they cannot even keep a simple election promise within six months, I suppose listening would not help anyway. erans cannot express their concerns and needs directly to their member of parliament or the minister then there is more wrong with this government than their pleas falling on deaf ears. The Rudd Labor government went to the election giving veterans and their families a misguided impression of where they stood on veterans entitlements. Veterans have been duped by this government. They have been given the impression that they will not be worse off under this government-yet, clearly, they are now $113 million worse off. There is no way for your hollow men to spin that. The budget figures are patently clear. They are $113 million worse off. What do you say to a partner of a veteran who has come back with a range of disorders and whose marriage cannot continue to work because of a range of issues but who has been with the veteran for 20 or 25 years, caring for him? What do you say to a partner who, every day, goes and meets with her previous husband, caring for him and taking care of his needs, but cannot live in the same house and they are now separated? Suddenly, after 12 months, you are going to rip away the pension from that partner. You are going to look that partner in the eye and say, ‘I know you care daily for the needs of the veteran and I know you have been together for so long and that, due to a range of posttraumatic disorders and other conditions, you cannot continue to live together and you are no separated, but we are going to take your pension away.' Are you kidding me? Have the hollow men infected the front bench so much that your empathy and degree of understanding of what is right and what is wrong have the become shallower as a consequence? Every veteran in this great country of ours who voted for this government has an absolute right to feel a great deal of misapprehension, If vet- to feel like they have been dudded. The coalition has always supported the veteran community and strongly believes that the veteran community should be exempt from a range of budgetary cuts. We have a contract with our veterans that says, ‘We put you in harm's way and we will preserve your entitlements.' The sacrifices that veterans have made have not lessened over time. What they have done on the battlefield and the operational fronts across the theatres of war has not lessened over time. The sacrifices that partners have made on behalf of their veteran spouses have not lessened over time. What partners of veterans have done since their veteran partner came home has not lessened over time. The post-traumatic stress disorders and other illnesses that our veterans suffer have not lessened over time. The community's high regard for our veterans has not lessened. The great resolve of the community has not lessened. But, clearly, the way this government views veterans has lessened. The government's view of this unwritten contract that ‘if you go in harm's way, we'll take care of you' has lessened. Clearly, this government's view of the sacrifice that veterans have made overseas and the value of that to the freedom that we hold has lessened, and that is sad. That is a great tragedy for this House to face. The saddest part of all this is that Labor is not only eroding the value of veterans entitlements with the legislative changes I have spoken about but also eroding the value of our veterans' commitment to this country. Veterans would say: ‘You promised that you would not erode the value of veterans entitlements. That was your promise to the veteran community, and within six months your budget is ripping $113 million out of the veteran community.' In the language of the military, that is a ‘jack act'. You are simply a bunch of ‘jack men' and should stand condemned. Debate interrupted. NA",157
221,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Urgent Relief for Single Age Pensioners Legislation",160
222,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I am delighted to speak in the House tonight and continue the theme that my good friend the member for Fadden has been speaking onthat is, the policy ineptitude of the Labor government. I want to specifically focus on the pensioners of Queensland, particularly the pensioners in the Ryan electorate. I think they have really been dudded by the Rudd Labor government. These are Australians who have paid their taxes all their working lives and are now in their elderly years and are entitled to a certain lifestyle-a lifestyle of dignity and contentment. These are challenging economic times, and the government has at its disposal a $22 billion budget surplus. For those who might be listening to this debate, especially from Queensland and the Ryan electorate, this $22 billion surplus is a legacy of the Howard era. This money is the result of strong economic leadership from the Howard government. However, we constantly hear in the parliament these days that the Labor government delivered this surplus. But, of course, any thinking person would realise that after only a matter of months in office there is no way that the Rudd government could have produced a $22 billion surplus. I want to remind pensioners in the great state of Queensland that the federal opposition very strongly support a $30 increase for single age pensioners. It is not a lot of money, but it would make an enormous difference in their lives. For the Rudd Labor government to oppose this increase is terribly mean spirited. In these tough economic times, to vote against this measure proposed by the federal opposition really says something about the Rudd Labor government. They have spoken frequently about working families. They have spoken strongly about trying to represent people who need the help of government. Yet a significant group in the Australian community, our pensioners, who need help are being deprived of it. It would be $30 a week extra on top of the $273 a week they now receive. It is something that this wealthy and generous country could afford. I think the taxpayers of Australia would not want to deprive our senior Australians who receive $273 as single age pensioners. In the months ahead the coalition will continue to remind our electorates and the electorates held by Labor members in Queensland that Labor voted against a $30 increase that we proposed. In the months ahead I will certainly be letting single age pensioners in the Ryan electorate know how the government voted on this. There are 2,818 single age pensioners in the Ryan electorate in Queensland. I will be meeting with them and I will remind them of Labor's position on this important issue. I am sure that they will remind their friends who live across other Queensland electorates such as Bonner, Brisbane, Dawson and Longman of how their local members of parliament voted. I notice the member for Longman is in the chamber. I wonder what he will say to the pensioners in his electorate. How many single age pensioners live in Longman? There are 5,567. I suspect they will not be too pleased about how their new local member stood up for them when it counted most. To the people of Longman who might be listening, I encourage them to contact their local memberMr Sullivan interjecting",160
223,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,I don't quite know why he is interjecting and preventing me from raising this. People in the electorate of Longman will soon be made fully aware by Liberal and National Party members of the stance taken by the Labor government on the $30 measure proposed by the coalition. (Time expired) Budget,161
224,Mr CLARE,ADJOURNMENT,"I think there is one thing that the member for Ryan will not be telling his electorate-that is, this evening in the Senate the coalition voted against changes to the Medicare surcharge levy and a $1,200 tax cut for people who are doing it tough. It will be an enormous disappointment to the people in my electorate, in the electorate of the member for Longman and, I suspect, in the electorate of the member for Ryan. This is something that would have given relief to thousands of people. For some young families, it would have meant a tax cut of up to $1,200. That is a lot of money. To give you an idea of how much money this is, it is about double the benefit that was received from a cut in intermote est rates only a few weeks ago. If you have an average sized mortgage, a cut in interest rates of 25 basis points would put $50 back in your wallet or purse. If the opposition had done the responsible thing, if they had been in touch with the people they say they represent, they would have voted the right way in the Senate this evening and given people a $1,200 tax cut. But they did not do that. Mr Sullivan interjecting",161
225,Mr CLARE,ADJOURNMENT,"There have been a lot of mistakes made over the last few days, and I do not want to be critical of people who make mistakes because we all make mistakes; we are all human. The problem is not that the shadow Treasurer did not know what the cash rate was. I think the problem is that she did not know the consequences of 10 consecutive increases in the cash rate and the problem that has brought for the people in my electorate and for people all across the country. Mr Sullivan interjecting",161
226,Mr CLARE,ADJOURNMENT,"Member for Longman, 10,000 people lost their homes last year. They understand what 10 increases in the cash rate means, and they certainly understand the problem that that creates. The plagiarism gaffe is another example along a similar line. I do not criticise the shadow Treasurer for being caught redhanded. The problem is not that she chose to steal someone else's work; the problem is that she did not fess up when she was caught. She did not admit that she had made a mistake or apologise for it. She blamed her staff. The lesson is: do not cover up. The cover-up is always worse than the original offence. If you do not know anything about tax or tax policy then it is probably best not to talk about withholding tax. In her first speech as shadow Treasurer, she said: This is a government that says it wants to proAustralia as a financial services hub and then reduces withholding tax for foreigners. As if that is a bad idea! I thought that cutting withholding tax would be a good thing if you wanted to set up Australia as a financial services hub. We received a report overnight from the IMF that had some interesting information about our economy. It identified the productivity constraints in Australia that the Reserve Bank had identified on 20 occasions and the problems that those have created for our economy. It also made the point that the fiscal policy that this government has implemented is providing the flexibility that the Reserve Bank needs to do its job-the necessary flexibility to take pressure off interest rates and off the people whom we represent and want to help out. The IMF report also showed that, if there were anywhere you wanted to be in a global financial crisis, it would be Australia. No-one is immune to this crisis, and it would be foolhardy to think otherwise. There is a saying that, when Wall Street sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. Wall Street is pretty sick at the moment. Peter Costello was talking about this on Lateline last night. He made the astute point that the global financial crisis is a symptom of regulatory failure. No-one is immune to this, but we are better placed than most to deal with it. Our big four banks have AA credit ratings. Our financial services regulation model is the envy of many countries. Our strong budget surplus will provide ballast to help us weather this financial storm. The IMF report also talked about the support that a prudent fiscal policy will provide to monetary policy. This will make it easier for the Reserve Bank to lower rates and take pressure off working families. In these uncertain times, we need to create budget certainty; that is the responsible thing to do. People can forgive mistakes. We can forgive someone the mistake of not knowing the cash rate. We can forgive someone for reading the Wall Street Journal when they have nothing else to say. We can forgive someone for not knowing that cutting withholding tax is actually a good thing. But what we cannot forgive is the impact of irresponsible behaviour, and we saw irresponsible behaviour from the coalition tonight in the Senate. Their kicking a hole in the surplus will make it harder for the Reserve Bank to cut rates. Their voting against the Medicare surcharge levy reforms will deny young families in my electorate and all across the country the chance of a $1,200 tax cut. Thousands of people in my electorate will be bitterly disappointed with the decision taken by the opposition in the other place. It just shows how out of touch they are. (Time expired) Fadden Electorate: Dental Health",161
227,Mr ROBERT,ADJOURNMENT,"Just three weeks ago I received an inquiry from a pensioner living within the mighty electorate Fadden who had a raft of medical issues. This gentleman is an insulin dependent chronic diabetic. He had recently experienced a mini heart attack and was suffering from infected gums-an infection which his doctor had informed him was contributing to his already myriad health problems. This man had spoken to his doctor and to a dentist, and they both informed him that a program which had existed under the previous government but which had been scrapped under the merciless current government could have helped him. Thankfully, this gentleman did not take that as gospel and contacted my electorate office. We were able to inform him that, while the government had announced that it would discontinue this program in March 2008 and that all funding would cease on 30 June 2008, the coalition had kept the program alive to benefit all Australians. The program in question is Medicare dental. The coalition government introduced the Medicare dental scheme in September 2007, and it started in November 2007. Between its introduction and the end of April 2008, the scheme had provided 311,943 dental services. The scheme allowed people with chronic and complex health problems where dental health was a contributing factor or complication to access private dental treatment following a referral from their GP. Patients could receive up to $4,250 worth of dental treatment and therapy over two years. Following a disallowance motion, introduced to the parliament by the opposition, dental services under Medicare will continue to be available. This moribund government cannot try to cancel the program via the same piece of legislation until at least the end of December. The gentleman managed to have all his teeth removed under the Medicare dental scheme, despite the Rudd government's best efforts. His overall health is so much improved as a result, Madam Deputy Speaker, on which I am sure you would join me in saying ‘well done'. His teeth were rotten to the root. There is no question that this gentleman's dental health had a negative impact on his general health. This is not the only inquiry I have received at my office from local constituents concerned about the future of their dental health. A woman recently inquired on behalf of her daughter, a sufferer of both lupus and multiple sclerosis and a recipient of the ability pension. Due to dentists and doctors being misinformed by the government as to the status and future of Medicare dental, this woman found it difficult for medical practitioners to consider her case. A 59-year-old woman on the disability pension also contacted my office this month. She suffers from chronic asthma, high blood pressure and chronic gum disease. Her teeth are so rotten she is scared to eat even an ple. This woman would also not be covered under the government's new scheme but, thanks to the coalition's measures, she is able to seek treatment and recompense. I have received many other inquiries and complaints from people in my local area as a result of the confusion over the status of this program. People in the northern Gold Coast area have been very vocal in their support of Medicare dental. I am tremendously pleased that the program has continued to be in play and be available to people through to December 2008 at a minimum. The opposition will be doing everything we can to keep the program going and delivering dental care to those who desperately need it. I urge the government to reconsider its position on Medicare dental. Longman Electorate: Burpengary State School",162
228,Mr SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Longman) (7.44 pm)How interesting it was to hear one speaker in the adjournment debate criticise the government for not providing their pension increases while the next speaker on that side tells the story of two pensioners in his electorate who would not be recipients of the pension increases that the opposition brought forward. But I do not want to talk about those issues tonight. I want to talk about the Burpengary State School, in my electorate. Last Friday I had the very great pleasure of visiting Burpengary State School to predis- sent the school with an Australian flag to replace one that had been stolen from their flagpole the previous week. I cannot understand why somebody would want to steal an Australian flag from a school, but somebody did and so a visit was arranged. The Burpengary State School has served the local community for over 128 years. It is an integral part of the community, although when it was established one can reasonably ap- assume it would have been in the middle of farmlands. The school was established in the 1880s by families who would rightly have been considered as pioneers, particularly in that area, as it would have been quite a distance from Brisbane then. But these parents were pioneers in another sense. Back in 1880 they understood that their children's lives would be made better by receiving a decent education. That is of course still true today, and it is why this government is proceeding with an education revolution to make sure that children today get a better education. While I do not really want to single out any of the students of the school, I thought was fitting that for this year, the 129th year of the school, one of the school captains is a descendent of the pioneering families from the area, the Litherlands. Essentially a small rural school for 100 years, the urban growth that has happened in my part of the world in the last 20 years has seen this become one of the biggest primary schools in Queensland. I know that the school principal, Ms Paula Passi, is particularly proud of the school's heritage. In keeping with that heritage, the school's mission today is to ensure that each and every one of its more than 1,100 students receives the best possible education they can provide. Also in keeping with that heritage, the school has a strong and vibrant P&C, which is heavily involved in the school and helps to provide a number of the facilities that the school needs. By coincidence, the school received its NAPLAN, or National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy, the day before my visit. The results are worthy of giving an airing here tonight. Across the three grades tested-years 3, 5 and 7Burpengary State School achieved results above the national benchmark in all of the five areas assessed-reading, writing, spelling, grammar and punctuation, and numeracy-except for one of the years' groups falling just short of that national benchmark in reading. Let me repeat that: in 14 of the matters, Burpengary State School was ahead of the national results and significantly ahead of the results achieved for Queensland in all 15. Clearly, Ms Passi and her staff are doing an excellent job in the area of fundamental primary school education. I was also particularly impressed by the quality of the two school bands on display at the senior parade. Music is an interest of mine, bordering on a passion in some areas, and I was particularly impressed to learn that it the students playing in the junior school band had only begun to learn their instruments this year. On the parade I was impressed by the number of year 5 students who received their citizenship certificates, which meant that they had spent the whole term without running into trouble with any of their teachers; by the number of students who received awards for their work in the national science competition; and by the number of highachieving athletes, whose efforts were acknowledged at the school. I think it is also worth noting that the school will shortly be able to capture from their roofs in excess of a million litres of water, which they can store in tanks and transfer as needed to the school oval, which was built with Investing in Our Schools funding, to make sure that that oval is properly watered at all times. This is a great school serving a great community in what I believe is the greatest part of our country. (Time expired) Telstra",163
229,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise the issue of broadband and Telstra. Improving broadband access is high on my list of priorities, and this is an issue over which Telstra and I have had a tortured past. While there have been some successes, there still remain several black spots throughout Canning, largely because of the diversity in the geography and topography. Just to give 15 you an idea of what an issue it is in my area, it is fair to say that it is probably the primary issue that people contact my office about. I will continue to fight for better coverage and a better deal. As I have said previously, I will support any arrangements that result in better service and better coverage in my electorate. The Rudd government must outline what they are going to deliver and when. Canning residents do not deserve to be left behind in internet technology. Most recently I have raised with Telstra the lack of ADSL availability in Seville Grove, which by the way is in a metropolitan area. It is hard to believe in this day and age that metropolitan areas have black spots. Despite it being a highly populated and growing outer metropolitan area, it is a black spot. Canning Vale is also an area with a number of concerns that my constituents have brought to my attention. They are unable to access ADSL, while their neighbours can. This is also in the metropolitan area. Pair-gain lines remain problematic and dialup services in metropolitan areas in this day and age seem quite ridiculous. In the more regional areas of Canning, service in parts of Mundijong, Keysbrook, Serpentine, Pinjarra and Halls Head are extremely patchy. When I recently contacted Telstra with a range of queries about local services, I was met with the response that improvements in the area are unlikely in the near future. Telstra advised: With respect to ADSL availability it is unlikely that any further upgrades to pair gains and or RIMS will take place in the near future. As you know the Commonwealth Government has requested responses from companies to the National Broadband Network and the RFP [Section 11.1/ includes a ‘gag' order that prohibits bidders from making public statements about the RFP or the process.] So it was a bit of a cop-out. While Telstra are complying with government orders, this is of no comfort to my constituents whose services, if any, are just not up to scratch. If only they would put Jeff Booth in charge I am sure we would have a more proactive approach, because he is the only one in Telstra that I have seen deliver at any time. The recent resignation of Telstra's public policy manager, Dr Phil Burgess, has come as no surprise to me. One of CEO Sol Trujillo's ugly amigos has flown the coop. However, I understand that Dr Burgess will be retained as a consultant to Telstra and as a personal adviser to Mr Trujillo-no doubt at some higher price-and will take the time to write a book about his three years at Telstra. That's it: he has trashed Telstra, grabbed his money, and run home to the good old USA. I have spoken before about the long list of US executives imported by Trujillo. It is extensive-and expensive, I would imagineand includes operations boss Greg Winn. Mr Trujillo came here with a five-year plan to cut costs, improve performance and introduce new technology. That is good in theory, but I remain critical of the results he has achieved in his time. Telstra has just recently announced that it will axe some 800 jobs in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane as a result of a restructure. In 2005, Mr Trujillo committed to axing 12,000 jobs by 2010. Telstra has already cut more than 9,000 jobs. It may be good for Telstra's shareholders but is certainly not for the workers. People who are losing their jobs would find it hard to take that the big boss took home in excess of $13 million last year, plus cash bonuses and share options. Even Greg Winn took home $11 million last year. Last month the company announced a $3.6 billion annual profit. Despite profit being up by 13.5 per cent, mum and dad investors are not being rewarded. Dividends are stagnant, as are share prices. For example, today the share price of Telstra was $4.31-it had hardly shifted. Meanwhile, Telstra's shareholders continue to foot the bill for Mr Trujillo's overseas travel budget, including private jets, first class fares and lavish accommodation with all the extras. And don't forget the Telstra executives road show tour, which cost more than $1.7 million plus expenses. Trujillo is a well-known supporter of and large financial donor to John MCCain's US presidential campaign. The Sydney Morning Herald suspects that a number of his amigos are also financing this campaign. (Time expired) Road Safety",164
230,Mr HALE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to make a heartfelt plea to road users in the Northern Territory to take more care. The Northern Territory road toll is currently at 58, compared to 35 at the same time last year. This is a horrendous toll of human life. However, the human toll is not just the 58 souls that we have lost; it is a toll on the families and friends who are left behind. I do not think I have ever witnessed more torment, anguish and pain than I have seen when visiting a family on the day that one of their loved ones was lost in a car accident. I lost a friend on 27 October 2004. Michael Edwards died while travelling as a passenger in Darwin after a night out with friends. Known affectionately as ‘Wally', he is sadly missed. He was the loving father of two daughters and partner of Jodie, and a fantastic brother to Tim and Patrick. But what tore my heart out the most was the impact that his death had on his mum and dad, Jackie and Stem. They are still two of the most outstanding people I know. However, the pain is still etched on their faces. They not laugh as loudly as they used to. They miss their son. I remember the call I received from Patrick on the morning Wal had died. I am still haunted by that conversation. I was shattered, as were many other people. Wally was just 32 years of age. My plea is to the young drivers on our roads. When you get behind the wheel, think of the two people in your life who love you without conditions, the two people who have put bandaids on your knees, changed your nappies, rocked you to sleep, blessed you when you sneezed, hugged you when you lost, celebrated your wins, read to you at night, checked under the bed to make sure there were no monsters, dried your tears at your first failed relationship, taken you on driving lessons and cooked you Sunday roasts-your mum and dad. Consider the pain and suffering, the absolute torment and despair, they will feel should you not take care. I think that all in this place will support my plea to all drivers, as we head towards another festive season, to slow down, take extra care, nominate a sober driver and wear a seatbelt. Christmas is a time of celebration, love and happiness, not a time of despair, sadness and funerals. The government is providing funding of $17 million over five years for an innovative new national driver training program for learner drivers, in line with our election commitment. This includes bringing forward $1.5 million into the financial year to enable the early commencement of the program. One of the first steps will be the world-first, interactive website and a pilot trial in Tasmania. Young drivers are over-represented in serious road crashes and are particularly vulnerable during the early stages of solo driving. In fact, young people go from being do some of the safest drivers on the road when they are on their L-plates to being some of the most likely to have a car crash the moment they get their Ps. Nationally, nearly a third of people killed on Australian roads are aged between 16 and 25, yet they represent only 15 per cent of the population. Research has shown that increasing the quality and variety of supervised driving can lead to reduced crash risk after licensing. Once implemented, keys2drive will provide learner drivers and parents or mentors with a free professional driving lesson from an accredited instructor; support parents and mentors with instructional material and practical guidance on how to provide effective supervision and training to a learner driver; establish an interactive website which will offer short instructional videos, guides on handling various road terrains and weather conditions, and the location of the nearest accredited driving instructor; and, finally, deliver the country's first ever national accredited scheme for driving instructors. The Rudd Labor government is committed to making our roads safer for all drivers, and keys2drive is a practical way of equipping young people with the skills they need for a lifetime of safer driving. In conclusion, spare a thought for the emergency workers such as police, firefighters and paramedics who arrive at the scenes of these accidents and who are also working to prevent road fatalities. All Australians need to address their behaviour on our roads so that we can enjoy a safe and happy festive season.",166
