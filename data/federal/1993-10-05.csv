2,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I wish to inform the House that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, will be absent from question time today and for the remainder of this week. In his absence, questions should be addressed to the Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin. NA Budget 1993-94",11
3,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Finance. I ask the minister whether he made the following statement in the parliament on 27 August 1981 when, as the then shadow Treasurer, he was justifying the then opposition's decision to oppose the sales tax measures announced in the budget: This is not blocking Supply. We are not suggesting a blockage of the Appropriation Bills and therefore putting the Government in jeopardy. All that we are saying is that there ought to be a blockage of these tax Bills because they are not in the best interest this country. I ask whether he then went on to say: It is consistent with the fact that we have opposed various tax Bills in the past. Does the minister's statement make a mockery of the Prime Minister's feigned indignation about the way the present budget is being approached by the Senate?",11
4,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the Labor Party has never argued that we should block tax bills while saying at the same time that we should be reducing the deficit. That is the position that the opposition is in. The opposition is saying, - Stop these tax increases and let us have a lower deficit'. Obviously, the two things do not go together. The opposition is in an absolutely absurd position. How could it argue that this nation should be running a lower deficit while at the same time running a policy that would increase the deficit? Yet that is the position of the opposition. In this year's budget the government has taken an entirely responsible approach to the national economic need-entirely responsible with respect to this year and to the out years. The small stimulus is appropriate for this year, and it is absolutely appropriate that that stimulus be withdrawn over the next few years. Our deficit reduction program is the kind of approach which various other countries around the world are employing. It is the approach that the United States has undertaken. It is the approach that the International Monetary Fund is suggestingMr Downer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the minister about conventions and how the Labor Party had voted against tax bills in the past. Instead of supporting the ludicrous position that the Prime Minister referred to yesterday, the ""minister is now talking about a different matter. The minister should focus on how Labor is being hypocritical in arguing its case about conventions.",11
5,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, points of order go to the proceedings and not to debate.",11
6,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister has made a very valid point. However, the honourable member for Mayo was raising a point of of order on the specifics of the question, and the minister will come to the answer. MrWILLIS-I have been addressing that precise point. The position now is totally different from that in 1981. When the opposition was in government in 1981 it was not, in any way, in the position that this government is in now-because the Labor Party in 1981 was not arguing to have it both ways. Those opposite are arguing to have it absolutely both ways. They want to increase the deficit by some $3 billion in 1996-97. That would be the result of the blockage of the various measures which they say they are against. At the same time, they are saying to the world that we should have a lower deficit. It is an absurd position. The deficit reduction program that we have put in place in this budget, and which this parliament should be concerned to pass, is the entirely appropriate approach to be taken. The fact that members of the opposition are preventing that from being put in place is certainly a factor in damaging the standing of this nation in terms of the strength of the dollar and confidence of other countries in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition laughs about that. He does not give a damn about the state of the nation because he is basically in total wrecker mode. He wants to do anything he can to make the life of this government more difficult, no matter what damage it does to the nation and the economy. That is a deplorable position to be in. His action is going to have the effect which he says is entirely inappropriin ate for the strength of the nation; that is, he wants a lower deficit but is taking action to increase it. The Labor Party has never been in that position. It has never argued that way-in 1981, or at any other time. Our position in this year's budget of requiring there to be a deficit reduction program in the next few years is absolutely in the nation's interest. went down well with the financial markets when it was first announced-and it should be supported by this parliament. The fact that the opposition is trying to prevent it happening is economic vandalism of the worse order. The Leader of the Opposition has thrown away all semblance of economic responsibility. He is simply taking the popUlist approach of making the government's position as difficult as possible. Any kind of rational, economic approach has been totally forsaken by him. So the answer to the question simply is that the Labor Party has never been in the position that the opposition is now in. To go back to some past time and to say it justifies what it is doing is an absurdity. Mr Thckey-When we. were in government, you did not know what deficits were. Mr Bilney-Didn't know! When you were in government we had",11
7,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will restrain himself, as will the honourable member for O'Connor. Mr Bilney-I am sorry. I was provoked. Employment Levels Mr FITZGmBON-My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he inform the House about recent signs of strength in employment? Is the government's budget designed to help employment? If so, what are the impediments to the government achieving its objectives?",12
8,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can inform the House that in recent days we have seen more signs of a strengthening in the labour market, with the ANZ job vacancy series out today showing a rise in September of four per cent, following an increase of 1.2 per cent in August. So the trend estimates being recorded the series have increased by over two per cent for the last four months. The series is up now nearly 22 per cent on that of a year ago. That is encouraging. As I said last week, we also saw motor vehicle registrations rise in August to be 16 per cent above where they were a year earlier. Housing finance numbers are also up strongly for July and are nearly 31 per cent above It where they were a year earlier. We saw the Department of Employment, Education and Training skill vacancies up three per cent in September, to be 25 per cent higher than a year earlier. As I said, in the non-residential building approvals as well as in the residential building approvals, for the past year we have seen a rise, and they are now almost 30 per cent above where they stood a year earlier. So we are seeing on a broad range of indicators an indicator coming through. The one problem that the country now has, and should not have, is the question about the passage of the budget. The last place there ought to be impediments to the economic progress of the country should be in the place which is most interested in its progress, which is the Houses of parliament of the Commonwealth. Yet we are seeing this obstructionist tactic by the opposition in the Senate. At least it is now \leing noticed. The Sydney Morning Herald yesterday, under the heading 'It's time now to pass the Budget', said: Shrewd tactics, however, suggest that now is the time to allow the Budgetfinally-to pass. It went on to quote Malcolm Fraser's remarks of last week: The case can be made that this line has now been crossedthat is the line between sensible review and unreasonable and unproductive obstructionism. That was what was stated in the Sydney Aiorning llerald. The Australian on 1 October talked about the - Dangers of rogue Senate'. It said: Still an economically vulnerable nation with difficult reforms ahead, Australia cannot afford an unworkable government. (Even the world's most productive economy, that of the United States, finds political deadlock a dead weight.) It went on in those terms. I made the point yesterday to the Leader of the Opposition that he will expect to come back in 21jz years time and contest. the next election and seek endorsement as Prime Minister by the device of a majority in the House of Representatives. But does he believe he is then entitled to a majority in the Senate to pass the financial legislation of a government were he to be elected, when he is taking the view that the legitimate budgetary measures of this government-as the Minister for Finance has said, up to $3 billion; not a small measure; a core part of the deficit reduction strategy-are put asunder in the Senate by his actions? On what basis, therefore, does he believe that he could come back, seek in a conventional way to form a government and then say that he has authority when in fact he denies that kind of fiscal authority to the elected government in this term of office? I think these are questions that John Hewson has to answer. These conventions are only safe from the first empty-headed opposition leader that puts them asunder, from the first person who wants to put them asunder. The opposition has to know that in the tactics that it is employing it is urging the parties in this parliament to rewrite the rules of behaviour in the Senate. In an article in the Sydney Daily Telegraph in March 1968Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 145 refers to relevance",12
9,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! What is your point of order on relevance? Mr Thckey-In this regard, the Prime Minister was asked a question regarding employment.",13

11,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Mr Thckey-I am on a point of order.,13
12,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I warn the honourable member for O'Connor. The Prime Minister might resume his seat for a moment. On a number of occasions I have had to ask honourable members when they come to the microphone, whether it be on a point of order or anything else, to do so in the appropriate manner. I. would respectfully again ask honourable members to do the same. Your point of order is on standing order 145, relevance. Mr Thckey-And the point of order is that the Prime Minister was asked a question about the unemployment jobs advertisements, and we are now getting some sort of lecture on the Senate and the budget.",13
13,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for O'Connor may resume his seat. The Prime Minister was answering the question as to the process of budget bills in this place. He is in order.,13
14,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In an article in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 11 March 1968 Sir Robert Menzies wrote a long article under the headlineMr Sharp-You are going back to 1968, are you? Where next?",13
15,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know opposition members hate to be quoted Menzies; they cannot stand it. Menzies wrote the article under the heading, 'Falsification of popular democracy'. On the question of the financial prerogatives of the House of Representatives, he said: The Governor General issues a commission to form a government to the leader of the party (or coalition of parties) commanding a majority in the People's house, that is the House of Representatives, the House which represents the people on a population basis, the House which represents in its most recent form the public opinion of the country and the House which has the greater financial powers. He then went on to say: This means that if a government with a clear majority in the House of Representatives presented its budget to Parliament and then brought into the House of Representatives financial measures to give effect to that budget, and had them passed by the House and sent up to the Senate a hostile Senate could legally reject them. This, of course, would create an impossible situation and would make popular government unworkable. He went on to sayMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Is it in order for the Prime Minister to make these quotes when in 1968 the Labor Party had passed 11 bills?",13

That does not extend, however, to abusing the forms of the House. Opposition members-Ohl",14
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said leaders of parties. I invite the leader of the National Party to restrain himself. On the point of order which I am sure the honourable member for Benne10ng is likely to raise on standing order 145, the Prime Minister was asked a question about employment and matters before this parliament which had an effect on that. As I am listening to the Prime Minister, he is endeavouring to show how budget bills in this place and the blockage of thoseOpposition members-Ha, hal",14
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I He is endeavouring to show how they have an effect on employment. I invite the Prime Minister to come back to that question.,14
25,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was quoting these issues of principle, which Sir Robert Menzies addressed after he completed his term as Prime Minister, on the financial powers of the House of Representatives and the Senate. I will make two further quotes on this and complete his piece. He said: It would be a falsification of democracy if, on any matter of government policy approved by the House of Representatives, possibly by a large majority, the Senate representing the States and not the people could reverse the decision. . . Otherwise, a Senate opposition whose party had just been completely defeated at a general election, would be in command of the government of the nation. This would be absurd and a denial of popular democracy. There it is from a leader of the Liberal Party-from the horse's mouth. Also, Prime Minister Holt said: It is one of the most firmly established principles of British parliamentary democracy that a House of review should not reject the financial decisions of the popular House. The terms of the constitution reflect this principle. For petulant, spiteful reasons, having lost the last election, the Leader of the Opposition, a person who does not understand the conventions of this place or these houses, is now taking the view that he can hold up $3 billion of revenue from the Commonwealth government's budget to reduce it and, in so doing, is seeking to rewrite the conventions between the parties in this parliament. Were he to have approached the electors at the last election as a leader seeking to win an office in government by a majority in the House of Representatives, he could not have said that he expected any other party in the Senate to pass the financial measures of a government he led. To be led to that sort of position, instead of accepting the fact that it has been defeated for a fifth time, looking through why it has no appropriate contact with the body politic and society in this country and going back to its problems at source, the coalition is doing a spiteful blocking, wrecking tactic in the Senate at the expense of the Australian nation, the whole Australian public, so that we end up with a larger budget deficit at a time when it ought to be smaller and when the private economy is growing. The Liberal Party should understand the jeopardy it is placing itself in in following this tactic; in following the leadership of a person who is blocked in by the honourable member for Bennelong-who now will not let him do anything on the republic, will not let him move on any of these other questions and supports this tactic-and the honourable member for Flinders, whose sole position in this place is to stand and wreck and spoil. This is the Liberal Party which is going to seek a popular mandate at the next election. The Leader of the Opposition has got to know that it may take a long time to put together the fabric of Australian parliamentary life",14

Is it the first time ever since we have been sitting in this new parliament that you have seen question time terminated after just 25 minutes?

59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As the honourable member raised this matter with me at the commencement of question time, I have had one of my staff check on it. Apparently the flag on top of Parliament House had been twisted around the back of the rope of the particular apparatus there.

60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, having witnessed that foretaste of Keating's reimblican rule, can I ask you a question. It does go very much to the interpretation by you and by this House of standing order 145. I refer in particular to the question that was last answered by the Prime Minister. I do not think anybody could argue for a moment that he was asked other than a question about employment by the honourable member for Hunter. Mr Bevis-Tell us about the way you are.",16

I can understand a certain amount of licence being given to the Prime Minister, but how many minutes into an answer, which is utterly irrelevant to the question, must the answerer get before you invoke the operation of standing order 145? The Prime Minister gave something like a fiveor six-minute answer to that question. There would not have been more than about a minute related to jobs. The rest of it was a political attack upon the opposition. We can perhaps cop two or three minutes but you cannot expect this House to be regarded as having any semblance of order or sanity if you are going to allow the Prime Minister to go on for five or six minutes in total irrelevance to the question that was asked of him.",16

69,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (2.31 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. I take great pleasure in introducing to the House of Representatives the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill 1993. The bill is part of a scheme designed to improve the safety and efficiency of road transport and to reduce the administrative costs associated with road transport operations in Australia. It seeks to achieve the objectives of the heads of government agreements on heavy and light .vehicles. These agreements provided for a complementary legislative model to achieve a workable framework for the implementation of a national scheme of road transport regulation. Contradictory road regulations and charges imposed by each of 'the eight state and territory governments have seriously constrained road transport efficiency, and have impeded the flow of trade between states, to the ultimate cost of Australian consumers and indusThe scheme is being developed by the 1993; National Road Transport Commission which was established in January 1992. Under the terms of the agreements, the Commonwealth is required to submit to parliament road transport legislation on behalf of the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay Territory. The states and the Northern Territory will then secure the passage of adopting legislation through their respective parliaments. Future amendments to the Commonwealth , legislation and regulations on behalf of the ACT will aU,tomatically flow on to the other states and the Northern Territory. The Ministerial Council for Road Transport endorsed a proposal at its meeting in October 1992 to divide the task of creating uniform road transport law into modules. The road transport legislation is being developed at two levels: a set of broad principles to provide an overall legislative framework; and a series of regulations covering technical standards which will be progressively incorporated into the legislation. This bill covers the module dealing with the operation of vehicles and traffic rules. It is designed to put into place a range of regulations covering issues such as heavy vehicle standards, driver standards, and traffic and vehicle operations. Further bills will be developed to deal with registration, driver licensing and compliance. These bills will, in time, be combined to form the road transport law. The bill has been developed by the commission in close consultation with all jurisdictions. A regulatory impact statement was circulated widely and submissions in response to that statement, including those from the, road transport industry, were taken into consideration. Ministerial council voted in favour of the bill on 31 July 1993. The first set of regulations under this has been drafted. The road transport reformheavy vehicle standards-regulations have been submitted to mini.sterial council for formal consideration. I envisage that these regulations will be tabled during the latter part of the budget sittings. The bill provides that regulations can be made to apply as laws in the ACT and Jervis Bay. The regulations will commence on a date agreed by the ministerial council and specified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. The maximum penalties in relation to offences for breaches of the regulations will be $2,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a body corporate. In the case of overloading, the penalties will be $3,000 and $15,000 respectively. The higher penalties for overloading offences reflect the more serious impact of overloading in terms of safety and road pavement damage. The bill provides that the minister-being the relevant minister in each of the jurisdictions-may declare that the operation of the regulations are suspended in a specified area or even a whole jurisdiction. Such application orders will be made in accordance with the provisions of the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 and are subject to disallowance by the ministerial council. Similarly, there is provision for particular vehicles or persons within a jurisdiction exempt from complying with a specific regulation. Conditions for exemptions will be agreed to by ministerial council and included in the regulations. The federal government is committed to continuing reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of the road transport industry and improving the environment in which it operates. The implementation of uniform or consistent regulations is regarded as an integral element in achieving reforms in the road transport industry. We therefore support the efforts of the commission to develop' a truly national approach which will result in one nationally consistent and durable set of regulations covering the use of our roads and particularly the operation of heavy vehicles. State governments must also demonstrate bill their commitment to the reform process to ensure the objectives of the reform process are achieved and to enable the road transport industry to reap the benefits of these reforms as early as possible. The measures in this bill have no significant impact on government revenues or expenditure. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Reference",17
70,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEES,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services) (2.37 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: HMAS Cerberus technical training and other facilities at Westernport, Victoria. HMAS Cerberus is the major training establishmentfor the Royal Australian Navy and is located on Westernport Bay, Victoria, some 60 kilometres south-east of Melbourne. Existing facilities and services date back to the early 1920s. A number of the facilities are more modem or have been upgraded. The to be transfer of technical training from HMAS Nirimba to HMAS Cerberus necessitates the provision of additional facilities to enable effective training to continue. This proposal provides purpose-built facilities for technical training, replacement of those facilities where upgrading is not economical, expansion of facilities unable to cope with increased demand and new facilities for services operating from temporary or inadequate accommodation. The scope of the work provides for continuous functioning of the base throughout the construction period and includes a health centre, accommodation blocks, galley and cafeteria, technical training classrooms and workshops, indoor swimming pool, gymnasium extension, motor transport compound and engineering services. The estimated total cost of the works is $51.5 million at April 1992 prices. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction work on the site is expected to commence by May 1994 with completion date due by July 1997. I table the selected drawings. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 September, on motion by Mr Crean: That the bill be now read a second time.",18
71,Mr ANDERSON,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 undertakes certain housekeeping amendments to 13 different bills relating to the primary industries and energy portfolio. The first relates the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988. Under it, the National Registration Authority will be required to release a summary of its evaluation of chemicals or chemical products before making determinations to allow public involvement. The authority will be able to conduct public and private hearings for the purpose of obtaining comment on chemical products, and will be required to publicise those hearings in daily newspapers throughout Australia. This is important to rural Australia in particular, when access to newer types of chemicals is freely available to our competitors abroad. The timeliness of that access is also important. The industry is keen to ensure that that process, without in any way watering down the vigorous standards applied to the sorts of chemicals that are used in agriculture in this country-many of which can be used to great advantage in the preservation of our delicate land and soil resources-is not in any way inhibited. AVCA has advised that it believes that this process is appropriate so long as consultation takes place close to the period of registration rather than earlier on, so as to maximise the opportunity to facilitate. quick registration where that is appropriate. The authority will also be able to seek the advice of certain organisations or persons by releasing confidential commercial information to assist it in its evaluation of applications. Precautions will be taken to ensure that trade secrets and certain information subject to possible commercial exploitation are safeguarded. The authority directors and staff are exempt from being sued for refusal to grant a clearance of a chemical product, and the amendments will extend this exemption to the authority itself. The next part of this amending legislation relates to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992, and these amendments will allow the authority to progressively determine conditions of service for staff transferred from the Public Service. The age limit of 65 is removed, appropriately, and receipts will be able to be issued in a more efficient manner. We then come to amendments to the Austo tralian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987. The government will incorporate ecologically sustainable development principles and priorities into the normal activities of government decision making and administration. This will mean the inclusion in legislation of objectives focusing on eco"" logically sustainable development for research and development corporations, and ensure that expertise in ecosystems management and conservation, as well as economic and social factors, arc taken into account when people are selected for research and development corporation boards. The boards will also be required to take ESD principles into. account in determining priorities for allocation of funds, and report in annual reports ESD related research together with progress in achieving all of the corporation's objectives-including, of course, the new ESD objectives themselves. Again the maximum age for board members is removed. These same types of amendments are incorporated in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987, the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. Moving on to a slightly more involved area, the Dairy Produce Act 1986 is also to be amended. The amendments to this act will remove any uncertainty about the arrangements under which manufacturers of exported dairy products currently receive market support payments which are financed by a levy on all milk-that is, a levy raised by the industry on its own people on the production of all milk. This market support scheme is administered by the Australian Dairy Corporation on behalf of the Commonwealth. The allmilk levy assists exporters to compete in world markets. In fact, it probably runs deeper than that. The levy focuses the sights of the dairy industry on world markets and exports, and assists exporters to compete in highly corrupted world markets, particularly in an environment where, for so long, the EEC and the Americans have refused to-or have been unable to-effectively institute major reforms. At the same time, the system guarantees that the product normally exported is not dumped at low export prices on the domestic market. This market support system is being phased out and will cease to exist in 1999. It should be pointed out that it is not a protection scheme as there are no tariffs on dairy exports coming into Australia and no anti-dumping protection from New Zealand product. This will present us with ever greater challenges in the future because New Zealand has got on with the job of reform, and its food and fibre value adding sector is now able to operate much more efficiently than ours. New Zealand's labour on-costs are lower, its taxes on input production costs and what have you are significantly lower, its waterfront has been cleaned up, and its industrial relations practices are more efficient. This presents Australia with an enormous challenge and will increasingly pressure Australian dairy farmers to match New Zealand's levels of efficiency. More assistance from government and union policy would be of great assistance here. Nonetheless, I think we can take great pride in the fact that it is reasonable to assume that, in terms of what New Zealand and Australian dairy farmers do on their own places, they are the most efficient 'in the world. Under the guidelines for the payment of money from the fund itself, exporters must deduct the amount they import of a like product from what they export. They are then supported on the net export amount. This is to prevent dairy companies from receiving market support payments on export product which would otherwise be sold on the domestic market and then importing the same type of product for domestic sale. If this arrangement is not enforceable, the Australian Dairy Corporation will be required to make back payments on the gap between net and total exports. In recent years, this would have reduced the effectiveness of the scheme by some $2 million each year. The scheme has operated since 1987 and every year since then the Australian Dairy Corporation has sent forms to all manufacturers seeking the amount of product exported and the amount imported. The market support payment has then been paid on the balance. Recently, two players in the export market believed they had found a legal loophole in the legislation and wanted market support payments on their total exports, not just net exports. Both have imported product, particularly from New Zealand. The industry claims that one of those companies in particular had used the offset system and cooperated with it prior to the year in question and was therefore, self evidently, aware of the rules. Normally, the Dairy Corporation would have paid out on the 1991-92 year in August of this year but has not done so because of uncertainty about the 1986 legislation. This amendment removes any uncertainty and allows the corporation to proceed to apply the arrangement for 1991-92 and 1992-93, and the other years following that, until the scheme ceases to exist altogether in 1999. If the legislation is not passed, the price of dairy products will fall about $10 a tonne on average next year. This is because 15 other dairy companies have paid their offsets for that year and they would require adjustment. The Australian Dairy Industry Council, the industry'S policy body which represents dairy farmers and manufacturers, and the Australian Dairy Products Federation, which represents manufacturers, both support these changes. I think that is of great significance and importance. I move now to the amendment to the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Act 1991. When the 1991 fisheries legislation was passed it was anticipated that arrangements with the states and the Northern Territory on the offshore constitutional settlement would be completed by 3 February 1994. The timetable has been delayed and a further 12 months will be granted. The Fisheries Management Act 1991 is to be amended to reflect the original intention that seasonal and other closures may be authorised under a management plan. The court found that there had been an error in calculating the entitlements of some fishennen and a new plan had to be implemented. The amendments allow more flexibility. Provision is made for a fishennan to hold a number of statutory fishing rights as a discrete package of rights that will authorise a particular fishing activity. An example of that might be a combination of quotas to take various species of fish, or specified combinations of fishing gear or boat characteristics, such as size of engines and characteristics of nets. The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 are to be amended in a way that is consequential to the establishment of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. They reflect a changed funding arrangement, with the Commonwealth providing $1 for every $2 spent by industry rather than dollar for dollar as applies to other rural industries. This is because half the forest and wood industry is deemed by nature to be a manufacturing rather than a primary industry. The amendments also provide that money raised from charges under the Forest Industry Research Import Charge Act 1993 will be directed to research and development relevant to the timber importing industry. Amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 will allow for the collection of the levies. Finally, amendments to the-Wheat Marketing Act 1989 will correct an anomaly in the act to ensure that it provides the necessary constitutional power for the states to confer functions on the Wheat Board to allow it to conduct intrastate trade in grain and grain products. While the states have passed legislation to allow the Wheat Board to trade intrastate in grain and grain products, there is some doubt that the Commonwealth legislation actually gives this power for grains other than wheat. In order to validate the board's operations, these amendments will operate retrospectively from that date. Other amendments will allow the board' more flexibility in pool return payments to allow adjustments for variety, quality, transport, storage and handling costs, and other things, to ensure that growers within the pool are treated fairly. The opposition does not stand in the way of these amendments.",19
72,Mr HORNE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to support the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. In my electorate of Paterson primary industry is of great importance. Not only is there a strong dairying section, but we also have a viable forestry industry, a healthy fishing industry, a well established fruit and vegetable industry and, of course, some of the best grazing country in Australia. It is important that the natural advantages of that part of Australia be preserved, and they will be preserved by this legislation because it places stress on our agriculture being ecologically sustainable. The first amendment is related to veterinary chemicals. When travelling to Canberra. this morning, I read an interesting article about Australian rice. Honourable members are probably aware that Japan has recently agreed to import rice from many countries, including Australia. Until this year, the major argument that Japan put forward against the use of Australian rice was that the quantity of pesticide in it made it dangerous to eat. That report has since been superseded. The Australian rice currently being tested by Japanese connoisseurs-we must remember that rice is a very important part of their diet-has been cleared. Not only has it been cleared of being dangerous because of pesticide content; it has been stated that Australian rice offers no threat at all arid has a flavour equal to the very best rice grown in Japanwhich, I am assured, is the best in the world. It has now been recommended that Australian rice be importeo by the Japanese for human consumption. I would certainly strongly recommend that too. That example identifies some of the problems in our primary industry-problems which this legislation is attempting to address. The bill also amends the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act. The area in which I live has long been renowned for its vegetable growing properties. But in recent years much of this land has been given over to growing cattle feed; lucerne, corn and the like. The major reason is that the people who traditionally have grown vegetables-on a typical lower Hunter vegetable operation, potatoes would be grown in the summer and cauliflower, cabbage and broccoli in the winter-are struggling. A family of farmers advised me recently that last year their taxable income was $14,OOO-from a farm that is probably worth half a million dollars. I said, 'What did you produce?'. They said, 'This year we are growing cauliflowers. We will probably plough in 60 per cent of them. We are getting 20e to 30e from the supermarket and it costs 40e to 60c to grow them'. As a result of this conversation, I contacted a research horticulturalist at the Somersby station-an employee of the New South Wales department of agriculture. I said, 'Can we sell vegetables overseas?'. He said, 'Yes, I could sell any amount of green soya beans, chinese cabbage-fresh or seed-and a species of white radish that Japanese and Chinese people use in salads and soups. It is very desirable to them'. I said, 'Does anyone grow it in Australia?'. He said, 'No. No-one has ever asked me about it'. That is the result of asking a research horticulturalist, 'Can we export vegetables?' . Much has been said over recent years about Australia's ability to provide the Asia-Pacific basin with food. We do have a remarkable environment. On the east coast of Australia from Cape York to Tasmania we have virtually every climate type that exists in the world. We have almost every soil type-the beauty is, our on-season is the off-season for the more populated Northern Hemisphere. But what research is being done to exploit the golden opportunity that we have? I venture to say that there is very little. I believe it is significant that the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) stated in his second reading speech that it is very important to ensure that the best available people can be appointed to positions in that corporation. I support that. Our primary industry sector is languishing because we are not aggressive enough in our marketing techniques. We are not advising people of the technology and information available and of the markets that exist outside this country. That is where our horticulturalists need to be directing their efforts. I come back to the legislation to say that this is what will be driving our horticultural industry in the future. Let us get someone out there who is prepared to provide the initiative for our producers. I move on to the Dairy Produce Act. I welcome the opposition's support of this legislation. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Me Crean) has agreed that the dairy industry fund will be used to underwrite Australia's hosting of the World Dairy Congress, held under the auspices of the International Dairy Federation. We all appreciate that we live in an increasingly global civilisation. What we see in Australia today will exist in America tomorrow. That is so with the dairy industry. It is very important that our dairy producers be exposed to the world to allow an interchange of information, expertise and market tips of what people in other countries want to buy. They do not necessarily want to buy what the Australian producer is currently producing. The Fisheries Management Act stresses that fisheries be ecologically sustainable. The major problem that fishermen are experiencing in my part of the world is not only the increasing levels of pollution in coastal waters for coastal fishermen and oyster farmers in particular, and the competition to the deep sea fishermen from external sources-that is, international fishermen-who are traditionally not observing the rules and regulations that Australian fishermen have to face, but also the fish stock that we are placing increasing pressure on is decreasing in quantity. Our fishermen's trips to sea are longer; their nets have to be bigger; their shifts have to be greater; and their return, unfortunately, is smaller. We must make sure that this very valuable resource-this major employer of people in coastal Australia-is maintained and is allowed to continue. I finish up with the forestry industry. That industry, unfortunately, in the northern part my electorate is in grievous danger of failing. It is in danger because of overexploitation of forestry reserves. The machinery that is rampant in the forestry industry today is capable of processing far more timber than ever before. Unfortunately, we are not seeing the research, the value adding and the plantations that are necessary for our children to be allowed to see the forests that we took for granted. Those forests need to be maintained. Ecologically sustainable development has unfortunately become a by-word. It is one which is touted in virtually every sphere; it one which too easily we resort to. I am proud to say that it is the underlying theme of these particular parts of the legislation that are before the House today and one that this side of the House wholeheartedly supports. I have great pleasure in supporting the legislation.",21
73,Mr ANDREW,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Wakefield) (3.03 p.m.)Like. the member for Paterson (Me Home), I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise in the House in support of the legislation before the House and in support of the changes proposed under the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. As the honourable member for Paterson has said, there is no dispute in the House about the direction that this bill should take. I only remind the honourable member for Paterson, as a relatively new member in this chamber, that the sort of cooperation that has been expressed over this bill has characterised the chamber on most agricultural bills anyway and is something that I know the Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources (Me Lee), if not the Prime Minister (Me Keating), is conscious of and in most instances in his capacity as the Minister for Tourism is prepared publicly to acknowledge. The first part of the bill to which I refer, and the one that has attracted the most immediate attention, is the part that affects the dairy industry. As the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Me Anderson) has indicated in his address, this is a bill about which all parliamentary parties and all agropolitical parties feel some disquiet, but it is a bill which we feel obliged to bring into the House, present and pass in the long-term of interests of the dairy industry in Australia. For the last five years the dairy industry has had an arrangement where exports of dairy product from Australia are encouraged and assisted by the whole milk levy collected from the entire Australian industry. However, an anomaly has arisen. Some companies had been using imported product which was supposed to be offset against the level of support they received for their exports. These companies have not declared all of the imported product, and have not declared the offsets. Therefore, they have been in receipt is of a greater level of support than the original legislation intended. The opposition joins with the government in seeking to have this anomaly corrected, recognising that this correction will involve a measure of retrospectivity, and will cause some disquiet. In the interests of equity, we see no viable alternative or satisfactory course for the dairy industry. The proposal is to amend the legislation to iron out this anomaly, and so ensure that imports are properly offset against exports when application for assistance from the whole milk levy scheme applies. The government and the opposition join in recognising that, even though the anomaly exists and there is a good deal of disquiet, there is no other responsible course of action that can be taken in the interests of the dairy industry. As the Deputy Leader of the National Party pointed out, this particular course of action has the endorsement of the dairy industry itself. Last week, he and I met with the chairman of the Australian Dairy Industry Council in order to ensure that the direction proposed by the government was responsible and that it was reasonable for the opposition to support it. The honourable member for Paterson raised the other area of interest in the bill-the question of agricultural and veterinary chemichemicals cals. Much of the impact of this bill has been on the dairy industry. I join the honourable member for Paterson in seeking the establishthrough ment of a national registration authority agricultural and veterinary chemicals in order to reassure Australian consumers that the they consume is of the highest possible quality. We should consider some sobering and staggering statistics. At the tum of the century there were estimated to be 1.25 billion people on this globe. It is calculated that by the year 2000 the population base will be something is. like five billion people, and by the year 2050 it will have risen to 10 billion people. While we in this chamber are frequently concerned with what have been grain mountains and agriculture butter lakes in Europe, the simple reality is that we are still looking at a situation in which we need to have the best possible cal agricultural practice applied across the globe if we are realistically to go about feeding not only the world's present population, but the available. projected population of 10 billion people. It has been calculated that agricultural producbefore tion needs to rise by 75 per cent. That crease has to be achieved on what is accuratefurther ly seen as a diminishing land base. Some of our best agricultural country around the globe is being taken up by urban development, so there is an increasing presagriculturalists sure on every farmer and every parliament find appropriate ways to go about maximising world food production. One of maximising production has been the astute and careful use of farm chemicals. Too often it has been far too easy to polarise the farm chemical debate and to have people shouting their concerns about what are frequently unfounded threats of pollution in the food we eat. In fact, as Australians we probably consume the cleanest food that has ever been available to any generation that has ever occupied this globe. What is not generally recognised, and this legislation gives me an opportunity to highlight it, is the intensity to which we expose chemical companies in order to authorise or register any available farm chemicals. Few people appreciate that, of the 12,000 or so first submitted for consideration as potential new chemicals for use in agriculture or veterinary science, only one normally gets to the final completion stage to be for actually available to producers to use in agricultural practice. It is one out of 12,000. food That elimination process takes somewhere between five and 10 years. Given the number of chemicals and the time lost in the process, it is not surprising that most chemical companies consider it costs them between $50 milHon and $80 million to register a new chemical for use in agriculture anywhere around the globe, and particularly in AustralIt is reassuring to discover that, when the vast majority of chemicals used in Australian were exposed to the tests used for consumer protection, 99.7 per cent of the food . samples used in the tests brought in a chemiresidue level under the legal limit. In fact, in 80 per cent of the food sampled in Australia, there was no detectible residue of chemical The proposal contained in the legislation the House is to establish a National inRegistration Authority. Its task will be to enhance what has been the very successful role carried out in the past by the agricultural and veterinary chemical registration scheme. It is fair to say that Australian have nothing to hide in the to way in which they have gone about applying farm chemicals and that Australian consumers the keys to have nothing to fear. It is all too easy to forget that the most hazardous time in applying farm chemicals is not when the consumer bites the apple, consumes the orange or picks up the packet of cornflakes but when the farmer picks up the concentrated chemical and puts it into the vat for dilution. In fact, the legislation before the House is not designed solely to protect consumers; it is also designed to protect farmers who are the users of agricultural chemicals. Farmers are most at risk because they are exposed to concentrated chemicals whereas the consumer normally faces a chemical that has been diluted 1()() times, even when the apple is consumed straight off the tree after the spray plant has just driven past it, and further dilution automatically occurs as a result of its exposure to irrigation water, rainwater, sunlight or wind. So this legislation is designed to protect not only consumers but also those Who are obliged by reason of their vocation to apply chemicals. It is fair to point out that the decision to have a National Registration Authority has been welcomed by the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia. The only concern it has is to ensure that, whenever the authority chooses to hold a public hearing so that people can express their concerns about agricultural chemicals, those concerned parties representing various consumer groups appear at one hearing rather than at individual hearings for every concerned party. It is rightly pointed out that that would further delay the registration of chemicals and would, for no good reason, mean a further delay in the time in which those chemicals could be made available to agriculturalists. I opened my remarks about agricultural and veterinary chemicals by talking about their potential to increase our food production. It is important to note that to date the use of these chemicals has been assiduous and wise and that, as a result of these chemicals, we have successfully increased the potential of marginal land and the productivity of recently developed crops. That is to be welcomed, and it is important if we as Australians are to continue having the opportunity of making a realistic contribution to feeding the rest world. That leads to other comments I want to make about this legislation. The honourable member for Paterson talked about the opportunities he saw as being lost for horticultural exports into Asia and to the Northern Hemisphere where, as he rightly pointed out, because of climatic conditions, our on season is its off season, and vice versa. I point out to the honourable member for Paterson that while I welcome his remarks and recognise that among the greatest opportunities we have for an expansion to our food base, to our productive base, and to increase our balance of payments in our favour is in horticultural development, We also have to recognise that much of what he sought to have happen is already occurring. The honourable member for Paterson was somewhat critical in his remarks of a number of horticultural industries because he felt they had not captured the export opportunities that had been presented to them. He may be right, but we should not lose sight of the. fact that in my electorate-no doubt in his electorate; in fact, in all electorates in which horticultural industries are represented-there are innovative horticulturalists who are doing aJI they can to capture potential markets not only in Asia but also in Europe. If I may illustrate that for a moment. While he was making his remarks I was reminded of a grower known to me in my own electorate who is busily exporting honeydew melons and rockmelons into Asia. I was aware of the fact that the Australian citrus industry this year will export navels into the United States and has just completed a season of exporting navels into New York state particularly, in the off season for the Californians, and has done so very successfully. Mr Kerin-Navel oranges.",23
74,Mr ANDREW,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Werriwa wants me to elaborate and point out that we are talking about navel oranges and not some form of military engagement, if that was the alternative he had in mind. I was referring to navel oranges being very successfully exported into New York state which occurred as a result of reciprocation between of the the Australian industry and the American industry. On an even safer subject, I think we ought to laud what has happened in the Australian apple industry where currently exports of Australian apples have been in demand. Australians have been meeting their New Zealand opposition in very successfully developing export markets for apples. These markets had largely been lost because the movement of Britain into the EC meant that we had lost the preference that we once enjoyed in entering the English markets. I remind the House and, in particular, the honourable member for Patterson that many of these exports are already occurring. I conclude by turning to an industry in which exports have been most successful and in fact ought to be encouraged. This is not an appropriation bill so I do not intend to talk about the wine tax, but I think it is appropriate for the House to consider that, of all the horticultural industries represented in this place, the wine industry has been seen as the most successful exporter. It has been a successful exporter without any direct government assistance, it has been a successful exporter without needing to be protected from imports and, in addition, it has been a successful exporter of a product that is value added and labour intensive. So, in that sense, the plea from the honourable member for Paterson for greater enhancement of horticultural exports, while well intended, ought not to be allowed to be left languishing, leaving the impression that the horticultural industry had been, of itself, failing to meet opportunities. In my opening remarks I referred to the dairy part of this legislation. The changes that are proposed in the registration of agricultural chemicals are very important. It is exceedingly important that at no stage do we allow the registration process to frustrate the availability that Australian farmers have to the latest agricultural chemicals overseas. Chemicals registered overseas ought to enjoy a certain preferential access to the Australian market because Australian farmers need to exploit every opportunity they can in order to maximise their export potential and exploiting those opportunities will mean having available to them the latest in agricultural chemicals. We want those to be the safest in agricultural chemicals. The history of the agricultural and veterinary chemical industry in Australia would indicate that they have been safe in the past. This legislation should not in any way frustrate or delay the continuity of what has been a very successful registration procedure.",25
75,Mr KERIN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"In speaking about the wine industry, the honourable member - for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) provokes me to say a few words on that topic, but I will stick to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. This is an omnibus bill on behalf of the various industries involved with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I am very pleased to see the Minister for Resources and Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) at the table. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has something like 240 acts and, therefore, it is involved with many diverse industries and tasks. There is a need for constant amendment due to changed circumstances in the industries themselves, changes in government policy, quite often legal interpretations and the correction of minor mistakes. Consolidation of acts is very difficult, especially with staff restraints; but consolidation is also .d,ifficult due to the very diverse nature of the industries involved and the tasks being performed. I note that, in the budget, staff numbers are to be cut again in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I have always taken the view that if that department had a few more resources, particularly in the legal area, a lot more progress could be made on consolidation and in other policy areas. But we live in a time when deregulation and smaller public sectors are all the rage. Basically, the opposition wants total wage deregulation. I suppose if we got that, we could privatise government departments, send them offshore and get it done a lot cheaper. There are something like 60 countries with populations of less than one million people, so they should be able to give us a good deal. Swiss Air recently sent its finance and accounting area to, India, and is very happy with the result. So, we could export some of the people giving us economic advice to countries where we could get cheaper economists and financial advice, and this might be a good thing. But the industries we are dealing with here today-unlike other industriesare very difficult to send offshore. It is a that the real world of trade means that comparative advantage does not hold up all that well for many of our primary and resource industries. In commenting on the opposition's approach to industry policY, I make the point that the effective guillotine now in place has been imposed by the opposition at the behest of the minor parties in the Senate. The guillotine not only limits debate, but ensures that the parliamentary draftsmen work under increased pressure, and therefore mistakes are more likely to occur as the legislation and the necessary amendments go through the system. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and I hope the committee's recent report on better legislation will be taken on board by the government. I turn to the amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992. The whole question of notification, testing, registration and clearance of these chemicals has a very long history. By analogy, it took this government something like six years to get the states to agree to the amount of sugar in jam, to introduce uniform food standards, and eventually be able to do something about applying some health standards to the imports of foods. In the whole area of agricultural and veterinary chemicals it certainly took a very long time to get the states to agree. Basically, each state had its own system of registration. There was a lot of duplication. There was always an argument by the states that there was a lot of variation between them. But when one is dealing with states as big as Western Australia and Queensland there is a lot of variation. Eventually, agreement was reached at the Australian Agricultural Council-as it was then named-that we ought to really sit down and see whether or not we could get national registration. The motivation coming from the Commonwealth was to get speedier registration of chemicals, avoid duplication and waste and concentrate our resources because of a lack of pity toxicologists and other people to actually review these chemicals. In the United States, an organisation called CAST, Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, is looking at this. Organisations such as that and Clean Food Australia are desirable in order to try to present to the public a more balanced view on the use of chemicals in the environment and in agriculture. Too often a good news story gets in the way of facts, and there is a need for an organisation to come forward that can actually help in obtaining feedback from the public and in developing some empathy with agriculture and for industry to try to provide accurate, unbiased information for effective planning and to provide assurances to urban Australia on the practice and products being used in Australian agriculture. I welcome the mo-e in this amendment to get more exposure. The NuForm Ltd incident was good news at the time, but when the inevitable backdown came and we saw the exaggeration of the story it did not rate a headline or a paragraph. A lot of pressure has been put on industries as a result of increased costs, by people in agriculture and by some of the people who have an ideological commitment against the use of all chemicals in agriculture. A lot is happening in the industry. I notice in the paper today that Japan now has to import rice and that it has assessed our rice as being the most chemical free of any rice that it is likely to import. In the cotton industry, progress has been made on the use of chemi- . cals. Chemicals are used systematically across a wide range of industries. Internationally, some scientists now have integrated pest management strategies, partially derived from our experience. But the use of chemicals is going down. For example, in the Indonesian rice industry, there has been a reduction in the use of chemicals of approximately 40 to 60 per cent. This all bodes well. However, those are not big news stories; they are not horror stories. As I have said, there is a need to constantly get across to the public that this is a question that agriculture, the scientists the government are dealing with. The act provides for the regulation of chemicals, but the amendments contained in clause 4 will substitute a new section 20 into the act and extend the range of information that may be disclosed and those to whom it may be disclosed. A major change is that, the chemical contains an active element that was not used in Australia prior to the clearRegistration ance of the chemical, a summary of the authority'S assessment may be disclosed. People may ask why the National Registration Authority would need to disclose confi- . dential commercial information. The problem was that the existing procedure for disclosure was very complex. To date, the authority has not been able to readily seek advice from various Australian and overseas organisations and individuals because it involved the disdirectors closure of confidential commercial informaalready tion. However, I am pleased that precautions have been built into the amendments to tration ensure that trade secrets and certain other information subject to possible exploitation are safeguarded. Other changes are that, if the National Registration Authority is reconsidering the clearance of the product, it may disclose particulars of the product and that, subject any conditions contained in the regulations, information about the toxicology of the product may be disclosed. As well, confidentake tial commercial information may be disclosed to the Com-nwealth, state or territory governments or their authorities; an overseas authority having the same functions as the National Registration Authority; a prescribed international organisation, authority or person; or a person who, in the opinion of the authorated ised person who is to disclose the informathe tion, has the authority of the person sought the clearance to obtain the information. If you understand that, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are a better man than II However, all these changes are necessary. Another question that can be asked is: would the authority want to hold public or private hearings? The government is saying quite simply that it is committed to involving the public in determining the clearance of and agricultural or veterinary chemical product. For new products witJt new active constituents the registration authority will provide public release summaries of its evaluation and invite public submissions before it makes its decision. For wider issues the government has decided ·that the authority should be empowif ered to hold public or private hearings, and that is a very strong step towards the National Authority's operations being open and transparent and being seen as such. Another question is whether or not the authority itself will be exempt from suit or legal action in respect of the granting or refusing of an application for clearance. The proposed amendment will extend the exemption from suit in respect of granting or refusing an application for clearance to include the National Registration Authority as well as the and staff of the authority who are exempt. The exemption is very specific and does not apply to the National RegisAuthority in other circumstances, such as breach of statutory duty or negligence in commercial performing its duties. To sum up, these are all very worthwhile amendments. They go to the process of scrutiny. As I said, they might not satisfy some people in the general community, but I to believe we have gone a long way over the last decade or so towards getting speedier, more uniform registration, having the capacity to into account overseas information when the relevant authority is looking at new chemicals, and also allowing public scrutiny that should reassure the public to the maximum extent possible .. Quite a few people in my electorate have been writing to me on this issue. Some of those people have been associwith the agent orange issue, and 1 believe government has gone all the w-y in trying who to have as much disclosure as possible. I now quickly turn to the dairy industry. The two proposed amendments to the Dairy Produce Act will provide a clear legislative basis for an import offset arrangement operatwhy ed by the Australian Dairy Corporation when making market support payments, and it will allow the minister to authorise the use of moneys from the dairy industry fund to an underwrite the International Dairy Federation's world congress to be held in Australia next year. There has been some controversy on the first issue. The offsets are very important because if we did not have that offset requirement, people would take advantage of the situation and get additional payments for a product that is virtually being imported and re-exported. One company has said that the legislation is retrospective. The ADIC and the ADC contest, rebut and reject that. I am very pleased .that the honourable member for Wakefield has said that the opposition accepts what the government has been saying by way of proving that this bill is not retrospective. Such measures have been in the present market support system since its adoption in 1987. It is my understanding that when the amendments to the bill were reviewed there was a further possible problem detected by the Attorney-General's Department. The minister at the table has circulated some further amendments and he will be speaking to those later today. But that additional point was really about whether or not the mechanism was a tax, and the further amendment puts that all beyond doubt. I think this is all very necessary, sensible and minor, but it does show that there can always be different interpretations to legislation. That fortifies point I made at the outset, that there is a need in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for constant amendment to all the acts that the department is involved with. I tum now to fisheries. When I ceased being the minister in that portfolio, we were in the process of setting up the Australian Fish Management Authority. It was the assumption at the time that the authority certainly had the powers that it needed and that the management advisory committees also had certain powers. But when we tried to put in various fisheries management plans often aggrieved parties would take the government to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and judgments would come out that really cast some doubt on some of the things that we were trying to do. Whenever we could get one group of fishermen to accept that what we were doing was in the industry'S overall interests, we would find an individual whom we could never fit with a fair and equitable means of addressing fish managementparticularly where stocks were in decline and where the resource itself was threatened. The Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Act 1991 is amended by extending the application of part IVA of the Fisheries Act 1952 for a maximum period of 12 months from 3 February 1994 to preserve existing fisheries arrangements under the offshore constitutional settlement until all states have enacted complementary legislation, and to continue the existing management plans in the northern prawn and southern bluefin tuna fisheries under the Fisheries Act 1952 until new plans are made under the Fisheries Management Act 1991. In terms of the points I made a moment ago, the bill also makes minor amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to provide that a management plan for a fishery may include provisions to effect or allow the AFMA to effect seasonal or other closures in that fishery. There is a need to make that quite clear and quite legal.' There is also a need to redefine the statutory fishing rights to provide that various combinations of rights can be required to allow access to a managed fishery and provide more flexibility in their the application and control. Finally, there is the need to provide for a smooth transition from management arrangements applying under the Fisperies Act 1952, most of which were repealed in 1992, to the new Fisheries Management Act 1991 by waiving appeals provisions where the managed fishery access rights for specified fisheries are carried over to the new legislation. Fisheries legislation is inherently complex. We are dealing with a resource that is often declining and where people have a lot of investment in the industry for a particular fishery. One could speak at great length about the administration of fisheries, as one could about the other industries covered by these 13 series of amendments. The changes to the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Selection Committee Act are basically to get a wider mix of skills of persons selected for membership of the Meat Research Corporation Board, to ensure the expertise in the fields of conservation and conservation management and natural resources for people representing the board of the Meat Research Corporation, and also to amend section 5 of the Meat Research Corporation Act to include the furthering of sustainable use and sustainable management of natural resources in the objects for which the Meat Research Corporation was established. I do not know whether it applies to these acts, but certainly in the amendments Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 we are amending the maximum age limits on directors of the Australian Horticultural Corporation and corporation selection comsustainable mittees. I was not ageist at the time when put that provision in the bills applying generrequires aIly to all the statutory marketing authorities; that was the policy of the government of the day. But the 1990 review of Commonwealth primary industry statutory marketing authorities concluded that the selection processes positions associated with corporations emof phasised the appointment of the best available person with relevant expertise. Given that am only 10 years short of 65, I can see the great wisdom in this. But cablnet has accepted here the recommendation of the review ment committee to remove the age limits. All the other amendments in straightforward. The establishment of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation represents an 1989, enOrmous amount of work in the department over a long period and by the relevant ministers. I believe again that honourable members should take these matters into annual report. consideration and understand that here we have an industry that possibly does have comparative advantage, because I think Australia can be a greater timber producer without affecting the environment.",26
76,Mrs GALLUS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Hindmarsh) (3.40 p.m.}-I would like to take a few moments to address one aspect of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1993and research. ecologicaIly sustainable development-which is the subject of several of its clauses. Firstly, to the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Indusdevelopment'. try Selection Committee Act 1989: the volved amendment bill will result in two additional qualifications for board membership: that at least one board member have qualifications in conservation and management of natural resources; and that at least one board member have qualifications in environmental and ecological matters. I point out that the provision might not necessarily result in the appointment of an additional board member since one person may have qualifications in both areas and may already be serving as a to the member of the board. With respect to the Horticultural Research . and Development Corporation Act, the objects of the act have been amended to include use and sustainable management we of natural resources. The amendment further that the annual report. assess the extent to which the corporation has contributed to the objects of the act, including the additional ESD provision. As for the Meat Research Corporation Act, for the proposed changes are similar. The objects the act have been amended to include the sustainable use and sustainable management I of natural resources. The amendment to this act goes slightly further, in that the principles of sustainable use and sustainable manageof natural resources must be taken into account in the funding of research and develthis bill are opment activities. FinaIly, with respect to the Primary Industries and Energy Research Development Act there is already reference to ecologically sustainable development in its list of objectives. This amendment will require that activities relating to ESD be part of the As far as they go, the amendments in a relation to ESD are a move in the right direction and it is probably necessary that they constitute part of that act. However, my concern lies with how much of this interest in ESD is window-dressing and how much will directly impact on the activities of the above corporations, and activities in development The government has failed to fully explain what it means by 'ecologically sustainable From talking to people inin various aspects of the horticultural and meat industry, it becomes clear that some are ignorant of what it actually means. What is worse, in some sections of industry generally there is a real fear of ecologically sustaingoals able development because it is seen as something running counter to development. The government should explain that, in many instances, the word 'economically' could be substituted for 'ecologically', because if something is not ecologically sustainable then it is also not economically sustainable. When we look at some of the things that have been done in agriculture-for instance, in the Murray-Darling region-it is clear that if we had earlier looked at ecological principles and ecologically sustainable use, perhaps we would not be witnessing all the problems that exist today. We may still have some problems because we learn a lot about these matters with the benefit of hindsight. Nevertheless, these amendments will require us to put into practice that which we already know. The government has failed to explain why ESD is important: that 10 years down the track, today's ecological disasters will be economic disasters. I have not had the chance in debates on previous bills to talk about ESD, so I take opportUnity to express some concern about what is happening to the whole ESD process. The ESD policy was announced with great fanfare and with consultation between industry, NGOs and all the people concerned. That process went on for over a year. It was a very positive process in so far as everyone involved had a chance to get to know each other, and it broke down the barriers that had existed between conservation groups and industry. They started working together, they started networking, and they started dealing with the bureaucracy. It appeared as though they knew where they were going and that everybody was working to the same end. At the end of that initial period, things started to fall apart because matters were handed back to bureaucracy and government. The bureaucratisation of the process meant that those who had ownership of the process at the beginning were now losing it. They no longer felt as though they knew where the process was going, nor did they feel part of it any longer. Bureaucracy changed the process. It dropped some recommendations and changed others. The clear direction and that were there in the initial part of the process disappeared. Statements about ecologically sustainable development as part of the research and development must constitute something more than motherhood statements; they must be something meaningful. To achieve that, the government must explain what ESD means. There is some concern that the ESD process, being an initiative of the previous Prime Minister, is not seen as a priority by the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That is something that concerns me.",30
77,Mr HARRY WOODS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"page) (3.46 p.m.)I rise to add my support to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. This is an omnibus bill that will amend a number of acts administered under the portfolio of primary industry and energy. The more important amendments relate to the following: the disclosure of information relating to agriculture and veterinary chemicals; the repayment of the market support levy in certain circumstances; the refining of a this range of matters that may be dealt with in fisheries management plans; the collection of levies and charges relating to forestry research and development; changing certain functi()ns of the Australian Wheat Board to include other grains; and an increased emphasis or focus, as the shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), noted, on sustainable use and management of our resources. I agree with many of the comments made by the shadow fuinister. I suggest that she direct some of them to her National Party colleagues who are of the opinion that ecologically or environmentally acceptable development cannot happen together with economic development. As to the effect of what this government has done over the last few years, that is vividly portrayed by an article in today's Australian Financial Review which talked about the potential for Australian rice exports to Japan. As we know, Japan bans rice imports but, because of seasonal difficulties with its own production, it is allowing a one-off importation. The Japan Offspring Fund campaigned against Australian rice a few years ago, considering it unsafe, but now says that it stands alone as the only uncontaminated table rice available for importation to Japan. In 1991, tests by that group claimed to have found 3,000 times the permissible levels of agricultural chemicals. The fund's director, Mr Junichi Kowaka, said: The taste is as good as Japanese koshihikarithe best and most expensive grade of Japanese rice. He said: It can even be used for sushi. So, arigato, Mr Kowaka. I wish we could also thank the Japanese for lifting the ban on foreign rice. Hopefully they will do that in not too distant future. By contrast, Mr Kowaka has circulated a report forecasting that table rice imports from the US and EC would be contaminated with high levels of chemical residues. Specifically, he claims that, of the 100,000 tonnes of Californian table rice which he expects Japan to import, 4,000 tonnes will be dangerous to human health., Of the 50,000 tonnes he expects from the EC, he suggests that 32,000 will be unsafe. But, of the 400,000 tonnes he expects to be imported from Australia, none will be contaminated. He wrote that Australia is improving its system to cut the use of post-harvest chemicals. The aim of Mr Kowaka's group, the Japan Offspring Fund, is to campaign against food contamination. Its aim is the protection of future generations. Taking the opinions of the Japan Offspring Fund and Mr Kowaka into account, we can see the effects that the Commonwealth government's legislation and policies have had over a number of years on promoting a clean, green image of Australia throughout Asia and the world. Opportunities in that regard are enormous. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 provide for the regulation of chemicals used in the agricultural and veterinary industries. The National Registration Authority was established in 1992 as a statutory authority to supervise the national registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The NRA aims to be representative, flexible and accountable and to act in a commercial manner. In performing its functions, the NRA can consult industry representatives, government bodies and people or bodies having a particular interest in the industry-or as consumers of the industry'S products. There are restrictions on the information that the NRA may make available to people and bodies when evaluating chemicals, the most important being a restriction on the disclosure of commercial information provided in confidence. Amendments contained in this bill will substitute a new section in the act to extend the the range of information that may be disclosed and the people to whom it may be disclosed. The major changes are that, if the chemical contains an active element that was not used in Australia prior to the clearance of the chemical, a summary of the NRA's assessment may be disclosed. If the NRA is reconsidering clearance of a product, it may disclose particulars of the product. Subject to any conditions contained in the regulations, information about the toxicology of the product may also be disclosed. As well, confidential commercial information may be disclosed to the Commonwealth, state or territory government or their authorities; to an overseas authority having the same functions as the NRA; to a prescribed international organisation, authority or person; or to a person who, in the opinion of the authorised person who is to disclose the information, has the authority of the person who sought the clearance to obtain the information. The proposed amendments will enable the NRA to hold public and private hearings for the purpose of obtaining public comment. Before conducting a hearing, the NRA has to set out the place and time of the hearing in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and in daily newspapers throughout Australia. The amendments will further encourage the nonuse of chemicals where their use is not necessary, and the promotion of Australian products as ecologically sound, as clean and green, and as healthy. The amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 propose to provide new aims for those groups, namely the furthering of the sustainable use and management of natural resources, and to increase the economic, environmental and social benefits to members of the horticultural industry and to the community in general. The bill makes the corporation assess its own achievements in relation to its objectives, on an annual basis. The bill also proposes to amend the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act, to ensure that expertise in the fields of conservation and management of natural resources, and environmental and ecological matters, is represented on the Meat Research Corporation board. The Australian Dairy Corporation is a statutory authority established under the Dairy Produce Act. The objective of the ADC is to enhance the profitable production and marketing of Australian dairy produce. The ADC is accountable to industry and to parliament through the Australian Dairy Industry Council. The ADC is administered by an ll-person board and is financed from its trading activities, interest and levy receipts. The levies, which are imposed by the Dairy Produce Act, include a corporation levy, a promotion levy, a market support levy and a research levy. Funds raised through the levies are used to finance the industry fund, the promotion fund, the market support fund and the supplementary fund. This bill will amend the act to allow the industry fund to be used to finance expenses which will be incurred in connection with the 1994 International Dairy Federation's World Dairy Congress. Another amendment, dealing with import offset payments, will be inserted into this by clause 21. The proposed section will be used from the beginning of July 1991, ending in June 2000. Where a market support payment is payable to a manufacturer of a dairy product that was exported, and the manufacturer imports a similar type of product in the same year, the manufacturer will be liable to pay a levy to the ADC equal to the amount of market support that would have been payable had the manufacturer exported the same amount as was imported. So the ADC will recover the market support payment in relation to the product that was exported, where the manufacturer subsequently imported a similar product. The ADC will also determine whether the imported product is sufficiently similar to the exported product in that regard. The object of the import offset is to allow the Australian dairy industry to reduce market support payments-payments on dairy exports when a manufacturer imports and exports a similar product. In such circumstances, the manufacturer will receive market support payments for net exports, rather than gross exports. The amendment to the bill does not alter the objective of the legislation; it alters only the mechanism whereby the corporation recoups the market support payments. As such, it is a technical amendment aimed at ensuring the corporation is most readily able to make market support payments on net exports. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority was established by the Fisheries Management Act 1991, with the major function of preparing fisheries management plans to ensure that the exploitation of fisheries resources is conducted in an ecologically sustainable manner. To achieve this aim, the AFMA prepares plans for the various fisheries industries that deal with matters such as the number of boats in an area, the total catch for the area, the allocation of the catch and the closure of the area during certain times of the year. The Fisheries Management Act, which commenced in 1992, established a new system of statutory fishing rights and provided for the making of fishery management act plans to be the primary instrument for the managing of Australia's commercial fisheries. The act gives the AFMA general powers to make management plans and create and issue various types of fishing concessions. The bill proposes to am', 'ld the Fisheries Management Act to clarify the matters that may be included in a plan. In particular, it would enable seasonal and other closures to be authorised under· a management plan, and provide greater flexibility in the type and number of fishing concessions a fisherman may hold. The proposed amendments will enable fishermen to hold a number of statutory fishing rights, as a discrete package of rights which authorises a particular fishing activity. The amendments in the bill include a clause to amend the Fisheries Management Act, to make it clear that where a provision of the principal act could have an application that would exceed the Commonwealth's legislative power the provision will operate to preserve parliament's intention that the provision principal act have an application within the Commonwealth's legislative power. The amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act are technical amendments to accommodate the imposition of new levies and charges on forest and wood products industries under the Forest Industries Research Import Charge Act, the Forest Industries Research Levy Act and the Forest Industries Research Export Charge Act. The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act provides for the establishment of research and development corporations and councils which provide the funding and administration for research and development in agricultural industries. Amongst the aims of the PIERD Act are achieving the sustainable use and sustainable management of natural resources and improving the accountability of expenditure on research and development activities in relation to primary industries. The amendments to this act will deal with the Commonwealth funding of research and development bodies. The Commonwealth's contribution to the forest industries research and development corporation will not exceed 50 per cent of the funds collected under the Forest Industries Research Levy Act and the Forest Industries Research Export Charge Act. As well as that, the bill will amend the act to provide that the Commonwealth's matching payment to the forest industries research and development corporation is not to exceed 0.25 per cent of the value of the industry as determined by the minister. Another clause of the bill amends the act to require a research and development corporation to include in its annual report research activities related to ecologically sustainable development. This bill also proposes to amend the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Po-er Act to clarify the ability of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority to invest surplus moneys in specified ways without needing to seek the permission of the minister for each transaction. The bill also proposes to amend the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 to clarify the power of the states to confer functions and of the powers on the AWB to allow it to conduct intrastate trade in grain and grain products as well as in wheat. The proposed amendments will also improve the operational efficiency of the Australian Wheat Board by extending the delegation powers of the chairperson or the managing director. Most of the amendments proposed in the bill have no financial implications. However, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act will allow expenditure from a research and development corporation established in respect of forest industries to be funded by the Commonwealth. The levies and export charges are expected to be introduced at a rate which will attract a Commonwealth contribution of 0.05 per cent of the gross value of the product. Accordingly, it is estimated that the Commonwealth contribution would be approximately $90,000 in 1993-94, rising to $350,000 in 1994-95. Funding for the first two amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act will be provided by existing NRA funds. The added emphasis that many aspects of this bill give to the sustainable use of our resources is a focus that we should be aiming at with all legislation. I believe that is particularly true for primary industry. Australia is unique in the opportunities that are presented to it as a provider of clean, green products to the world and, in particular, to Asia. An extract from the Australian Financial Review about rice really shows that point. The thinking of governments and bureaucracies over 20 years or so has shifted the emphasis away from the importance that we attach to our primary industries. The recognition that Australia needed to become a manufacturing exporter if it were to maintain prosperity really took over that thinking, and with good reason. The steps that this government taken forward in promoting manufactured exports have been quite remarkable, especially in the last four or five years. Along with that recognition of the need manufacture has been an almost implicit acceptance-especially by many bureaucracies-that it would be at the expense of primary industry. But our primary and reparasite source industries are still major earners Australia, and bureaucracies and governments in particular need to recognise that this that it will remain so and give credit to these primary and resource industries. The emphasis needs to be on exports with a focus on value adding to those products, the management of those products in an ecologically sustainable way and the promotion of those products clean and green, different and better than rest of the world-just as Mr Kowaka said the article.",31
78,Mr TUCKEY,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I wish to address this omnibus bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. We tend to have a lot of those these days, but this of course is the proper way use that particular mechanism-unlike some things that have been taken to the Senate recent times. I wish, firstly, to address attention to proposed changes to the legislasulfate tion relating to the National Registration Authority and, in particular, to the decision that it will be able to in fact release what would be commercially sensitive information to organisations or persons whose might assist in the evaluation of applications. More importantly, as far as I am concerned, the second reading speech also states: The National Registration Authority will be able to conduct public and private hearings for the purpose of obtaining comment on chemical products and will be required to notify the times and places such hearings in daily newspapers throughout Australia. It is interesting that the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) made a remarkunderstand and I know he really made it in a slightly different context-that there are no financial implications. One of the great financial implications that has confronted rural Australia in recent years is the time it takes for our authorities, including the NRA and, I might has say-even worse-the health department, to reinvent the wheel on issues relating to many agricultural, veterinary and other chemicals. The simple fact is that very few of them are to invented in Australia and very few of them are implemented in Australia first. I am reminded of the circumstances of what our is now one of the most commonly used worm treatments in our great sheep for industry-an industry that needs every possible advantage at present. The product trade is so, named Ivomec was introduced into New Zealand with no fuss or any bother in 1981, and it did not get full commercial release in Australia until 1986. It has been used since then. I use it on my farm, and I have not seen one sheep tum up its toes in all that time and, as what is more, I am not aware of any others the who put it into sheep having problems. The in sheep are probably a little more worm free than some of their compatriots, but 9therwise they seem to get along pretty well. The simple fact is that there was plenty of evidence that the product was safe, it was necessary and it had a much broader spectrum to in terms of dealing with worms, some of which had become quite resistant to other in treatments. I can still remember an uncle of my mine trying to drench animals with copper or sometqing such as that because it was all that was available. These modem treatments of course assist, and we have had developments since then which allow cattle to be treated with a similar product by applicainformation tion to the skin. But the point I am making is that I have had those sorts of difficulties, delays and associated problems. I am aware of them because of the representations I made this year. I have to admit again that these probfor lems have been with the health department more than the NRA. I refer to a product known in the trade as Formaz or, more broadly, as IPU 500, which is a herbicide. I it is one of the most consumed herbicides in the world. It has been in common use in Europe for decades, and it is possibly a herbicide that will deal with a problem in the Western Australian wheat growing industry of rye-grass herbicide resistance. Rye-grass is a very vigorous grass which causes a number of problems for industry. It can bring about a disease in sheep called ryegrass toxicity, where a fungus grows in the seeds of the rye-grass hand literally paralyses and can kill sheep as well as larger animals. People try to destroy rye-grass with spray topping before it goes to seed. Of course, if it gets a major hold in a crop it is a very vigorous grower and reduces yields dramatically. Considering Australia's reliance today on growing and exporting wheat crops, one would think we would be desperately searching for a solution. Yet when this was produced commercially in Western Australia this year I found myself going through every possible avenue of bureaucracy to even get a trial conducted. The Department of Health in Western Australia was not much better than the rest. It is not a reason for opposing the legislaI tion, but I want to put on the record my concern as to how much further delay there will be in obtaining items that require no evaluation. These chemicals have no special attributes as to how they might work in Australia. Because we are at the bottom of the world one would think that somehow all these chemicals would have different applications and different problems. As I said, we go about reinventing the wheel. I am quite happy for the NRA, the health department or anybody else to take an entirely new chemical and go through every proper process, but it seems that the bulk of these inquiries and delays are applied to products that are already in use· in many parts of the world, and I do not think we are so smart that we will find anything different about them. All I can see coming out of the so-called public hearings is further delay and an invitation to certain sectors of the community to oppose these chemicals simply because they have 'chemical' in their names. I can assure honourable members that huge farmers do not use chemicals they do not need. Chemicals are extremely expensive. On my farm, for a nonnal cropping program of a couple of thousand acres the chemicals cost me more than my fertiliser. I assure the House that I do not want to overuse them. In fact, the efficiency of my farm and of all those fanners whom I represent and their ability to survive in very difficult times can be advantaged by competition and by the introduction of competing chemical types. Senator Winston Crane drew it to my attention today that apparently there is a replacement for glean-an extremely expensive herbicide-which is 60 per cent of the price. But there is still a battle going on about endorsing it. It is not surprising that many people who might turn up at public hearings are surreptitiously representing those manufacturers who are already in the market. There are very good commercial reasons to delay the introduction of competing products, but that is not very helpful to the agricultural industry. I think this is a matter of considerable concern. In making inquiries throughout the industry, have had it pointed out to me that the NRA is taking a much more liberal view of this today. It is recognising the need to get on with the job of authorising the use in Australia of products that have been well established in other markets. It is to be congratulated. On the other hand, we are also told that there is an interdepartmental battle going on because the NRA-the National Registration Authority-with its proper responsibility for registration, would like to have total responsibility for assessing these products but has to knuckle its forehead to the health department. That is one of the great stumbling blocks according to the industry. Then state health departments jump in for a little extra. Surely today we should be debating a system whereby the NRA, if that is the appropriate authority-it appears to be so-should be up front making the full decision. For the information of the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), I am told that the health department, when reviewing the decisions of the NRA; has four meetings a year. If for some reason it rejects the proposition put to it about a certain product, that is not dealt with in the intervening period-it goes to the bottom of the pile. Presumably, if the health department is a little busy it might be another six months before it gets up for further consideration. That is outrageous. These decisions should be made on an ongoing basis and every possible effort should be made to get safe product onto the market as quickly as possible in the interests of promoting the industry. There are other products that apparently would be very valuable to us. I am sure everyone will be able to spell these products. There is one called porcine somatophlin which is designed to actually reduce fat on pigs and turn it into muscle. It is an injection and is possibly a steroid of some description. But if we can get past the requirements importing countries and produce, by this simple mechanism, a less fat and more musto cular pig-meaning, of course, not tough muscle but edible muscle-that would be very helpful. But it too has sunk in the quicksands of this system. It should be out there making dollars for farmers-pig producers in this case-and, of course, consequently for Australia. There is a similar product whose name begins with 'bovine' - that is the easy bit to spell-which apparently will do the same with milk production. But, again, we cannot get out of the bureaucracy and of course we cient: should. I do not disagree that these are things that have to be tested to a reasonable degree. But, in my opinion, two or three years for a product in use in other parts of the world just too long for national evaluation and we should be doing something about it. I am taking this opportunity today to lodge my plea and again register my concern that sales taxes. public meetings are no way to overcome these problems when we have a section of the community that is totally negative about this type of farming activity and, consequently, will use these meetings to try to delay Some of the meetings could be private, as act provides. That may be more sensible if NRA is of the opinion that it wants further information, but one would not have thought that it needed a piece of legislation to find out things about these chemicals that it could not discover in its own laboratories. Part of the proposal contained in the legislation is to allow it to release certain confidential information regarding the chemical structure of these products. That does not seem very fair to the inventors, but I expect it may have some sense-although I wonder again why the decisions cannot be made internally. That is my first area of concern regarding this legislation. I hope the minister takes it as a constructive contribution, because in the end it might do what the budget has failed to do-;-that is, create some jobs. That is a pretty serious matter. It might do something towards replacing the extra 5c a litre that all regional and rural people now have to pay under this budget just to get fuel and to pay for the cost of of freight within their communities. I was astounded today to hear the answers questions and the bleating about trying to get the budget deficit down when the simplest way to reduce the budget deficit is to collect taxes at existing levels through higher profits. In other words, create a prosperous community and we would not have a deficit problem. That is the issue that this government should be addressing instead of trying to create myths about when, where and how the conventions of this place work in terms of the Senate's dealing with bills. These are the it issues which will make Australia more effigetting the productive factors of chemicals and other things into the marketplace so the farmers of Australia, who have carried the place for so long, are able to contribute again is and become profitable once more enabling them to pay their taxes and fix up the deficit of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) without adding to their cost structure through fuel and I would also like to take the opportunity to report quickly on the state of the fishing industry in a couple of areas because another segment of the legislation deals with this things. situation. I have concerns about the the Commonwealth's administration of fisheries. the I get a lot of representations about this throughout my electorate because people in my electorate who are established in places such as Geraldton also operate large fishing vessels, trawlers and such in the Gulf of Carpentaria and other areas under Commonwealth control. These reports are that it is a constant, ongoing mess. The simple fact is that the state Fisheries Department in Western Australia has a reputation unequalled in terms of fisheries management. It was at the forefront of limited entry, and it controls its fisheries on that basis. There is a huge controversy going on in my electorate at the moment because the catch that is applicable to the crayfish industry-the rock lobster industry, as the Americans prefer us to call it-has been reviewed. As a result the industry is recommending, with the assistance of an advisory commission made up substantially of fishermen, that there be a 25 per cent reduction in the number of pots being put in the sea to catch these crayfish. As honourable members will understand, those who have the pots in many cases are resisting, particularly those with fewer numbers of pots, because 25 per cent of that smaller number is a real problem. But they have the courage to stand up and do this. A very large proportion of the fishermen involved are prepared to accept it. This approach is needed because we now have such excellent technology in the industry. Once a fisherman used to go along and drop pots where he thought he might catch a crayfish, but now he drops pots only where he knows he will catch a crayfish because he can practically see them on the bottom. Furthermore, he can find them with the GPS system. It is quite amazing to see a fellow turn on his little television screen and see the pot there. The automatic pilot is turned on, and the boat can go and find one pot in millions of square miles of ocean. It can drive you to within a metre of it. The efficiency of each pot has gone up to such a degree that the industry has to do something about it. That is not related to the issue today, make the point that the majority in the fishing industry in Western Australia is standing up and saying that it accepts that something has to be done and it is arguing about what is the best way. But nobody is arguing against the fisheries having to be saved or that they are getting too good at catching fish. But there has not been. a quick enough response in any practical way in the Gulf of Carpentaria. In fact, the fishery there might be lost because the breeding stock has been so thoroughly depleted through inaction. Action is being taken, but it is always too late. It does not address the fundamental act of catching fish, and that involves the size of the net, the amount of net in the water or, in the case of crayfish, the number of pots in the water. Parliament is being asked again today to deal with certain matters and, from reading the second reading speech, they seem to be matters which go some way towards getting better control of some of these situations. But I make the point that it is all too late. I hope it is not too late, but it is much later than it should be, and the policies are not necessarily good. One of the reasons for that might be either that the industry has not been prepared to give government the complete message or that th- industry has not been listened to in the way that it has been listened to in Western Australia. As I said, the controversy goes on. Unfortunately, to a degree it gets politicised over there. Recently I made a call to tell politicians to butt out of an argument about the biggest single fishery in Australia, the Western Australian rock lobster fishery. It is a huge exporter, one to be protected, and no side of politics should play politics with it. Concerned people are getting up and threatening the livelihood of one member of parliament who happens to have a business selling cars. People are being told to go to another town to buy their cars. That is outrageous, and I called for it to stop. I hope it does, because it is important that the right decision be made. As I said, it is time that the Commonwealth went over there to talk to a few' Western but I Australian regulators, because they have certainly done a wonderful job. I lived in Carnarvon and watched the starting up of a green fields prawn fishery. It is still going, and good money is being made out of that. Good money is being made out of the scallop industry there because of the controls that have been applied. This legislation is a little hard to understand, but involves only minor adjustments. I hope by now the message is getting through so that we will see some proper improvements and a more sensible approach to the industry, particularly in the Gulf of Carpentaria. That is a major fishery, a huge fishery and, as such, must be protected in the national interest. At the moment there are still grave doubts about its future viability because it has been fished to a level well beyond a point of recovery. On that, I will close.",35
79,Mr VAILE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"My main interest in this Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill before the House at the moment is really with regard to the dairy industry. I was interested to listen to a couple of the comments that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) made with regard to the National Registration Authority. I take heed of his comments. I can also see the other side of the argument: trying to gain a little more public involvement in assessment of chemical products to be used in agriculture could be a very good thing for operators in the agricultural sphere, such as the honourable member for O'Connor. At so many other levels of government we have seen that the extension of public involvement in the assessment of these sorts of things is very positive. I suppose the longer we operate in this sphere, in this parliament, we tend to believe that between ourselves and the bureaucracy we hold all the wisdom. We certainly should not believe that because we do not; there is a lot of wisdom out there in the public arena that we should be tapping into and making use of. I think the House is aware that the opposition is not opposing any of these amendments. To a large extent they are common sense amendments to various acts within the portfolio of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). As I said at the outset, I am more interested in making some comments on the amendments to section 94 of the Dairy Produce Act which was introduced in 1986. I believe these amendments will bring in a much clearer legislative basis for the import offset arrangements operated by the Australian Dairy Corporation. Obviously I am interested in the dairy industry because it is the major primary industry, worth something in excess of $60 million a year, in my electorate of Lyne. So I certainly have a great deal of interest in what is happening to the Dairy Produce Act, as it will affect a lot of my constituents. The current system of import offsetting introduced seven or so years ago has been universally accepted within the industry and has worked extremely well. Earlier this afternoon I noted that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) spoke on this particular part of this bill. Of course, he introduced this legislation in the first place when he was minister. Everybody will remember that the industry went through a great deal of angst and heartburn at the time the legislation was introduced, particularly producers and particularly in New South Wales, in that initially it was believed the market levy was basically blackthe mail money to try to keep the oversupply from Victoria out of the market. Certainly that was a case that precipitated the bringing into being of this act. I note that none of my colleagues from Victoria are here this afternoon, but I will say that, so far as the suppliers from my electorate were concerned, at that time their market milk supply was being severely disadvantaged by Victorian producers dumping excess milk in a flush season over the border into New South Wales, thereby severely affecting the viability of New South Wales fanners. I will add that this act has certainly stabilised, and ensured the future of, the dairy industry in Australia, in particular in my electorate. I have spoken to numerous members of the dairy industry within the electorate of Lyne and all have said that, although the all milk levy is a big slice of their incomes, that it is a burden to them and that it is an added overhead, they are very happy with how the industry has been remodelled, how it is developing and how this initial legislation in 1986 secured their future in the industry. On two separate occasions cooperative managers have said to me that they have never seen their suppliers happier. The survival of the dairy industry in the late 1980s, and the subsequent growth of the dairy industry in the 1990s, can be directly attributable to some hard industry decisions made in those years. Included in these hard industry decisions was the introduction of the all milk levy and the system of import offsetting introduced under the Kerin plan, as it is called. The system works so well because it effectively pulls product onto the export market, thereby keeping domestic prices at an acceptable level to both producer and consumer, and thereby helping out all manufacturers in the industry. The most attractive part of this market support program is the equity that it gives to all parts of the industry. It is a universal levy which is universally accepted and it provides universal price assistance. This market support scheme has only seven years to run, phasing out in 1999. It is crucial to the restructuring of the dairy industry that it continue on an equitable and even basis. Already the dairy industry is Australia's biggest processed food export industry, with significant and growing shares in Asian and Pacific markets. The only way to avoid many of the problems that were in the industry is to stick firmly to the rule that support payments are available only for net exports. This is the only way to avoid many of the evils in the dairy industry that the industry has worked so hard to get rid of. Some of these evils include the flooding of domestic markets with excess supplies that could otherwise be exported, as I alluded to previously. By paying this levy right across Australia we are enhancing our exports of processed dairy products and will maintain a limited amount of milk on the local market. The amendment to the Dairy Produce Act is vital to the continued success of the industry. I am not against opening our market to imports. We have a very efficient and lean industry which is working very well. The effect of sucking in imports in this wayeither for domestic sale or re-exportingwould mean that the total amount of product on the domestic market would be increased. This would push the domestic dairy price down, thereby frustrating the main objective of the market support system, which is obviously to hold all domestic dairy prices to a remunerative level. Furthermore, if market support funds are spread over an export tonnage, which is inflated by imported product, the rate per tonne is again obviously less which, again, is to the detriment of all exporters. If this amendment is not supported there will be no winners. All those in the industry would lose from the across-the-board fall in prices on the domestic market, which we need to remember still absorbs two-thirds of milk produced in Australia. There have been a few comments within the industry that this is retrospective legislation. This is simply not the case. The other night  Gallagher, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Dairy Industry Council. He put a very strong case. He said that the amendments to the legislation will not be retrospective. He stated: I do not believe that the Council would accept that the legislative powers conferred by the amendment are retrospective, for two reasons. First, the offset policy and the arrangements employed by the Corporation since 1987 were endorsed by the Council at least five years ago and have been well known to, and accepted by, manufacturers since that time. Several firms have paid offsets against imports in years prior to 1991. The ADIC records show that the offset arrangements have had ADIC approval since at least August 1988 when the Executive directed the Corporation to continue the practice already then current of applying offsets. It is important to note that all operators in the industry have known of the arrangements since 1988. Mr Gallagher continued: The second reason for my belief that the Council would not regard proposed legislation as retrospective is that the offsets for 1991/92 are a current liability of firms that have received market support payments for that year. The Corporation advises me that they have not sought to pursue the offsets for that year, or since, pending resolution of a legal challenge to the practice. I should add that members of the Council consider that this is a current liability to the industry, not to the Corporation, both because the funds are the proceeds of industry levies and because the offset sums will be added to the total support payments available for distribution to the industry this year in accordance with provisions of the market support program. The offset arrangement has been a feature of the market support system since it was adopted, with industry support, as part of the Kerin plan arrangements. As I said before, all those operating within the industry have been well aware of the arrangements that have been in place since 1988, whether they be operators under one company name or another. It has become well known to manufacturers who have been claiming the support payments, and paying offsets, since 1987. There are therefore no surprises for anyone in the continuation of these arrangements, and there are no surprises in this amendment being brought to parliament. I understand that the offset payments for 1991-92 have not yet been sought by the Australian Dairy Corporation pending the clarification of this legislation. After parliaIt ment passes this amendment and the corporation applies the offset it will not be acting retrospectively as people have known about the offset system for a long time and have already received levels of market support payments which, under the scheme, they are not entitled to keep. People are fully aware of the reasons for the introduction of the scheme and of what is required from each and every supplier. For a few companies to use a legal loophole is a simple case of someone trying to get an easier ride at the expense of his mates, and he certainly cannot claim that he did not know what was going on. Out of three processors in my electorate, two fall into the category where they have been complying since 1988 and one has not been complying. So there are both sides of the argument in my electorate. If this amendment is not passed, and the offset arrangements cannot be applied, the corporation calculates that the industry will have approximately $3.2 million less in its pool of support funds. The lower amount in the support fund will mean lower payouts to exporters. Butter exports will be down by $10 per tonne; cheddar exports will be down by $10 per tonne; skim milk powder exports will be down by $8 per tonne; and whole milk powder exports will be down by $9 per tonne. the Also, the loss on the domestic market from lower prices is forecast by the corporation to be an additional $2 million. Just because one or two exporters have refused to meet their offset obligations for 1991-92, the industry as a whole could lose more than $5 million in support for its exports. That is not right. It is not fair for those suppliers and operators who have continually supported this program. It is clearly obvious that this amendment is important for the continued success of a $1 billion export industry and, just as importantly, it is important for the continued success of what is turning into a model industry in Australia. This is a model industry. Since 1986-87 it has got off its backside, helped itself, restructured itself and sorted out its internal problems. There are still many problems because different systems are operating in each state. is a leading rural exporter and a leading rural industry today. It should be used as a model industry, not only within the rural sector or the rural production sector but right across the board with many of our industries. The export side of the industry is being supported so that it can compete in what is a very unfair and uneven playing field on the international markets. This industry is worth in excess of $60 million per year to the electorate of Lyne. I have been in contact with many companies that operate within my electorate which are heavily involved in the dairy industry. I include here Mr Ken Isaacs from the Hastings Cooperative, which has 67 suppliers, and John Wignall from Australian Consolidated Foods, which has 70 suppliers at Taree and another 34 at Comboyne. Australia Consolidated Food believes that this amendment is important totriaintain the market support to the local suppliers. While ACF is not in the export market, by its suppliers paying this levy it can clearly see the beI}.efits that the current scheme provides. ACF proquces approximately 450,000 litres of milk, with approximately 180,000 litres of that being manufactured milk. Forty-four trailers, twice per day, head down to Newcastle for distribution of this milk supply, with the rest going to either Gloucester, Lidcombe, or the huge general by-products station at Wetherill Park in Sydney. People at Australian Consolidated Foods clearly say that suppliers have never been happier, and that the current system of an all milk levy is working extremely well. I have spoken with local suppliers, including people like Elwyn, Robert and Leslie Walsh of Killawarra near Wingham. They have told me that, although the levy costs them on average $10,200 per year-which is an added overhead and about which, initially, they were not convinced in the mid-1980s when it was introduced-they now believe that it stabilised their industry, it stabilised their operation locally, and it certainly helped them to be able to budget into the future with their operation. These people are all fully supportive of the introduction of this amendment, and they believe it to be vital to their, and their industry's, continued success. The Hastings co-op is a classic example of how important this amendment is to the dairy industry. The Hastings co-op has just had its best year since 1973. Mr Nehl-An excellent co-op.",39
80,Mr VAILE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"'An excellent co-op', interjects the honourable member for Cowper who formerly represented that area that is now in my electorate. In 1973, that co-op had 138 producers, now it has just 67. Due to on-farm improvements the co-op has seen a 16.3 per cent increase in earnings over the last year, and from the end of the last financial year until now it has seen a further 15 per cent increase on last year's performance. In 1973, the Hastings co-op was producing 490 litres per supplier per day. In 1993, it is producing 953 litres per supplier per day. The dairy industry is starting to reap the benefits from some hard decisions-they were not easy-in the mid-1980s, and this amendment is vital to the continued growth of this industry. The Hastings co-op believes that the benefits far outweigh the costs of the all-milk levy. It is not only important as a protection from overseas importers, but the state to state dumping, which was precipitated by a lot of action by the Victorian dairy industry in the mid-1980s, has been virtually destroyed by the introduction of the Dairy Produce Act in 1986. We do not want to see a return of the interstate dumping that was a feature of the pre-Kerin plan years. This amendment to section 94 of the Dairy Produce Act 1986 will remove any uncertainty about the arrangements under which manufacturers of exported dairy products currently receive market support payments and, in doing so, will secure the future of many of the non-exporting suppliers by keeping the domestic market as a viable alternative. The dairy industry is currently a model industry, and does not need to be eroded by some companies trying to exploit the system-the system that they have known to be in operation since 1987. This amendment needs the full support of this place, so that the Australian Dairy Corporation can collect its market payments for 1991-92 and, in doing so, secure the future of both the domestic and export markets of the dairy industry, not just in New South Wales and Victoria but right across Australia. Last week when I spoke to representatives of the industry about- the implementation of this amendment, they supported it wholeheartedly. These were representatives from Queensland, not from New South Wales or Victoria, which are the major dairying states in Australia. As you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Queensland operates a different system. These Queensland representatives are fully supportive of what the current scheme has done to the dairy industry in Australia. It has certainly taken a great deal of hard decision making. I live in a dairy area and there was a lot of heartburn in the mid-1980s. But today, although my constituents are paying in excess of $10,000 annually on the all-milk levy, they agree that it is a good investment towards the balanced nature of their industry by comparison with the other primary industries, and the misfortunes and the difficult market times that those industries are experiencing at the moment With a little guidance from the bureaucracy and government, the dairy industry has got itself to where it is today-unlike the beef, timber and sugar industries. We do not want to see that strong industry position eroded; we want to see it continued for the benefit of all concerned, not just a couple of companies that have restructured their organisations and found this loophole. It is pleasing to see both sides of the House support this amendment. (1ime expired)",42
81,Mr LEE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"in reply-In summing up in this debate on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill, I would firstly like to thank all honourable members who have taken the time and put in the research effort to make quite commendable and constructive comments. In particular, I would like to thank the shadow minister for primary industry, the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson), for his comments. I might not agree with all of his statements about New Zealand, but on most other matters there would be agreement on both sides of this chamber. The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), made some quite visionary comments about his belief that there is great potential for increasing horticultural exports from Australia. I know that he is a very keen supporter of the government's clean food export strategy which, under the auspices of the Agrifood Council, is developing a clean food export strategy to promote Australia's clean and high quality food exports into Asia. I know it would also have your support, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the support of all honourable members in seeking to boost Australia's exports into one of the world's fastest growing regions. The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) both referred to the claims that there is a retrospective element in the amendments which affect payments to the dairy industry, and I do not dispute the comments made by either honourable member. We do acknowledge that these measures will affect future payments, not past payments but, at the same time, will take into account previous imports by some individuals. However, it is the government's view that there no retrospective element to these measures. The honourable member for Wakefield went on to make a comment in passing about the wine industry and, after praising the wine industry, said that the rapid expansion in the export of Australian wine products has been done without direct government assistance or protection from imports. While I understand that he is a very strong supporter and defender of the wine industry, particularly in South Australia, it is important to acknowledge the assistance which governments from both sides of the House have provided to the Australian wine industry. For example, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation received over $1 million in the six years to 1991-92, and wine exporters received over $26 million in the seven years leading up to 1992-93 in export market development grants. The wine industry has only received those grants because it has spent a lot more than that in promoting Australian wine products overseas. It is through schemes such as EMDG that the government is providing assistance to the Australian wine industry, and we believe that there is still great potential for that industry to boost exports. Recently, I had the honour of representing Australia at our national day at the expo in Taejon, Korea and, Mr Deputy Speaker, you may wonder how that is connected with this bill. The major Australian producer selling products at our expo pavilion is The Hardy Wine Company, which out-sold its targets within a few weeks of opening at the expo. It is another way that the industry and government is continuing to work together to try to promote Australia's wine products. The honourable member for Lyne also mentioned the Kerin plan a few times. It was interesting to hear the comments made by the honourable member for Weiriwa (Mr Kerin), given that he was the man responsible for the reform of the dairy industry in Australia, and that he had to persuade quite a few people that these reforms were in the long-term interests of that industry. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) made the comment in passing is that she had concerns about whether the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) remained committed to the ecologically sustainable developfurther ment process. As the Minister for Resources and the minister responsible for the forest industry, I assure the honourable member for Hindmarsh that both I and the Prime Minister strongly support the ESD process as outlined in the national forest policy statement. There is a firm commitment in that statement towards encouraging greater use of plantations and encouraging the forestry industry to increasingly rely on plantation timbers as years go by. The government's commitment to establishing the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation also makes it clear that government and industry in future will work together to try to develop new technology and new Australian research and development so that we can use our resources in a more sustainable manner. That is a very clear demonstration of the commitment of the Prime Minister and the government to ESD processes. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) expressed his concern about delays in the registering of chemicals which are commonly available overseas. He expressed the concern that in Australia we were seeking to reinvent the wheel each time a new chemicalor product was sought to be added to the market. I commend the honourable member at least for acknowledging that the NRA is now more prepared to allow registration than it has in the past when the product is widely used overseas. For the information of the honourable member for O'Connor, I refer to a couple of the products he mentioned in passing. He mentioned that PST, porcine somatophlin, is able to convert fat into muscle tissue in pigs and that that would improve the productive efficiency of people involved in the pig industry. Advertisements will be placed tomorrow in newspapers stating that the assessment on PST has been completed and is now available. There will be 21 days from tomorrow for public comment on that assessment. On BST, bovine somatophlin, which the honourable member for O'Connor also referred to, I have been advised that the United States has deferred approval of BST while research is carried out. Last Saturday, on this very issue, the government advertised that new legislation will be made available for public comment and that all members and senators will receive copies of that new legislation for comment. In that new legislation, we are seeking to provide for fixed time frames for assessments to take place by the NRA. Those time frames will depend on the type of application, whether it is a new drug or whether it is a drug that has been used widely overseas. The procedures have been developed as a result of discussions with the industry. A maximum time frame of 15 months, but in most cases three months, will be provided for the assessments to take place. I hope that eases some of the concerns of the honourable member for O'Connor. I thank all honourable members for the contributions which they have made to this debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",43
82,Mr LEE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"by leave-I move: (1) Clause 21, page 7, line 34, omit ""the manufacturer is liable to pay to the Corporation"", substitute ""the market support payments that would otherwise be payable to the manufacturer under section 94 are, despite any other provision of this Division, reduced by"". (2) Clause 21, page 8, lines 4 to 6, omit proposed subsection (3), substitute the following subsection: ""(3) The Corporation is to determine whether the market support payments that would otherwise be payable to a manufacturer of dairy produce under section 94 are reduced under subsection (2) of this section and, if so, the amount of the reduction."". (3) Clause 21, page 8, lines 9 to 11, omit proposed subsection (5). (4) After clause 25, page 9, insert the following new clause: ""25A. After section 9 of the Principal Act the following section is inserted: Act not to apply so as to exceed Commonwealth power '9A. (1) Unless the contrary intention appears, if a provision of this Act: (a) would, apart from this section, have an invalid application; but (b) also has at least one valid application; it is the Parliament's intention that the provision is not to have the invalid application, but is to have every valid application. '(2) Despite subsection (1), the provision to have a particular valid application if: (a) apart from this section, it is clear, taking into account the provision's context and the purpose or object underlying this Act, that the provision was intended to have that valid application only if every application, or a particular invalid cation, of the provision had also been within the Commonwealth's legislative power; or (b) the provision's operation in relation to that valid application would be different in a substantial respect from what would have been its operation in relation to that valid application if every invalid application of the provision had been within the Commonwealth's legislative power.

The amendment to part 6 is a technical amendment to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 which alters the mechanism for the Australian Dairy Corporation to recoup market support payments. This will occur when firms have imported similar product to their exports. The amendment does not alter the original objective of providing a clear legislative basis for the import offset arrangement. The amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 included in this bill do not operate retrospectively. Amendment 1 reduces a manufacturer's future entitlement to market support payments when similar dairy products have been imis not ported. Amendment 2 enables the corporation to determine whether the market support payments should be reduced, and the amount of the reduction, if a manufacturer imports dairy products. Amendment 3 deletes the invalid proposed section 94A(5), which is now appli- redundant due to these other amendments; The amendment to part 8 will add a new section to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 which declares parliament's intention that no valid operation of any provision of the act is intended. The new section will enable all provisions of the act to operate to the extent that they are capable of having a valid application. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum.",44
83,Mr ANDERSON,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The coalition accepts these government amendments and the spirit in which they are put forward. They allow for the continuation of the all milk levy and its objectives in assisting export development in the dairy industry and raising prices on the domestic market. That scheme, as many speakers here today have attested to, has been extremely successful. As a result, we have seen the dairy industry remove itself from the front pages of the nation's newspapers. The industry was blighted by problems of farms not being big enough and of extreme poverty in rural areas where dairying was the major industry. Today we find that we have an aggressive, outward looking, professionally managed and, in many ways, a very impressive rural industry all round. The Kerin plan, to give credit where credit is due, has been instrumental in bringing that change about. The industry is being allowed to continue in a sensible way. The arrangements which pertained in the past, whereby a levy was raised on people who had imported by being set against their exports, have been substituted by the system outlined by the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), in that payments subsequent to a declaration of the level of imports made in the previous 12 months will now be deducted from the producer's market support payments from the fund. I cannot but fail to return to this question of competitiveness. The dairy industry has done an enormous amount. I have friends in that industry who have told me of the difference it has made to their industry. However, transport costs in this country are too highthey remain too high-and this budget does nothing but increase them. Labour on-costs in the food processing and fibre processing sectors of this economy are substantially higher than they are in New Zealand and we will not be able to raise any sort of protection against New Zealand imports under closer economic relations. We have no choice whatsoever but to match New Zealand· at its own game. I believe that in that regard more needs to be done. However, I accept the thrust of the remarks .. At an appropriate time, I would seek a commitment from the minister on the amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report-by leave-adopted. Third Reading Motion (by Mr Lee)-by leave-proposed: That the bill be now read a third time.",45
84,Mr ANDERSON,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I would like to seek from the Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), inasmuch as he is able to give a commitment, his views in relation to the concerns that have been raised here this afternoon about public hearings on agricultural and veterinary registration. Whilst the industry the coalition both accept that the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals will be able to conduct public and private hearings for the purposes of obtaining comment on chemical products, we believe that it is important that this process be facilitated and streamlined and that one hearing should be held as close as possible to the final registration process. There are a couple of reasons why this is a desirable objective. Firstly, several bodies such as the National Food Authority will want to be assured that new chemicals do not leave residues in food or affect soils unnecessarily. It is important that the NRA is able to cover the range of relevant issues and views in as brief a hearing process as possible. Secondly, that hearing process needs to be as close as possible to the final point of the registration process to ensure that competitors do not have access to material that would be made available in a public hearing in a way which might imperil their commercial standing. Very few patents or other forms of protection are available to chemical companies. In view of this, I seek the minister's assurance that the government will seek to ensure that, where there are to be· public hearings, they be designed to facilitate both the commercial interests and the rapid adoption of registration rather than hamper the process.",46
85,Mr LEE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I am in the interesting position of being the Minister for Resources, not the minister directly responsible for the issues which have been raised by the shadow minister and Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson). I am more than happy to give him a commitment that I will pass on the opposition's request to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). I am sure that he will give the honourable member a speedy response. In a past life as a backbencher I chaired the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which looked at the whole question of genetic engineering. This issue came up in regard to research and development in that area, given that public enquiries into the and proposed release of new technological developments in that area might allow those who are opposed in principle to any development in the area to use public hearings to restrict the opportunities for Australia's industries to get a competitive advantage over our competitors. It is not the government's intention that these public processes be used as an opportunity by certain groups to make it more difficult for Australia's primary industries get the competitive advantages that they deserve to get from research and development in this area and the proper use of chemicals. I am more than happy to pass on the request from the shadow minister to the minister responsible .. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time.

86,Mr HOWARD,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"It is particularly appropriate that the estimates before the committee should include the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, because that gives us an opportunity on this side of the chamber to say something about the extraordinary behaviour of the ministerial head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Those of us who have been in this parliament for a few years would have to assert, without any fear of contradiction, that the action of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in terminating question time today was about as erratic and as authoritarian a piece of behaviour as we have ever seen from a Prime Minister sitting at the dispatch box in this parliament. Whatever the Prime Minister may say, however much he may try to rationalise it, however much some of the apologists in his own party and elsewhere may try to put a gloss on his behavto iour, the fact is that the Prime Minister lost all control today. He was clearly aggravated by a series of events, and he is plainly showing the pressure of the great public office that he holds and for which he is manifestly unfit. In normal circumstances, if the proper decorum and proprieties of the parliamentary system had been observed, the opportunity might have been available for the opposition to have moved a motion of censure because certainly the Prime Minister's behaviour warranted the strongest possible censure. There was no excuse for what the Prime Minister did today. He plainly embarrassed people on his own side, and the rather anguished, embarrassed looks of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), and the stunned mullet reaction of most of the occupants of the government backbench, will long live in· the recollection of us on this side of the chamber. The truth is that the pressures are accumulating on the Prime Minister. He has coming together this week four of the major issues which he would hope would be a hallmark of the time that he spends in the prime ministership. Mabo has gone from bad to worse. He has succeeded in alienating every single interest group around the entire Australian nation on that particular issue. On the industrial relations issue, he is on the verge of an unconditional surrender to his industrial and political bosses in the ACTU. We were promised a new world of workplace bargaining when he addressed the Institute of Company Directors within a few weeks of being unexpectedly re-elected on 13 March. We were told bravely and boldly that we were going to have workplace bargaining; that the 71 per cent of non-unionists in private sector workplaces were going to have the opportunity of entering into enterprise bargains; and we were promised that the government would stand up to the trade union movement-and it has been in a headlong retreat ever since. The government has already agreed to destroy the secondary boycott provisions, which have stood for 16 years as a valuable protection for the business community against trade union excesses. Despite that track and the fact that by destroying those provisions the government will be placing trade unions above the law in this country, it has resolved to go ahead with that course of action. Let us come to the issue of workplace bargaining. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) promised a Claytons form of workplace bargaining-not genuine workplace bargaining of the type wanted by employers, of the type advocated by the opposition or of the type adopted in many Australian states, and adopted with very good results in other parts of the world. lt was not that kind of workplace bargaining, but it offered at least a tiny step forward· which would give some modicum of additional freedom of movement for non-unionists within the system. That was not good enough for the ACTU. The Minister for Industrial Relations has been sent packing by Martin Ferguson and Bill Kelty. He has been told that the only form of workplace bargaining that they will agree to is one that embraces the use of the award flexibility provisions one that might involve the creation of a large number of workplace unions. The ACTU came up with this marvellous idea that the problem of non-unionists in the workplace would be solved by getting rid of them, rather like solving the problem of poverty by allowing all of the poor to die. A lot of pressure is accumulating on the Prime Minister, and that pressure came to a head today. The reason that the Prime Minister went over the top, the reason that he lost control, the reason that he demonstrated before the national parliament his unfitness occupy his great office, is that he was angry at the response given by the Minister for Finance. The Minister of Finance sang from the wrong hymn sheet. Last night the Prime Minister went on the PM program and laid out the great counterattack: how he was going to tum defeat into victory. This week was going to be the Prime Minister's blitzkrieg; he was going to come back and try to brand the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as a constitutional wrecker. The only person who has been record branded as a wrecker today is the Prime Minister himself. He has been the instrument of his own destruction today because he lost control of himself. He has demonstrated that, under pressure, he is a puny parliamentary performer. He has demonstrated that when things go bad he spits the dummy. In the words of the Leader of the Opposition, he has got a glass jaw. He could not stand the fact that the Minister for Finance was reminded of the simple reality that 11 years ago, when the minister was the shadow Treasurer, he had argued the right of the then Labor opposition to do exactly what the coalition is now doing in the Senate. We are not destroying convention; we are not wrecking convention; we are doing what Lionel Murphy, Gough Whitlam, the Minister for Finance, the Prime Minister and the present Governor General all argued when they were in opposition-what any opposition had a right to do. lt is an absolute travesty of constitutional history for these people to parade before the people of Australia and to say that in some and way what the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues are now doing represents the wrecking of conventions. We are doing exactly what Whitlam, Murphy, the Minister for Finance, Hayden, the Prime Minister and many other Labor people before us have said that we had a perfect right to do. What really angered the Prime Minister today was the fact that, instead of the Minister for Finance getting up and saying, 'Well, the opposition is a bunch of wr-kers and the Leader of the Opposition is a destroyer of the great conventions of this parliament' , to he had enough intellectual honesty not to run that argument. He ran another argument about adding to the deficit. He forgot the fact that 11 years ago, by voting down the tax bills of the then government, he added to its deficit in 1981; but I will let that pass. What the Minister for Finance did today was contradict the standard version of the Prime Minister that was given out on PM last night. When the second question was asked there was exactly the same reaction from the Prime Minister, and exactly the same reaction when the Minister for Finance began to continue along the lines that he had developed in his first answer. That is why the Prime Minister went over the top today and lost control. Try as he did at his press conference, and no doubt try as he will over the next few days, to explain and rationalise it away, he had absolutely no excuse at all for behaving as he did today. It was just a sign of what an authoritarian, autocratic and arrogant man he is, and the way in which he collapses under a degree of parliamentary pressure. He is supposed to be the lion of the parliamentary forum-the man who can take it all and dish it out in great measure. The truth is, put him under a bit of pressure and he crumples; put him under a bit of pressure and he behaves like a prima donna; put him under a bit of pressure and he behaves like a spoilt childhe does not behave like a Prime Minister. He is running around the country at the present time trying to construct this phoney argument that the opposition is breaking convention. We are not breaking convention; we are doing what the Labor Party did when it was in opposition; we are doing what Lionel Murphy and Gough Whitlam said any opposition had a right to do. The opposition is not voting against the budget; we are not denying supply; we are not voting against the appropriation bills; we are merely exercising our right selectively to vote against certain measures that we believe are not in the interests of Australia, particularly as the government never told Australians six months ago that it was going to introduce those measures when it lied and cheated its way back into office in the election on 13 March. As a consequence, I move: That the proposed expenditure for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet be reduced by $10 as a measure of the disapproval of the House at the precipitate action of the Prime Minister in terminating question time in the House today.",47
87,Mr ATKINSON,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I wish to speak in support of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I believe it is totally appropriate that we raise the issues and problems that have been caused by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) because of the way in which he has handled himself in this place today. I think it is very appropriate that I go through some of the points that have been raised by the honourable member for Bennelong in the chamber. He has made considerable comments with respect to the pressure that the Prime Minister is under. It is clear that he is under substantial pressure in many areas. Mabo is one of those areas where he has taken a particular line to the Aboriginal people in this country and has then backed away from that line. He now finds himself under increasing pressure because of the attitude that he took early in the piece. When we look at the industrial relations issue, substantial numbers of people throughout this country-in the order of 70 per cent-do not come under a unionised structure. The fact is that the Prime Minister is under increasing pressure from the union movement for it to have some involvement in the workplace based agreements. Over a period of time, we will see this pressure being increased by the union movement. This is of great concern to many small enterprises where there has not been union involvement and where, in the past, they have been able to operate quite efficiently and effectively under agreements and arrangements reached with their employees independent of these systems. The amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Bennelong should be supported to indicate where the opposition stands, and to indicate our dissatisfaction with the way in which the Prime Minister has operated. Our dissatisfaction is not just with the three questions that were able to be asked during question time today-two of which were answered in total and the third one only partly answered before interruptions by the Prime Minister. The fact is that the opposition is being put under increasing pressure with respect to the answers given to questions about issues in this place. We have had taken away from us the opportunity of discussing matters of public importance. This has' been of major concern to us. There are issues that need to be raised in this place regularly that we have not been able to raise. Under the current arrangements, we will not be able to raise them until 28 October. We find ourselves in a situation where, time after time, debate has been guillotined. Since 1983, when this government came into office, well over 500 pieces of legislation have been guillotined. From Federation until 1983, less than 100 pieces of legislation had been guillotined. That is a restriction on the way in which this chamber can operate. It is a tion on the rights of the people of this country to have their legislation discussed in the manner of a true and democratic country. I conclude my remarks by saying that we must take note in this place of the way in which this Prime Minister has dealt with issues. The Opposition's protest, as illustrated in the wording of this amendment, is an appropriate way of doing that.",49
88,Mr DOWNER,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I support this amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) over the last few weeks, and in particular in the last few days, in relation to the budget shows all the characteristics of somebody with a dictatorial mind. First of all, the Prime Minister takes the view that, if people disagree with the government's budget, it is intolerable and they deserve to be crushed. It is totally unacceptable for anybody to criticise the government's budget. According to the Prime Minister, despite the fact that it is a dishonest, regressive and damaging budget, it is utterly reprehensible for anybody to criticise it. To the dictatorial mind of the Prime Minister, it is also completely unacceptable for the parliament to have the audacity to stand up for Australians in defiance of some of its measures. Obviously, the Prime Minister is resorting to the traditional propaganda tactics that have been so well practised throughout history by people of his mentality-what some people describe as 'Goebbels tactics'. Firstly, the Prime Minister makes an assertion which he knows to be untrue, but he believes that by continuing to repeat it some people will eventually believe him. The Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box a few weeks ago and asserted that the coalition opposed tax cuts. That is not true. Anybody who follows politics in this country knows that that is not true. We explained at the time that it was not true, yet the Prime Minister continues to assert it. He believes that, if he asserts something totally untrue for long enough, eventually enough people will believe it. That is how he won the last election. His latest concoction is that the coalition is restricbreaching convention by opposing some measures contained in this budget in the Senate. As little as 1.5 per cent of revenue measures in the budget are being opposed by the coalition in the Senate, but according to the Prime Minister that is a breach of convention. I could wheel out no end of constitutionallawyers and officials with great experience in the area of parliamentary practice to prove that the Prime Minister is wrong-because he is wrong-and still he would continue to assert the lie in order to instil the idea into the minds of some people that his proposition might be true. Today, I received a 'letter from the Clerk of the Senate in response to my telephone call to him, which effectively stated that the decision of the coalition to oppose some tax bills was entirely constitutional and consistent with convention. The Clerk of the Senate, a distinguished public servant, made the point that the Senate has every right to oppose tax bills if it so chooses, and that the Senate has done that since 1901. In 1901, the Senate rejected an appropriations bill three times before Sir Edmund Barton returned to the parliament with a completely redrafted bill. So from time to time, from 1901 until today, the Senate has been opposing tax and money measures. The Clerk of the Senate made that point in his letter to me. He made that point very clearly by quoting Senator Lionel Murphy, that great icon of the Labor Party. The Labor Party loves Senator Murphy and quotes him to support any case which it believes to be sacred. As the Clerk quoted him, Senator Murphy said: The Senate is entitled and expected to exercise resolutely but with discretion 'its power to refuse its concurrence to any financial measure, including tax Bill. That is one of the icons of the Labor Party speaking, as quoted by the Clerk of the Senate, one of Australia's most distinguished public servants. Yet the Prime Minister continues to assert that to oppose any of his measures in the Senate at all is a breach of convention which, if it were a convention, he breached in this chamber in 1981 when he opposed certain tax measures. He was a member of the shadow cabinet at the time and he and his colleagues organised the Labor Party in the Senate to oppose tax measures which constituted exactly the same proportion of Commonwealth revenue as the tax measures the coalition is opposing. The Prime Minister's assertion-this repeated and dishonest assertion-that the coalition is sometlow breaching convention is yet another example of the dictatorial mind at work: repeat the lie over and over again and in the end someone may believe it. I can absolutely assure this chamber that we will not take these tactics from the Prime Minister lying down. Every single time the Prime Minister tries this stunt, every time he tries manipulate pubic opinion, we will be there pointing out the dishonesty and the disreputable arguments he puts forward, and exposing the hypocrisy of the case that he presents. We will do that every time this Prime Minister sets out to promote that point of view. It is also interesting to hear the Prime Minister saying that the coalition is wrecking his budget; that we are wreckers and vandals. We get that from the Prime Minister over and over again. That is yet another example of the Prime Minister's technique of telling an untruth and then repeating it over and over again in the hope that some people will eventually believe him. Is it true that we are wrecking the budget? Of course it is not true. The coalition is opposing only 1.4 per cent of the revenue measures in this budget. If we take into account the views expressed by the Greens and the Democrats and look at what they and the coalition will oppose, in the context of this financial year that amounts to the government losing something like $140m worth of revenue out of $100 billion worth of a revenue in total. In other words, if the Democrats and the Greens vote as they say they will vote on the amendments to the budget proposed by the coalition, the Democrats, the Greens and the coalition would reduce revenue by 0.14 per cent. Is that wrecking the budget? Is it wrecking the budget to reduce revenue by 0.14 per cent? The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) run around saying that people will not get their tax cuts by Christmas. They are not getting five-eighths of them at any rate because they have been cancelled altogether by the Prime Minister, despite the fact that he promised them. They are saying that people will not get their tax cuts by Christmas because they will not be able to finance them. As things stand with this budget, the government will lose $140 million worth of revenue from measures opposed by all parties wanting to oppose them in the Senate, and they say that will destroy $1.66 billion worth of tax cuts in the 1993-94 financial year. Is that wrecking the budget? Is that destroying the opportunity to finance the tax cuts? Of to course it is not. That is manifestly untrue. It is totally dishonest propaganda to suggest that the coalition is wrecking this budget or making it impossible to finance the bringing forward of the tax cuts. It is about time that this chamber took account of that and brought an end to the dishonest propaganda of the Prime Minister of this country-a man who is no longer worthy of that job, given his utterly disgraceful and contemptible performance over the last few days. We saw an hysterical performance by the Prime Minister in the parliament today when he cut off question time, ran up and had a little press conference, crying with his glass jaw in pieces about how cruel and how unfair everybody has been to him. There is the dictatorial mind at work. Criticise him and it is unacceptable. Attack him and he cannot take it. But he can dish out the dishonesty and the propaganda.",50

90,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (5.29 p.m.)-I make the point that you have just made, Mr Deputy Chairman, that the intemperate and extraordinary language we have heard from the three opposition speakers in this so-called debate has been quite amazing, especially since they are attacking the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others for supposedly lying, not telling the truth, or trying to fabricate the facts. All these terms were used in the context of the speech by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) who has not even remained in the chamber to hear a reply-nor was he here to speak in the correct order. It shows what respect he has for the procedures of this chamber. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has moved an amendment to the appropriations in which he says: That the proposed expenditure for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet be reduced by $10 as a measure of the disapproval of the House at the precipitate action of the Prime Minister in terminating question time in the House today. If the total value of question time to the opposition is a mere $10, I will give those opposite $10-I produce it for their purposes-if that is the point they are trying to make. Mr Costello-Table it.",52
91,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I table the $10. The whole point is that the honourable member for Bennelong and the opposition have been reduced to producing nothing but stunts in their attempts to attack the government. What a pathetic motion it is. It is not a serious amendment of any kind, but a stunt by the honourable member for Bennelong who jumped the queue, taking the place of the honourable member for Mayo. Then the honourable member for Mayo was not even here to make his speech at the correct time. We have heard three speeches from members of the opposition in relation to this matter, but there has been nothing but personal attacks on and abuse of the Prime Minister. There has been no attempt to address the issue. The fundamental issue that has been raised in relation to these estimates is a constitutional one. It goes to the heart of whether the government is going to be able to produce a budget and get that budget-it has the constitutional right to produce it; it is the democratic will of the people-through the Senate. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his cohorts are desperate because they have no policy, no philosophy and no ideas. What have they done? They have decided that the only way they can possibly survive in politics as a party-let us be clear that after the election the question arose whether the Liberal Party had a future at all, having lost the election that could not be lost-is to force some kind of election. The Leader of the Opposition is breaking all constitutional conventions in trying to prevent the government passing these very important bills. If the opposition had any decency it would simply support the bills. The honourable member for Mayo said that the sum was only 0.14 per cent of the total. That is incorrect.. It is not $140 million that those opposite are opposing; it is close to $3,000 million of tax cuts-if they are all put together. Mr Thckey-Not in this budget.",52
92,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"They oppose them here in the House of Representatives and intend to oppose them in the Senate. The only reason they will not get away with that total opposition in the Senate is that the Australian Democrats and, hopefully, the Greens will not support them in such a major destructive exercise. Instead of debating the appropri.ations we have heard personal abuse of the Prime Minister, and instead of a coherent speech from the honourable member for Mayo or the honourable member for Bennelong we have had a stunt put forward as an amendment. The level of debate in this chamber has been reduced. The Prime Minister did cut off question time. But it was becoming unmanageable because of the disorderly behaviour of the opposition in not even allowing the Prime Minister, or other ministers, to answer questions in a proper fashion. There was a concerted attempt systematically to shout down the Prime Minister and other ministers. Mr Bilney-I have heard a more polite crowd supporting Collingwood.",52
93,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member makes a football analogy. The situation today is disgraceful. We should be focusing on the main issues affecting this country. That is what the government is trying to do. Mabo, the possibility of a republic, a budget are all issues. They are the central questions, not the attempt by the opposition to absolutely run down and destroy the credibilityMr Costello-Wind it up.",53
94,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member should go back to university and do another course, in constitutional propriety. If he knew about constitutional propriety, he would not be trying to undermine the precincts of the constitution by trying to block central tax bills. The important difference is that these bills are absolutely crucial and central to the whole process of the budget. The fact that they are being rejected in the Senate is a disgrace; it has to be changed. Mr Williams-Tell us about the constitution.",53
95,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member knows about constitutional requirements in relation to the Senate. We do not want to precipitate another situation that of 1975-one step led to the next until there was a crisis which, initially, many opposition members did not want to bring on. But when these conventions are breached, eventually there is a crisis in which the whole budget process of the government is undermined. There could be a constitutional crisis not dissimilar to that of 1975. So be warned that one step leads to the next. The whole situation can be reversed, as the Prime Minister mentioned. If those opposite were in government and the Labor Party and a minor party were in control of the Senate, those opposite would not want-and would consider it an outrageous breach of democratic principles-the kind of breach which they are trying to maintain today and in the weeks we try to get the budget bills through. The honourable member for Mayo attempted to tell us that this was only a small matter. But the bills which the opposition voted against in this place would constitute a very major blow to the budget strategy-and to the budget. So we totally reject the approach taken by the opposition. The debate on these appropriations should get back to the issues in question. We appeal to the opposition to try to do the reasonable thing and think of the future for major parties in this country. A major party has to show some responsibility. But those opposite are not doing thatbecause they are desperate to force an election. Mr Thckey-How do we force an election?",53
96,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Those opposite have said that they are trying to force an electionMr Thckey-I know you're trying to make us the government every time things go wrong, but how do we force an election?",53
97,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"After 13 years of opposition, those opposite have not learnt anything. They have the same crazy New Right philosophy and ideas that have been rejected internationally. They are the Thatcher and Reagan ideas, but they have gone. The Australian Liberal and National parties represent the only major opposition parties in the Western world that are still committed to similar to crazy New Right dimensions. Mr Bilney-They're dinosaurs.",53
98,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"As the minister says, they are absolute dinosaurs. All their ideas are rejected throughout the world by scholars and by academics. Even the British Conservative Party has moved away from Thatcherism. But we have here the great supporters of Thatcherism, the great supporters of the new right. The opposition parties lost the election because the Australian people did not want their values, their crazy ideas, and their 15 per cent GST - Australians did not want the 15 per cent indirect taxes. What hypocrisy! We have this very same group in opposition voting against a one per cent increase in indirect taxes when it was proposing a 15 per cent increase on everything. Whole items which are now not taxed would have been taxed under its proposal. So we have this hypocrisy coming from opposition members. Instead of their coming up and accusing the Prime Minister and the government of dishonesty and being disreputable, they should look at their situation. The other day I heard the editor of the Australian, Paul Kelly, say that. the opposition has no policy and no direction; it does not know what to do on the major questions affecting the country. Because the government has a few budgetary problems and the opposition has managed to get a few people to vote with it in the Senate against the budget measures, the opposition is sitting there thinking that the Australian people will eventually vote for it and it will simply fall into government. The opposition will not fall into government. The Australian people will vote only for a party that represents idealism, principle, tradition, and the basic values of fairness and social justice, which is what the Australian Labor Party represents. The opposition needs to adopt some principled positions. It may think that it is riding on a high at the moment, but as soon as we resolve these issues of the budget, I can assure you, Mr Deputy Chairman, it will be in a situation where we will see the totally intellectual moribund Liberal Party go to another defeat at the polls.",53
99,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services sought to present a note to the House. In these circumstances leave is required. Is leave granted? Leave not granted.",54
100,Mr TUCKEY,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"We have just heard something that was a reflection of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) tried to do during question time today, and that was to give us a diatribe that really had no meaning. As a consequence, I will ta.ke a few moments to address what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) just said. The parliamentary secretary came to a point of accusing the opposition of forcing the government to an election. That is technically impossible, other than by defeating supply, and nobody has suggested that that might occur. Another option that the government might havehaving lost certain parts of its budget legislation, for instance, the wine tax-is to use that opportunity to call a double dissolution. A double dissolution is available only to the government of the day. It is used from time to time when a government cannot get its program through and it feels that it has the public support to do so. That is the difference that the parliamentary secretary does not seem to understand. We can have a double dissolution as soon as a bill is rejected on two occasions according to the rules that apply. The simple fact is that the government then has to go back to the people and convince them of its program. We on this side of the parliament would be delighted to see the government go back to the people with its budget-the budget it never bothered to tell them about before the election. We know that they voted for the government, and we know why. They voted for the government because they happened to believe-underlining the word 'believe'-a matter that now embarrasses the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). He has told his constituents that he is very embarrassed by this budget, and so he should be. He told them before the election, as did the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and everybody else, that the Australian people could re-elect the Keating government and turn around and have no extra taxes. That was the f&ct. There were to be certainly no increases in such areas as fuel tax and sales tax, which everybody now recognises have such a debilitating effect on the opportunities of Australian business to compete and Australian consumers to fund their own family budgets. That is the issue. This is not an issue about the federal budget, it is an issue about poor people's budgets-people who, irrespective of the decisions of the Senate on these budget bills, will get no tax cuts. They certainly will not get anything by Christmas, even if they eventually get that rebate. ' This particular amendment makes clear that it is an attempt to demonstrate disapproval at what happened at question time today. I thought that I would take the opportunity to remind honourable members on the government benches of the way this chamber used to operate. I thought I might start with a couple of points of order. Hansard of 30 April 1981, at page 1808, states: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Standing Orders provide that an answer should be relevant to the question . . . On page 1809 the same person went on: Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order. is a Standing Ordernot numbered, of course, because I do not think this person would know where to ,find itwhich says that an answer will be relevant to the question. The Speaker at that time, having had that point made to him, said: Order! The Treasurerthe honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), as I recollectwill draw his answer to a conclusion. Who made those points of order? Hansard shows the present Prime Minister did. He wanted to complain about it. But what did the Speaker do? The Speaker instructed the minister to bring his answer to a conclusion. I have here a two-page list which takes us through from 30 April 1981 to 15 September 1981, not a very long period, and which gives 10 examples of Speaker Snedden telling ministers of the Fraser government that they should bring their answer to a conclusion. In one example Mr MCVeigh was further told: The honourable gentleman will bring his answer to a conclusion orl will require him to resume his seat. Those of us who were present at that time will recall that was a common practice. That was how Speaker Snedden dealt with the government that elected him. He dealt with the opposition fairly and he gave it a go. When it comes to relevance, it is interesting to note that a lady who later became Speaker, Mrs Child, drew his attention to his own ruling when she said: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw your attention to the Hansard of 27 August. You ruled: The minister will answer the question and not engage in irrelevancies, such as contrasting the Government and the Labor Party. What was Speaker Snedden's response? He agreed. He said that the minister should answer the question and not engage in irrelevancies such as contrasting the government to the Labor Party. There is the message for the day-not a petulant Prime Minister curtailing question time. If the honourable member for Hunter There does not know what his question was, nobody does. He asked a question about unemployment, an issue of grave importance and sensitivity. That is to his credit. He was trying to throw a little light on t-ehill because he wanted to raise the ANZ Bank's job advertisement statistics. The figures are a little better. What did the Prime Minister do? He started with a bit of an answer on that, and the opposition heard him in absolute silence. We recognise how sensitive and how proper it is to raise these questions, as I hope the honourable member for Hunter did when he asked the question. What did the Prime Minister do? He turned around and used that question and the fact that he was standing up and abusing the processes of this place to try to re-establish his Goebbels like approach and paint a picture of an opposition doing something that was entirely",54
101,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,Mr Snow)Order! I ask the honourable member for O'Connor and other honourable members not to use language which is close to unparliamentary.,55
102,Mr TUCKEY,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I know that I am the one person who has been kicked out of this place for using a person's name. I have been called unparliamentary, and I have never been able to work out why. All I did then was use a person's name. I will not do it again at your request, Mr Deputy Chairman. I respect you. The simple facts are that the Prime Minister got up in answer to a question on unemployment and started to abuse the processes of the place by reading something that Mr Menzies had said that was probablycin a context quite different from the circumstances applicable at the moment. I was waiting for him to read something from Billy Hughes when he was a Liberal; he might as well, for all the relevance it has to today. The history of this place is clear: over almost a century the Senate has rejected bills prepared in this place, including taxation bills, and all political parties have been involved in that. There is nothing different about that. It is an absolute farce for the government and the Prime Minister to tell the people that they cannot have their tax cuts because of our opposition to the nasties in the budget-the bits the government never told anyone about. I have not been in the Senate today, but I know what our intention was-to pass the tax cuts. The Liberal Party, the National Party, Senator Harradine, the Democrats and the Greens-a majority in themselves-are all willing to pass the tax cuts for people for Christmas. The only people who are reluctant about it are those opposite. They come in here carrying on about it and trying to make this juvenile logic. It has always been like this, but it has never been so bad. It is absolute kid-stuff. I do not think the press gallery is that silly. I do not think it will cop this. The Prime Minister closed down question time today because the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) was reluctant to come out and say that he did not do things that he did, and he was dodging and ducking. Of course, his dodging and ducking on the world today was· even bigger. He said straight out that he did not want to be answerable for what the Prime Minister said. He must be enraged by being dragged into it in the way he has. He is the person who, in 1981, put the then opposition's case and said why it was appropriate to do these things. Of course, he was right, and now he is having it put back to him. The Prime Minister was getting very worried today about what his minister might say in answer to the next question, SO he closed question time down. In truth, he abused the parliament but, worse, he chose a question on unemployment to put on his stunt, when all he had to do was answer it properly and demonstrate that little bit of a light on the hill. I repeat that opposition members were hearing him in total silence. They only went off when he abused the privilege of this place and turned around and raised matters which were totally irrelevant and which would have been dealt with summarily by Speaker Snedden, as I have shown the parliament today. Speaker Snedden would never have tolerated it, and he demonstrated it time and time again. He disciplined ministers and he required them-Prime Minister and all-to do the right thing by the then opposition and give it a chance.",55
103,Mr BEAZLEY,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"We oppose the amendment to Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94 moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). It is yet another example of the effective bowdlerising of great parliamentary traditions that the opposition has engaged in. It used to be the case that when an opposition had an objection to a budget it would move what was effectively a censure motion-that the budget be reduced by £ 1. From that point there would be a discussion on the totality of the budget. What has the opposition done on this occasion? Because it did not get the whole of question time, it has said that the expenditure for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet should be reduced by $10. Great parliamentary institutions are thereby reduced to sheer farce. It is sheer farce that the opposition has managed to produce the proposition that because it did not get the whole of question time we ought to reduce the budget by $10. It is unfortunate that the opposition did not permit the tabling of the $10 of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous). We could have got this out of the way and gone on to talk about the budget quite sensibly, the opposition having collected its $10 penalty for having missed out on 20 or 30 minutes worth of question time. Opposition members missed out on question time not because of the absence of $10; they missed out on question time today because they were purely disorderly-disorderly beyond the capacity of any Speaker to control. This is not a unique experience in this parliament. In the last couple of weeks question time in the Western Australian parliament was closed down after four minutes, and nought minutes. There are a few other disorderly oppositions around the place including, apparently, one of our own. The opposition here was disorderly. I am always amused when the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) stands up and pontificates on these matters. We counted the interjections of the honourable member for O'Connor during one question time-a question time when he was not ejected-and he managed to break the century; he got in 110 interjections in the 45-minute question time. It was a truly magnificent performance in its own way. Of course, that sort of disorderliness means that no questions are answered. We had this pabulum that there was no noise when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) started to answer his question. The Prime Minister never stands at the dispatch box of this place in question time without producing an immediate orchestrated hubbub from the gibbering array of pathological exhibits who sit on the opposition front bench and, whenever question time comes around, proceed to get stuck into him to ensure that no answer is heard. Every now and then the experience palls a bit. One is tough, but one has feelings. There is no sense in trying to make points if they cannot be got across. It is not possible for Mr Speaker to operate on the basis that the entire opposition front bench is disciplined; that is obviously out of the question. The basic job of members of parliament in this chamber is to assist Mr Speaker to maintain order. In the final analysis, it is not Mr Speaker to keep order; it is for honourable members to keep order over themselves. A point about relevance was raised. From time to time ministers stray from relevance. A question was directed to the Prime Minister as to whether there are, in his view, any impediments to the budget's capacity to create opportunities for employment in this country. I would have thought it was manifest that the prospect of substantial sections of the budget being carved up did constitute such an impediment, and it was so ruled by Mr Speaker when the point of relevance was raised. There was no question of relevance. When Mr Speaker ruled the opposition position out of order, and the Prime Minister in order, we got this inane baying. What had b-n generally a gibbering on the opposition front bench converted itself into an inane baying over which absolutely nobody could hear themselves think, let alone speak. At that point in time the Prime Minister considered that, for sensible good order in the House, the best thing for him to do would be to shut down question time. The opposition is seeking justification not just on the issue of question time, but also on its general proposition that what it is really doing is not all that heinous. We have to remind opposition members not just of history but also of our contemporary situation. Whatever may have happened in the past, this is now undeniably true: it has only been since this government has been in office that we have effectively operated a deregulated financial sector in the economy, - sector which is enormously sensitive to effective fiscal management, whether we like it or not. Some of us on both sides of the chamber, I suspect, do not like it at all; nevertheless, it happens to be the case that money markets and others in business these days focus far more heavily on the government's fiscal performance than they ever have in the past. That imposes enormous disciplines on governments; it imposes enormous disciplines on parliaments. That situation, of course, is a post mid-1980s situation. A second point that can be madethis can go into a historical illusion as far as this. debate is concerned-is on the question of for how oppositions choose to oppose budgets. Generally speaking, oppositions have done it in this way: where they have had the certainty of defeat in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, they have chosen to oppose them in both places; where they have had the certainty of defeat only in one chamber-the House of Representatives-they have chosen to formally divide and oppose it only in that place; and where oppositions have found themselves in a situation whereby their actions are likely to defeat a budget in the Senate, with the exception of a perfonnance of the Liberal Party on supply in 1975, they have pulled back. Nobody has minded the odd $100 million trim around the edges of the budget. As the Prime Minister pointed out in his press conference today, he has introduced a whole raft of financial refonns-some associated with budgets, some out of budget season-on which the opposition, the Democrats and other Independent members of the Senate . have had a million things to say. Changes have been made; there is no question about that. Changes have been made. But none of those propositions involved the systematic, full-scale attack on the budget that the opposition has raised today in this area. Of all the articles the Prime Minister might have quoted in question time in this area, there was one he might have made more play of but he chose not to, instead going to Sir Robert Menzies-and I suppose if one wants a source for the Liberal Party it is not a bad one to cite, given that Sir Robert was the founder of the Liberal Party and the only decent Prime Minister it produced. But one of the conservative columnists, Gerard Henderson, had much to say on the absurd perfonnances of the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and the way he has conducted himself in the course of this budget debate. What upset Henderson is what ought to upset all tories about this position: as he points out, the opposition has, directly as a result of its behaviour, elevated people who are unquestionably ideologically unsympathetic to - he Liberals to a point of legitimacy on interference with or manipulation of budgets that will be a long standing trait and opportunity for them. The levity with which it is done is also a cause for remark. Henderson said: Perhaps there is a way of stopping Alexander Downer's faxes. It's just that, as yet, I have not come up with the appropriate five-year plan. However, I do know that it pays to clear your receiving tray before retiring for the evening two or more Downer faxes increase and multiply overnight. So every morning, every night and frequently during the day media releases from the shadow Treasurer continue to arrive uninvited. My favourite is one which commenced ""If I might take the luxury of making one prediction today ... "" to which was attached a memo from a chap called ""Stephen"" addressed to ""Alexander"" advising how to maximise media coverage. From memory, Stephen's message was of the ""send more faxes"" genre. God help us. He went on: The Coalition could have negotiated the Budget through the Senate after seeking appropriate changes to the proposed industrial relations legislation. Instead, John Hewson, in revenge mode, decided to give a series of free kicks to the main surviving strand of left-wing thought in Australia. We on this side of the chamber cannot necessarily be expected to approve of everything that Mr Henderson has to say, but from the point of view of the conservative side of politics one would have thought that some of the things he has had to say would constitute some pretty sound advice. The opposition might well have looked at it a bit more seriously. The fact is that a soft point has been found in the opposition's political defences in this place-and it has been the cause of its baying over the last week. It is no accident that the opposition has got more than usually hysterical over the last week or two. It is always easy to get out there and make hay with an unpopular budget. It does not have to be a particularly brilliant opposition to do that. From time to time governments have to introduce tough things in budgets. Money markets happen to want to see those tough things, of course. But generally speaking it is fairly easy, if one wants to make cheap political capital at a government's expense, to take those elements of a budget which have found some fonn of unpopularity and exploit them. That is no real achievement as far as an opposition is concerned. But here the opposition is creating a set of . precedents which will rule. When the Labor Party confronted its bitterness at defeat in 1975, it eschewed-and I do not think, given lest the trauma that we experienced, many of us personally, that we on this side of the chamber have been given credit for this-using the Senate in that fashion ever again. Should we happen to be in opposition, we would not take our opposition in the Senate to any point of jeopardising the totality of a budget, or a substantial portion of a budget. We might well divide the Senate on it in circumstances when we knew we would lose, but not in circumstances in which we knew that there was a possibility at the end of the day that there may be a victory for us. The opposition rewrote the rule book back in 1975. It seems that this mood strikes it every 15 or 16 years, or whatever, because it has decided to rewrite it again. Mr Williams-I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Chairman. I was prompted to rise by the reference of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to the rule book. The rule book seems to specify that the debate will be conducted on the basis that for each question before the chair on the main appropriation bill the minister in charge will speak for a period which is not specified. We have had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services exercising that privilege on the question currently before the committee. I question the right of the minister to continue to speak for an unspecified time.",56
104,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Mr Snow)On the point of order, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is entitled to speak. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services was the only listed speaker from the front bench on the government side. The minister is entitled to ed time.",59
105,Mr BEAZLEY,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Unfortunately, I think the honourable member will actually find that the minister is entitled to unlimited time after each point is made. Generally speaking, during this period he is usually engaged in a question and answer process. Admittedly, as far as this matter is concerned the opposition has eschewed that, but it does run the risk of hearing ministers at very great length in the course of committee debates. I will wind up on this point anyway, Mr Deputy Chairman, as I think I have made all the points I intended to make. The opposition rewrote the rule books in 1975. We put the rules back again. We said that we would not see that sort of situation emerge. The opposition has rewritten the rule book again. I think from this point on one would have to say it is pretty problematic whether any party will be bothering to rewrite it in the way in which it ought to be for the good of this nation.",59
106,Mr COSTELLO,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Higgins) (6.07 p.m.) Apart from anything else, the committee is actually considering the appropriations to various departments under Appropriation Bill (No 1). I know various ministers have exercised their prerogative to come in here and speak for unlimited time to try to justify what happened in question time today. All I can say is that, if they want to justify what happened in question time today, perhaps they could let question time run tomorrow. They could actually have some questions about it, and could give us some answers. I want to dwelI on the subject of appropriation and, in particular, appropriation in relation to the Department of Finance and the disturbing situation which has arisen in relation to the Australian National Audit Office and its lease of office space at the Australian Labor Party's headquarters, otherwise known as Centenary House. Many honourable members will be aware that the bizarre details behind this arrangement reveal an arrangement which will take money out of taxpayers' funds and channel them into the Labor Party. It is a deal which illustrates that in situations where there is a conflict between public interest and party interest the Labor unlimitParty puts party interest first. The Auditor-General and the office which he administers, the AustralianNational Audit Office, are independent and external to the government. In historical terms the office is responsible in a broad way to both the parliament and the executive. The Auditor-General is appointed by the Governor General which means, in effect, the government. But the Auditor-General reports to the parliament. Tharrangements by which he obtains office space and indeed the arrangements by which he is financed come through the resources of the government: in the case of office space, the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services; in relation to finance, the Department of Finance. This arrangement means that the Auditor-General and his office have to negotiate with the Department of Finance for funding when in fact the Department of Finance may be the primary focus of their audit functions. Worse is the tendency of the government to hold purse strings over the Australian National Audit Office in circumstances which I will come to eventually. Even worse is the tendency of the government, whenever it gets an audit report which it does not like, to personpayments, ally tum on the Auditor-General and attack him as if the fault in government financial management were his. It is a classic case of shooting the messenger. It happened in one of the most regrettable instances in relation to audits when the Auditor-General produced his report No. 34, The National Bankcard: Who Will Pay the Piper? I tum to the question of the Auditor-General and his office space. The Australian Property Group of the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services negotiated a lease for his office to establish premises at a building initially known only to the Auditor-General as a Lend Lease building. What he did not know was that the Australian Property Group was negotiating a lease to a building which would be owned by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Property Group negotiated that lease with the owner, which turned out to be the Australian Labor Party, on terms which included a nine per cent rent increase every year for 15 years. Comparable leases in Canberra provide for a one per cent inflation based increase over that period. The Department of Finance believes that the rental payment, a nine per cent increase every year for 15 years, is out of the ballpark, out of the grandstand, and even out of the car park as far as Canberra is concerned. It has said that in relation to commercial property it should be only one per cent per annum, therefore the Australian National Audit Office will be given an increase of only one per cent per annum in relation to rental for the duration of the lease. The result is obvious. The audit office is locked into a lease, which escalates at nine per cent per annum, but will be funded only for increased rent at one per cent per annum. As the Auditor-General has stated in hearings of the Senate estimates committee, this leaves the Auditor-General with no other choice but to reduce staff to pay the rent. He has stated that by 1996 the office will be in a totally untenable position and will be unable to carry out its functions properly. The function of scrutinising government and looking after taxpayers' money will now be run down in order that the Auditor-General can make lease which are uncommercial, to the Australian Labor Party. I do not contend that the Auditor-General has acted without fault. Clearly, he should have taken a much closer interest rather than just leaving this to the department. Maybe he should have asked some questions or maybe he should have sighted the lease and looked into it as a good auditor, one would think, might do before allowing it to be undertaken on behalf of his office. The Auditor-General has told the Senate estimates committee that he was unaware of the escalation clause in the lease agreement. That being the case, it is now clear that the Auditor-General will not be in a position to perform the critical role of scrutinising government departments and authorities because he will be debilitated by devoting the best part of his resources to the Australian Labor Party. The nine per cent increase will be going off to the Australian Labor Party and coming out of officers who should be scrutinising the Labor government in relation to where its expenditure is going. The fact is that, unless something changes in a few years, the audit function in relation to the Commonwealth of Australia will have been run down and the ALP will grow fat on the money. The Auditor-General may have been too trusting in relying, as he did, on the advice of the Australian Property Group. Those whom he relied upon for expert advice were probably less than competent, but the Australian Labor Party has been less than decent. It has succeeded in diverting millions of dollars from the Commonwealth into its own coffers. Quite often in this House we hear how it claims or feigns to stand up for the little battlers. But when it comes to operating as a capitalist, it wants to extract every ounce of blood it can get from every commercial deal it does. The ALP cures its escalating debt with public money. It is prepared to rob a public function, which is essential to the careful scrutiny of government, to protect its interests at the taxpayers' expense. Both of these issues need resolution. It is not healthy in a democracy such as Australia for the government to sit back and watch the necessary and critical functions of an independent watchdog disappear and dissipate. By the same token, it is hardly healthy in a democracy for the Department of Finance to agree to an uncommercial nine per cent rent increase for the next 15 years when it is not required by commercial considerations. There is an answer. The Australian Labor Party, if it had the decency to do so, could either merge the lease or reopen it and renegotiate it on commercial terms; it could eschew unconscionable conduct; it could elevate the public interest over cial gain; it could ensure that audit functions continued whilst it received a commercial rent; it could put into practice what we have so frequently heard lectures about: conscionable dealing by commercial considerations. The Auditor-General's office has been performing a very valuable role. That valuable role should not be brought to an end; in fact, it ought to be enhanced. That valuable role of scrutinising government departments, seeing where taxpayers' money goes, making sure that it is not wasted and protecting taxpayers against government ought to be continuing. We on this side of the chamber believe that the Auditor-General should have even greater independence. Senator Watson will introduce a private member's bill in the Senate, which will have support from the opposition, to make the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament, to free the Auditor-General from some of the constraints that currently operate on him where he is funded by, and scrutinising, the government. This has been recommended for many years. It came out of a report from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts called The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and the Parliament. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has not seen fit to take any action on it over the last four years. We on this side of the chamber believe that some action should be taken and Senator Watson will be introducing that bill to ensure that the Auditor General's independent statutory function is protected. The Minister for Finance is fiddling, audits are burning and the Labor Party is profiting. This situation stinks. It is a testament to government incompetence and political greed. But there is a solution. The solution lies fairly and squarely in the hands of the Labor Party. It is easily fixed. All it takes is a bit of honour-the honour to open up that lease and renegotiate it, the honour to say, 'We will not rob taxpayers' funds and run down scrutiny of government. We will put public interest in front of private interest and unconscionable dealing'. A bit of honour from the Labor Party could solve this problem. I trust that a bit of honour will not be too hard to find private finaneven at this late stage.",59
107,Mr NUGENT,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I want to talk about some matters relating to my shadow portfolio of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, which comes under the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and particularly about ATSIC and the $1.3 billion worth of appropriations. It is interesting that at the last election the coalition had a very comprehensive policy on the structure of ATSIC. It is interesting to note that since that election much of the policy that we took to the people in March has been legislated in this place because, to its credit, the government recognised the worth of that policy and introduced it as legislation. Despite the coalition's initial resistance to the formation of ATSIC some time ago, in the last three years I think there has been very considerable bipartisan support for ATSIC in this place. That support is based on the view that, whatever we have been doing as a nation in the past in respect of indigenous affairs, clearly it failed by whatever measure or yardstick we want to talk about. Throwing money at the Aboriginal problems and ignoring the cultural differences or the lack of skills and experience to administer some of those resources in the Aboriginal community were certainly not having a sufficient positive effect. We believe that the best thing for human dignity and a meaningful life is, wherever possible, independent effort and self-reliance. This should be the aim in Aboriginal affairs, the same as in any other area of endeavour. I believe that is compatible with the basis of ATSIC's existence, which is a continuing devolution of responsibility and decision making to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In the last three years we have been committed to a bipartisan-in fact, a cross-partyapproach. However, this does not mean that we as an opposition can forget our role to try to keep the government honest. We have questioned and, when appropriate, will continue to question whether ATSIC is achieving what it was set up to do. I want to issue a word of warning to some who seek headlines around the country with the more strident and publicity seeking sensationalist comments. It is important that we all recognise that it is no use trying to assess the effectiveness of long-term programs in a short time frameafter all, ATSIC is in its infancy. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 1989 was only proclaimed on 7 February 1990 and ATSIC commenced operations on 5 March 1990-just 3'12 years ago. It is perhaps instructive to look at performance indicators in areas such as housing, education and health today which often reflect decades of indifference, poor policy decisions and downright neglect over a long period of time. Can we truly therefore lay the blame for those poor outcomes at the doorstep of an organisation which has been in existence for only 3'/2 years? ATSIC's statement of purpose at its inception stated: ATSIC will work towards the achievement, in the longer term, of a situation of justice and equity where Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders sufficient economic and social status to enjoy fundamental civil, social and economic rights. For example, we could hardly look at the past three years educational achievement statistics to assess the effectiveness of a preschool program which has been running for only three years. We cannot yet assess the benefits of infrastructure such as the provision of water and sewerage in a particular community in a short time frame to see what benefits it will have. About two years ago I visited the community of Woorabinda in Queensland which was in a shocking condition. I went back there a couple of months ago. In the meantime, the community had installed sewerage works, sealed the roads and made a number of other infrastructure changes. Visibly, there was not a lot of change but, clearly, by putting in that infrastructure that community will be in a position to actually advance quite rapidly from now on. So we must have realistic time scales. People from either the Aboriginal or the wider community who expect miracles are being very unrealistic. The spotlight has been on ATSIC in recent months and ATSIC· seems somewhat ultra sensitive to this. I have to tell the commission that it should not be, so long as the criticisms are constructive, realistic and made with some understanding and appreciation of ·the problems involved. In the three years since I have been ,in this place the statement that I have heard frequently is that Aboriginal organisations are the most audited in the country. I do not believe that is necessarily true. Perhaps we should ask the Australian Taxation Office about the activities of a certain lady senator! The point is that any government department administering taxpayer money must expect to be called to account for its actions. The true measure of independence sought by Aboriginal communities surely is that one must be prepared to be answerable for one's decisions. Whilst recognising that we cannot expect ATSIC to perform miracles overnight, the questions I would ask are these: where are the public and easily understood performance benchmarks? What are ATSIC's priorities? I have have mentioned its statement of purpose-and it is a very generalised statement-but I ask: what actual and detailed targets have been set for achieving this? ' I suggest that one important performance area would be housing. For example, according to Industry Commission estimates it costs $150,000 to build a standard three-bedroom house in remote areas of the Northern Territory. I was in Maningrida, a little community on the northern shores of the Northern Territory, two or three months ago. That community consists of 1,159 people, not counting the out-stations, 42 per cent of whom are aged under 14 and only four per cent of whom are aged over 50. There are 300 family units, with up to 38 people in a single house. There is no accommodation at all for single men. Just imagine the pressures. Including the people in the public gallery, there are probably 15 or 16 people in this chamber at the moment. We are talking about more than double this number of people living in one three-bedroom house with one toilet and one shower in a hot climate-young families, kids trying to do homework, older parents, screaming babies and all the pressures that go with that. Those issues are very important and should be dealt with. In that community, if one takes out the substandard accommodation, the average is 9.8 people to a single bedroom. If we were to build a standard dwelling for each family unit in that community it would cost $45 million in construction costs alone, and that story can be paralleled right around Australia. The 1991 census showed that 67 per cent of the general Australian population own their own home-the figure for the Aboriginal community is only 28 per cent. It was stated in the government publication entitled Social justice for indigenous Australians 1993-94 that a housing needs survey in 1987 indicated: ... 16,000 additional dwellings were required meet the needs of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders living in substandard and overcrowded conditions. Just meeting that backlog alone would cost something in excess of $2 billion. There are other issues concerning the appropriateness of housing; the larger number of extended families in the Aboriginal community; the fact that there are more lone parent families in the Aboriginal population compared with the general Australian population; and more multi-family households-eight per cent in the indigenous population compared with one per cent in the rest of the community. The Industry Commission report on public housing said: Given the expected increase in both the population and the number of ATSI households, it is very unlikely that the level of funds provided will ever meet all the housing needs. That is a pretty daunting statement. So in that climate, when we spend our dollar in the Aboriginal community, what should we be spending it on? I ask ATSIC, in its selfdetermining role, - o ensure that the expenditure of every dollar achieves the maximum long-term efficiency and effectiveness. How much of that administration and how many conferences are really essential? When it comes to funding some of the legal activities that have been going on for clearly political purposes, I have to ask: why is that so important? It may be desirable, but where are the priorities? ATSIC has a fundamental issue to face: priorities on where it spends its money. Does it spend it on the nice things, the esoteric things, the desirable things or on the hard, tangible areas on the ground? I am almost out of time. Later in this debate I will seek to obtain the call again to talk about some other issues concerning not only housing .but also health and education and what I think the government needs to do about some of those things.",61
108,Unknown,ENERGY LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 8.00 p.m.,63
109,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I enter this debate in support of the amendment that has been moved with one or two things in mind. One of the reasons-not to the prime reason-that the amendment has been moved is the behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this House this afternoon. I think it will go on record as one of the more disgraceful episodes that we have seen in this new Parliament House for quite a few years. His behaviour only heightens that which I have said in this House before, that democracy in this Parliament House and this chamber is fast disappearing. Some of the conventions that we have held dear over the last 90 years of federation have slowly been watered down. One of the concerns that I have expressed in the past is the arrogance with which ministers treat this House. When they are supposed to be presenting a bill, they leave a parliamentary secretary or someone else with no relationship or without any feeling for the bill itself to attend to it. In fact, the other night the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) dealt with a matter to do with science. He was quite out of his depth. The executive power is very real in this parliament today. One wonders just what power an individual, a backbencher or a properly elected person has at this time. The Prime Minister's adage is that when the going gets tough-not that the tough get going-he gets out. Mr Rocher-He went and slithered out the door.",63
110,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Curtin is absolutely right. It is a very rude and arrogant attitude that is fast becoming the hallmark of this government. The manner in which he badmouths Australia overseas concerns me greatly. I refer particularly to the republican issue. All of the ning on the issue of the republic is done overseas, as is his criticism of our flag. We have to wonder what international people think or believe of Australia when the Prime Minister, in the position in which he was elected to this place, does not have the decenacclaim cy to support Australia, as he should. I deal with the republican matter fairly squarely by referring to the lack of equity justice in the appropriation for the Republic Advisory Committee on constitutional reform. I understand that it has probably already been funded to the extent of under $1 million. Mr Hicks-Shame!",64
111,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"It is a shame because this budget provides for another $600,000 in 1993-94 and a further $200,000 per year until 1996. I think that is arrogance at its worse. We have not had a decision made by the people of Australia. This parliament has been elected under the constitution which has been with us since 1901. It is to all intents and purposes a democratic constitution. Fairness would indicate that the organisation Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy should be favoured with at least an equal amount of money in order to put the alternative viewpoint. At the moment in Australia we have the spectacle of one of the major newspapers carrying an advertisement for designs for the new flag. I suggest that anybody who looked at that advertisement in the Australian last weekend should take it out, draw a picture of the current Australian flag on it and send it back to the originators. I say that with a purpose. Much has been made in the last two weeks about the win by Sydney of the Olympic games in the year 2000. I suggest to this chamber and the people of Australia that that bid was won because Australia is recognised throughout the world by its flag, its constitution and its known link with the monarchy. Anybody who now suggests that there is a reason to change when we have been so successful under the monarchy I believe is throwing the beliefs of the majority of Australians back in their faces. Another matter I refer to are the recent 75th anniversary celebrations of the occasion on which Australians defended the Somme at run- Villers-Bretonneux and also Bullecourt-an area that is known for its very good relationships with Australia. I was there just two years ago and the Australian flag is proudly shown within the shire chambers of the local council and the school is prepared to always the generosity of Australians. For the Prime Minister to have used that occasion as and a negotiating tool against the French by and denigrating the efforts of those people who were there at that time, who fought under the flag and fought for Australia was uncalled for. I believe that in another circumstance and another place that would have been quite appropriate. My father fought at Villers-Bretonneux, Bullecourt, Pozieres and right along the Somme. My uncle was killed in Flanders and is buried near Ypres. I believe those Australians who fought in that war fought for the flag and for a principle. That principle is now being put into second place. This government has no mandate to change the flag or the constitution. I think it is quite inappropriate for the Republic Advisory Committee to be allocated the amount that it has. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is the only honourable member on the government side prepared to stick by the principles of what the monarchy means to Australia, what that monarchy means as to the democratic rights of all Australians and what he believes is the part that Great Britain played in our history. This country goes from one crisis to another regarding our debt, this budget outcome and our competitiveness. Talking in terms of such irrelevancies indicates that our priorities are not correct. I call these matters irrelevancies because the majority of Australians want the monarchy to continue. Certainly the impression I get from my electorate is that under no circumstances should the flag be changed. The Department of the Treasury is thinking of putting out a new $10 note. That is not too bad, I do not mind what changes the department makes, but I know that a lot of my constituents have been concerned about the $5 note. It may be that a new $10 note will only have the value of a $5 note of two or three years ago. The tnatter that I find a little concerning is that the new $10 note will be the same length as the $5 note issued last year but will be 7 millimetres longer to help people who have problems with their sight to recognise the new note. The new $10 note, like the $5 note, will be made of polymer, which is a type of plastic. There was an adverse reaction to the $5 note. There are people who cannot handle it, particularly the aged. Mr Nehl-Nobody wants it.",64
112,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Cowper is absolutely right, nobody wants it. For goodness sake, if the government cannot get anything else right with this economy, let us not change that $10 note and replace it with a note similar to the $5 note. I would like to talk about the fallacy in this place of calling bills deficit reduction bills. The main concern out there in Australia is not about the republic or the monarchy; it is about the fact that our national debt, as the Auditor-General disclosed, is escalating beyond our ability to repay it. Our national debt, including our foreign debt, is now the highest per capita of any country throughout the world-Somalia, Ethiopia, or anywhere. I think it is a nonsense to describe these bills as deficit reduction bills, especially when they are not reducing the deficit and particularly in a situation where they should be. The budget should be addressed in a real and meaningful way.",65
113,The CHAIRMAN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,I call the honourable member for Watson. Perhaps he might shift back one seat.,65
114,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Watson) (8.10 p.m.)The Chairman is absolutely correct; I was just trying to get closer to you, Mr Jenkins, and that is what led me astray for a moment. I was hoping to get a little closer to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), because a lot of the things that he was saying were so difficult to comprehend that one had to move a little further down the chamber to understand where, he was coming from. The committee has before it Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94, which deals with appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Treasury and the Advance to the Minister for Finance. We would not know that, of course, from listening to most of the input from the opposition. We had earlier this afternoon, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) so succinctly said, a stunt move by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). To get his own point of view across, he used the mechanism of proposing that we reduce the appropriation to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet by $10. He then went on a rather lengthy dissertation of the terrible things that have happened in this chamber since the election. I suppose (everything that has happened since the election has been pretty terrible for the honourable member for Bennelong. He did not get to be Leader of the Opposition again; he did not get to be a minister in a Hewson government-thot\-h that probably would have been as galling for him as the position he is in now. He and all his colleagues are rather unhappy that the Australian people chose us and not them, which I think shows a remarkable amount of sense on the part of the Australian people. In parts of this debate the opposition has expressed some real fear about what is going to happen with the republican issue, what is going to happen with the flag, what is going to happen tomorrow at question time. I think government members could say to the opposition that, since the election, the government has been involved in a number of issues which are of great importance to Australians, and the appropriation for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has assisted the government in some of these endeavours. The support that PM&C has given to the Mabo issue, for instance, is one instance where the government can rightly say that it is doing something to address an issue that has been of concern to all Australians for many years. I think that all of us, as Australians, need to be able to come to terms with the Aboriginal community, and all of us, as Australians, will not be able to go into the 21st century unless we successfully do that. The Mabo process, which has been supported by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, has been a mechanism for us to address, as Australians of European descent, our having to come to terms with those people who have lived in this country for many thousands of years before us. Of course, that is something that the opposiRepublic tion does not really want us to address. We have some people on the opposition side who genuinely and sincerely want to see this process come to fruition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) is sincere in wanting to see an outcome, but he has not been able to influence many of his colleagues at all. The redneck approach of the National Party was to dig things up, run over people and, whatever·the mining and agricultural industries want, they should get. We have seen in the papers that have been prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet another view on this. That other view which has been put forward in many of those papers, and which this appropriation supports, is one that ensures we take a balanced view. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) was just about to get up and take a point of order on me. He will do anything to cut off someone having a debate on something sensible: because he wants to move down the front and maybe get a little closer to the action-he is not going to get any closer to the action than where he was years ago-and have a shot at the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), which is what the amendment of the honourable member for Bennelong proposes here. The honourable member for Mitchell and some of his colleagues need to understand that all this chiacking, all these slick attempts and all these sillinesses do not disguise the fact that this proposal put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong is the nonsense that it is. It is a shot by a person who may have gone on to great things in this country but, in recent years, has just become more and more irrelevant. I did not think I would ever see the honourable member for Bennelong-who is a member of parliament I used to have a lot of respect for-come in here and push his colleague aside at the beginning of drive time, as he did this afternoon, so he could put forward this silly proposition. I did not think that my good friend from the National Party would have been supporting him in the way he did, but the point is that the money ·being appropriated here for the Advisory Committee will be money well spent. Surely one thing that we can do in this country in the run-up to the tum of the century is talk about and think about what we are as Australians and where we are going as Australians. A healthy debate on something such as that is useful. It is not something about which we should get up and say, 'It is a disgrace that the government is appropriating for that'. All of us, I would have thought, should say, 'Anything that is a catalyst for this sort of consideration is something that we, as members of parliament, should support'. The canard has been brought in here again that there is money in these appropriations for new flags and things such as that. What is that wrong with Australians, in the run-up to the tum of the century, considering whether the flag we have is appropriate or not? That is not something that we should try to generate a lot of fear and loathing in the community about. It is something that we, as an educated sensible people, should be able to talk about. It is something that we should be able to have some discussion on and, if people decide that that is what they want, it is something we, as members of parliament, should legislate for. I have heard a lot of talk from members of the opposition that somehow or other the flag that we have now is sacred. Not too many of them were here only a few short years ago when we legislated for that flag. Until then there were a number of flags people could have flown from their house, ship or whatever if they were Australian. They were red, they were blue and they were white. But Malcolm Fraser decided-not the people of Australia that the Australian blue ensign would be the flag. He did not have widespread consultation. He did not go out and talk to the country. He came in here and proposed a bill. Those in the merchant navy had a new flag, because that is what the merchant navy had after that-a new flag. But there were no catcalls from this side and there was not any outrage in the community, because that was what was decided. Mr Braithwaite-What about World War II?",65
115,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"We have this stupid interjection from the other side: what about World War II? Most of the Australian troops did not fight under the Australian flag. They did not fight under the blue ensign in World War II, so those opposite are creating these myths as we go along. I think it is healthy that we should have some debate about the republic, the flag and Mabo, because these three things help us to find what we are as Australians, where we want to be, and where we want to see our country by the turn of the century. I commend to the chamber the appropriation for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for the work that that department is doing in that process. I suggest to those opposite that they should forget the stupidity of the amendment of the honourable member for Bennelong and, indeed, should even forget the stupidity of the proposition put forward by Deputy Leader of the Opposition where he foreshadows the constitutional vandalism that the opposition is going to get up to in the Senate. The problem the opposition has is that it has run out of ideas. The opposition in the House of Representatives has lost control of the process within its own party and it has lost the plot. (1ime expired)",67
116,Mr MACKELLAR,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I listened with interest to the contribution-if one can call it that-from the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). It was as confused as his attempt to rise to speak from the wrong place in this chamber. It is a symptom, I think, of the state of the government at the present time that its members have difficulty knowing where they should be sitting or where they should be speaking from. Listening to the honourable member's contribution, one can only say that there were a couple of useful points. He said that healthy debate is useful; I agree with that absolutely and completely. We have been endeavouring to have healthy debate in this parliament for some time. The only problem is that the government has stifled that healthy debate at every opportunity. One of the things we saw today was the Prime Minister. (Mr Keating), who prides himself on his toughness and his capacity to both give it out and take it, walking away, hiding from the parliament of this nation, the parliament of the people, the House that he suggests should have control of everything that goes on in the nation, rather than those people whom he would call unrepresentative swill in the Senate. I must remind the honourable member for Watson that the heat came on only some 10 minutes into the Prime Minister's answer to a question when I the answer he was giving bore no relation whatsoever to the question he was asked and the House became unruly. This became too much for the Prime Minister and he walked away, revealing absolutely clearly not only to members of the Australian public but also to members of his own party that he truly does have a glass jaw. There is nothing wrong with the Australian the people considering a new flag; I agree with the honourable member for Watson when he says that. But the Australian people ought to have the opportunity of making a decision as to whether they wish to have a new flag or not. That is the argument that I get out in the electorate. Some people want a new flag, but my experience is that more people do not at this stage. What they all want is to have some role in that decision. When the decision is made, they want the present flag to be part of the choice rather than having a series of alternatives forced upon them to which they have to respond. I thought that tonight's effort from the honourable .member for Watson was a brave one considering, firstly, that he did not know where he was supposed to be sitting in the chamber and, secondly, that the government is under such very obvious strain. The parliament as a whole, both in this place and in the Senate, that other chamber, is considering what it should do with the budget-this extraordinarily unsuccessful budget-that has been brought down by the present government. There are some aspects of the present budget that I would like to draw to the attention of the chamber tonight. It has been brought to my attention that at page 44 of the 1993 Tax Pack, the taxation commissioner requires that, in relation to a deceased taxpayer: The following items must be sent to the tax office by the executor or trustee of a deceased estate: · A certified copy of any will; · A certified copy of the death certificate; · A statement of the deceased's assets and liabilities at the date of death. No such requirement appeared in the 1992 Tax Pack. I cannot recall any legislation passing through parliament over the past year that would authorise such a request. Accordingly, I set out to establish under What instruments taxpayers were being required to furnish this information. To be fair, the information officers in the tax office who were first contacted by my office in relation to this matter were, to put it kindly, not at all helpful. Rather than offering to take my inquiry on board and provide a considered reply, they brushed it aside with highly generalised comments about the tax office having the power to ask for anything if it wished. Although not specified by the tax office, I gather those officers had in mind the powers contained in section 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, but I will come back to that later. Naturally, I considered the response unacceptable and asked for assistance from the Parliamentary Library's research staff, and they gave me a very detailed response. Whilst it is not appropriate to canvass all their advice here, I will mention some of the considerations which caused them to conclude that there were real doubts as to whether the tax office was correctly authorised to ask for this information in the way it has. The Parliamentary Research Service was of the opinion that section 161 of the Income Tax Assessment Act does give authority for the taxation commissioner to request a certified copy of any will, a certified copy of a death certificate, and a balance sheet at the date of death from a person who furnishes a return of a deceased taxpayer. However, the operative word is 'request', and doubts have been expressed as to the validity of a request which appears as a boxed 'advice' in the Tax Pack. It should be noted that on page 3 of the actual tax return form a request is made for a group certificate to be furnished and attached to that form. That is considered to be a valid request. However, the request for a will, death certificate and assets-liabilities statement is not made on the return form. Instead, it is made at page 44 of the 1993 Tax Pack. Such a request does not, in the opinion of my advisers, constitute a request which can be regarded as being part of the return form. Rather, it is presented in a manner which might well cause it to be overlooked by some people as just another one of the more than 30 boxed pieces of information and 15 advertisements in the Tax Pack. I think it is appropriate at this point to raise the matter of section 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The key words are: The Commissioner may by notice in writing require any person, whether a taxpayer or not ... to furnish him with such Information as he may require; That is the provision which I referred to previously as being the authority cited by the officers at the tax office inquiry desk to justify the page 44 Tax Pack request. Some people have said to me that there is doubt as to whether the Tax Pack advice is sufficient to meet the legislated requirements that requests for information must be made by notice in writing. I think that when we look at it there is a great deal of validity to that opinion. I add, too, that I cannot remember any legislation going through this parliament in recent times which would justify that inclusion this last year in the Tax Pack when it was not included before. I am not encouraging people not to furnish a will or a death certificate or assets-liabilities statement deceased taxpayer. Rather, I am concerned that there appears to be some informed doubt as to whether the tax commissioner is technically correct in seeking this type of information as a boxed request amongst-I remind honourable members-95 pages of Tax Pack information. One can imagine that there may be some people in our community who genuinely overlook the page 44 request. What will be the commissioner's attitude to such people? Will they be treated as felons or will the commissioner acknowledge the unsatisfactory nature of his request and follow up with a formal section 264 request in writing for this information? We have to remember that the tax office in recent times has gained a reputation for what could be described as uncompromising tenacity towards anything that hints at a taxation liability. The government is so skint for revenue that the tax office has been given the task, quite deliberately, of going out and getting every last cent. That page 44 request-page 44 out of 95-is an instance where such an attitude, I believe, would be totally misplaced. I trust that the tax commissioner, in following up his duties, will not seek to convict or to take punitive action against people who, quite understandably, could overlook that boxed request on page 44 of the 95 pages of Tax Pack. It seems to me a very strange inclusion at this stage when it has not been included before. It is characteristic of the lax way in which this government makes its requests known to the people of Australia. I hope that the tax commissioner will treat people who may have overlooked this boxed request with some leniency.",67
117,Mr CADMAN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"In speaking on the amendment to Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94 presently before us, there are some general comments I wish to make. For those Australians who look for leadership from their government, this government is undermining confidence in the future. Everything upon which they have come to rely is constantly under threat of change or extinction. The government, which exhibits a for a hypocritical attitude, is led by a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with the same attitude. Today, the Republic Advisory Committee, a chosen but unrepresentative, publicly funded group, reported to the government its recommendations for the way in which Australia could become a republic. The Australian public has been treated with disdain in this process. The Republic Advisory CQmmittee is basically and almost completely comprised of people in favour of changing our current system of a democratic constitutional monarchy to that of a republic. Last year the government used $55,000 of public money to fund this group, while in the financial year just past it spent $551,000. For the coming year, $200,000 has been set aside for constitutional reform, making a total of $805,000 of public money being used by the government to push one of the Prime Minister's pet barrows. If that is not hypocritical, nothing is. I draw the attention of the chamber to a statement made by the Prime Minister in this place on 28 September this year. He reporte(d: I said publicly in London that it is not because our affections for Britain are reduced or the friendship between us frailer, or our respect and admiration for the institutions Britain has bequeathed us in any way diminished, that Australia is considering the option of becoming a republic. Having listed all the reasons on which he has not based his push for becoming a republiccarefully pointing out that we have no particular gripe with the British people-the Prime Minister then moved across the waterways to Ireland and said that it was because he is a Catholic that we will become a republic. Whichever way one looks at his arguments, it was a display of sheer cynicism and hypocrisy. Divisiveness is reaching heights that 1I have not seen in Australian political life before. 1 would like to read to the chamber the definition of 'bigotry' in the Macquarie Dictionary. It says: . . . intolerant attachment to a particular creed, opinion or practice. I am not calling the Prime Minister a bigot, but I believe that he encourages bigotry in others through his statements. He says of himself, 'I am pure; I only have the interests of Australia at heart', but he draws on all sorts of arguments set to create conflict, differences and problems between groups in our community. 1 thought such things had long vanished and long been dead. No-one could regard his statement in the House as anything but a contemplated statement and one encouraging bigotry. While 1 do not believe that he is a bigot, he encourages bigotry. While the Prime Minister has said that he has not given the command to go full speed ahead on the issue of a republic, and while he has said that he would not introduce a republic contrary to the wishes of the Australian people, on the same date, 28 September, he said: I said the Australian government's view was that . . . it would be appropriate for Australia to become a republic by the centenary of federation in the year 2001. The Prime Minister has an agenda-he has a set agenda. It is no good his saying that he will draw back, sit on his hands and stay out of the debate. 1 refer the chamber to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald dated 4 October where the Prime Minister found that things were not running well for him in opinion polls. After telling England, Ireland, France and every other nation how important it was for Australia to become a republic, he returned to Australia to find that he was not doing so well in the opinion polls. Having made that statement in the House on 28 September, a statement indicating that there was an agenda set down by his government to have a republic by the year 2001, only five days later the Sydney Morning Herald reported: Mr Keating wants to take some of the political heat out of the debate by emphasising that the issue is one for the people to decide and that the Government has no intention of imposing its view or its timetable. The government has a timetable. The government is determined to set the pace to the year 2000 or 2001, according to whichever report one happens to be reading. Opinion poIls showed that the government was on unsteady ground, so the Prime Minister quickly manipulated the system to suit himself. The methods employed by the Prime Minister and his government are like something we would read in The Prince. The way the government does things is black, dark, and machiavellian. The Prime Minister shows that his government is prepared to manipulate people and attitudes. He only has to press the right button to divert public attention from the main game-from unemployment, the budget and all the other important things that are burning Australians up. The public is really not that concerned about the issues the Prime Minister is raising, but he tries to create a split and a difference between people-a split and a difference that is not there until provoked-in order to divert attention from the main issues. In answer to a question on the Mabo issue on 31 August, he said: The Government has developed a piece of what I hope will be landmark legislation. I am certain that it is superior to any Aboriginal land law in this country and something which this government will be very proud of. Since that date, the Prime Minister has been changing his tune almost every day. From every interview it is possible to discern that the legislation he talks about now is not the same legislation about which he was speaking on 31 August, but some revised version that has come about after he has spoken to John Fahey, Richard Court or some other premier. He shows no consistency, but is prepared to manipulate not only mainstream Australians but also Catholic Australians, black Australians, or any Australian in a group that he can identify. The Prime Minister has been backtracking ever since his initial announcements on Mabo legislation. I draw the attention of the chamber to other statements he has made. On 30 August, he said: The Government's position in respect of the High Court's historic decision is that it will do necessary to award and protect native title in this country. Aboriginal groups have been most concerned that there was a rolling back of the discrimination act. There was no hint of that in the earlier statements. It is no wonder that people like Martin Ferguson have said that it is 'impossible to defend the indefensible', and that Michael Easson called the budget an 'act of bastardry'. The extent of the Prime Minister's capacity to manipulate the community has soured even his truest believers. Whether it was the honourable member for Barton (Mf Punch) or the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay)-there is a whole bunch of themStephen Loosely, the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), the honourable member for Perth (Mr Smith), the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), or the honourable member for BartonMrs Crosio-What are you reading from?",69
118,Mr CADMAN,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I am reading from a newspaper article. These people complained to the Prime Minister in the strongest terms about the way in which the Australian community had been treated. Of course, the Prime Minister said that that was just the whingeing of people who were losers. As one newspaper reported: PM crushes sour grapes backbench. The Prime Minister has had the flag on and off the agenda. The issue was raised in the House, and the Prime Minister let it run. Nobody seems to know where this character is leading us. The Prime Minister has made instability a fundamental of Australian life. It does not matter whether it is the flag, nationhood, security of land tenure-all the things that Australians thought they could count on-it is under threat. That is an illustration of the Prime Minister's character and of the processes he employs in government. He causes division and disunity, especially within mutually opposed groups. It does not matter whether it is the republican debate, Mabo, the budget or the flags issue, the government and the Prime Minister constantly what is are creating problems between members of the community, problems that none of them want a bar of. They want to get on with their lives, earn a living and put their kids through school and university without the manipulative and crass process adopted by the Prime Minister.",71
119,Mr ROCHER,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I am prompted to speak in this debate by a rambling and somewhat incoherent contribution by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) earlier this evening. The honourable member took advantage of the standing orders to speak for an unlimited time at the committee stage in what was-as I have already described-a strange, if not incoherent defence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). To contemplate the honourable member defending anyone, let alone his Prime Minister, leads me to observe, 'God help us'. God help us if the honourable member for Calwell is defending someone and taking advantage of the standing orders. Whilst I laughed at the time, on further reflection I felt that many of the things he touched upon should not go without comment. He decided, by some twist of logic, that the real issue in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the blocking of the budget. We have only to read the amendment to question that conclusion. I will say, for the sake of the committee and for the information of the honourable rr(ember, that we are not talking about blocking the bUdget. Appropriation Bill (No.1) is under discussion. This committee is considering several elements of it. It is true that the budget announced certain taxation measures which cannot be dealt with in the appropriation bill. We do not have any serious intent of blocking it yet the Prime Minister, with inane defence by many on the other side, is repeating Goebbels-like the contention that somehow we are about blocking the appropriation bill. We are about nothing of the sort. The appropriation bill largely deals with expenditure. We have some very real criticisms of what is included, particularly in this section that deals with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Treasury, and including the Advance to the Minister for Finance and-a new one to me-Provision for Running Costs Borrowings. We will payout to the government to the extent that we think it deserves. We have no intention of defeating the appropriation bill. The lie is repeated time and again. To some extent, it is permeating. Only the Prime Minister, with his influence in the press gallery, could possibly get away with it. We are talking about an appropriation bill, with accompanying legislation, which is misnamed to indicate that there is some intention to reduce our deficit up to 1996-97. That is like the old straw man technique. Those opposite have created a huge deficit and now they are saying they have to do all these marvellous things to get it down, hoping-to some extent successfully-that the rest of the community will forget how we got into that mess in the first place. Dr Kemp-Their first step was to put it up. ' Mr ROCHER-Yes, they did-this very year. Many of my colleagues, including the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) who has just contributed to the debate, have made that point in other debates. That is the sort of nonsense we have got into. The other point I want to make is one touched on by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) earlier this evening. I mean no disrespect to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table, but we are discussing appropriations for the departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Finance and Treasury-and other appropriations. Yet there is not present a minister who is responsible for any of those departments. I do not know what the honourable member's connection might be with those departments or ministries but I suspect, London to a brick, that she is not in a position to answer or make judgments which are rightly the province of the relevant ministers. She might angle for becoming the minister for running costs borrowings-it is the only item on the list for which we do not have a minister. There is an opportunity-she should get her faction, get in there and get the big white car along with the rest. I put it seriously that this is not the only occasion. It happens at the second reading stage as often as it happens at the committee stage. I will not go into a litany of what the committee is supposed to be all about; that is, discussing, criticising and seeking information on the legislation. The truth is we do not get it, half the time because there is a guillotine and we do not get to the committee stage. But that is another story. I could not but be amazed at the honourable a bit member for Calwell mounting a defence of his stressed out Prime Minister. This is the Prime Minister who only a few years ago was seriously touted as considering the Paris option-I think it was called-when his predecessor allegedly did not honour a deal he had made in the presence of Sir Peter Abeles and Bill Kelty at Kirribilli, to hand on the prime ministership to our precious Prime Minister. The only Paris option left for the Prime Minister now is winding back speedos in a used car yard in suburban Paris. That is the only job he will get in Paris these days. We have crazies defending a Prime Minister who has lost all credibility and who has nearly lost, not his marbles but his self-control. In the ramblings we hear-the Prime Minister is paramount among them-it is said that something awful is happening in the state of Denmark because the Senate should insist, as it is entitled to, under section 53 of the constitution: Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. We know that section 53 deals with certain taxation matters. If they are not in the categories spelt out in the constitution, of course the Senate can contest, amend and deal with them in any way which is normal for this parliament. There is no basis for suggestions that a convention, as claimed by our stressed out Prime Minister, can modify or override the terms of a written constitution-and that is what we have. For him to canvass the falsehood that somehow what the Senate might have in mind is breaking a convention, is a load of codswallop-it should be recognised as such. It was only as recently as 1970 that the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gough WhitIam, not only wanted to stop some budget measures, but also claimed that the then opposition was out to destroy the coalition government's budget-and the government. Yet our stressed out Prime Minister is waxing eloquent about breaking some convention. I inform the chamber that the very first appropriation bill after Federation was referred back to this chamber by the Senate three times. That is some convention. In the years from 1951 to 1982, the Labor Party in opposition opposed budget legisla.tion on at least· 13 occasions-and that is after the Second World War. Our stressed-out Prime Minister is carrying on like a nit in a fit. 1967 Senator Lionel Murphy, the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, representing the Labor Party, talked about legislation. He discussed his reasons for doing so and concluded by calling on the Senate to reject the legislation. Let us not have any more of this nonsense. Let us not have any more of this utter rubbish from our stressed-out Prime Minister. (Time expired)",71
120,Mr NUGENT,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I spoke earlier in this debate under the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I said specifically that we need to recognise that it will take some time to address many of the issues that are relevant in the Aboriginal community. I said that ATSIC needs to take great care when it is deciding its priorities between those things that are desirable and those things that are essential. I started to talk about some of the housing issues. I referred to places like Maningrida, where there was an average occupancy rate of 9.8 people per bedroom, and to the costs of fixing up some of the quite appalling housing conditions in the Aboriginal community. I want to continue on that particular track, because I think the government needs to do a lot more to address some of these issues. It is not just a question of finding money; it is a question of how that money is being applied in a tangible way and in on the-ground programs. A recent Industry Commission report on housing was quite damning. While recognising that not all problems identified were related to ATSIC, it said specifically: At government level there is no clear demarcation of responsibility. This contributes to confusion and duplication of services. The poor delivery of services is exacerbated by the on-going dispute between local governments and communities over the payment of rates. Whilst recognising that negotiations have begun between the Commonwealth and states to enter into bilateral agreements to increase efficiency, it was the view of the Industry Commission that those arrangements whilst being helpful were unlikely to 'substantially improve funding and administrative arrangements'. The commission is saying that, In although talks are going on to improve the system, it really will not make any significant difference. It called for basic changes to enhance transparency and accountability in programs which presently suffer from conflicting objectives and a lack of clarity about which level of government is responsible for what. I agree with most of that, but I do not lay that responsibility at the door of ATSIC. It is the government's responsibility. I think sometimes, unfortunately for ATSIC, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs e Mr Tickner) is all too J;eady to do his Pontius Pilate act, stand back and say that it is up to ATSIC so he will push the matter in its direction. He should be dealing with issues that are far bigger than ATSIC, because often interdepartmental and intergovernmental activities are involved. I also want to talk a bit about the health situation in the Aboriginal community, because it seems to me that it is one of the major areas where, as a nation, we are failing to come to grips with issues that are relevant. It is a very. visible area in terms of service and demand; it is actually quite well researched, and there is quite a lot of statistical data. In the papers presented with the budget this year, all the health statistics were left out. A phrase states something along the lines that the government is still doing work and it will publish them later on. The picture is not good. A recent report that I have seen on maternal deaths in Australia between 1988 and 1990 shows that direct deaths amongst Aboriginal women during this period were the highest that they have been since 1972. In other words, they are the highest in 20 years. The incidence of maternal death for Aboriginal women through pregnancy and childbirth is eight times higher than for non-Aboriginal women. A couple of months ago at a tropical diseases conference in Darwin, Dr Christine Phillips highlighted research from central Australia in which 374 Aboriginal people with diagnosed diabetes were monitored between 1984 and 1991. During that seven-year period, 130 of them60 men and 70 women-died. A total of 130 out of 374 Aboriginals died. Diabetes mellitus, which is not insulin dependent, is between two and five times more prevalent amongst Aborigines than amongst other Australians. One health worker has estimated that on anyone day 50 per cent of Aboriginal children in a classroom may have a hearing impairment due to middle ear infection. That is not just a health problem; it also augurs badly for their educational prospects because they will not be in a fit condition to learn. A report by Professor John Mathews, the Director of the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, told the same conference that nearly all rural Aboriginal infants at six weeks of age were permanently infected with harmful bacteria. He has more recently made the point: We know that chronic bronchitis and damaged lungs in later life are a sequel to childhood infections that aren't treated properly. These bacterial infections undermine a person's health later in Death rates from pneumonia in people with damaged lungs are very high in middle age and that is probably a consequence of what's happened in childhood. Sadly, Professor Mathew's comments mean that the consequences for today's six-weekold rural Aboriginal infant who is permanently infected with harmful bacteria will be realised in his or her middle age. Frankly, I think this is a national disgrace and it requires a national effort to combat it. It will take time, but the government needs to take that action now. If ATSIC does not have the expertise, then the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) should take control of the situation. I recently visited a number of health centres in the Pitjantjatjara land in South Australia. The standard of basic cleanliness-the infestation with mice and goodness knows what else, where doctors stood there not batting an eyelid-was quite appalling. I am not trying to sensationalise it. I am shocked and disgusted, as I think any decent person would be, that we are actually running health centres such as those in this country in 1993. It seems to me that the government has to take more positive action to deal with those issues. I will not go on with a lot more statistics, but we have to look at where we have been successful; we have to look critically at where we have failed; and we have to decide what we need to do to try to lift our game. We cannot just worry about bureaucratic sensitivities. We must take an honest look at ourselves and make every attempt to get close to what is working and what is not. We must recognise that this problem is not something which can be fixed overnight. We must have a realistic, tangible set of benchmarks by which to measure our progress. A series of smaller, shorter-term targets rather than an amorphous long-term target might be a better way to go. We have to be much more tangible about this issue. We have to look at things like cultural requirements in the programs that we put in place. We have to look at the importance of involving the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders-the people at the coalface. Perhaps we ought to look at the example of life. people like the late Fred Hollows who came up with a very specific, targeted program to achieve a specific purpose. If trachoma can be taken head on, surely we can do something about the pennanently infected six-week-old Aboriginal babies and detennine the most appropriate mechanism-both culturally and medically-which will enable us perhaps in a five-year time frame to be able to announce a vast improvement in these dreadful statistics that we are all aware of. I ask the government: where is the program for AIDS? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) some months ago came up with an itemised, non-expensive, lO-point plan that could make a significant impact on the potential damage that AIDS might do in the Aboriginal community. We. have had no reaction from the government at all. A lot of work needs to be done. Frankly, it is not enough for the government to set up a structure such as ATSIC, give it funding, and then say that it believes in self-detennination so ATSIC should deal with the problem. The federal government must deal with the states and local government as weil as ATSIC. The federal government must judge when extra resources are needed. The government must take some responsibility for the wider issues involved. I have never doubted the good intents of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in these matters. Sharp, J. R. I worry about the effectiveness of some of the things that he is doing. Regrettably, if he is wrong in what he is doing, the indigenous people of this country will suffer yet again. It seems to me that we have to take the view that ATSIC is not beyond criticism. It should not be too sensitive. We have to make some hard decisions about where we place the money between those issues that are desirable and those that are essential. Rather than spending millions of dollars on conferences, administration or amorphous subjects, we need to be looking at short-tenn practical measures. I urge the government to reexamine the way it spends the money being allocated in this appropriation for the benefit of the indigenous people of this country.

121,Mr WILLIAMS,NOES,"Tangney) (9.11 p.m.)Potentially one of the most divisive, and certainly one of the most poorly handled, issues this country has faced in recent times, the response of the Commonwealth government to the Mabo decision, is dealt with in the vaguest tenns in this year's proposed budget. This probably reflects the government's inability to reach a satisfactory resolution of the decision. It is appropriate that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) have a close involvement in the resolution of the decision, but this is not reflected in the Attorney-General's portfolio program perfonnance statements. In fact, it is hard to find references to Mabo anywhere in the budget. It does appear in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's statements. Provision is made there for expenditure of $0.1 million for an interdepartmental committee to investigate the decision. An unexplained additional item provides a further $0.1 million for 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait NOES Islander strategic initiatives'. Combining both these amounts appears to provide quite inadequately for expenditure already incurred in respect of the IDC. The fact that the Attorney-General's Department statements do not clearly provide for Mabo may reflect the fact that no specific allocation of future responsibility for administration of Mabo matters appears to have been made. The Attorney-General has important responsibilities having regard to the issues raised, particularly constitutional and those relating to the exercise of judicial power. As an example, the government proposes the establishment of a national native title tribunal PAIRS which, if established pursuant to the proposals, would exercise Commonwealth judicial power. I say nothing at this stage of the merits or otherwise of the proposal but it is a tribunal which, if it were established, should be provided for in the Attorney-General's program perfonnance statements, and there are no allocations. The statements indicate that the Office of General Counsel within the department had an extensive role in developing the Commonwealth response to the Mabo decision and in the Commonwealth's consultation process in relation to this issue. Before one of the Senate estimates committees, a representative of the department, Mr Dale Boucher, the Australian Government Solicitor, stated that for the last several months resources had been applied at 'senior executive level and below that' to the Mabo issue. Mr Boucher also stated that the department will need to develop its resources in that area. It must be assumed that the Attorney-General's Department is currently cap in hand to the Department of Finance in this regard. Mr Boucher stated that he anticipates that the department will be seeking extra funding, probably to build up to, he estimated, six or seven people working on consideration of Mabo issues, in addition to those lawyers already engaged in Mabo litigation. Mr Boucher conceded that there are no moneys in the Attorney-General's Department perfonnance statements for Mabo as such. We are therefore left up in the air as to just how much Mabo will cost the Attorney-General's program this year. Another subject appropriate for comment in relation to the estimates is the push of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for a republic. My comments will be brief because there is little of relevance to it in the Attorney General's Department's statements. Again we see that increases in outlays have been announced not in the Attorney-General's Department's statements but in the statements for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. In this case there are funds provided for the establishment of the Republic Advisory Committee, for the establishment of a constitutional reform unit and for increases in outlays for the Centenary of Foundation National Advisory Committee. In addition, it was announced in the budget that community information activities on constitutional affairs will be undertaken, and no doubt it is fair to assume that this is for the purpose of promoting the Prime Minister's republican push. It must be asked why each of these items is being administered by J>rime Minister and Cabinet rather than Attorney-General's. But the question should be asked in particular in respect of the constitutional reform unit. Genuine constitutional review is not limited to the Prime Minister's republican push. It is also not clear at all what role the Attorney General's Department has played and will play in the republican debate and the constitutional reform process. It clearly concerns complex constitutional questions which will require detailed legal advice which it is hard to believe is not already being provided. The operations and funding of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission also warrant comment. There are significant variations in expenditure and outcome recorded for the 1992-93 estimates. Of the funds provided, $2.1 million has been carried over to this current year as 'slippage'. According to the papers, it resulted from the late appointment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the late appointment of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, the delayed implementation of the report by this House's Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act, and also unfulfilled commitments in respect of the community relations strategy for the national agenda for a multicultural Australia. Given the size of this sum in relation to the total commission budget, the explanation of slippage is somewhat skinny. It is to be noted that substantial responsibility for the slippage that did occur on the explanations given .does not lie with the commission; it lies with the government. In this light the Attorney-General's proposed review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, while welcome, is not relevant. It should be added that that review should provide appropriate opportunity for public participation in the review process. 1\vo current issues relating to the commission are also of relevance in the commission's budget. Recently we have had debates in this House on the declaration under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 0 Act of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of AlL Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. There is no indication of the impact on the commission budget of those two events. What the debate revealed in a major way was that there is a requirement for an extensive program of information provision to the public on what the commission does and, in particular, what the commission's role will be in relation to those two declarations. Another question arises in relation to the commission budget in respect of the role of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner. The papers indicate that he will play a leading role in relation to the Mabo debate. How this ties into the Departthent of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Attorney-General's Department generally is not indicated. Enormous government resources have been devoted to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and have given rise to a considerable number of government funded interest groups speaking on Mabo or taking steps in relation to Mabo. There is a clear need for some rationalisation of funding in this respect involving a focus on what should be the proper role for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission along with the role of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and other agencies.",76
122,Mr ANDREWS,NOES,"I wish to address my remarks tonight to that portion of the budget relating to the Attorneydemographic, General's Department and, in particular, to provision of the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services. In the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services five family service programs are being funded by the federal government pursuant to the provisions of the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act. Those programs are the provision of marriage counselling, marriage education, mediation, parent adolescent mediation and family skills, which, in effect, are parenting programs. The total budget provision for these programs for the current financial year is $20,681,000, simply a cost of living increase on the $19;657,000 which was provided in 1992-93. The figure of $20 million for preventive and remedial programs can be contrasted with the amount of money spent, for example, on the Family Court in Australia of $52 million and a further $8 million of federal government funds on the Western Australian Family Court, making - total three times that $20 million of some $60 million. It can also be contrasted with the estimated cost of family separation and breakdown in Australia, namely, in the order of $3,000 million. If we take the preventive programs within that $20 million, we see that $1.4 million is spent on marriage education and less on family skills. An amount of one one-hundredth of the total budget of the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services and one threethousandth of the cost of marriage breakdown and separation each year is spent by the federal government on preventive measures in Australia. There seems to be a considerable imbalance in the amount which we spend as a society on prevention compared with what we spend picking up the pieces. I understand that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who have responsibility on a day-today basis for these measures, are considering some changes to the structure of the provision of family services and, with that, the structure of the funding itself. These measures must be considered against the background of some major changes which have occurred in societymeasures and changes which relate to cultural, roles, marriage, fertility and the other changes which have occurred over the last two to three decades in Australia. The changes include an increase in the number of persons born overseas from 9.8 per cent in 1947 to 21 per cent in 1993; a dramatic widening of the gap between the rich and the poor; parents having fewer children; an increase in the number of children born out of wedlock or outside marriage, from five per cent in 1950 to some 24 per cent born last year; more and earlier divorce; decreased fertility rates; an ageing population; and changing roles, including increased participation of women in the work force, many of whom wish to be there and many others who do not, as was reinforced by a study released late last week by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. Taken together, these changes represent a dramatic change for many Australian families. Committees have examined two recent bipartisan reports on family changes and the impact that will have on American society. Many of these changes have been looked at by that nation. These reports repeat what is happening in· Australia. In the first report, Beyond Rhetoric, the National Commission on Children pointed to the breakdown of the American family, especially in urban areas. The mayors of America's most populous cities had written that 'the major cause of problems of cities is the dissolution of families'. In a subsequent report entitled Families First, issued in January this year, the National Commission on America's Urban Families called into question popular current opinion about families. It pointed to the inadequacy of the responses so far, namely, firstly, to deny that there is a problem in existence; secondly, simply to treat the symptoms; and, thirdly, to deal with the issue only in economic tenus. The commission set out a number of objectives for policy makers including empowering the family, strengthening the family and the relationships between parents and children, increasing community support for families, and changing the nation's culture. Each of these broad areas of recommendations are matters which I believe, as we approach the International Year of the Family 1994 in Australia, are well worth considering in this context. When changes are being made by the government in relation to these matters, I believe that there are a number of principles which ought to be considered in the way in which family services are provided by a range of bodies and agencies throughout the country, partially with the support of the federal government funds. The firSt ·principle is that all agencies-whether they be in far-flung rural and isolated areas or major agencies in capital cities, such as marriage guidance councils and Centacares, or whether they are made up of paid professional workers or voluntary professional workers:-ought to be included in the process of advice to government about these matters. A corollary of that is that as a matter of social justice we ought to include in that advice and in the way in which decisions are made all those who are concerned for the welfare of Australian families. The third principle is that decisions, advice and the provision of those services should be free, so. far as possible, from the bureaucratic strictures that often involve empire building within particular agencies more than the provision of services to the people. I can speak from personal experience about two of the five currently funded peak bodies. The five peak bodies are Marriage Guidance Australia, Centacare Australia, the Australian Council of Marriage Counselling Organisations-all of which are primarily involved in the provision of marriage counselling, which takes the major part of that $20 million worth of family services funds-the Australian Association for Marriage Education and the Catholic Society for Marriage Education which to date have been partly responsible for the advice and national programs in relation to the minor part, the preventive part, of just $1.4 million. These two bodies, with a minimum of bureaucracy, have effectively worked together to represent almost all marriage educators in Australia, estimated to be some 5,000 people across Australia if all those providing services are taken into account. That is an interesting figure which can be contrasted with fewer than 300 marriage counsellors who are funded through the family services program or through the agencies that provide those programs. I Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending the annual general meetings of these two bodies in Hobart. They reaffirmed their commitment to each other to continue to work together to. provide marriage education and family services in Australia. They also sought-rightfully I believe-a real say in discussions about the way in which family services will be provided in the future. In addition, they urged continuing funding for a number of important national initiatives- a national training program to raise the standard of educators throughout Australia; continued research into ways in which these programs can be delivered more effectively; the - publication of the magazine Threshold which goes to many of the marriage educators and is particUlarly important to those in isolated areas; and support for annual national conferences so that the raising of standards can continue. These are real social justice issues which need to be addressed in the context of the operations of the Attorney-General's Department. Those involved in the field appreciate the keen interest that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General has taken in these matters. (TIme expired)",78
123,Mr SLIPPER,NOES,"I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate in committee on estimates relating to the portfolio of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). The people of Australia are sick and tired of having the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) ram down their collective throats his desire to tum Australia into a republic or, should I say, to reduce Australia to a republic. We have also seen how the government has imposed the guillotine here. We have seen how MPIs have been scrapped. We have seen how question time can be truncated. Indeed, today we saw a particularly bad example of what government and parliament would be like should the Prime Minister be successful in imposing his republican changes. We also find that we are now prevented from censuring ministers. Last week we saw the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) caught out. The Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) sought to move a censure motion against the minister, but the government refused to allow that very important matter to be debated. So the people listening today will realise that if the Prime Minister is successful in bringing in his republican changes parliament will become even more of a joke. Also the Australia we love, the Australia in which we grew up, and the Australia we respect will be no more. Today the Republican Advisory Committee brought down its report and passed it on to the Prime Minister. It is very sad that a number of people who accepted appointment to the Republican Advisory Committee, and who had offered great service to this country in the past, allowed themselves to be used as tools by the Prime Minister and the government. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said in his media statement following the committee's report, the real question to be detennined is whether we need a republic in this country, not how we implement a republic. I refer to a phone poll taken in my electorate by the Sunshine Coast Daily newspaper over the weekend. The question asked of the people of the Sunshine Coast was: do you want Australia to bec;ome a republic? A massive 'no' vote was recorded. This was reported on the front page of the Sunshine Coast Daily yesterday, Monday 4 October, under the headline, 'Coast shuns republic bid'. In fact, 2,881 people responded-86.6 per cent-saying they did not want a republic, and only a mere 445 people-13.4 per centwere prepared to go along with the Prime Minister's attempt to gut our constitution, to gut our constitutional monarchy, and to gut our way of life. The Republican Advisory Committee has indicated that any change simply seeking to remove the Queen and the position of Governor General, replacing them with a president, is not a minimalist position. Indeed, we only have to look at the Australian constitution to realise that even the so-called minimalist approach to constitutional change would require around 200 changes to that very important document which has safeguarded our way of life, safeguarded our future, and contributed very much to the stability and freedom that we enjoy in Australia. In a question to the Prime Minister, which he has refused to answer properly, I have foreshadowed the possibility of the disintegration of Australia. At the very least, we would certainly have constitutional chaos if the government and the Australian Labor Party are successful in gutting our constitution and destroying our constitutional monarchy. Over the various months the Prime Minister has spoken about the Senate. He refers to people in that place as 'pansies' and 'unrepresentative swill'. Is that the way that we want our Prime Minister to refer to the upper house, which at this very time is seeking to hold the government to its promises? I am very pleased that the Senate is refusing to allow the government to get away with breaking more promises. I am of course referring to the government's proposed tax hikes. Thank heavens for the Senate. We do not really know what is contained in the Prime Minister's secret agenda. What does he intend to do with respect to the states? Who knows what is in this Prime Minister's mind? Indeed, it has even been suggested that Australia may not have a head of state. We all know what that would mean. It would mean that the Prime Minister would also in effect become the head of state. So we can sum up the government's republican agenda as meaning more power to the Prime Minister and Labor. Australians of Liberal, Labor or National Party persuasion speak with one voice and say that the one thing that they do not want is more power to politicians. They do not want politicians to have more power, particularly politicians like the Prime Minister who lack calibre. The Queen has done an absolutely wonderion ful job during the time that she has been the throne of this nation. In yesterday's Courier-Mail it is reported that despite by the Prime Minister to suggest that the Queen is indeed the queen of a foreign state, she is still.the preferred figure among AustralAustralians. ians to open the Olympic games in Sydney in 2000. Mr Bruce Scott-Hear, hear!",79
124,Mr SLIPPER,NOES,"I am pleased that the economy honourable member agrees with me. Moves trouble. to link the push for a republic to the Sydney Olympics have been given an overwhelming thumbs down. Ninety-two per cent of people answering the survey said that they opposed the idea that the 2000 Olympics should be deadline for Australia to sever its constitutionbe al links with Britain. Eighty-eight per cent said the Prime Minister was wrong to discuss a republic in the context of the games. And not deliver. 60 per cent-this is a very important figure, Mr Deputy Chairman-say that the Queen should open the games, compared with only nine per cent for the head of a new republic.· Nearly seven per cent of people said the Governor General should open the three per cent said that the games should be opened by a successful Australian olympian, and 5.5 per cent said it should be the Prime Minister. If it were considered that the present Prime Minister could still be the Prime Minister at that time, no-one would want that option. Only 14 per cent of people said that Australia should have a new flag of the Olympics. In this country we have a system that works; a system of checks and balances; a very cleverly devised system that is fair to all; form a system that denies any individual too much power; and a system that guarantees our stability, freedom and way of life. I am not afraid to stand up in this parliament and that I publicly support our constitutional monarchy; I publicly support our flag; that I publicly support our constitution and our way of life. The onus has always been the Prime Minister to say why we need tralia. change. The onus has always been on the government to make out its case for change, and it has failed dismally. The various opinpolls published on an almost day-today on basis show that the people of Australia are rejecting the Labor Party on this important efforts issue in ever increasing numbers. The government has failed to say how its republican agenda would improve the lot of The people of Australia know that the government is trying to divert their attention from the real issues. The real issues are one million people out of work, a ruined and a.country that is indeed in real In the remaining time available, I move to the issue of Mabo. Here again the government has been a total failure. The Prime Minister has strutted around the nation, raising expeca tations of Aborigines to a level which cannot achieved. He has spoken to mining people, pastoral people, and tourism people and he has raised their expectations also but he will Land-holders throughout the country are worried about their title. Uncertainty has been introduced into land title in Australia through the decision brought down in June 1992 by that six High Court judges. We need to bring games, certainty back into the land law. The problem is that the parliament introduced the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. We should be rolling back the Racial Discrimination Act and returning land tenure to the states. States would then be able to decide the question of land rights in accordance with by the time their own laws and values. I also draw the attention of the chamber to the fa.ct that it would be entirely wrong for the Prime Minister to seek to impose some of Mabo solution on the people of Australia unless he is able to achieve the concurrence of all state Premiers, including the Premier of Western Australia. I find it say particularly despicable and disgusting that Premier Fahey, Premier Kennett and Premier and Groom are apparently prepared to do some sort of behind the door deal with the federal on government at the expense of Western AusIt should be recognised that those states have almost no native title whereas the situation in Western Australia is quite different. We need to go forward as a nation, restore certainty and recognise that land title is indeed a matter for the states. It is important that this parliament reject any proposal brought forward by the Prime Minister which does not have the unanimous support of all states. (TIme expired)",81
125,Mr ALDRED,NOES,"In speaking to the estimates for the Attorney General's Department, I would like to raise serious matters about the use by this federal Labor government of the Australian Federal Police, the AFP, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Attorney-General. At the outset, I would remind the House that in the adjournment debate of 26 November last year I raised issues surrounding the Jodhpur probe into the meat industry by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the ABCl. This probe was established in 1991 as a result of grave concerns about the continuing criminal penetration of the meat industry. Its subsequent report, part of which I tabled at the time, highlighted allegations of fraud, drug importation and other abuses. Little government action was taken on issues arising from Jodhpur, though the then Minister for Resources, now the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), did strengthen the industry's fit proper persons requirements. Moreover, as I pointed out, this strengthening did not stop the Smorgon group taking over four meat works of the Angliss group in late 1992, despite disturbing references to the Smorgon group in Jodhpur and the conviction of one of its companies, Pacific Meat Supply Pty Ltd, under the Contravention of Secret Commissions Act in the Melbourne Magistrate's Court on 20 February 1986. It is interesting to note that the Smorgon group donated $102,000 to the ALP in the last federal election campaign, according to the returns of the Electoral Commission published in the Australian Financial Review of 31 August last. It also gave $1,000 to the coalition. As is well known, my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) has also raised questions about the meat industry in this House, the first occasion being in October 1991. In fact, throughout 1991 and 1992 allegations of corruption in the Australian meat industry featured a number of times in public debate and were reported in some detail in the Herald-Sun, the Weekly TImes and the Age. By early 1993, a federal Labor government that was obviously extremely nervous about the constancy of allegations in respect of the meat industry, and facing an imminent federal election, finally took decisive action. Decisive action aimed at pursuing the allegations in Jodhpur and cleaning up the industry? Of course not. What a silly, naive thought. In the finest traditions of the Labor Right, the AFP as a result of complaints from the National Crime Authority was ordered to raid the premises of virtually everyone in Victoria who had commented at some stage on Jodhpur, ostensibly to determine how the report was leaked. As a consequence, on 27 January 1993, the AFP executed search warrants on the Age, the home of Age journalist David Wilson, the Weekly TImes, the home of one of its journalists, Steve Cooper, the office and home of the honourable member for Gippsland, the offices of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, the home of the union's leader, Wally Curran, plus the home and office of a private detective. Not a and bad day's work, I guess. Just think what the AFP might have achieved if the extensive resources put on the ground that day and in the intensive follow-up work had been directed to some really worthwhile objective. The raids were clearly an intimidatory exercise to discourage adverse comment about the federal government's abysmal record in failing to tackle the hard questions in the meat industry. Moreover-this is a particularly interesting point-the warrant executed on those searched was extremely wide ranging, giving the AFP on at least one warrant that I am aware of the authority to remove documents relating to 68 organisations and persons. It listed documents relating to the AFP, the Commonwealth police, the Age, the Herald-Sun and the Weekly TImes. The inclusion of the Commonwealth police is particularly curious as it was disbanded 14 years ago and, of course, had nothing to do with the Jodhpur probe. Mr Alan Kohler, Editor of the Age, called the raids for what they really were in the Australian Financial Review of 28 January. He said: , It looks to us like they are on a fishing expedition, looking for other things that may be of use to them and they'll come back later. In addition, it has to be asked why, if the federal government and its law enforcement agencies were so concerned about the leaking of the report on Jodhpur, they took so long to act after it was first referred to in the media. A little history at this point may help in understanding the problem. Prior to 1991, the Victoria Police were gathering information on the illegal activity of certain meat contractors. Further detailed work was then undertaken by the ABCI and the report resulting from those investigations was forwarded to the then Minister for Resources, the honourable member for Maribymong. Around September 1991, it was common knowledge in the media that a copy of the Jodhpur report was circulating. On 25 September 1991, an article by Peter Wilson appeared in the Herald-Sun. Peter Wilson, incidentally, is not to be confused with David Wilson of the Age. The Peter Wilson article made extensive reference to Jodhpur and the fact that the Herald-Sun had seen the contents of the report. It is known that Peter Wilson ha<!-a copy of the report, as did a journalist· of another paper who was also briefed on its contents. Publicity about the report and the industry continued throughout 1991 and 1992, being further spurred on by a dispute at Camperdown meat works in 1991 with resultant court cases during 1992. About the same time, there were rumours in the industry that Mr Wally Steiger, who had fled Australia to avoid prosecution in the early 1980s, was trying to get back into the country. This was potentially a major problem, as he was being linked to former criminals in the meat industry who were also moving back. Mr Steiger did eventually return to Australia in mid-1993, was charged and convicted of corruption offences and sentenced to about two years gaol. Many of these industry problems were, of course, centred in the Maribyrnong area where most of the industry is located. This is also the electorate of the then minister. Even more to the point is the fact that the briefing of the media throughout 1992 in regard to Jodhpur and the actual leaking of the report is alleged to have been done by the then minister's assistant, Mr John Brumby, now leader of the state opposition in Victoria. The AFP were appraised of this fact by at least one of those individuals raided on 27 January this year. This leads to several compelling and serious questions to be asked of the government. Firstly, why did the AFP not follow through the allegations that Mr Brumby leaked the Jodhpur report? Secondly, if Mr Brumby were empowered to officially release the report, why were intimidatory raids by the AFP authorised last January, nearly 18 months after the report was known to be in circulation? Thirdly, if Mr Brumby illegally leaked the report, will the government proceed against him under the Crimes Act? Finally, is all of this a diversion from properly tackling corruption in the meat industry? I am sure all of those raided on 27 January this year and the community at large will be interested in the government's response.",82
126,Mr WILLIAMS,NOES,"Tangney) (9.49 p.m.)I wish to supplement the remarks I made earlier by referring to the subject of court buildings. In the budget papers, provision is made for the refurbishment of the Federal Court's accommodation in Melbourne. An amount of $6.5 million has been allocated for that purpose. Exactly what is involved in the refurbishment is not the least bit clear from the budget papers. The question arises whether refurbishment of the accommodation of the court in Melbourne is required, or whether there should be a complete replacement of the facilities. Th\! Federal Court occupies two buildings: one at 450 Little Bourke Street and another at 451 Little Bourke Street. They are obviously on opposite sides of the road. Under present arrangements the judiciary, court staff and the public have to move between the two buildings. Anybody familiar with the area knows that Little Bourke Street is a public thoroughfare for vehicles. The accommodation in the courtrooms in the building at 451 Little Bourke Street is completely unsatisfactory. It also should be mentioned that the High Court, when it visits Melbourne for special leave applications, utilises Federal Court accommodation. The court that it uses is of some historic significance. Not necessarily for that reason, but related to it, the court's current facilities are quite substandard. The facilities provided for the Federal Court are not adequate for a senior national trial court; the facilities provided for the nation's ultimate court of appeal are equally unsatisfactory. What is proposed, however, is not an acceptable alternative. The division between the two buildings will be perpetuated. The height of the building at 451 Little Bourke Street is such that economic use of the site really is not practicable. This proposal should be reconsidered with a view to constructing a purpose-built Federal Court building in Melbourne. The Federal Court is an itinerant court. Frequently around Australia judges visiting from interstate for the purpose of sitting on a full court or meeting a demand for trial judges use its facilities. The facilities for visiting judges in Melbourne are quite inconvenient and they are remote from the other parts of the court. Another area left, it would seem, in an unsatisfactory state is the security of tenure of the building at 451 Little Bourke Street. There has been a long standing dispute between the Commonwealth and Victorian governments in relation to that. The Federal Court's accommodation in Adelaide is also quite inadequate. Accommodation is provided within an office building in Grenfell Street. The Federal Court conducts significant complex trials, both commercial and public law in subject, but there is within the court structure in Adelaide no court suitable for such trials. There was in 1992 and 1993 a long running commercial trial conducted under facilities that, given the nature of the issues, the documentation and the number of parties and counsel and instructing solicitors involved, were quite inadequate. is to be noted that the budget contains no provision whatsoever for the improvement accommodation in Adelaide. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Transport and Communications Proposed expenditure $1,034,813,000.",83
127,Mr SHARP,NOES,"The Department of Transport and Communications allocation in Appropriation Bill (No.1) deals with areas that are of great interest to me, particularly road funding. Areas such as shipping and waterfront industry reform and rail and road transport reform are all in one way or another affected by the appropriations under this department's title. I thought I would first of all speak about the way the government has cut back, and very savagely cut back, on road funding allocations in the budget. It is interesting to look at last year's road funding allocations. Some $1,628 million was spent on roads last year according to the budget papers. This year, according to the budget papers, the expenditure is to be cut from around $1,600 million down to $1,019.6 million, to be exact. For any of us who are pretty plain in the maths department, that means a $600 million cutback out of last year's overall budget of $1,600 million. That is a very sizeable cut by anybody's book. That is not the end of it. The forward estimates in the budget papers for the next financial year indicate that the government intends to cut road funding even further, to $813 million. .So in the course of two years road funding under the current government's priorities will have been cut, according to its budget papers, in half. One can imagine the net effect that that will have on the state of our roads around Australia. Every one of us knows that better roads are safer roads. Safer roads mean that fewer lives are lost and less injury is incurred on our roads. The corollary is that if we spend less money on our roads, they will be less safe and therefore we will have a subsequent increase in the number of accidents, injuries and deaths on our roads. Anyont< who takes an interest in the condition of roads around Australia will recognise It that in many areas the state of the roads has . reached a quarter to midnight situation. Any of of us, particularly country members, who spend a great deal of time on the roads perfonning our electoral duties would recogmillion nise that roads are falling apart. I have into many shires in my electorate where roads have rapidly deteriorated simply because they have reached their full life expectancy. Some of the roads have been around for more than 40 years. They should have been repaired, with a complete renewal of their surface, foundation, drainage and so forth, several years ago. That has not been done because the money is not there. All that this budget will do is make that situation even worse. For country people who travel so many miles roads, on roads that were not well built in first instance and which are getting worse as funding. a result of this budget, this budget is a disaster. Not only is it in the general road funding area that the government has cut back, but it, also it has cut out the black spots road ing project. The black spots project has been going for the last few years. It initiative of the former Minister for Land Transport, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). Mr Bruce Scott-He would have to be doing, better than the current one.",84
128,Mr SHARP,NOES,"Anybody would be better ac---:-an than the current one in this particular matter. The honourable member for Charlton institutwhen ed the black spots campaign. It has now cut out in this budget, most unfortunately. It taking. only 6c. a htre - fuel eXCIse and is interesting to note that when the honourable member for Charlton introduced the black spots road funding program he claimed that it would save 220 lives per year. He said it was money well spent. For every $4 million we spend on improving our roads, we save life. For every $500,000 we spend on the future. black spots campaign, we save a life. So there is eight times more benefit from our dollar being spent on black spots than there is from it being spent on the general road funding allocation. The axing of this program from budget brought down on 17 August this year is indeed something many honourable memon bers from both sides of the chamber, and everybody who takes an interest in the safety of our roads, would be very upset about. But whilst that has been the case, whilst road funding has been cut from some $1,600 per cent. to $1,000 million, and will be cut next been year to $800 million, the government has been busily putting its hand into the pockets of motorists. It increased fuel excise by 5c a litre for unleaded fuel and by 7c a litre for leaded fuel. In fact, the government had a crack at lOc a litre for leaded fuel. That means that fuel excise revenues will increase from $7.2 billion last year to virtually $10 billion by the year 1996. It is interesting to note that by the year 1996, less than lOc in every dollar-indeed, around 8.6c in every on dollar-collected from the motorist in fuel the excise will be returned in the fonn of road When this government came into power 101f2 years ago, fuel excise amounted to 6c a litre. After this government has had a crack at it will be up around 33c or 34c a litre. Yet, fundat the same time, road funding in actual dollars will be less than it was when this was a good government gained office. Mr Braithwaite-Scandalous.",85
129,Mr SHARP,NOES,"What the government is as my honourable colleague points out to us tonight, is engaging in a scandalous act of high-ay robbery, as the :rim/_MImster (Mr Keatmg) - s-d t- descnbe It he was a shadow mmlster m the former been go,:,ernment.

The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) often speaks shipping matters in the House and he would be particularly interested, and no doubt concerned, about the consequences of this government's decision to increase the excise on fuel oil for the shipping industry by 100 The net impact of that will be an increa-e in operating expenses of $360,000 per ShIP per annum for Australian flag vessels. If we compare the increase in costs of $360,000 a year for each ship in the Australian fleetbecause of the decisions of this government in its budget-to the savings of $440,000 a year that each ship in the Australian fleet would have experienced had the Fightback package been introduced on 17 August instead of the Labor government's package, we can see that the shipping industry will be $800,000 per ship worse off each year as a result of the election of the Labor government on 13 March. The Seamens Union of Australia must be regretting the advertising campaign it ran during the election campaign urging people to vote for the Labor Party, ?ecause the net result is that the Seamens Uruon and its members will lose jobs as a result of the savage increase in operating expenses for the Australian shipping industry. They are not the only ones. It is the same for truck operators. Transport operators around Australia have been really hit for six in this budget. There are extra fuel costs of $6,400 for the average road transport operator per truck per year, and there are extra operating costs of $2,400 because of the sales tax increases. All of that means that truck operators are going to cut out jobs. They estimate that one in every six jobs in the road transport industry will disappear as a result of the decision to put up fuel excise. So whether they are shipping operators or transport operators and road users - ho are going to experience worse roa-, thIS .budget-part of which we are - ebatmg torught-;has been a disaster for thIS country. It WIll lead to fewer jobs, a less competitive economy for Australia, and less safe roads for Australians to drive on. All of this spells disaster for the average Australian and disgrace for the Labor government.",85
130,Mr HOLLIS,NOES,"It is always a pleasure to follow my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). It is quite interesting when he talks about going to these roads in his electorate. Many of them have been funded by the state government, so perhaps he should take up this matter with some of his state colleagues and not the federal government. I was a little surprised that when the honourable member for Hume was makitig these comments he did not give the government at least some credit for the magnificent Goulburn bypass, which I use on my way to and from Canberra. It is federally funded and it is a magnificent piece of roadwork. I would have thought that, as it was finished and opened since the last budget, the honourable member would have at least commented on it. Before he gets too concerned about the seamen, let me assure him that the Seamens Union of Australia-which is now known as the Maritime Union of Australia-has no regrets for the advertising and the sterling work that it did to make sure that a Labor government was re-elected at the last federal election. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Chairman, there has been a massive attitudinal and structural change in Australia's shipping and waterfront industries over the last decade. This government's reform programs were developed and implemented with the full cooperation of the industry unions and employers during a time of unprecedented industrial harmony. But one would hardly think so much has been achieved. The achievement has passed largely unnoticed by the community and, indeed, by the editorial writers-especially the editorial writer of the Australian Financial Review-let alone those opposite. Maritime reform has been a major priority in the government's drive to improve Australia's international competitiveness. The most comprehensive and successful reform program undertaken by any government has transformed the waterfront and shipping industries into highly reliable and efficient contributors to the nation's economic well-being. On the waterfront, performance gains are continuing following the three-year program which concluded at the end of September 1992. Container terminal labour productivity has more than doubled; average - hip turnaround time has almost halved; contamer handling rates are equivalent to efficient ports overseas; stevedoring labour has been downsized by 57 per cent; and stevedoring contract rates have fallen between 20 to 30 per cent. The government continues to build upon strong foundation of cooperative reform with waterfront employers and unions, encouraging the maximisation of reform benefits to wateraction. front users and bringing a stronger focus improving efficiency in other port services and at the port-land interface. The Industry Commission report released in June 1993 on port authority services and activities provides a strong basis for the government to pursue further reform in the port sector with state territory governments. This government will also be progressing initiatives at port-land interface to encourage implementation electronic data interchange in the transport sector and facilitation of efficient cargo movement through state establishment of interface efficiency councils at major ports. The last shipping reform program, comsion pleted in mid-1992, achieved similar efficientions cy improvements. There was an average crew size reduction from 28 to 21; new ships being introduced with crews of 17 to 18; there are long-term labour productivity cost savings of $50 million per annum; and investment was introduced for 22 modern ships with reform multiskilled crews, modernising a third of the Australian fleet. Earlier this year, the government announced support for a package of measures developed with the industry for further streamlining the efficiency of crewing arrangements. current average crew size of less than 21 is to be reduced to an average of 18 by the end of 1993 and aims to go down to a level as low as 16.25 by the end of 1995. The new crew cuts and other reforms will result in further labour productivity savings of up to $50 million per annum. As with the previous reform program, the bulk of the labour adjustunprecedented ment costs will be met by the shipowners. The government again will assist the early flow-on of reform benefits by contributing to $25 million towards the voluntary ment packages and training. In addition to furthering the efficiency quality of Australian shipping, the government continues to pursue national and international action to improve the standard of foreign ships to minimise the risk of maritime accidents and the potential pollution of our the coastal environment. The recommendations of the government commissioned report, Ships of shame, provides a strong basis for future The government is also pursuing the on outcome of the comprehensive review of Australia's national plan to combat seaborne oil pollution to ensure optimal national preparedness for responding to a marine casualty. Part X of the Trade Practices Act, regulating international shipping services, is underand going a wide ranging review of its effectiveness in meeting the interests of Australian shippers. The review is due to report to of government by the end of 1993. The benefits of maritime reform will continue to be monitored and assessed by the government, with the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Trade Practices Commisplaying key roles in identifying inhibito the flow of reform benefits to Australian exporters and import reliant industries. are Maritime reform must remain a dynamic process to meet the imperative of international competitiveness. The government's initiatives will maintain the momentum of cooperative and ensure industry structures optimise /the delivery of cost-effective and high quality services to Australian exporters and import reliant industries. I suggest that only the Keating Labor government could have in achieved these sorts of massive reforms in The shipping and on the waterfront. Last week a document was released from the Industry Commission purporting to outline . impediments to regional industry adjustment in Australia. One of the recommendations was for the termination of the policy of cabotage for coastal shipping. At a time when the world's ocean transport industry faces an crisis, and when the international fleet has become crftically over-aged and suffers from a deteriorating safety record, up the implications for the removal of cabotage retirewould be devastating for Australia. Yet those opposite continue to push for our and Australian coast to be opened to the ageing rust buckets of the world. The argument of those opposite is that if other countries are foolish enough to use taxpayer funds to subsidise shipping, and if ship owners and crews are prepared to run huge risks in running cheap, untaxed, unsafe ships, Australia should participate in this free lunch and bother about developing its own shipping capability because the free market will take care of it for us. That is not good enough for a nation with the fifth largest transportation task - in the world. The removal of cabotage would lead to the immediate disappearance of the Australian flag fleet and its input to the economy. The fleet would have to flag but to tax havens to survive. Australian ships pay tax, their crews pay tax, and they carry the cost of complying fully with all the international safety conventions. We are therefore uncompetitive with the untaxed, unregulated and unsafe ships which would be allowed in by the removal of cabotage. Australia now has one of the most modem, if not the best, merchant fleets and one of the best trained seafaring work forces in the world. For that we can largely thank a tripartite lO-year effort by government, industry and unions. The reform of Australian shipping has been one of the major achievements of the government's micro-economic reform process. It has resulted in a major reform of this traditionally difficult industry, something it. almost totally unremarked upon by either the press or the public. Foreign flags are chea-r because they do not pay tax, but that is no reason to import them into our domestic economy. The argument that this would lead to a competitive balance between Australian flag ships and foreign flag ships is nonsense. The Australian ships woulq flag out immediately in order to gain the tax advantages of their competitors and we would finish up with no Australian fleet at all. If this is what the opposition is proposing, it is proposing that we in Australia exchange safe, well-maintained and well-manned ships for foreign ships. Additionally, it would put several thousand seafarers on the dole and significantly increase our balance of payments problem because of the profits and wages repatriated out of Australia. For the sake of Australia, for the sake of Australian shipping, we must maintain cabotage.",86
131,Mr NEHL,NOES,"I rise not to speak on the issue of transport in general and road transport in particular. At the moment, the government benches are fairly empty, but visualising them full of government members. I wonder whether they have very short memories or whether members of cabinet do not get out of aeroplanes in our capital cities any more. If they have very short memories, they have probably forgotten two horrific bus crashes on the Pacific Highway-one at Cowper in the electorate of Page, and one at Clybucca in my electorate which resulted in the highest death toll of any road accident in Australia. As a result, the government instituted a program to upgrade the Pacific Highway and also introduced the black spot program. In answer to a question on 16 May 1991, the then Minister for Land Transport, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), said: It is one of the most outstanding programs for road safety that has ever been adopted by any government in Australia. While honourable members will never be able to identify those people whose lives will be saved as a result of it, they can be damned sure that hundreds of people will live as a result of He was right. Now the government has cut it out. How many lives is it prepared to sacrifice on the roads of Australia because it will not provide adequate funding? I am not talking about black spots alone. The roads of Australia are the arteries that provide transport for goods and people, and they are doing so in increasingly less safe conditions. The federal government has axed road funding by $608.3 million this financial year. That is a massive cut of 37.4 per cent. We know that the government is broke. We know that it has mismanaged the economy. We know that it has delivered a budget of betrayal-but how can it cut road funding in one year by 37.4 per cent? That is not the end of it. In 1994-95 funding will drop to a total of only $813 million, which is less than was spent on road funding in 1982-83-less than was spent over a decade ago. In fact, in the next financial year less than $1 in every $10 raised by the fuel tax will be spent on roads, compared with the $6.66 spent on roads for every $10 raised by fuel tax when the coalition was last in power. The axing of black spot funding is absolutely disgraceful. It was a program that saved lives. Tonight, as I have done in the past, I congratulate the honourable member for Charlton for having instituted the black spot program. In answer to the same question on 16 May 1991, he said that something like 220 lives a year would be saved on the Pacific Highway alone, and that something like 35 death spots would be eliminated in the first year of the program. If any road funding program deserves to continue it is the black spot program. If any highway in this nation deserves special priority funding, as provided through cooperation between federal and state governments, it is the Pacific Highway. Honourable members who were here a few years ago might recall that I presented a petition with 55,000 signatures collected from right around Australia-not just from people in my electorate but from people as far away as Western Australia and Tasmania-acknowledging that the Pacific Highway was a special case for priority funding. I believe that that special case still exists. The government has also axed the provincial cities and rural highways program, as well as the arterial roads program, and is leaving the funding of my pet highway, the Pacific Highway, to the state government. Of course, the federal government has cut back its funding to state governments anyway. I would like to mention something that happened recently in Coffs Harbour, which is where I live, because what is happening there is symptomatic of what is happening all over Australia. In the last week or so, the Coffs Harbour City Council surveyed its road network. It estimated that in order to bring roads up to a reasonable standard, and in the light of the continued cutbacks in road funding by this government, it has a 112-year backlog of road works. Who can believe that? It estimated that, unless it receives an injection of funds, it will take 112 years to face Coffs Harbour's roads to an acceptable standard. That 112 years represents a 71-year backlog in rural roadworks and a 41-year backlog in urban roadworks. Admittedly, Coffs Harbour has grown significantly and dramatically, which is part of the problem, but it is not in isolation. Every community right around Australia would be in the same situation to a greater or lesser extent. Local governmeJ}t bodies do not have enough money to keep up with the roadworks-and it gets worse each year. There is absolutely no point in them even considering trying to borrow it; they would never be able to pay it back. Yet it indicates quite clearly that there is a crucial, crying need for more road funding. I acknowledge that this government and Australia are broke; we are in great trouble. But that .does not do away with the need for priority. Even road safety research has been slashed. Some 97.4 per cent was the amount cut from road safety land transport research. That is pretty disgraceful. Another pressing need in my electorate is to upgrade the Coffs Harbour airport- At present, the existing main runway is 2,080 metres long and 30 metres wider We recently had our first international flight, a charter flight from New Zealand which came in one Saturday and went back the next. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) has declared the airport to be international, as from 1 July this year. But we need additional funding to widen the runway to 45 metres from the present 30 metres to take in 767 aircraft and service the Asia-Pacific region. We need to lengthen the runway by an additional 400 metres to take in long-haul aircraft. It is absolutely vital to upgrade the Coffs Harbour airport to take full advantage of its international status. Coffs Harbour City Council is doing its utmost. It has let a tender its for the preparation of the master plan. The final documentation for that is due in December. That will look at domestic and international passenger movements, gener-l aviation and a whole range of things including passenger terminals and airport facilities, commerresur- cial development and many other issues. I have already approached the appropriate minister, who has replied that no funding is available. I acknowledge that the airport is owned by the Coffs Harbour City Council. Theoretically, it should be totally responsible for any further upgrading. But it is vitally important that it be upgraded, particularly now that we have the Sydney Olympics in 2000. The Coffs Harbour international airport will provide another gateway for New South Wales. Mr Braithwaite-Very important. Mr NEHLIt is very important. At present we have only one international gateway in the state. This will provide the fourth runway for Sydney, which will be vitally important. Mr Hollis-Badgerys Creek.",88
132,Mr NEHL,NOES,"My colleague the honourable member for Throsby mentions Badgerys Creek. Pigs will fly before that comes in. It will not be there before the Olympics. To serve the Olympic games, it is absolutely vital that the Coffs Harbour airport be upgraded to full international status. To do that we will need some financial assistance from the federal government. I put the minister on notice. That also applies to the Pacific Highway. It needs to be upgraded to a four-lane dual divided carriageway. It is essential that that be completed before the year 2000. (TIme expired)  p.m.)-The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and his colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) do the cause of roads a great disservice with the sorts of arguments each of them put. It is the age old ploy of comparing last year's expenditure-or 10 years ago expenditure-with this year's proposed expenditure, without referring to the same funding circumstances. It is a total dishonesty. Their constituents will recognise that-and this House deserves better from them. They are both very able gentlemen, capable of making a much better contribution than that. They have not mentioned transfer of responsibilities. It shows that they have not the budget estimates. Being a debate on the budget estimates, it helps to get the book from the Bills and Papers Office. The program performance statements explain accurately all the points being made by the two honourable members to whom I have referred. It is stated: 1992/93 was the peak funding year for Federal road funding with $1.8 billion being allocated to national roads (this figure incorporates $160 million for the elimination of blackspots under sub-Program 4.2). That appears on page 302. On page 303 it is stated: 1992/93 was ... the final year for the Provincial Cities and Rural Highways ... program with $300 million being provided over three years for road and rail projects. Those opposite know as well as I-as do you, Mr Deputy Chairman-that that was a three year program, as was the black spots program. They were limited programs. It is the height of misrepresentation to say that there has been a 93 per cent reduction in road safety outlays. Road safety outlays, as they appear on page 314, show expenditure under the road safety program last year to have been $171.833 million and this year to be $12.931 million. Within that was the provision last year of $163,400,000 for the black spots program. Those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot bemoan the end of the black spots program-it was an interim programand also lump it into the road safety package and say that that package has gone down by 93 per cent. The figures show it. I say to my colleagues opposite that if they are going to use those figures they should open the book and read the estimates. The explanations are all there. The king hit is that this year we are moving to a system where only the national highways are funded by the federal government. The rest of the money has been transferred across to the states in untied grants. Whenever honourable members on the other side rail against increases in fuel excise, they should remember that each of the states has its hand in the same pot and are also getting a share of the money. So they get two dips: one as read specified road funding under the national highway program and another under the general revenue grant. If they want to use more money out of that, that is their decision. They can use the lot on roads, if they want. But they choose not to. It is not a valid argument-they are trying to mislead the public-that the money for roads has disappeared. It is now going to their colleague governments. Their state colleagues are syphoning off the money for purposes other than roads. That is the real story. Mr MCGauran-Prove it.  I like the honourable member for Gippsland, but I ask him not to distract me. Mr MCGauran-But you are bluffing.  That information is readily available and I will get it for the honourable gentleman, to clarify it for him. The money is being syphoned by state governments in New South Wales and Victoria for purposes other than roads. That came under the heads of government agreement between Mr Greiner and former Prime Minister Hawke. The second last paragraph of page 303 states: Funding in the new program will be limited to thenational highway system. It continues: This flows from decisions of Heads of Government that each level of government should have more clearly defined responsibilities for roads. Let us put an end to the rubbish that is going on. Those opposite are not doing themselves a service and they are doing the issue of roads and the interests of motorists a great disservice. State governments can take as much money as they want out of general revenue and use it on roads. That is their decision. Similarly, local government now has untied grants. Its money is marked 'roads', but there is no supervision to see whether it is spent on roads. Some honourable members opposite, including my good friend the deputy chairman of the transport and communications infrastructure committee, and-we have heard and read it in evidence-the state roads ministers, whatever they are called, did not want an end to specified road grants because they knew that if their money went untied to state treasuries they would have to run the gauntlet of state cabinet. That is what is happening; they are losing some of it. Some of the money going to local government is losing priority around the council table. We can go as far back as anyone wants; we can go back to the Fraser government. It brought in personal income tax sharing. On a state by state basis-looking at the analysesin the middle to two-thirds of the way through the 1980s the priority on roads at local government level did not change. The additional money went to other purposes. I recognise that there were some exceptions. Some country councils spent a very large proportion of their budget on roads, but state total by state total that is not what happened. The other thing to remember is this: it is clear that we should be looking not simply at a comparison of the number of dollars last year, 10 years ago or next year. It is: how well is the money spent? All honourable members in this chamber know that they can go around to councils in their electorates and point to instances where equipment could be better utilised. They can point to inefficiencies (where money could have been better spent. They can point to methods of repair where money could have been used more wisely. In the inquiry that we-the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), other members of this committee and I-have been conducting, evidence upon evidence points to at least a 20 per cent improvement in productivity. We spend almost $6,000 million each year in this country, over three levels of government, building and maintaining roads, but no-one on the other side of the chamber ever asks whether we can spend that money more wisely. If we get a 20 per cent productivity improvement, as we believe we can, that is equivalent to getting another $1 billion worth of roadworks done without spending one more dollar. In fact, motorists in this country are being robbed of the equivalent of $1 billion of roadworks each year through inefficiencies. They include a number of things: lack of coordination, the stop-go nature of road funding, under-utilisation of plant, insufficient money spent on research and insufficient knowledge on performance of roads. In the few minutes that I have left I want to say something about the waterfront and the transport change from the warehouse to the wharf. Before I do, I would like to say one more thing on roads. I want to register as strong a protest as I can that, as we improve roads in this country, the number of traffic infringements goes up. There is an interesting contradiction: as the level of road casualties goes down, the level of road infringements goes up and the take from road infringement notices goes up. Motorists are obviously driving better. There are fewer crashes and fewer casualties, but the revenue goes up and up. What we really have here is .a taxing of motorists-a revenue raising process masquerading as a road safety measure. We have scarce resources to supervise and manage roads for the states. We accept that. But those resources should be used on the hazardous sections of road, such as sections of the Pacific Highway where strangers on that road doing the wrong thing are likely to get into trouble. I am referring to neither the straight stretches of national highway at the bottom of a hill nor that stretch in my electorate where, in the space of 2.3 kilometres, there are four different speed limits and a camera or radar gun is trying to catch people if, on the changeover, they do not quite make it. That has nothing to do with road safety; that is revenue raising. The last thing I want to mention concerns ports and transport changes in the waterfront. I refer to the plea of the manager of BHP Transport Ltd for state treasuries to take their hands out of the pockets of port users. He states: If as a matter of policy State Governments wish to tax imports and exports . . . that is a matter them, but these charges should clearly be seen recognised as a tax on Australian manufacturing He is talking about the growing incidence of financial return to the state Treasury in South Australia from state charges. His speech is well worth reading. It excludes any reference to stevedoring costs and makes excellent comparisons. I recommend it. If honourable members want a copy of it, I would be happy to give them one. (TIme expired)",90
133,Mr SHARP,NOES,"I rise to follow the contribution made by the honour to the debate this evening. His contributions are always interesting, and he probably knows more about transport than any other person sitting on the government side, including the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). It is always worthwhile to listen and respond to the comments that he makes. I refer to the end of the honourable member's speech where he made comments about port authorities. I happened to read the speech given the other day by the General Manager of BHP Transport. It is a very worthwhile speech, as the honourable member for Shortland has pointed out. It points out something that we on this side of the chamber have been talking about for a long time now, and that is the need for state governments to engage in port authority reform. It is reform which we, at this level of government, cannot dictate but which we can suggest and encourage. Indeed, we should be suggesting and encouraging it, as the honourable member for Shortland has pointed out. Through the increases in taxes that state governments impose through their port authorities, Australian ports are on average now about 21/2 times more expensive to use than New Zealand ports providing similar or the same service. So the point made is one well worth making. The only point that I would make in response to the comments by the honourable member for Shortland is that, when I made my comments a year or two ago, I remember being attacked in the Senate by the now Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins). He said that the Commonfor wealth had no role at all and no right to and interfere in this area and indeed that the honourable member for Gilmore, as I was then, was obviously displaying his ignorance by speaking on a subject that the Commonwealth had no role in. I make the point, as the Industry Commission has also made the point, that we do have a role. It is an important one and one which leads to Australia's ability to compete, because it is through our ports that probably 95 per cent of all Australia's exports end up going. They are therefore affected by the tax raising policies that state governments engage through their port authorities. So the point been well made, and I am glad the honourable member for Shortland has made it. As far as the second last point the honourable member for Shortland made about revenue raising techniques in the guise of fines on motorists is concerned, I share with him that concern. In the area that I represent, I understand from folklore, the Hume Highway at Goulburn is the highest revenue raising area for the New South Wales government in the fonn of motor traffic fines. I must admit, sadly, that I have contributed to that on a number of occasions over the years. Mr HoUis-The Goulburn bypass.",92
134,Mr SHARP,NOES,"In recent years, the Goulburn bypass, as the honourable member for Throsby points out, has made motoring in that area much safer. It is something that I think we need to look at. In relation to some of the roads we now have, particularly in those sections around the Cullerin Range, Goulburn bypass and any of these major four-lane highways that have been properly built, I question whether 110 kilometres an hour is an adequate speed. I think it could proba:bly go quite higher.  130.",93
135,Mr SHARP,NOES,"As the honourable member for Short land has interjected, perhaps even 130 kilometres would be a respectable speed limit and quite safe for those roads. The only thing motorists are likely to do on those roads is fall asleep, run into the centre of the road and get themselves bogged after a weekend's rain such as we have just had. That is the worse thing likely to happen to motorists. So the point has been well made. The honourable member for Throsby made the point that in my remarks I do not give credit to the Goulbum bypass. I make the point that the scheme to put a bypass around Goulbum and to make the Hume Highway a dual carriageway from Sydney to Melbourne was established by the Australian bicentennial road development fund, which was set up by the Hon. Ralph Hunt when he was the transport minister in the former Fraser-Anthony government. So, if one has to give credit for has the Goulburn bypass, the dual carriageways of the Hume Highway or any other such road, one should give credit to that government, that minister and the poor, long-suffering motorists who have paid their taxes through the petrol bowser in increasing spadefuls over the last few years. and provided revenue for governments to do that. When I speak of the poor, long-suffering motorists, as the honourable member for Shortland suggested, we should go to our budget papers and check the facts. The facts are that the long-suffering motorists have been ripped off in bigger spadefuls under this government with this budget more than ever before. For those interested in history, when this government came into power I think the amount of revenue raised from fuel excise was, off the top of my head, of the order of $1,000 million per annum. As a result of the decisions of this budget, fuel excise will raise $9.8 billion by 1996. If we again go to the budget papers, as the honourable member for Shortland urges us to do, and check the) facts exhibited in those papers-I refer to page 3.155 of Budget Paper No. I-road funding will go from $1,627.9 million to $1,019.6 million in this budget and will go down to $813 million in the year 1994-95. If we follow the advice of the honourable member for Shortland and check the facts according to the budget papers, we see that road funding is being reduced. The honourable member for Shortland can put forward excuses such as these were three year programs, one-off programs or whatever he might like to put to justify these reductions. The fact is that road funding is decreasing, petrol excise is increasing and the motorist is being fleeced. That is something that concerns all of us. As the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) pointed out in his impassioned speech, which he has consistently given in this chamber on matters relating to the Pacific Highway, the state of that road is getting no better, the traffic is growing at a - rapid rate and it is simply a matter of time before we see major accidents repeating themselves on that stretch of highway. We have been very lucky in the last two or three years. I welcome the contribution of the honourable member for Shortland. As people interested in this subject would appreciate, his contribution carries a considerable amount of weight. His contribution raised points for debate in this chamber about the amount of road funding that we are receiving under this government. If we use the budget papers, by any measure road funding is being reduced and fuel excises are going up from 6c a litre when this government came into power 10 112 years ago to 31c and 32c a litre, depending on which type of fuel we use for our cars. That is irrefutable and will cause the average citizen of this country to damn this government and its policies. It will not lead to safer roads or a more competitive Australian economy. It will not lead to more jobs being created. It is instructive for us to consider those facts as we debate this appropriation bill tonight because it is the irrefutable cutbacks and the increases in taxes that will lead Australia down the path of financial and social ruin. I make these points because I think they are important points which concern particularly rural people but also all Australians since we all use the roads. We are all affected by the cost of transport in our daily lives and, therefore, all of us should be concerned about what this government is doing to our roads, our transport industry, our shipping industry, our waterfront, our ports and our railway operations. As a result of this budget and these bills, they are not being helped-indeed, they are being made worse.  p.m.)-I thank the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) for his kind remarks, those that were of quality and those that were complimentary; but can I help him again. He is from the National Party and it is sometimes difficult to get the message across. I refer him to page 303 of the program performance statements where it says: Funding in the new program will be limited to the NHS. This flows from decisions by Heads of Government that each level of government should have more clearly defined responsibilities for roads. In other words, the money that was going to the states under specified road grade programs other than the national highway system goes to the states untied, for them to do as they will with that money. The honourable member for Hume should help us all and get on to his state colleagues and Premier Fahey and tell them that syphoning off roads money to other purposes is not good enough for country people. That is what is going on. The honourable member for Hume knows it, I know it and everybody else here knows it. A similar thing is happening in Victoria. A number of us knew it would happen. Similarly, we should get on to our friends in local government who are getting untied moneys for roads-the state transport minister did not want that to happen either-and who are against any end to specified road grants and tell them that ratepayers want to see that money being used for roads. In addition, the honourable member for Hume forgets to mention that that increase in fuel excise in the early years of this government was not so much an increase in excise but a change in terms, because what the Fraser government collected as an accrued oil levy was changed in category and retitled a fuel excise. The accrued oil levy ended and it was replaced by a corresponding increase in excise, so the take was pretty much the same sort of take. There have been increases in recent times and there are increases in excise in this budget. That is part of the budget policy. But part of the money that comes from fuel is earmarked for roads and part of it goes to the states as untied revenue grants. I· say to the states, 'Do what you wish with the money. You are there at the state level and know best how it ought to be used. But do not complain to us when you do not use it for the purpose that people want it to be used'. It also goes to help pay for schools, hospitals, defence and a whole range of other government and family support services. It is a general revenue source, part of which is earmarked for roads. I thank my colleague the honourable member ' for Hume for those nice things he had to say about me and I hope he looks at those pages in the program performance statements that I have referred him to now. I will talk to him after the debate is over and help him some more. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Employment, Education and Training Proposed expenditure, $2,663,638,000.",93
136,Mr MCARTHUR,NOES,"I would like to address the chamber about the budget allocation to the Department of Employment, Education and Training of $12.2 billion, representing about 11 per cent of the Commonwealth's yearly total expenditures. Ten years of Labor has left Australia with a legacy of one million persons unemployed. What a legacy for this department! According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, a person is counted as employed if he or she works for payor is a volunteer for more than one hour a week. Many thousands of Australians might be working very few hours and not be happy about that, yet officially they are regarded as employed. (The Australian community might have a different idea from the statistics gatherers on how many Australians are really unemployed. I would like to examine the operation of the labour market programs in these appropriations. DEET has recently acknowledged in the July 1993 edition of its Job Report: . . . the principal impact of most of the labour market programs run by the CBS, skillshares and other brokers is currently to ""shuffle the rather than create additional jobs. It goes on to say: . .. new job creation is also occurring under programs like jobstart. Those statements from DEET obscure the real issue. With the $1.36 billion being allocated for labour market programs in 1993-94, an increase of 10 per cent on last year, is Australia any better off since the government has quadrupled the expenditure over these programs from just $307 million in 1990-91, three years ago? I draw the attention of the chamber to this remarkable increase in these labour market programs but no increase in the jobs that Australians are able to achieve. How many people have found any long-term work due to this extra $1.3 billion being spent by the government? In 1989 DEET conducted a study of jobstart. This current year $356 million is being allocated to jobstart. Jobstart is a straight-out wage subsidy program, as honourable members would be aware from moving about their electorates and seeing the various programs in action. The study found that only 21 per cent of participants became employed due to these subsidies. A major reason is that wage subsidies push other workers from their positions. We often see this as we move around our electorates. The offer by the government to subsidise certain wage rates encourages firms to put people on for a short time but, unfortllOately, other people leave the job, leave the factories, and we have no improvement in the total position. I ask the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley): what has really changed through these job subsidies? Contrary to DEET's claim in its July Job Report, wage subsidy schemes such as jobstart are least effective during recessions as the bulk of employers are actually reducing their work forces rather than increasing their size. The aim of employment policy should be to create more long-term jobs and not just improve short-term job prospects. There is only one way that this can be done in any sustainable manner. It will not be done by tripling or quadrupling expenditure on labour market programs as this simply does queue"" not work. DEET should be winding back its expenditure on the 62 labour market programs in this whole area of job creation that have been featured over the past 10 years of this disastrous Labor government. Rather than shuffling the unemployed, Australia must try to increase the number of available long-term jobs. We should not be proud of the efforts of the CES in the year just gone when it states in its program performance statements accompanying the budget that in the 1992 calendar year 1.7 million job referrals, over 430,000 placements on - labour market programs, and 320,000 job placements, including some 96,000 subsidised places, were provided. It seems to think it has done something quite good. The Commonwealth's employment agency found real jobs for only a minority of its clients. The number of people with a job in Australia in the year to August increased by only 5,000. This is a real indictment of the job creation potential of the current Labor government. So much for the claims of the Prime Minister (Me Keating) in the One Nation statement that 500,000 new jobs would be created over the next three years. We all knew this would be a fallacy, a false hope for the many unemployed people throughout Australia. We should be incensed that the OECD's July 1993 employment outlook predicts that the 1993 percentage change in Australia's employment opportunities will be only 0.7 per cent and that New Zealand will grow at a suggested 1.1 per cent and the United States at 1.1 per cent. The growth in the number of jobs available to Australians this year will be enough to keep up with the additional number of Australians who are able and willing to work. And Labor concedes that problem. I would like to draw the attention of the chamber to a very important comment made in a recent speech by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, that to achieve an unemployment rate of six per cent by 1999 Australia needs yearly growth in the workplace of three per cent, far above what is happening today, as honourable members would be aware. There is only one way to solve Australia's unemployment dilemma, and that is to facilitate the growth of business investment. Every member on this side of the chamber is aware of that. The program that we put forward as a fundamental premise at the last election was based on that approach. If we concentrate on increasing our spending on CES shuffling of the pack, we are doomed as a nation. The first step in encouraging business investment is for everyone-business, government, welfare groups and individuals-to realise that today's situation is very serious. In 1992-93 there was a fall in new capital expenditure of 1.4 per cent, which came on top of drops of 1.6 per cent, 7.9 per cent and 17.2 per cent in the three years from 1989-90 to 1991-92 inclusive. Those figures demonstrate that in fact investments have fallen quite dramatically and, as a consequence, no new jobs would be created in that business sector. Of course, this is very much below Australia's potential to make this new investment. The lack of new investment emerges from the lack of confidence in the present Prime Minister and the present government. I do not think businesses will be reinvesting in the current climate. Businesses may also think that they can obtain better returns elsewhere, in countries in the South-East Asian region where governments might be seen to be more business friendly and where there are incentives for businesses to invest and to create job opportunities. As Professor Judith Sloan pointed out when she delivered last week's Bert Kelly lecture, not between 1970 and 1992 the only two sectors in Australia where jobs expanded rapidly were the local, state and federal government sector and the service industries. Honourable members would be aware that in the government sector it is changing. For instance, last year alone the Victorian government was forced to shed 20,000 jobs in the government sector because that government could no longer afford the cost of employing those public sector employees. In the current recession businesses have recognised that the only way that they can maintain their profitability is to cut the number of persons employed in their particular business or enterprise. Businesses also know that the taking on of new staff is difficult because of the on-costs and the highly regulated labour market. The training guarantee levy, compulsory employer-funded superannuation which this government will continue to increase to the turn of the century, the holiday leave loading, RDOs and the time spent on form filling to comply with government requirements in areas such as equal opportunity all take many hours and add to the on-costs of giving young Australians jobs. Of course, most young Australians-and most people on the dole queues-would be keen to get a job. They are not too worried about the wages and on-costs that employers have to bear in actually trying to put those people jobs. Even though some of DEET's programs in the labour market area, such as the doubling of spending to $26 million this year on job clubs, might be relatively effective, it is really the main game. The main game is cater increasing Australia's productivity so that Australians can export, compete internationalassistance ly and attract business investment so that businesses will become profitable and be able to create jobs. In its basic way that will Australia make some impact on the millioncurrently plus unemployed persons who have come about under the regime of this current ment.",95
137,Mr LES SCOTT,NOES," profit The No. 1 priority of this government, of course, remains to assist the unemployed get back into the work force. In the meantime it is important that we maintain effective training for these people to enter the work force, and that is what a lot in the budget will actually cover. (The 1993-94 budget contains a number of measures in the employment, education and training area which will directly assist ployed people in their efforts to enter work force. The $120 million increase in spending on employment and training proinvolved grams will be of assistance in promoting employment and training opportunities. Amongst the employment and training measures contained in the budget are the happens quite often. establishment of a $3 million· community activity program, which I particularly welmatching, come; the expansion of the new enterprise incentive scheme, the NElS program, which of course has been very effective; the landcare and environment actiol) program, better known as LEAP; and, of course, group trainwhere ing schemes. The experiences of people in electorate of Oxley with programs such as these prove that they are very effectiv((promoting employment opportunities. The community activity program, which very much welcome, will assist up to 7,000 unemployed people this financial year through a number of pilot programs throughout Austraining. tralia which will enable these people to gain valuable work experience in the t:ommunity into sector. The program will add to the range of opportunities available for unemployed people to maintain their contact with the world of work-a very important component. While the program will have a modest not budget of only $3 million this year and will for some 7,000 people nationally, if it is expanded it has the potential to be of great to a large number of unemployed people, particularly in my region of Ipswich and, of course, nationally. An example of a help successful community volunteer program operating in the Ipswich region is the MATES skilIshare volunteer program for govern the long-term unemployed. The program provides volunteers for noncommunity activity on the basis that the activity involved could not be done by a paid to employee. The coordinator of the program registers individual activities within organisa. tions as suitable for volunteer activity and recognises the need not to disadvantage any of these measures full-time worker. This program avoids any possiQility for exploitation of the unemployed by operating within strict guidelines and meets the requireunemments of the Department of Employment, the Education and Training and the skillshare program. The overriding priority for people in the MATES program remains job searching activity and there is an understanding that if a person received a job interview it had priority over volunteer duties. This "" The emphasis of the program is on job with the coordinator interviewing potential volunteers to find out previous work experience and courses that they have done so that they can use the experience they get from voluntary activity to get a job in an area they have specific training. It gives my them the opportunity to have some hands-on experience in those areas rather than just in finishing a training course and waiting at home for a job to tum un. They have the I opportunity to be working .'1 the community doing something worthwhile and continuing with the skills which they obtained through It is very important that people, particularly the long-term unemployed, are given some incentive, a feeling of belonging to the community. This particular program helps them to do that. When the economy improves these people will again be placed in the work force. The volunteer program is useful in helping to ensure that people maintain skills which they have learnt in their skillshare courses and it also gets unemployed people back into a work routine in an environment where they can hear about potential job opportunities. When they are at home feeling rather depressed, they are missing out on those opportunities because they are not out in the community mixing with other people. Quite often when mixing in the community they find contacts who can help them get back into the work force. The Ipswich MATES skillshare experience, with its own volunteer program, puts the participants in an ideal situation to participate in the new community activity program. I am sure that they will take the opportunities presented. The $19.5 million expansion of the new enterprise incentive scheme that I mentioned earlier, which provides financial assistance and advice for unemployed people who want to establish a small business will, also directly benefit unemployed people in my electorate. I have a major concern about it. It has been a very successful scheme and I very much welcome the initiative by the government in this regard. The extra funding means the creation of an extra 1,651 places this financial year. That is very important. NElS has proven to be one of the federal government's most successful and cost-effective labour market programs. Over 40 new small businesses have started in the Ipswich region in the past two years under the SEVS-NEIS program with a high rate of success. The SEVS element is the state government's part of that joint Commonwealth-state program. The cooperation between the Commonwealth and the Queensland state government is to be commended. Over 70 per cent of the jobs created in recent years have been in the small business sector, and the $19.5 million expansion of the NElS program is therefore an effective way of encouraging employment growth. The expansion of the successful group training schemes is also welcome news for the Ipswich region, containing the Ipswich and Moreton community apprenticeship scheme, better known as IMCAS. They are extremely successful even though every year there are the same problems of having to justify why extra financial assistance is needed to continue. It is one area that I believe we should be promoting even more. Once again, I welcome the initiatives by the government in maintaining the group training schemes. IMCAS has played an important role in finding employment opportunities for young apprentices and trainees who would otherwise be unable to complete their apprenticeships and traineeships. At present, over 100 apprentices are receiving employment through the schet 'P.. IMCAS employs local people who know the area, are familiar with regional employment conditions and have a rapport with the local business community. It is very important to have that two-way communication with the business community in order to place those young people, particularly in the apprenticeship area. Most of the time and resources of the local people are devoted to approaching employers directly to encourage them to employ people rather than wait for people to come to them. Th- Ipswich City Council and the Moreton Shire Council are available as host trainers and they pick up a lot of those people. They should be commended for that. The increased funding for group training schemes will ensure that groups such as IMCAS will continue to play an important part in providing employment and training opportunities right across the nation. It is important that we maintain a lot of apprentices for the long-term employment growth of Australia; The $10 million increase in federal funding for LEAP announced in the federal budget, which will allow the provision of an extra 5,000 places nationwide, will give further scope for the expansion of the program in the Ipswich region. LEAP stands for landcare and environment action program, which has been well received throughout Australia. The extra funding for LEAP means the allocation of 10,000 places in the program in 1993-94, bringing the total number of young people assisted by the program to 15,500. A total 49 young Ipswich people are currently receivopportunity ing on-the-job training in environmental projects under LEAP in the Ipswich region, the parliament. with a further 50 to commence shortly. Participants in the program will learn skills including bush regeneration, plant identificaof tion, weed removal, selective tree planting, landscaping and horticulture, apart from learning a whole lot of other skills. In tion, the young people are undertaking trainlem ing in carpentry, the use of chainsaws and trail construction activities. They will also urer said: undergo off-the-job training at the Ipswich College of TAFE in subjects including plant out identification and culture and landscape practices. The valuable skills which the nearly 100 young people in the Ipswich region will gain from LEAP substantially improve their ability to find employment following the completion of the program. I visited one particular gram recently and discovered that the supervisor in that program was a product of the jobskills program. He is now supervising these young people in this area. It is good see people pass through these programs and assist other young people, particularly in areas of training and employment. The governunderstand ment's labour market programs are just one aspect of its overall employment, education and training strategy. The budget also connation's tained a number of measures in the area of ment. student assistance which will encourage young people from disadvantaged backbehind grounds to continue with their education. Over the past six years the number of students receiving some form of assistance has increased by over 236,000. The budget for the government's student assistance program has doubled since 1987, resulting a 21 per cent increase in the percentage secondary students, and a nine per cent increase in the percentage of tertiary students receiving student assistance. The government's programs in the area of employment, education and training represent an integrated package designed to give the unemployed and students the employment, education and training opportunities which they need to become part of the full-time of work force. It is my pleasure to have the to speak in the committee stage this evening and support the matters before",97
138,Mr EVANS,NOES,"Cowan) (11.07 p.m.}-The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in the first few words his budget speech said quite chuffedly that it was a budget about jobs. He told parliament that the government's commitment to the addisolution to the growing unemployment probin Australia, now some 11.1 per cent, was a priority of the government. The TreasToo many are out of work. Too many have been of work for too long. The primary objective of nursery and this budget is jobs. The Treasurer went on to outline his desire to provide a further fiscal stimulus to the economy hoping that jobs will eventuate and wait for the rest of the world to recover to help solve our long-term problems. What happens proif the world does not recover? In these brief and simple words, the Treasurer has given a very clear indication of how he interprets the current challenges Iaced by to our country. Although he may think himself sincere in his deliberations over the budget, it becomes plainly obvious that he does not fully the machinations of business and is underbriefed when it comes to understanding the challenge and solutions to our greatest problem, that of unemployI am at a loss to understand the motives his assertion that this budget will improve the opportunities for employers to employ when clearly it increases overhead expenses, thus diminishing the motivation for employing people. Which employer would act so irrationally that he would set out immediin ately to employ people when he has increased of overheads, limited opportunity to negotiate with staff, as proposed by the ACTU, and the indirect costs of employing someone ever increasing? It seems that the Treasurer and, for that matter, most of his comrades opposite have just missed the point when it comes to financial responsibility. Any budget conscious homemaker will simply tell those opposite that one way to go broke very quickly is to spend more than is earned. This is what the Treasurer proposes, although under the guise of improving employment conditions. It is bunkum to suggest that employers will act irrationally and play fast and loose with the company till and employ when overheads have increased as a consequence of this budget. When it comes to unemployment, before we can solve the problem we first have to understand the probable cause and then seek consensus on a solution, not the paternalistic big stick approach so dominant throughout the history of the Australian Labor Party and its fellow traveller, the ACTU. In March this year Mr R. G. Gregory of the ANU said that Australian job losses within the employment market have been very considerable over the last 20 years and have seemed to concentrate on the male group. After adjusting for population growth, one in four male full-time jobs have disappeared since 1970. Women have done absolutely and relatively better than men in obtaining employment during this period. However, it would be a wrong assumption to suggest that the fall in male employment was attributed to the increase in female participation. From the peak of employment in 1929 to the depth of the Great Depression in 1933 the unemployment population fell by 12 per cent-approximately half the fall in the male full-time employment population ratio between 1970 and 1983. At the beginning of 1993, unemployment in Australia was at its highest level since the 1930s. Average unemployment rates increased from the so-called dark years of the 1960s at 1.8 per cent to 3.6 per cent in the 1970s, and 7.2 per cent in the 1980s. During this period the OECD, which the Treasurer and Prime Minister (Mr Keating) so proudly quote, had similar experiences, but viewed on a decade by decade basis, Australia's deteriorating unemployment performance is amongst the worse. The biggest job loss is within the middle job market. This market is the middle 60 per cent of the job market and covers mostly non-managerial positions. Most growth in employment has been in the high and low paying jobs. To further highlight the difficult position our country is faced with, if male full-time employment in non-managerial jobs from 1976 to 1990 had kept pace with population growth, there would have been a net employment growth of 31 per cent. Instead, we have a growth of seven per cent. All this small growth has occurred within the high and low paid markets, thus placing more pressure upon the middle group. One of the reasons we should consider for the loss of employment in the middle group is the reduction of the manufacturing sector where importing has increased over the past few decades. Furthermore, there is a tendency for manufacturers to move towards technology, also increasing the job loss within the middle employment group, which seems concentrated within the manufacturing industries. The strong reduction downward employment trend in the middle pay occupations is surprising in a mature, wealthy economy and, generally, would not be expected to fall behind population growth and behave in the same way as in the low pay occupations. The fact is that it has. What is the government doing about it? The accord-like most moves towards centralised wage fixing-was expected to compress wage relativities and thus increase employment in the middle of the earnings distribution and reduce employment growth in the bottom and top segments. But it seems to have had no effect other than to reduce real wage levels. Would it surprise those on the government benches to realise that the real wages for those with low earnings have fallen 10 per cent since 1985 and are now 10 per cent below 1976 levels, and real wages in the top 10 per cent have also fallen since 1985 to be equal with 1976 levels? So the accord and the subterfuge of being the workers' party has lost its meaning to the ALP and the ACTU. Another attempt at solving the problem has been the desire of the government to increase education standards so that the unemployed could more readily enter the work force. Many education planners, including the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), have stressed the need for a better qualified work force and advocate the need for university graduates. However, most job growth has been in the low pay jobs and there is no evidence that the economy has been generating employment demands for an increasing proportion of well educated graduates. The middle market jobs are just not there for the university leavers. Since 1976 the average number of years of schooling of a full-time work force has increased by one year from 11.6 to 12.5 years, yet wages for non-managerial male workers have not increased in real terms. It is often argued that because the unemployed are unskilled, it is the unskilled jobs that are disappearing. Consequently, many advocate-including the government, and most specifically the minister-that if skills were to be increased within the unskilled unemployed, they would then have access to the middle level jobs. However, it is the middle level jobs that are disappearing. The unskilled are unemployed not only because unskilled occupations are disappearing, but because employees from the disappearing middle level are taking jobs that were previously held by the unskilled. Displaced workers from the middle pay jobs cannot move into the high pay jobs in any significant numbers because those high pay jobs are just not there. If the middle group workers are displacing lower level unskilled workers, as the job loss is primarily in the middle group, then unemployment is likely to be long term. Therefore, the notion of educating our unskilled worker is not necessarily impacting on reducing unemployment-and it will not, unless the government addresses the middle pay group employment opportunities and provides incentive to employ in this category. But what has the Treasurer done? He certainly has not addressed the challenge of unemployment in a sustainable sense. He has not shown any inventiveness in providing incentives to business to provide long-term employment opportunities and, therefore, strategies. The challenge, in my view, cannot readily be solved through fiscal resolutions, as is badly attempted in the Treasurer's budget; rather, it requires an entire rethink on the way we do business. We are in the midst of a major worldwide shift from industrialisation to information or knowledge based industries. Yet the government, supported by the ACTU, continues to move towards the archaic rules governing industrialisation. The times require us to be flexible, and it is time that the government addressed the challenges of the future. The future is nothing but tomorrow, yet this government seems more interested in yesterday. The Treasurer has not addressed unemployment in any real sense within this budget, and it remains to be seen how the government will address the other challenges it will be faced with over the next few weeks. I do not believe that the government is capable of under. standing our nation's challenges until it repeals the paternalistic thinking that dogs its history. Unfortunately, too many unemployed Australians will suffer whilst the goVernment seeks wisdom.",99
139,Mr GRIFFIN,NOES,"Corinella) (11.16 p.m.)Australia's language is important to the development of Australia as a nation. Australia's language is also important to the citizens of Australia in terms of their access to jobs, education and training opportunities and their participation in the broader life of the nation. Following a process commenced in 1990, the government was able to finalise a white paper which has been supported with significant funding in the context of the last three budgets. The policies of this government have focused on improving English language skills amongst Australians, particularly those adults-perhaps a million adults-who do not at the moment have effective reading and writing skills in English. Specific m-asures in this year's budget include $11.4 million for workplace literacy programs; over $20 million for TAFE sector literacy programs; and $2.4 million for the establishment of a national languages and literacy institute. The report also resulted in a significant increase in the funding for the adult migrant education program to ensure that new arrivals to this country who do not speak, read or write English will have an opportunity to do so. The white paper also concentrated on the school system. Before the changes of governyear ment in Victoria and Western Australia, we had agreement with state ministers to ensure that there would be a better assessment of literacy skills amongst kids in primary so that we could not only measure the skills of kids at the end of primary school, but also identify those who have difficulties and take others remedial action. This particular plemented the national curriculum profile processes that would have ensured a minimum standard across the country in schools-a minimum standard that did not prevent any schools or school systems setting higher standards. It is a shame that this major reform has been scuttled by the irresponsible actions of Liberal state governments. This policy also makes the point that, Australia's participation in the world comdemands munity, both as a trading nation and as a participant in the Asia-Pacific region, we to do more about second language learning in Australia. It is for that reason that we have seen the writing of a curriculum for foreign language learning in Australian now a new incentive scheme to encourage the learning of second languages up to year 12. This will mean that between now and the of the century an additional 150,000 people will be studying a second language at secondary school. Many of the government's responses to literacy issue stem from a report tabled in Senate in 1991 from the Senate Standmg Committee on Employment, Education and totally Training on literacy needs in the workplace. The importance of the report was in its million recognition of the need for lifelong learning in a rapidly changing information based and technologically driven world. I wish to phasise particularly recommendation 17 of the report, which concerns early intervention, - nd recommendation 18, that all students leavmg school should be literate. Before doing so, the following background information is, I believe, relevant. the Australian Council for Educational Research conducted a literacy survey of 10 year olds and 14 year olds in Australian schools. The total test was mastered by 71 per cent of the 10 year olds and 83 per cent of the 14 olds. This follows a similar national survey in 1975. There was no significant area in which student performance at either age level declined in those five years. However, school the report pointed out: While some will wish to emphasise the high proportions of students who could do most - sks, will be most concerned about the ePucatlOnal and social consequences for the students who are reform comunable to do some tasks. Despite the emphasis placed on literacy by schools, the number of adults who have difficulty accomplishing everyday literacy tasks is unacceptably high. The first national survey of adult literacy was conducted in 1989. That report found that at least 10 per cent of the adult population-more than one million adults-are estimated to be functionfor ally illiterate in English in terms of the of contemporary Australian society. About 700,000 of those people are of English need speaking background and about 300,000 of . non-English speaking background. The alarming cost to the nation of these functionally illiterate Australians has been estimated at at schools and least $3.5 billion. However, there is no doubt that the starting point to remedy literacy problems lies in our turn education system. The committee report young quoted a submission which states: An adult with literacy problems has first been a child with literacy problems. the In recommendation 17, and indirectly in - he recommendation 18, the committee has made a strong case for early intervention. It is unacceptable that between one million and 1.8 million of a population of some 17 Australians are functionally illiterate. In a nation that has as its greatest challenge the need to be internationally competitive, it emis totally unacceptable that between $3.5 billion and possibly as much as $6.5 billion is lost in productiyity because of basic literacy problems. Not only do we need to catch up with the clever countries like Japan and Germany but also we need to create an edge In 1980, to get in front. The recommendations in the report suggest a wide course of actions, but the key to the successful implementation of those recommendations will be the urgent need to address the largely unmet needs of the foundation stone of our education system-the Australian school systems. Unless those needs are met, all attempts at redressing this nation's literacy problems will be wrongly focused and the results will be highly marginalised. Adult and community education is also a policy area that this government is addressing in a positive fashion. Most recent government action in this sector has come as a result of a report from the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. This report entitled Come in Cinderella: the emergence of adult and community education was an initiative of this government and was the first of its kind since 1944. The report documents the scope of the adult and community education sector and its contribution to the personal development of individuals and the educational, economic and social well-being of the nation. Adult and community education responds to the needs of a diverse client group: from the early schoolleaver with a need for basic education, to the professional seeking continuing education, to women returning to the work force. It can already number six out of 10 adult Australians as past or present clients and it is growing faster than any other area of education. The sector provides educational opportunity where it has previously been denied and creates pathways into further education and training for those otherwise denied access. Through its community houses and networks, it also bridges the health, welfare and education divide and demonstrates how interdependent education, health and welfare really are. While recognising the scope and complexity of the sector, the committee also characterised it as consumer driven, client responsive, flexible, non-compulsory and performing an important compensatory role. At the same time, the committee found that the sector's clients increasingly want recognition of the work they undertake either for employment or further study. On 22 August 1992 the government's response to the report was tabled in the Senate and there have been further developments since then. Consistent with the report's recommendations, the government has endorsed the establishment of a working party to develop a national policy for the sector, reviewed what arrangements might be appropriate within NBEET to cover the sector, set up a unit within the Department of Employment, Education and Training to provide a focal point for the development of Commonwealth policy concerning the sector and agreed that the issue of funding for the sector needs to be reviewed as part of the development of a national policy, while considering that the self-funding and project based nature of the sector should not change in a significant way. State and federal education ministers have agreed in principle that the national involvemeqt in the sector should become part of the responsibilities of the Australian National Training Authority. This is expected to occur from 1 January 1994. They also agreed to the setting up of a joint AEC-MOVEET-working party to assume the role of developing national policy for the sector. The Commonwealth government has also responded to the sector's needs with funding of $600,000 a year for the next three years to encourage the adult and community education sector to increase its efficiency and professionalism. There are two components to the funding. Firstly, the Australian Association of Adult and Community Education will act as a focal point for Commonwealth contact with the sector and will be involved in developing strategies to address specific sector needs. Additional core funding of $150,000 a year for the next three years has been allocated to facilitate this role. The second component, which has $450,000 a year allocated to it, aims to address needs that are not being addressed through ongoing funding sources. This money is being used to support efforts to: encourage management training for community provider administrations; improve networking. within the community and adult education sector; provide seed funding for the revising and accrediting of the sector's curriculum materials to reflect competency based training approaches; and development of marketing campaigns to that support each of these elements, in particular, networking and competency based materials. Honourable members may be aware that when the department advertised for the subquarterly mission of proposals relating to the above objectives, over 350 copies of the program guidelines were mailed out to inquirers, which reflects the very high level of interest for initiative within the sector. However, the development of the sector is not primarily function of government involvement or assistance. Rather, the challenge is for sector to maintain customer orientation, client focus and flexibility, and its capacity to offer individuals a second chance in the education arena, while increasing the professionalism its members, the quality of programs and, where feasible, the consistency of educational outcomes in terms of national competencies, credit and articulation. One of the hallmarks of the sector is its fierce independence; this is also its strength. While the federal government has recognised the importance of the sector and is taking positive fiscal and policy steps to address needs, the capacity of the sector to address these issues is of greater importance to long-term growth and vitality than any role governments could sensibly play.",101
140,Mr NEHL,NOES,"In the little time that is available to me before adjournment at 11.30 p.m., I want to speak about",104
141,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,Mr Snow)The honourable member will have the full time for his speech.,104
142,Mr NEHL,NOES,"You are most generous; I am delighted to hear that. Thank you. I will start by talking about unemployment on the north coast of New South Wales. Last week I was this listening to my friend and colleague the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) speaking about unemployment in his electorgovernment ate. I went into a slight state of shock because he was lamenting the fact that some of towns have an unemployment rate of eight per cent and some nine per cent. While I am sure that these rates are most unsatisfactory for people in that electorate, when we compare situation with what is happening on the north coast of New South Wales, it is really curriculum quite a surprise. In the March quarterly unemployment figures, which I believe are the most recent figures available, Kempsey has an unemployment rate of 21.9 per cent, up from 18.5 per cent on the previous quarter; Bellingen has an unemployment rate of 21 per cent, this up by 2.5 per cent; Coffs Harbour has an unemployment rate of 19.2 per cent, up by a three per cent; Nambucca Heads has an unemployment rate of 19 per cent, up by 4.2 the per cent. That is basically very close to double the national unemployment average. The Department of Social Security figures show the number of people on unemployment of benefits as of August in the Coffs Harbour area as 5,776 and in the Kempsey area, 3,829. It is a bit worrying that, in the past 12 months, the Kempsey rate has increased by 12.8 per cent and the Coffs Harbour rate by 9.9 per cent. It does illustrate the fact that unemployment on the north coas- of New South Wales is, in reality, a growth industry. If people have to be unemployed, they would its much rather be unemployed in an area which the CSIRO describes as having the optimum its climate for the human animal and where the costs of living are far less than in, say, Queanbeyan, represented by you, Mr Deputy Chairman, where the heating costs are so the much higher. On the north coast of New South Wales that is one of the elements which is a significant factor in keeping costs down. Equally, clothing costs are cheaper because there is not the stress of the cold winters. Fresh fish, fruit and vegetables are much cheaper as well. We have a situation where unemployment is booming. The sad thing is that this budget, failed budget, this budget of betrayal, has absolutely nothing in it to create employment. I cannot understand how the people on the benches believe we can increase employment by increasing the costs of busihis ness. That is all this budget has done. The government has increased the costs of business by increasing the fuel excise levy and the sales tax. Surely it should have learnt by now. After all, it had a very close look at Fightback in the lead-up to the last election. The government studied it very carefullyand, of course, it has pinched quite a bit of it already. But it has not seized upon the salient fact that if it wants to help business expand and create jobs, it has to reduce the costs so businesses can be more competitive against imported goods and more competitive on - export markets. I am afraid that the north coast of New South Wales is a prime example of the failure of this government to do anything which will actually create jobs. The unemployment level on the north coast creates a lot of jobs in itself. Our friends in the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service are some people whose employment is owed to the growth in unemployment. People who put petrol in cars, those who work in supermarkets, doctors and nurses, also have been provided with a fair share of their employment by the unemployed people of the north coast. I want to make it quite clear that we have to have a turnaround in this country; we have to have a different culture and we have to believe that it is not good enough to train people to be the best trained unemployed work force in the world. This is what we are doing. If we are to talk about the long-term unemployed, the figures on the north coast are equally as bad. I do not want to get into statistics, because the 'po in politics stands people. We are talking about real peoplemothers, fathers, and kids living in families where there is no breadwinner at all. It is very sad. It breaks my heart to come across so many people in this situation. Quite frankly, while the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might get carried away with his republic and other things, ordinary people in Australia could not care less. They are concerned about the economy and a job. Above all, they are concerned about the future of their children. We now have a much higher school retention rate-and that is a good thing. More and more people want to go to university. Of course, not all of them can get there. But what is the point of all this education for them? I believe that, widespread throughout our community, there is an aura of sadness and despair, and it is something that we as members of this chamber should be addressing. The statistics can be carried away, but when it is boiled down we are talking about individual people. I would also like to talk about the university at Coffs Harbour. It is a very exciting project and, as from 1 January 1994, the existing Lismore based university, which is part of the extended University of New England, and the existing Coffs Harbour based campus of the University of New England will merge into a university for and of the north coast of New South Wales. That is a great thing for the whole of the north coast. As well as having the two campuses at Lismore and Coffs Harbour, it will incorporate open learning access centres in the 1\veed, Grafton and Hastings areas. I am not loath at this minute to forecast that in the fullness of time we will have full campuses of the university of the north coast in Port Macquarie and in Grafton. We will have open learning access centres in places like Kempsey to serve the whole of the north coast. I am on a pretty safe bet in making that forecast. As time goes by, the university will extend from the two initial campuses and we will have a series of campuses up and down the north coast. The new university will be for sponsored by the University of New South Wales for three years. I would like to make a special comment about the Coffs Harbour campus. The students who are studying and graduating from there are doing at least as well as students at Armidale and Lismore. In many cases they are doing better. Next year the new university will have 4,500 Commonwealth funded places and a further 1,000 places privately funded or industry sponsored. Coffs Harbour will have 440 equivalent full time places next year - The current Coffs Harbour student population is 330 equivalent full time places, represented by 500 people undertaking courses at that campus. That will double by 1996 and will climb to almost 800 student places by 1998. I believe that those estimates are conservative and that as time goes by we will see the Coffs Harbour campus continue to grow at a greater rate. The new university will be provided with an additional 90 student places for both 1994 and 1995, and at least 140 of these 180 new places will be provided in Coffs Harbour. The Coffs Harbour intake' for 1994 will be 215. The growth in university places is good news for potential students on the north coast-not just Coffs Harbour but the full north coast region-because it will be serving the whole of the region and it will provide increased access to university studies for a great many people who, because of geographical circumstances at present, do not have the opportunity of getting that study. I am very pleased to see that the university will put on five additional full time staff next year, a further five in 1995 and a further five in 1996. The new university will spend $3'.3 million on operations in Coffs Harbour next year. That is a very significant boost to the local economy. By 1996 this will increase to more than $6 million. Next year's direct university contribution to the local economy will be close to $70 million, with student spending and capital expenditure at Hogbin Drive. The indirect contribution is estimated at more like $50 million. It is a very significant economic input, a very significant educational input and I look forward to the university of the north coast continuing to grow and expand. Progress reported. NA Motion (by Mr Baldwin) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Pensioners: Shareholdings",104
143,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"It is interesting that the comments that I have to make in the adjournment debate this evening are quite relevant to the minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), because I am about to read a letter from one .of my constituents who has expressed a great deal of concern about the actions of the Department of Social Security in its treatment of not only pensioner shareholdings, but also managed investments in the current formula that it is using to assess pensions on a fortnightly basis. It is good that the minister is at the table because during the numerous debates that we had relating to the treatment of pensioner shareholdings we were graced with the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) most of the time. This letter is from Mr Clive Woolcott of 24 River Street, Taree. He has addressed his letter to the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of the parliament of' Australia. It reads: Dear Sir, I condemn the actions of the Minister for Social Security for implementing a punitive tax on pensioners who are forced to use financial advisers to help them service overdepression. Retirement was supposed to be a time of relaxation and pleasure. Now our government through its pursuit of J curves and other financial disasters have reduced our living income to under half of what we tried to provide for. Your un-Australian legislation is not a ""fair go"" as we all know it, and I seek a repeal of the unjust measures. Yours faithfully Clive H. Woolcott Mr Woolcott is expressing the concerns of numerous of my constituents who have become. quite confused, very nervous and worried about the measures that the Department of Social Security is taking. Each fortnight they are being reassessed with a complicated formula. I took the opportunity of asking a couple of representatives from the Department of Social Security to explain the formula to me in my office. It can vary, and does vary, on a fortnightly basis. People on pensions who have small amounts of money invested in managed investment trusts do not know from one fortnight to the next what actual income they have to live on, so they are finding it very difficult to budget. I have not had just one or two constituent inquiries coming into my office on this matter, I have had many. As you may be aware, Mr Speaker, in the electorate of Lyne 40 per cent of the population are retired. Many of these people were concerned initially about the capital appreciation of their small shareholdings being treated as income. Now we are finding-as of early September-that people with money in investment trusts are having a great deal of difficulty in budgeting. These people are very disillusioned with the government. When they retired they went to their financial advisers with their retirement money and they were advised to invest in these managed investment trusts. Their complaint is that the government has moved the goalposts unjustly and they feel that they are being treated unjustly. Now they are being forced into a much lower standard of living than they were accustomed to when they were working. It is a lower standard of living than they budgeted for when they retired under the rules of the day before the government moved the goalposts forcing them into this much lower living standard. I put those concerns of Mr Woolcott before the House. RAAF Base Amberley",106
144,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Oxley) (11.41 p.m.)The RAAF Base Amberley has played an important part in the life of the Ipswich region for well over 50 years, as most honourable members in this House would realise. Last year, celebrations were held at Amberley to acknowledge 50 years of service to the Australian Defence Force by No. 3 Aircraft Depot and 482 Maintenance Squadron and to acknowledge the fonnation of 501 Wing, which is the RAAF's newest and biggest unit. On 15 September this year, No. 38 squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force based at RAAF Amberley celebrated the 50th anniversary of its fonnation, which makes it the only squadron with 50 years of continuous service in the RAAP. No. 38 Squadron was fonned at the RAAF Richmond base, New South Wales, with Lockheed Hudson MkIV aircraft on 15 September 1943. It was reequipped with Douglas Dakota DC3s in 1944 and 1945, and with de Havilland Caribou in 1964, which are still flying today. From the beginning, No. 38 Squadron built a tradition of hard work, and that hard work continues today. The squadron has an outstanding record of service to the Australian people in the Indian and Pacific oceans in 1944 and 1945, as well as the Berlin airlift in 1948, supplying and servicing the Australian component of the occupation forces in Japan, and operations during the Malayan emergency. Other fields of operation have included training ground and air crews during the Vietnam War, supporting the Pacific Island Regiment in Papua New Guinea between 1965 and 1975, and other operations in India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. A particular source of pride for the No. 38 Squadron is the fact that one of its Dakotas was the first RAAF aircraft into Singapore after the surrender of Japan. No. 38 Squadron's exemplary record of duty extends into peacetime activities. Its versatile Caribous and their predecessors have been involved in various commitments including flood relief, cyclone relief, bushfire patrols, search and rescue, medical mercy flights, fisheries surveillance, rain-making experiments and grasshopper plague eradication. That is a great record. Throughout its history, No. 38 Squadron has been involved extensively in VIP transport duties. Following the end of the Second World War, the squadron helped evacuate prisoners of war from Bangkok, Singapore and Borneo, and was involved in a number of transport operations. No. 38 Squadron is at present actively engaged in any support and operates detachments throughout Australia and South East Asia. On Saturday, 18 September, the members of No. 38 Squadron conducted an open day for family and friends at RAAF base Amberley. In addition to events on the base, there was a fly-past of all the No. 38 Squadron aircraft over Ipswich and Brisbane.",107
145,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,Were you there?,107
146,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, I certainly was there. I was very pleased to be invited to participate in that day, and I will get to that in a moment. The day's activities culminated in a hangar buffet, attended by over 300 ex-members of the squadron, in addition to present personnel and invited guests, among which I was extremely pleased and honoured to be included. Amongst the ex-members .were original members of No. 38 Squadron, who would have seen active service in World War II. It was certainly great to see some of those older former members joining in the activities to celebrate such an important anniversary of the No. 38 Squadron. I would like to thank the commanding officer of No. 38 Squadron, Wing Commander John Benjamin, as well as the officers and enlisted personnel, for the hospitality that extended to me during the open day, and, of course, to all those people in the community who had the opportunity to attend. It was certainly a pleasure to take part in the celebrathe tions for the 50th anniversary of the formation of this historic squadron. As I said earlier, it has 50 years of continuous service, which is unique within the Air Force. It is the only squadron that can claim to have those 50 years of continuous service. Whilst many other squadrons have had many outstanding years of service, their service has been broken. I believe that the history of the No. 38 Squadron has been one of service and dedication to duty. I would like to put on record my congratulations to all those who have served in No. 38 Squadron and who have kept up its fine traditions. I offer my congratulations to all those people for the contribution they have made to the Australian Defence Force over those 50 years. Victoria: Flooding",107
147,Mr LIEBERMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Indi) (11.46 p.m.}-I rise on the adjournment to draw to the attention of members in the House, particularly those in the government, the fact that the floods in north-east Victoria, in my electorate, have devastated many communities. At this moment in Wangaratta, the people involved in helping to control the spread of the flood are desperately trying to prevent more houses from being submerged. The position is that the police and SES services of Victoria, the CFA, members of the Army establishments in northern Victoria, along with many volunteers are adding sandbags to the levee banks as the two rivers coming into Wangaratta-the Ovens and the King-have reached capacity and already the floods are at a level which exceeds the highest recorded level ever. ""That is a blow to everyone because after the last high in the 1970s levee banks were built which were expected to contain any known flood. It appears that they are inadequate. Honourable members would have noticed the publicity yesterday about the city of Benalla being almost totally submerged. they When I was there yesterday the whole of the main street was under water. Every shop in the main street had been subjected to very serious flooding. Windows had broken due to pressure of the water against them. Hundreds of families had been evacuated through the previous night in the city of Benalla. They were being sheltered in the school buildings in Benalla. At one stage I understand that three feet of water was flowing through one of those schools where the families had been brought. They were pretty wet and miserable when I saw them, but their spirit was still good and they were all very concerned for others, not so much for themselves, which is an attribute of the people of Australia which I admire. The tragedy for north-east Victoria is that this flood, which has been described by senior members of the State Emergency Service as the worse natural disaster in Victoria since Ash Wednesday, will leave communities, farmers, townspeople, business people and families in a position where, frankly, they will not be able to cope with the financial cost of restoring their properties and their stock. I believe that there will be substantial hardship. I naturally welcome the fact that the Victorian government has declared the area an emergency area and that funding is available-for example, up to $700 per household-for immediate cash requirements for the families. There is also a limited amount of money available, subject to means tests, to help towards restoration of buildings, but it is a very small amount. Regrettably, many of the people will find that,even though they had insurance on their buildings, this particular occurrence will not be covered. It occurs to me that one of the more useful things that this parliament might be able to do, perhaps through one of its committees, is examine the current relevance and suitability of insurance in Australia. I recognise that insurance cannot be provided willy-nilly because of the risk factor, but the problems experienced in Australia in obtaining adequate cover against diasters such as this should be examined in a contemporary sense by the parliament in the hope that some recommendations can be put forward which might make the insurance available more relevant and more useful. Australia is a cruel country with its droughts, fires and floods. It is inevitable that problems, such the one I am describing, will continue to occur. We must look to the future in that regard. I also inform the House of the contribution made by all the volunteers-the SES, Red Cross, the CWA, and the police-towards helping the communities involved in this desperate situation. I hope that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will be able to visit the electorate quickly and see the situation for himself because the nation should be helping financially. I was pleased to hear that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) will be coming down with me on Friday to visit the electorate and look at the extent of the damage. (TIme expired) Feral Animals",108
148,Mr HORNE,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, much has been said in recent times about ecotourism .. People from all over the world want to experience the natural holiday-pure water, fresh air, a healthy outdoor experience where one can communicate with nature and not witness the sort of human interference that has degraded our indigenous environment. We boast to our offshore visitors that such venues abound in this country and we, the natives, nod our approval. But do they exist here? I happened to be at a caucus committee meeting today where we discussed the possibility of importing dogs and cats, and the rules applying to such importations. I raised an objection on the grounds that there were already too many dogs and cats in this country. Consequently, I went to the library this evening to research the problem Australia faces from feral animals. Firstly, we need to define 'feral animal'. Most of us recognise that rabbits, foxes, pigs and goats are feral animals, and that from time to time and from place to place they will pose a major threat to our environment. But how many Australians really understand what danger their little moggy poses to native fauna, or what their pet bitch can produce pretty when mated with a successful feral dog? Cats generally kill animals up to their own as size, such as possums and rabbits-we even released thousands of them last century to counteract a rabbit plague-but they also kill koalas, lizards and birds. All those creatures are prey to the common cat. The average cat weighs about four kilograms and needs 300 grams of fresh meat each day. That converts to about 70 native animals and birds per week, or 3,600 per annum. Domestic cats are predators, and in the garden or about the home they will kill native animals when the opportunity arises. Add to that the fact that the average tabby can have three litters a year with an average of five kittens per litter and we start to appreciate the scope of the problem. Female cats are capable of reproducing from the age of 12 months. As a former teacher of science, I am a strong believer in the process of evolutionthe survival of the fittest and the natural advantage of the most able. That is a law of nature, and that law is being expressed by some of these domestic animals gone wild. Cats of much larger than normal size have been captured in the wild. That shows how successful they have been. Feral cats are frequently infected with disease, some of which can be transmitted to domestic cats, livestock and even humans. They have the potential to carry rabies if it were ever accidentally introduced· into Australia. This is not intended to be a denigration of felis domestus-I appreciate how people can be fond of such an animal-I just wish to point out the damage they pose to the environment. (Feral dogs pose a similar problem. The name 'dingo' has been applied generally to feral dogs, but in many cases the genetic linkage does not lead to the indigenous dingo. Significant populations of feral dogs appear to be cyclic. But in my own electorate, deer, goats, sheep and horses have all suffered attack from dogs-single dogs and packs of dogs. Disease is also a major risk posed by the presence of feral dogs; not the least Canada. important is hydatids. The history of introduced animals into Australia is not a proud one. Some 26 species, as a minimum, have been ranging up and down our countryside for the past 200 years, taking advantage of species that have not had to adapt to this new type of only has to think of the cane toad as a more obnoxious member of this group. But these animals are not restricted to dwelling species. Introduced fish are posing a major threat to our native fish. The common European carp is a particularly voracious predator that has placed many freshwater species at risk. This country has two centuries of environmental vandalism to overcome. Let us set to and rectify that problem as Above all, let us not exacerbate the situation. As a nation, we should accept our responsiTasmania bilities. I call upon the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to place toughest possible restriction on the importaratio tion of carnivorous animals into Australia.",109
149,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Bass) (11.56 p.m.) that - I draw to the attention of the House that while the children of Tasmania, in particular, are generally well catered for by a broad range of education and health programs, there is, however, a small but significant group for whom the system does not cater. These children have autism, which is a neurointegrative dysfunction. It is therefore very fortunate that a small committee of interested parents of these children has seen fit to do something about the problems faced by their children and other people's children who have autism and related disabilities. They have discovered a program called giant steps, which is running very successfully in Canada, British Colombia and Connecticut in the United States. Giant steps was founded by Ms Darlene Berringer, who recently Tasmania. She has agreed to give her endorsement and professional support for the setting up of such a centre and to assist with the training of staff. This pilot would be a satellite of the giant steps centre in Montreal, In Tasmania, the proposed site is the beautiful rural town of Deloraine, which is approximately 30 minutes from Launceston and within commuting distance of the north-west coast of Tasmania. The children will benefit ,greatly when the program is placed in such a predator. One 'rural environment. Local community and service groups, such as Rotary and Lions, have demonstrated a land keen interest in the project. The number of children planned for 1994 is 15. Some of them will be attending part-time-thus, the equivalent is 11.5-with staffing to be on a one-to-one basis. The estimated budgeted start-up cost amounts to $122,000, with first year operating costs of $561,000. Child numbers will increase at an estimate of 20 by best we can. 1995 to 30 by 1999. The giant steps centre will be unique to and, indeed, Australia. Giant steps will initially involve threeto 13-year-olds in the Tasmania. It is generally accepted that the of those affected with autism is about six to 10,000, thus making it more common than blindness and nearly as common as deafness. Autism Extrapolating the incidence of it thus indicates about 60 children in this age group in the Tasmanian community have classical autism. These figures do not indicate other children with neurointegrative dysfunction. These figures alone are evidence enough of· the demand for such a service. These children have specialised needs that can be met only by innovative techniques not available in the regular school system. In summary, it is felt by many of the parents of these children that their present placements are the best fit within the existing system-but they are far from appropriate for each child. Therefore, I commend to the House the giant steps concept. I will continue with my efforts to assist them towards giving special education needs to a special group of visited young Australians. Question resolved in the affirmative.

150,Mr BRERETON,PAPERS,"The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the NA following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am advised that the 113 Chinese nationals who landed at Christmas Island in October 1992 were the victims of a scheme to buy passage to Australia, where they were led to believe they could work and earn high wages. While we have no hard evidence of an immigration racket operating, loose links have been established between the four boats which reached Australia from the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the period December 1991 to October 1992. The focal point for the orgruiisation of the boats and the recruitment of passengers was Beihai, a small port city in Quangxi Province, and nearby towns and cities. Over the last decade or so Beihai has been prominent as a staging point for the flow of Vietnamese boat people and others joining that flow. In the last few months, it has been the organisation and assembly point for Sino-Vietnamese resettled in China who have left China by boat for Hong Kong. We have only a partial understanding of the organisation of the boats to Australia and the recruitment of passengers, and boat arrivals have generally been unexpansive on this issue. What has emerged is that significant organisers have not travelled on the boats, and passengers have generally advised that they paid amounts of around 4000 RMB ($A1050) for the journey, with some recruiters, organisers and crew apparently receiving free or discounted passage. Internationally, the US is the principal target of groups engaged in the illegal movement of PRC nationals, although some European countries are also affected. Passage costs to the US are around $US30-35,000, often with a downpayment of a few thousand dollars and the remainder paid after arrival in the US. The flow to the US is also highly concentrated, with almost all those entering the US coming from Fukien province, and the organisation of the smuggling concentrated in Fuzhou City. The smugglers involved in the US trade are reaping huge profits from what is reportedly a billion dollar business, and their links into organised criminaL groups have been widely reported. PRC authorities have acknowledged the problem of illegal migration and have implemented a series of measures aimed at discouraging illegal departures. These include investigating the activities of smugglers and prosecuting organisers and others involved in the illegal movement of people; the dissemination of information about the dangers of illegal migration through the local media and increased coastal patrols to apprehend boats departing illegally. Australia maintains close liaison with regional governments, including the PRC Government, about the illegal movement of people throughout the region. We have received close cooperation on the provision of, information on specific boat movements, and the return to the PRC of those who do not engage our international protection obligations. (2) The total cost to the Commonwealth of dealing with the 113 boat people who landed on Christmas Island was $359,500. This includes travel, salaries, overtime, accommodation and fares for staff and interpreters; food, accommodation and medical costs for the boat people; the destruction of the boat for public health reasons; and charter of an aircraft for repatriation. (3) No. (4) After a lull in boat arrivals of some years, there have been 654 unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia since 1989. (5) As at 28 July 1993, of the 654 unauthorised boat arrivals since 1982, and their 29 Australian-born children: (a) 457 are still in Australia (a) (i) none is awaiting determination claims (a) (ii) 152 have been granted entry permits and are in Australia lawfully (a) (iii) 305 are not lawfully in Australia, of whom 19 escaped custody and have not since been relocated (b) 226 have left Australia . (c) of the 152 lawfully in Australia, 140 have been granted refugee status. Others owe their legal status to dependency on a person who has been granted refugee status, or to marriage with an Australian citizen or permanent resident. (6) The total cost to the Commonwealth of accommodating, processing and dealing with boat arrivals, excluding the cost of legal assistance and litigation, is as follows: 1989/90-$607,800 1990/91-$5,547,000 1991/92-$7,443,750 1992/93-$8,003,000 (7) The total cost to the Commonwealth of legal assistance to boat arrivals is as follows: 1991/92-$778,030 1992/93-$773,553 Fertility Program for Women (Question No. 115)",112

(16) Is the Minister able to say how many women who were treated with hPG have subsequently died, for whatever reason.",113
152,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: On 11 May I announced an independent Inquiry into the Australian Human Pituitary Hormone Program and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Cm). I announced this Inquiry because I share the concerns already expressed by many of the former patients who received treatment under the program and by the community generally. The terms of reference of the Inquiry (copy attached) will ensure that investigations of matters including those raised in the honourable member's question will be undertaken by an independent team of investigators led by Professor Margaret Allars, Associate Professor of Law at Sydney University. The report of the Inquiry will be made public and, of course, will be provided to the honourable member. A number of matters raised in this question can only properly be answered as a result of Professor Allars' Inquiry. I have referred the honourable member's question to her for consideration in her report. Further, the issues raised by several parts of the honourable member's question may be sub judice, being the subject of writs lodged with the Supreme Court of Victoria by the husbands of three of the former patients and by two· of the former patients themselves. Accordingly, it is inappropriate for me to comment any further at this time. I am, however, able to provide the following factual information in answer to the following parts. (1) Refer to preamble above. (2) Refer to preamble above. (3) Refer to preamble above. (4) (a) (i) Nil (ii) 132 batches of hPG were manufactured by CSL (b) (i) Two batches of bulk hGH were imported and formulated at CSL. (ii) 99 batches of hGH were manufactured by CSL. (5) (a) Not applicable (b) One batch was imported from New Zealand with the gland source being New Zealand; one batch was imported from the USA with the gland source being Australia. (6) Refer to preamble above. (7) Yes. On 1 November 1990 the Department advised the Chairman of the National Blood Transfusion Committee (NBTC) that, while it appeared that treatment with hGH already was listed, as a reason for indefinite donor deferral, hPG did not explicitly appear on the list and that the list of exclusions should be amended to include recipients of hPG. I am advised that, upon receipt of the letter on 5 November 1990 at the National Headquarters of the Australian Red Cross Society it was faxed immediately to the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Directors in all States and Territories. (8) Refer to preamble above. (9) No. (10) Refer to preamble above. (11) Refer to preamble above. (12) It is not known whether organs from persons who received either hPG or hGH have been used in transplants. (13) No, the Department has written to the original treating practitioners and requested that they contact former patients to alert them to the connection between hPG and CJD, and of the possibility of secondary transmission. The Department took this approach because practitioners who supervised the original treatment, and explained its potential benefits and risks, should be in the best position to provide continuing counselling; and because departmental records show whether treatment was approved. Clinical records held by individual doctors are the only accurate guide to treatment actually carried out. The Department has, by advertisement, also encouraged people who think they may have been treated under the program to contact it in order to clarify whether they were approved for a course of treatment. The Department has established a 008 telephone number for this purpose. (14) Yes. The Department has supported the establishment of counselling services in Sydney and Melbourne. In addition, the Department is currently preparing to establish services in other State Capitals where the program operated. (a) The service in Sydney and Melbourne commenced in November 1992. (b) Each service has a counsellor and clerical support. (c) Not known-when the services were established the Department wrote to the original treating practitioners in these cities advising of the availability of the counselling services. (15) As at 11 August 1993, of the 1432 patients approved for treatment with hPG, Departmental records show (a) 995 had been contacted or written to by their treating doctors and offered counselling (b) 437 remain to be contacted. (16) The Department has received advice from medical practitioners that as at 11 August 1993, 8 women who were treated with hPG are known to have died, for whatever reason. NA NA NA CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE The purpose of the Inquiry is to examine the operation of the Australian pituitary honnone program and to report on issues arising from that examination. In particular, the Inquiry is to examine and report on: the decisions taken to establish and continue the program in the light of scientific knowledge of the risks and benefits at the relevant times; any applicable guidelines relating to the treatment aspects of the program, particularly the information provided to patients so as to allow infonned consent; the applicable rules and guidelines relating to manufacture of the honnones, including for the collection of pituitaries; and following cessation of the program, actions taken by the then Department of Health (subsequently DCSH, then DHHCS now DHHLGCS) and others in response to reports of deaths from CJD of patients on similar programs overseas and subsequently of Australian patients. The Inquiry will make recommendations on: further actions which the Government might take - to identify people in Australia who received the pituitary derived hormones and to provide counselling and support to them whether additional measures are necessary to regulate medical programs in the light of the experience of the pituitary honnone program and the current regulatory procedures any measures which should be taken to strengthen the rules and guidelines relating to infonned consent in similar medical programs priorities for research into matters related to CJD and its transmission. The inquiry will detennine its own methods of operation, including obtaining of information, subject to privacy provisions. All files in the possession of Commonwealth agencies will be made available to the inquiry and State Governments are being asked to assist the inquiry in relation to relevant records held by public hospitals. Aboriginal Reconciliation and the Constitution (Question No. 122) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 12 May 1993: Did he call for reconciliation to be part of a constitutional review; if so, what amendments to the Constitution would be necessary to effect reconciliation. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. As I said at the recent Conference sponsored jointly by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, it has always been my view that issues of indigenous peoples' rights and issues of reconciliation are inseparable from the process of long tenn constitutional reform. I wish to stress that recognition of the key role for indigenous people in constitutional change is a matter which has won support across the political spectrum. In agreeing unanimously to the Council for the Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991, the Parliament supported this view as part of building a new relationship between indigenous and other Australians. The Council of course includes representation from the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. Debate on the position of indigenous people in the Constitution is also being encouraged by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation. The Foundation is chaired by former Governor General, Sir Ninian Stephen, enjoys cross party support and includes representatives from both the Government and the opposition. It is very significant that the Foundation's 1991 Constitutional Centenary Conference took the view that the Constitution should recognise indigenous peoples' rights and that the reconciliation process should explore constitutional change as a means to that end. I note that the Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey, lent his weight to the debate earlier this year in saying that he believed that the establishment of an Australian republic must become the catalyst for a more positive and constructive partnership between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. The question of what, if any, constitutional amendments might be necessary to effect reconciliation is a matter, initially, for consideration and advice from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. As part of its task over the period leading the centenary of Australia's federation, the Council will consult Aborigines, Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community on whether reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or documents of reconciliation, will report to the Government on these views, and, if it considers such a document or documents would benefit the Australian community as a whole, will make recommendations to the Government on the nature, content and form of giving effect to such a document or documents. Such a role and function for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was unanimously supported by the Commonwealth Parliament. Aboriginal Rock Paintings (Question No. 196) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: (1) Did the Government award a grant of $109,019 to train young persons to repaint the rock paintings belonging to the Ngarinyin people at Mt Barnett, WA. (2) Were the Ngarinyin people consulted about the matter referred to in part (1); if not, why not. (3) Was the grant referred to in part (1) made to Mr David Mowaljarlai; if so, is it a fact that Mr Mowaljarlai (a) does not come from the Mt Barnett area, (b) is not a member of the Ngarinyin people and (c) is not recognised as a lawman by Aboriginal people in the area. (4) Is it a fact that under Mr Mowaljarlai's supervision, eight of the ancient tribal paintings were erased and repainted therefore destroying their cultural significance. (5) Was Mr Mowaljarlai named Aboriginal of the Year and awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for the deed referred to in part (4).",114
153,Mr BEAZLEY,HORMONES IN AUSTRALIA AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A grant of $109,019 was approved on 20 May 1986 under the Community Employment Program (CEP) to protect and conserve Wandjina paintings and sites with a view to training young Aboriginal people to continue the process. $67,885 of the total grant was released on 24 October 1986. After a complaint was lodged by the lessee of Mt Barnett in June 1987, the project was suspended on the order of the then Minister. At that stage, the work was substantially completed and no further payments have been made. (2) There was consultation with the Wanang Ngari Aboriginal Corporation which represented to remote and scattered small groups including the Ngarinyin people. An extract from a report by the Western Australian Museum Aboriginal Sites Department of June 1987 confirms that ""elders and custodians were consulted and generally approved that the sites be renovated"". (3) No. The grant referred to in part (1) was made to the Wanang Ngari Aboriginal Corporation. (4) I am informed that an enquiry undertaken by the Western Australian Museum Sites Department in 1987 found that the rock art had been ""enhanced in the traditional manner and not wantonly desecrated"".

(b) In 1992-93 just over 10 million calls were made to the Department's TeleService Centres. On current averages 50 000-60 000 calls are made each day to the TeleService Centres. (2) There are no details available on the particular nature of the call other than the type of payment to which the call relates. About 50% of all inquiries Calls relate to Newstart/Job Search Allowance payment, 30% to Pensions and 20% to Family Payments. On current averages a caller is connected to an operator within one minute and the inquiry dealt with in just under three minutes. (3) Yes. (4) Records are available on the number of written complaints received by the Department. No records are kept on the number of verbal complaints about the 13 2468 telephone system. A total of 89 letters of complaint covering 117 issues related to TeleService have been received since January 1993, of which 10 have been received in the three months ending July. All written complaints about the 13 2468 telephone service are registered and a response forwarded to the writer.

The main function of the MTIS is to act as an information service on Social Security matters to people from non-English speaking backgrounds. (7) & (8) The MTIS does not keep statistics on the number of complaints received. However, the main perceived areas of complaint include policy issues, problems experienced with MTIS operator techniques (eg. abruptness), problems experienced with Regional Office staff and language difficulties, such as language availability. The quality of information provided by MTIS operators has not been a reported problem area. (9) The MTIS has 20 full-time and six part-time operators. (10) The two MTIS centres are located in Sydney and Melbourne. (11) The MTIS operators dealt with 204,154 calls in 1991-92 and 242,109 calls in 1992-93. (12) Yes.

(13) Delays experienced by persons in gaining access to an MTIS operator are measured by the time taken for a client's call to be connected with an operator proficient in the appropriate language. For the week ending 13 August, for the seven major community languages, the average delay was 53 seconds. (14)(a) Persons can be connected to an operator in their own language by ringing the MTIS number (131 202). Calls can be made from anywhere in Australia for the cost of a local call. If an operator speaking the client's language is not available at that time, the client will be rung back at a later date.

156,Mr HOWE,HORMONES IN AUSTRALIA AND,"The Minister for Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The development of Australia's National Program of Action (NPA) in response to the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children is well advanced. It is expected that the completed document will be submitted to the United Nations by the end of 1993. (2) The Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services is responsible for developing the NPA. (3) An interdepartmental committee (IDC) has been convened by the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services to assist in the development of the NPA. (a) While the specific attendees vary, representatives are invited from the Departments of: Social Security; Finance; Immigration and - Ethnic Affairs; Foreign Affairs and Trade; Prime Minister and Cabinet; Employment, Education and Training; Transport and Communications; Industrial Relations; the Attorney-General's Department; the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau; the Australian Bureau of Statistics; the Australian Institute of Family Studies; and the Office of the Status of Women. (b) Meetings of the IDC are called when input to the process is needed rather than according to a fixed schedule. (4) Consultations have been held to seek the views of peak national non-government organisations (NOOs) and of NGOs with a specific focus on international aid. In order to assist State and Territory Governments to consult with NGOs based in the States and Territories, the Commonwealth held a further series of consultations upon request in most States and Territories. (5) (a) The Australian International Assistance Development Bureau (AIDAB) has made contact at a variety of levels with counterpart· officials from a number of developing countries, including most recently China, the Philippines and Vietnam, concerning their NPAs. Discussions w-re also held with Pacific Island Countries at the South Pacific Forum last year. ,. (b) Reference to developing countries' NPAs have been included in briefing material for High Level Consultations to assist in determining priorities and opportunities for Australian assistance. In addition, AIDAB has advised that a range of NPAs from other countries have been consulted during the preparation of Country Strategy Papers. Australian officials have also discussed developing countries' NPAs with officials involved in their development whilst on Health Sector Project Identification/Design Missions. (c) As a result of this policy dialogue and consultative process, Australia has been able to increase the level of its assistance' for children in the aid program. The Health Sector, in particular, which is one of the priority areas of need identified by UNICEF, has seen considerable growth in the level of Australian assistance in recent years. Total health sector assistance has increased by more than 50% sinCe 1990 when the World Summit was held. Australian health assistance is centred around the theme WATCH (Women and their Children's Health). New maternal and child health initiatives are· currently being developed in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. (6) It is not proposed to seek additional public comment beyond that already obtained through consultations with NGOs. (7) Commonwealth funds specifically linked the NPA have not been sought. Many programs at the Commonwealth and at the State and Territory levels will have outcomes consistent with elements of the NPA and will contribute to enhancing the well-being of Australia's children. In terms of Australia's regional commitments, there has been significant expenditure in 1992-93 on aid in the key areas identified in the World Declaration. This includes: $48.6m on health family planning; $27.8m on water supply and sanitation; $14.Om on basic education; and $66.4m on children living in difficult circumstances. A number of initiatives have been announced in the 1993-94 Budget which will directly assist children in developing countries. For example, expenditure on family planning activities will treble to nearly $3Om in 1993-94, in recognition of the benefits to women and children that these services bring about. (8) The Government is strongly committed to Declaration and to the achievement of a National Program of Action that is substantial in its content and is of value to Australians and to the interRent national community. The United Nations has commended the Australian Government for the thoroughness with which it has approached the task of developing the NPA in response to the Declaration. (9) The allocation of funds for Commonwealth programs affecting the well-being of children will be determined by the Government in the Budget context. (10) (a) Yes. (b) Yes.

Minister for Primary Industries and Energy: Export Powers (Question No. 343) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 1 September 1993: (1) Does he have the authority to invoke export powers of any kind with respect to commodities, minerals and energy; if so, (a) with respect to which commodities, minerals or energy, (b) in what circumstances can the powers be invoked and (c) what are the (i) extent of and (ii) limits on the powers. (2) Upon which commodities, mineral and energy exports has the (a) Government and (b) the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy exercised export powers since 1983 and why was the power exercised in each case. (3) Does he retain each of the powers referred to in part (2). NA Prudential regime strategy development Review of public relations consultancy for Hospitals Integration Project Western Front Pilgrimage promotion Survey of specialists' needs for information on hospital integration (4) Has his attention been drawn to any criticisms by Australian producers or overseas markets of the retention of export powers. (5) Has the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics prepared any analyses relating to the retention of export powers over coal; if so, (a) what were the main findings with respect to the retention of the powers, (b) has he accepted the findings and (c) if he is reviewing the analysis when will the review be completed and a decision made with respect to it. (6) How have the (a) marketing performance and (b) market intelligence capabilities of the coal industry changed since coal export powers were introduced. (7) Have the arrangements by which the sale prices of Australian coal exports are determined changed since coal export powers were introduced; if so, do the changes bring into question the continuing relevance of the powers. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)(a)(b)(c) Under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations of the Customs Act 1901 and the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations of the Export Control Act 1982, the export of certain mineral, energy, and natural resource commodities requires the permission of the relevant minister. The minerals and energy commodities currently subject to export controls are alumina, bauxite, coal, uranium oxide, heavy mineral sands concentrates, and liquefied natural gas. The natural resource commodities are wood chips and certain classes of wood intended for further processing following export. The regulations referred to above prohibit the export of these commodities unless a permission in writing to export the goods is given by the minister or an authorised person and that permission is produced to the Collector of Customs. The permission may specify conditions or requirements to be complied with by the holder of the permission and a time by which the requirement shall be complied with; and may be revoked if the person fails to comply with a condition or requirement. The minister may not unreasonably refuse permission or refuse to consent to assignment or surrender of a permission. (2) (a) (b) In addition to the commodities referred to above, for certain periods since 1983 the permission of the minister or an authorised officer was required for the export of copper ores, metals and scrap; iron ore concentrates and agglomerates; lead ores, concentrates and residues; manganese ores; nickel ores and metallurgical products; petroleum and petroleum products; common salt in bulk; tin ores, concentrates and residues; tungsten ores and concentrates; and zinc ores, concentrates and residues. The reasons for export controls have varied according to the commodity. For most minerals and energy commodities, they have been essentially to ensure that export prices align with world market prices. In some cases, it was also to ensure domestic supply. Mineral sands controls relate mental considerations. In addition to pricing, uranium oxide and nuclear materials controls relate to nuclear safeguards. Exports of wood chips and certain classes of unprocessed wood are controlled to ensure environmental values are protected, market prices are obtained and value adding opportunities are maximised. (3) See (1) above. (4) Yes. (5) The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) published an analysis of the impact of controls over Australian coal exports in Research Report 93.8 entitled The Economics of Coal Export Controls, released on 27 April 1993. (a) It found that changes in world coal market structures have affected the pattern of Australia's coal trade to the extent that the bargaining position of Australia's coal producers has improved. By diversifying into other markets and by the development of steaming coal trade, Australia is now less dependent on Japanese coking coal demand. It concluded that there is not a strong economic case for the use of export controls in the marketing of Australian coal. (b) The study is an economic one based on economic analyses of the issues raised. As such, it becomes a component in the Government's consideration of coal export issues. (c) In retaining export controls on coal, the Government has taken account of. other considerations relating to the need to provide assurance to the Australian community that Australia is receiving a fair and reasonable return for its coal (6)(a)(b) See 5(a). Knowledge of a wider diversity of markets and the growth of commercial market analyses have led to increased market intelligence. (7) There are constant developments in contractual and tendering processes. As indicated in 5(c), these have not affected the reason why export controls on coal have been retained.

165,Mr CONNOLLY,PROJECT NAME,"the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 7 September 1993: Did Australian Construction Services, Brisbane, construct a dog kennel for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service; if so, what was the (a) brief for, (b) specifications of and (c) cost of the kennel. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable to environ- member's question is as follows: This question was asked of my colleague the Minister for Resources but as I have portfolio responsibility for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service I provide the following answer to the honourable member's question: . Yes, Australian Construction Services, Brisbane, did construct dog kennels for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service's Quarantine Detector Dog Program at its Training Centre at 160 Curtin Avenue, Eagle Farm. (a) and (b) Provision and installation of a relocatable dog compound comprising 11 dog kennels, dog bath with ramp, stainless steel tub and insinkerator and two outdoor exercise yards 20m x 20m. Included was connection of all drainage to sewer, electrical modifications, refit of office, classroom and training shed and Council application and inspection fees. (c) The total project cost was $59,392.00. The end cost of the kennels themselves cannot be separated from this figure because the electrical and sewerage connections involved both the construction of the kennel block and modifications to the Training Centre.
