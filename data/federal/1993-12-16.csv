2,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned parents and friends of Stockton Child Care Centre draws attention to the House that the Federal Government is seeking to link accreditation to eligibility for Childcare Assistance and in the opinion of your petitioners this link will only lead to higher fees for parents and no guarantee for improvement in quality of care for children. We know that quality care cannot be legislated for-it comes from the heart. Please help us to help our children. Your petitioners therefore request the House to reject accreditation being linked to Childcare Assistance. by Mr Andrew (from 586 citizens), Ms Fatin (from 69 citizens) and Mr Ferguson (from 11 citizens). Leaded Petrol To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Assembled: The petition of the undersigned 'citizens of Australia opposes the reduction of octane quality of leaded petrol from January 1994, resulting from the Government's 'Lead Roundtable' meeting. The petitioners note particularly that this reduction in petrol quality: (1) Jeopardises the use of vehiCles made prior to 1986 for operation on high octane petrol and could lead to many of those vehicles suffering serious engine damage; (2) Will result in worse vehicle operation, higher emissions and greater fuel consumption for up to three million vehicles; (3) Will have negligible benefit to the community, through reduced lead emissions, because the oil industry proposes to leave lead levels in petrol unchanged in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, and because the use of leaded petrol already is rapidly decreasing; (4) Will disadvantage vehicle enthusiasts and low income members of the community. And your petitioners therefore pray that the House take action to ensure the continued availability of high octane petrol for Australian motorists. by Mr Robert Brown (from 34 citizens), Mr Sharp (from 17 citizens) and Mr Sinclair (from 17 citizens). Mabo To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representativ- in Parliament assembled: Child Care The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: l. The majority of Western Australians are opposed to any form of title based on a High Court decision and based on eligibility being determined by racial origin. 2, The majority of Australians acknowledge the specific rights granted by the Mabo decision. 3. The issue of whether potential claims for native title should be allowed in any other place, or whether all Australians should have equal right to acquire land under the established laws of the States and Territories-as applied pre-Mabo-should be decided by a referendum of all the Australian people. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Cameron (from 227 citizens), Ms Moylan (from 23 citizens) and Mr Tuckey (from 1,115 citizens). Off-Road Diesel Fuel To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned shows: We the undersigned citizens respectfully submit that the Government's proposal to charge users of off-road diesel fuel a tax equal to one per cent of the amount rebated to them through the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme under the Diesel Fuel (Excise Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 and the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 be abandoned. The Petitioners note particularly that: 1. Users of off-road diesel fuel currently receive a ' full or partial rebate of fuel excise paid in recognition that they should not have to contribute to road funding and maintenance in the same manner as on-road users of diesel fuel; 2. We object to being forced to pay fuel excise on diesel fuel and then being charged a tax, which the Government is calling an 'administration fee', to have that money returned to us as a rebate; 3. This tax sets a dangerous precedent and could lead to governments charging similar taxes on rebates, such as those for personal income tax. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Forrest (from 13 citizens), Mr Hawker (from 14 citizens) and Mr 'nIckey (from 62 citizens). Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembledThe Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows: 1. Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year. 2. Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source. 3. The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the schedule fee. 4. The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases. 5. The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance. 6. Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available. Wetherefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered. by Mr Andrew (from 21 citizens) and Mr Crean (from 1,964 citizens). Family Law Act To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in ParliamentThe petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to The Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes. (1) That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary. (2) That the Family Court be replaced by a tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel; the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. (3) That legal professionals be barred from appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast savings to the disputing parties. (4) That a modified fault clause be fe-introduced to Family Law primarily designed to discourage adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the expense of deserted and innocent parties. (5) That the child support agency be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate administrative procedure within The Tribunal. (6) That apart from cases of exceptional circumstances parental-child access become the inalienable right of all parents. (7) That alternative counselling, (Government funded) be made available through the Churches and that much more emphasis be placed on MEDIATION in resolving disputes prior to the commencement of legal proceedings. by Mr Andrews (from 2,000 citizens) and Dr Wooldridge (from 2,000 citizens). Free the Bears To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so small the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of thy House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears, for these purposes, to 40,000. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to object most ,strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Cameron (from 6,190 citizens) and Mr Filing (from 60 citizens). Family Law Act: Fathers Rights To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Parliament will consider the plight of the father in the Family Court of Australia. Fathers, according to the Laws of Australia, should have equal rights to their children, in both custody and access applications before the Family Court. Immediate amendments to the Family Law Act should be implemented for inclusion of parental rights as distinct from children's rights. It should be made possible for fathers to obtain a fair deal in the Family Court and be able to continue involvement in their children's upbringing at all times throughout every stage of their children's development, thus being in the best interest of the children themselves; without incurring exorbitant legal costs and manipulated by many of the legal profession. Access Orders from the Family Court should be implemented without delay and at no cost to the non-custodial parent, thus eliminating denial of access. We humbly urge Parliament to direct the Family Court by way of immediate legislation to jealously guard visitation rights and become more liberal with them. We further do humbly seek that a private members bill be introduced on an urgent basis to consider the plight of John Zabaneh, a fellow citizen and a father of four children whom he had no access to for nearly eight years despite that he had obtained unenforceable· Orders from the Courts. John Zabaneh has been denied any input in his children's development and upbringing and has little or no knowledge of his children's progress and well-being. As this matter is of human-rights nature, of paramount importance, it is specially requested that this petition be read to Parliament assembled in full, And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Atkinson (from 309 citizens). Boronia Heights: Pharmacy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Rankin draws to the attention of the House that owing to the current legislation a pharmacy is not able to conduct business at the Boronia Park Shopping Centre. As the area is populated by a large number of young families with inadequate transport facilities there is a genuine need for a pharmacy in this region. Your petitioners therefore request the House to approach the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority for reconsideration of this legislation with particular reference to the Boronia Heights area. by Mr Beddall (from 237 citizens). Medicare Office: Pines Shopping Centre To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens, draw to the attention of the House, that with the growing populatiQn of the Gold Coast in Queensland, there is an urgent need for a Medicare office at the southern end of the Gold Coast. Your petitioners therefore respectfully request that: A Medicare office be established at the Pines Shopping Centre located on KP MCGRATH Drive in Elanora as soon as possible. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bradford (from 2,872 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows That the majority of Australians clearly stand united in satisfaction with the existing Australian National Flag which reflects their values, history, and heritage. And that they condemn unwarranted attacks on their historic Australia Flag, whenever or wherever made by any Australian citizens. So therefore we call upon the House of Representatives to ensure that the Australian National Flag, as publicly acclaimed in 1901 and confirmed under the Flags Act(l953), is not changed, replaced, or diminished at any time, or in any manner whatsoever, without such a proposal being first voted upon and approved by a majority of Australian citizens in a national referendum. by Mr Braithwaite (from 367 citizens). Petrol Excise To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia opposes the increase in excise of 7 cents per litre on leaded petrol and 5 cents per litre on unleaded petrol resulting from the Budget. This rise in petrol tax: (1) discriminates against low income familieS and those living in rural areas (2) increases business costs and will cause further unemployment (3) adds further to the price of an already heavily taxed product (4) breaks Mr Keating's election promise not to put up tax. And your petitioners therefore pray that the House oppose these increases in petrol excise. by Mr Cadman (from 1,267 citizens). Vietnam: Human Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in The Australian Federal Parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: 1. Even as Communism disintegrates elsewhere around the globe, Vietnam's 72 million people still suffer under communist totalitarianism. 2. Although there have been some moves towards economic development by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in recent years, they have not led towards political liberation or improved human right records. People are imprisoned or kept under housearrest without charge or trial for the peaceful expression of their beliefs and alternative points of view. Among them are Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam and Thich Quang Do, Thich Tri Sleu, Thich Tue Si, Thich Tri Tuu, Thich Hai Tinh, Thich Hai Tang, Tich Khong Tanh. Recently Assistant Archbishop Nguyen Van Thuan has not been allowed to return to Vietnam after his overseas tour. Other political prisoners and prisoners of conscience include Dr Nguyen Dan Que, a member of Amnesty International, Dr Doan Viet Hoat a former Assistant Vice-Chancellor of the Van Hanh University. 3. Especially the Hanoi government has arrested on 17/11/93 Mr Nguyen Dinh Huy, Dr Pham Tuong, the leaders of the Movement to Unite People and Build Democracy inside Vietnam because of their plan to organise the International Conference to develop Vietnam in Saigon. Some other members of the organisation were also arrested such as Mr Bui Kim Dinh, Mr Tran Quang Liem, Mr Nguyen Tan Tri coming to Vietnam from the United States. This is· further evidence of human rights violation and communist totalitarianism. Such treatment represents a systematic attack of international standards of human rights solemnly recognised in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and in the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Your petitioners respectfully request the House of Representatives to: 1. Urge the Hanoi government to take action to facilitate the release of all religious leaders, political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, in particular those mentioned above. 2. Urge the Hanoi government to allow all religions to independently practice and organise their religious affairs in Vietnam. 3. Call on the Australian government to press the Hanoi government to respect human rights and civil rights in Vietnam, and to take these factors into account in its consideration of the provision of economic assistance. by Mrs Crosio (from 21 citizens). Tariffs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: Th-' petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that with more than 10 per cent of Australians out of work, the concept of a level playing field and zero tariffs is rejected by Australian families who can see no evidence of benefit but substantial losses from the arguments put by economic rationalists. Your petitioners therefore request the House to act to ensure that Australia maintains a visible processing industry based on our rural industries and that tariffs remain in place as long as other nations use non-tariff measures, tariff protection, etc.; stop imports of goods that are supported by subsidies and other non-tariff or dumping measures to Australia; and restore profitability to our farms and factories, employment opportunities to our citizens and to provide a future for our youth. by Mrs Gallus (from 12 citizens). Freedom of Religious Belief To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that: The effect of the United Nations ""Declaration on the elimination of all forms of intolerance based on religion or other belief"" will be to discriminate against: 1. Parents who choose to have their children educated in independent schools as they may no longer be assured that their children will taught according to the values they are seeking in a Christian or independent school. 2. Christian prayers on public occasions, or against an employer using Christian criteria selecting staff or against a person making a proclamation of the Gospel that salvation is Jesus Christ alone. Your Petitioners ask that the House disallow the signing of the Declaration. And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Lloyd (from 16 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: I. They are completeiy satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag. 2. They are aware it properly renects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of 3 Christian Crosses, represents the Nation's historical origin and the source of its guage and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its place in space. (c) The large star depicting a State and the Territories of the Commonwealth. 3. They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. 4. They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism. S. They are certain that any change to its form or to its acceptance as the sole Australian National Flag will produce division in the Australian community. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should ensure that the existing Australian national flag remains sacrosanct from change and remains the sole national nag. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Miles (from 811 citizens). Homeless Rate Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the be House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows that: 1. We are concerned that teenagers are able to leave home by obtaining young homeless rate for benefits without adequate investigation. 2. We believe that the nawed nature of the guidelines governing eligibility for young homeless rate benefits is in some circumstances encouraging family breakdown. 3. With thl:! number of young people receiving youth homeless rate benefits increasing by a factor of ten over the past six years, we consider that there are insufficient programs to help keep families together. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives should: Call on the Government to: (a) review the guidelines for young homeless rate benefits; and (b) show a greater commitment to programs which prevent family breakdown. by Mr Moore (from 38 citizens). Child-care Centres· To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: lap- The petition of parents of Australia's children oppose any proposal of the Federal Government to link compulsory accreditation with eligibility for fee relief for parents who send their children to long day care centres. We recognise that as parents, we are the best people to determine the future of our children and reject any attempt by the Government to institutionalise our children. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to oppose any plan by the Government for compulsory accreditation of child care centres. And your petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Moore (from 22 citizens). Tax Collection To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned most strongly request that there be no further imposition and collection of taxation by the Commonwealth prior to the passage of legislation authorising such tax increases and to repay those illegally collected taxes if the bill concerned is not passed, and taken before the legal date. We affinn furthennore that the collection of tax without specific Parliamentary approval is unjust and undennines general respect for the law. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Ms Moylan (from 26 citizens). Australia Post To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the adverse effects on all Australians and residents of country Australia in particular, of the outrageous increases in charges by Australia Post for postage of magazines and newspapers and requests the House to take action to prevent the proposed rises taking place. by Mr Nehl (from 16 citizens) Nursing Homes To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives We the undersigned petitioners draw to the attention of the members that an alternative funding tool for Nursing Homes has been formulated-The Focal Nursing Assessment Tool. Your Petitioners request that the members in Parliament assembled, should demand that the Australian Government: (a) Reject recommendations of the Macri and Gregory Reports to resolve problems associated with the present funding tool-The Resident Classification Instrument. (b) Consider the Focal Nursing Assessment Tool as a replacement for the Resident Classification Instrument. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Sciacca (from eight citizens). Australia Post To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia showeth: The need for the Government to recognise the importance of high quality postal services in rural Australia. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives caIl upon the Government to instruct Australia Post to cease the reduction of services in rural areas of the Goulburn District, have due regard for the social consequences of such reductions, and restore those services. Your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Sharp (from 204 citizens). National Flag To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: (I) The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national flag. (2) We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon by the people of Australia and passed by a majority of votes in a majority of States. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Sharp (from 76 citizens). Peace To the Speaker and Members of the Legislative Assembly, Parliament House, CANBERRA.

Make your love of peace your spiritual gift against violence, fear and hatred. 3. Use all your powers to bring about a NEUTRAL Australia. 4. Legislate against using technology for destructive purposes. ' 5. Use the millions of dollars spent on fear (defence) to replenish our earth. This planet has been brought to the brink of natural disasters by our own attitudes, but can yet be salvaged by willingness and dedication. Your decision will effect not only your physical welfare but your spiritual advancement or retardation. We pray that you will choose love and join us in bringing about a Golden Age. by Mr Slipper (from two citizens). Family Planning Clinic To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned residents of the Sunshine Coast in the State of Queensland, respectfully showeth: our support for the continued vital operation of the Family Planning Clinic on the Sunshine Coast, which is the only facility of this nature between Brisbane and Rockhampton servicing the medical and social demands of this region. Your Petitioners therefore Pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled require the Government to: give consideration to the benefits of this unique and necessary service to the Sunshine Coast. The community seeks your support to maintain and indeed increase funding to sustain thi- essential facility. And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Somlyay (from 359 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian al flag. 2. We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon and approved by the people of Australia in a national poll. And your petitioners, as in duty bound,. will ever pray. by Mr Taylor (from 26 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House our strongest support for the existing National Flag. The Australian National Flag is the most important symbol of the Australian nation and our national unity, and has evoked deep feelings of honour and respect for many generations of Australians. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to preserve our current Australian National Flag and to ensure that its design is not changed without the support of a referendum carried by the majority of Australians in the majority of States. by Mr Truss (from 41 citizens). Mabo High Court Decision To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens· of Australia draws attention of the House to the confusion over the Mabo High Court Decision and calls on Members to require the conduct of a Referendum to amend the Australian Constitution to reaffirm beyond doubt the rights of State Governments alone to define and issue land title. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Thckey (from 219 citizens). Nursing Home: Logan To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain nursing staff, residents and relatives and friends of Logan Nursing Home, Queensland draws to the attention of the House that they are appalled and offended at the aggressive, rude and dictatorial attitude displayed by the three members of the Standards Monitoring Team who nationundertook a compliance inspection on Monday the 13th September and a subsequent exit report on Wednesday the 15th September and the subsequent impact on morale of the staff. Logan Nursing Home has an excellent reputation for the high quality nursing care and the modern and yet homelike environment that it provides and the good quality of life that its residents enjoy. The nursing staff are a hard working, dedicated and compassionate team and many have been staff at the home for 8-10 years. We are astonished at the intimidating and threatening manner of the Standards Monitoring Team. Dedicated carers for the frail and aged support and welcome the compliance with standards. Overbearing, patronising and pedantic behaviour however is strongly opposed. This attitude has left many of the staff feeling emotionally degraded and dejected, doubting their competencies and this unfortunately has the potential to undermine the capacity and enthusiasm to continue to provide the high level of care required by the many senile, frail and ill aged people in their care. Your petitioners therefore request that the House call on the Minister to reduce the level of departmental and Government regulatory requirements for documentation and continued inspections of nursing homes to allow nursing staff to focus on the provision of high quality standard of care to their residents. by Dr Wooldridge (from 51 citizens). Petitions received. NA Community Affairs Committee",11
3,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I present the committee's report titled Australia s international health programs, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",18
4,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEES,"This report is the result of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into Australia's international health program. The inquiry was originally referred to the committee in the previous parliament and was readopted by this committee with its current membership in June this year. While Australia's overseas aid program has been the subject of detailed scrutiny in the last 20 years this inquiry is the first parliamentary investigation specifically into Australia's bilateral and multilateral health related aid programs, and into Australia's participation in multilateral health related organisations. It fonns part of a wide-ranging revision of the policy and administration of international health programs, and the report's recommendations will, we believe, improve their efficiency and effectiveness. Australia has long recognised its obligation and responsibilities to the international community to assist in alleviating the problems of the developing world by providil1g humanitarian aid and sustainable development assistance. This assistance has predominantly focused on the agricultural sector, with health receiving a low priority. In 1992-93 AlDAB and the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services between them spent approximately $37 million. on direct health programs, or around 2.7 per cent of the totalaid budget. Additionally, AIDAB spent $10 million on population programs, and $25 million on water supply and sanitation programs. In total, AIDAB and the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services spent $73 million or 5.2 per cent of overseas development aid on health and health related proReport grams. This represents an improvement on previous years. For example, in 1991-92 direct health and health related aid constituted only 2.84 per cent of total overseas aid. AIDAB expects the upward trend to continue in 1993-94, especially since budget support to Papua New Guinea is being replaced with program aid and a new four-year $130 million population initiative is under way. Nonetheless, many witnesses told the committee that AIDAB does not spend enough of its budget on health or health related projects. For example, the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders told the committee that health care has been the cinderella with AIDAB, and the Public Health Association stated that the health sector programs are incredibly poorly resourced and pathetically poor compared to western European countries. AIDAB itself acknowledges that, historically, health aid has taken a low priority in the aid budget. In 1977 it noted that expenditure in the agriculture sector exceeded that in the health sector by a factor of eight, and that only seven per cent of AIDAB sponsored students were in health fields, while those taking agriculture outnumbered students in health by nearly three to one. From an international perspective, the World Bank in its development report for 1993 comments that the share of aid going to health should rise to the equivalent of seven per cent of total development assistance immediately and should then rise substantially over the next five years. Despite the danger of special pleading, the committee believes that there are sufficient grounds to endorse the bank's recommendations. In order to develop coherent health policies and programs, AIDAB requires both generalist in-house health services and access to specialist experts in the wider community. It contracts a wide range of health professionals from academic institutions, non-government organisations and private consultancies to run projects and conduct preand post-project evaluations. Three themes have emerged in our discussions with witnesses about AIDAB's current program implementation methods and use of contractors. The first is that the current competitive bidding system for AIDAB contracts discourages vital cooperation betwe-n the limited number of international health experts in Australia. The second is that AIDAB funding is spread too thinly over many health projects, and the third is that aid projects have an unduly long start-up time. We believe it is possible to address these three concerns by a modification to the existing system of contracting health experts by focusing on the areas of Australia's greatest health expertise. This would be achieved by determining five or six major health priorities in developing countries in the Asia Pacific region that could become the focus of AIDAB's health sector aid. The health areas or health subsectors identified should take into account regional priorities and the levels of Australian expertise. Possible subsectors could be malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, rational drug use, micro-nutrition, immunology and HIV/AIDS. The committee recommends that AIDAB then call for period contracts in each priority health subsector. The successful contracting groups would be drawn upon for all necessary project design and implementation consultancy work in each country where aid projects in that health subsector are undertaken. These evolutionary changes to the current AIDAB procedures should satisfy AIDAB's contractual requirements, encourage cooperation in the health sector and improve the continuity of personnel on AIDAB projects. The committee has also recommended that AIDAB continue to fund health projects not classed as subsector priorities, although as secondary priorities. While AIDAB is primarily responsible for the administration of the official aid program, the international branch of the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services also delivers some health aid. This department fulfils Australia's international obligations contributing assessed core funds to the general operation of the World Health Organisation and several specific WHO programs. It also manages Australia's participation in WHO administration and in the activities of its associated agencies. The Department of Health also funds a public health education and research program, known as PHERP. Under PHERP, nine tertiary institutions around Australia are funded to provide public health postgraduate training. Several of the centres offer residential and distance learning public health courses tailored for health professionals and students from developing countries, in particular from the Asia-Pacific region. The centres have developed exchange and partnership arrangements with medical schools in neighbouring countries to encourage institutional strengthening, indigenous research and teaching capabilities. Staff at the centres are also involved in conducting public health related research and consultancies, often in the region. The international activities of these centres play an important role in strengthening the health services of developing countries, many of which receive other forms of Australian health aid. Such training reduces the reliance of developing countries on aid donors and overseas expertise to develop primary health programs. These activities also provide a commercial return for Australia by providing a cash inflow to these institutions and in the long run by encouraging trainees to continue to use Australian expertise and develop links with our professionals. To provide these kinds of international health facilities, Australian institutions need to maintain their own staff and research programs, and this requires a long-term funding commitment by the government. We believe the current review of PHERP provides a good opportunity for the department to demonstrate its commitment. We recommend that the international PHERP funding be guaranteed for a period of at least six years, and then on a triennial basis. The aspect of Australian aid in respect of political, strategic and economic returns is an by important part of our inquiry. AIDAB estimates that 87 per cent of the value of its aid program is made up of goods and services sourced from Australia. This is much less in the health sector. While the health sector does not lend itself readily to commercial exploitation because of the nature of primary health care, it does in fact offer some potential. In this particular case, it relates to multilateral and health related organisations and the various multilateral development banks. These organisations tender international consultancies and equipment worth many hundreds of millions of dollars each year. In this context, we were told by UNICEF that our participation in these programs is disappointingly low. We understand that in recent years the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Austrade and AIDAB have been endeavouring to provide Australian companies with advice on multilateral contracts. It is important that integration of the commercially oriented activities of the 'organisations continue to develop. One important principle of aid funding is that it is most effective when funded on a secure, long-term basis. Long-term expenditure commitments provide stability, which assists developing countries to strengthen their own support structures and assists Australian individuals and institutions. The committee is concerned about the government decision in October 1993 to freeze expenditure of all non-committed funds in the population program pending an independent inquiry into the relationship between rapid population growth and economic development. Such short-term action destroys Australia's reputation for providing justified and well planned aid programs and, in this case, flies in the face of intel1Jationally recognised policy directions. That decision also creates a potential precedent for other aid programs which could also be disrupted at short notice. These views were reinforced by the Chairman of the World Bank, who told us: Family planning is a key, and cost-effective, component of maternal and child health and its vigorous promotion is justified on that ground alone. Smaller and better spaced families are much more healthy ... in addition, the eradication of illegal abortion would reduce the number of maternal deaths per year by about 30 per cent. I would like to thank the members of the committee for their effort, particularly the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), who carried the bulk of the inquiry. As new parliamentarians they approached the inquiry with enthusiasm and dedication. I would also like to thank Ann Stewart, who was acting secretary; Bjarne Nordin and James Catchpole, who made a major contribution to the inquiry; and Lynette Sebo, whose clerical skills were so important. I commend the report to the House.",18
5,Ms WORTH,COMMITTEES,"As a member of the subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs which examined Australia's international health programs, I am pleased to comment on its report entitled Australia s international health programs. As the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), mentioned, it was my first inquiry and I certainly found it most interesting. . I thank the witnesses for their evidence and also for their very detailed submissions. As the inquiry proceeded I was left in no doubt that Australia has experts who are able to provide world-class health programs to countries less fortunate than ours. Many witnesses left me with the impression that they certainly cared a great deal about what they were doing. However, AIDAB was strongly criticised by many witnesses. It could be argued that the report should have been written in stronger language, but the committee sought to be constructive. The recommendations, if implemented, should overcome many of the problems that we have found to exist. In 1993-94, AIDAB will spend $1,402 million on aid to other countries, and $90 million of that will be spent on health projects. I mention that to highlight the real need to do things in a coordinated way and to get our best value for the dollar. The evidence to date suggests that we have not been well coordinated, and we have also neglected to follow aid opportunities with trade in the way many other countries do. We heard, for instance, from Professor Eastman, Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders at Westmead Hospital. He put it in perspective when he said: Perhaps there needs to be an independent advisory committee to AIDAB and the health department that is not set up by those bureaucracies, but constituted in some other way-by Parliament or in some other manner-that can provide independent advice upon what we as a country have got to offer. We have got to respond to the needs of developing countries in our region. I am the first to argue that we must respond, and it must be humanitarian based. But we have got to be more pragmatic. There are enormous commercial opportunities, and we are just ignoring them. I do not think you should divorce aid and trade. I think they are linked. In the real world, we have not only to supply humanitarian assistance to developing countries in our region, but we have to be a lot smarter in terms of how this country can capitalise on some of those advantages. We have got to be much more pragmatic. He. is quite emphatic in his criticisms of the advice that committees comprised of only bureaucrats give. There must be greater cooperation between AIDAB and the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. AIDAB was concerned that the use of too many advisory groups would lead 'to an amazing load of clutter at the end of the day', but the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services saw the benefits of having input from outside experts. There are many important recommendations as a result of the inquiry, but I believe those recommending that additional experts should be called in where necessary to provide advice are crucial, because, as I mentioned earlier, there is a huge budget involved with our overseas health projects. We must get the best value for our dollar. The advice from the witnesses was that there was no real collection of the experience these projects were gathering to hand on to others-what was learnt in one country was not being used in another. They felt that we tended to completely ignore the advantage to our own country of research data which could be gathered from the health projects in other countries. In South Australia, for instance, we have the example of the craniofacial unit which uses the whole of South-East Asia as a catchment area. While providing aid and assistance to people from those countries, it gathers research that will be put to the best benefit for our road accident victims and those people who are now bashed on the streets. Good can come out of all this; we just have to be smarter. As many a witness said, we have to get our act together and use the best possible people to give advice so that our projects are well coordinated. The recommendations should solve these problems, and I hope the government implements them. Motion (by Mr Allan Morris) proposed: That the House take note of the report.",20
6,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Committee Report",21
7,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I present the report of the committee entitled Access and equity-rhetoric or reality 7, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",21
8,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"The committee undertook this inquiry to determine whether access and equity strategy is meeting the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, or whether Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are still being denied access and equity in the range of government services available to all Australians. The title of the reportAccess and equity-rhetoric or reality?sums up this choice. In undertaking this inquiry into the implementation of the Commonwealth's access and equity strategy, the committee examined the comprehensiveness of the strategy, the extent to which it had been implemented and the outcomes that had been achieved for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. During 1992 the Office of Multicultural Affairs undertook an evaluation of the access and equity strategy. In general, it was found that the barriers to access and equity were more marked and more resistant to erosion for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders than for any other group of people. The inquiry confirmed these findings through discussions with a wide range of community groups. Rhetoric or reality? points out that there is still a large proportion of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who are not getting appropriate access to, and equity in, the range of government services available to all Australians. Government services should be available to all Australians who are entitled to them, regardless of race, religion, language or culture. This is one of the main principles of the Commonwealth's access and equity strategy. Access and equity policy recognises that while some services may be universally applicable, they may not be equally accessible if they are uniformly designed and delivered. This lack of access to mainstream programs and services is a problem that particularly affects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. One of the major barriers that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people face in gaining access to a range of government services is that services do not cater for the needs and circumstances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The committee is concerned that the access and equity strategy has been in existence since 1985, and has included Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as target groups since 1989, yet has still to achieve any significant outcomes for Australia's most disadvantaged and dispossessed groups of people. The committee believes it is vital that the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at the grassroots level are heard and responded to. The committee travelled across Australia, talking to a wide range of community organisations and regional councils, to hear of the problems their members face and to identify where improvements have occurred. There was a consistent message delivered to the committee wherever we went that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should determine the priorities and strategies for programs aimed at tackling the causes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. The discussions the committee held confirmed that there are still considerable barriers for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in gaining full access and equity in the range of government services available. These barriers include racism, language, culture, inappropriately designed and delivered services, and a lack of services in many areas. It should be recognised that there are still a large number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who speak their own language or languages but who may have difficulty in speaking English. Government departments need to take these barriers into account when designing and delivering services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Certain groups of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people also face additional disadvantages. These groups include women, older people, people with disabilities and youth. The committee heard much evidence that these groups of people are extremely disadvantaged with respect to government services. They present real challenges for service deliverers to adequately address their special needs and circumstances. Ignorance among the wider community of the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and traditions is still a major barrier facing these people. This ignorance is reflected in the political and government structures for service provision. The committee has placed considerable emphasis on the development of cross-cultural awareness courses within all departments and agencies to give an understanding of the different needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The coordination of programs and services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is still very poor and it is contributing to the continuing disadvantage and inequities. A much greater effort is needed from all levels of government to improve coordination of· services, especially in light of the heads of government in December 1992 to improve outcomes in the delivery of programs and services for indigenand ous people. Government agencies at all levels must also ensure that their programs and services are designed to take into account the different needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout Australia. State, territory and local governments play an important role in the delivery of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In undertaking this inquiry the comable mittee heard a great deal of evidence that there are a number of areas being funded the Commonwealth, and in particular some projects being funded by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, that are essentially state, territory and local governed ment responsibilities. These include areas health, housing and infrastructure. State governments have access and equity responsiand bilities where they deliver Commonwealth Islander peoples. funded programs. Awareness of their responsibilities varied markedly between states and territories. This is an area that needs correc- to tive action. As mentioned before, the access and equity strategy is yet to have a significant impact Aboriginal and Islander people. The commitservice; tee is critical of the way in which the Office of Multicultural Affairs has handled the access and equity strategy in respect of of Aboriginal and Islander people. In a strategy which is meant to identify and eliminate barriers facing minority groups, the Office of Multicultural Affairs has allowed migrant issues to swamp Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. The committee found the Office of Multicultural Affairs to unsuitable as the coordinating agency responPrime sible for Aboriginal and Islander aspects the strategy. As a result, the committee has recommended that the coordination of access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people be separated from the Office of MultiAboriginal cultural Affairs and be established as a rate unit, with appropriate resources, under responsibility of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner the within the Human Rights and Equal Opporcommitment . tunity Commission. The committee believes that the Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner would provide a more thorough and sensitive oversight of the access and equity strategy as it applies to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. While implementation of the strategy across government agencies has been patchy, one department has stood out as a true success story. The Department of SoCial Security has made consideradvances in access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The by DSS has introduced a number of important measures to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people receive their correct entitlements. It was almost universally acceptby Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander of communities across Australia that there is a strong commitment by DSS to achieve access equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait The range of programs established by DSS improve access and equity to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples include the following: the support network for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; the Aborigion nal and Torres Strait Islander interpreter remote visiting teams; and the community agent's program. I would urge other departments at all levels to take special note these programs, and their effectiveness, and consider them when targeting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their own programs and services. This inquiry confirmed the finding of the evaluation of the access and equity strategy undertaken by the Office of Multicultural Affairs, that policy oriented be departments such as Finance, Treasury, and Minister and Cabinet are still to find of meaningful applications for the access and equity strategy. I turn now to the future of access and equity. In the formulation of policies and programs and in the delivery of services to and Torres Strait Islander peoples, sepadepartments and agencies need to take into the account the special needs and circumstances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The committee was seriously concerned about the inadequate provision of essential services such as water, electricity and sewerage to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In many instances, funding for Aboriginal affairs is being used to provide services that should have been provided by mainstream agencies instead of being used to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage and to promote self-management. The committee is also determined to end the continuing myth concerning the levels of expenditure by the Commonwealth and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs and the amount of responsibility that ATSIC has in tackling areas of need. In chapter 4 on page 65 of the report, there are graphs which show that ATSIC is allocated only 0.6 of 1 per cent of the federal budget to fund its programs. This is only half the total Commonwealth outlays on specific Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs. Several other departments administer targeted programs. The total expenditure by the Commonwealth on the target of Aboriginal programs was $1.3 billion in 1992-93 or 1.18 per cent of the total budget. Yet Aborigiers. nal and Torres Strait Islander people total 1.6 per cent of the Australian population. Many other government departments have mainstream responsibilities to provide services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but, as this report shows, there is a very patchy performance by these departments. Too often the committee heard government departments and Aboriginal people state that ATSIC was totally responsible for service delivery when it is clearly not funded to achieve this aim. In conclusion, I would like to sincerely thank all of the people involved in the preparation of Rhetoric or reality?; the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who gave their time to make submissions and to talk to the committee; and the members of the committee for their valuable input of ideas. We had a number of new members of this parliament on the committee and they worked very hard to bring this report to a conclusion. I also wish to thank the staff of the committee, Allan Kelly, Craig Dukes, Penne Humphries and Peter Ratas for their enormous effort in completing this report. The recommendations contained in this report will provide a framework for much better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.",21
9,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"Like the previous speaker, the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who is the chairman of the committee, I pay tribute to the staff members and also to the members of the committee who were assiduous in their enthusiasm. If one is going to single out any group of people for praise in the conduct of the inquiry, it has to be those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who appeared before the committee and provided evidence and insights. We could not have functioned, nor reached a result, nor arrived at any recommendations, without their enthusiastic cooperation. Without them, there would have been no report. The recommendations are very important and very significant. I would like to emphasise some of them. One that most Australians would not be aware of, of course, is the need for interpretWhile we have a specific reference to the federal court system, it applies right throughout the whole range of government activities. Most non-Aboriginal or non-Torres Strait Islander Australians would not be aware that, for many of the people we were talking with, English was a second language. We have a concentration on migrants from non-English speaking countries for this sort of assistance in teaching English as a foreign language and also the interpreter service. It really is a most important factor. If we cannot communicate, if we cannot understand, if we cannot be understood, it means that our access and our equity are very limited indeed. I see this as perhaps the most important single recommendation. People have to be understood; there has to be communication. This also applies to the mass mail-outs, to individuals in communities, of correspondence from the Department of Social Security to remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities where we found evidence that, because of the method of distribution and, again, the language situation and perhaps the scarcity of mail deliveries, where a deadline was set, it was impossible within the time constraints for the appropriate forms to be completed and for the recipients to get the services they were entitled to. I am also particularly concerned that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should work in hospitals to provide that human interface between the institution and people who may be regarded as perhaps a little unsophisticated in the ways of a city environment. Of course, for them to go into the standard, major hospital is a very traumatic experience indeed. It is one that tends to stop Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people seeking the medical care that they need and are entitled to. Other members of the committee will speak about other things, but I want to stress the need to have Aboriginalliaison people in a whole range of government activities but particularly in the area health services. I have another concern that goes right across the community for me; it is not just something related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I am referring to care of the aged. Again, we find that aged care facilities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are virtually non-existent. I will not go through the particular circumstances of one case in my electorate which the committee knows of in great detail, involving the Booroongen Djugun corporation, which is seeking to provide aged care in Kempsey. This is just symptomatic of another major area where access and equity virtually do not exist. In conclusion, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community of Australia is the most disadvantaged community we have, with the possible-no, certain-exception of the descendants of the South Sea Islanders who need some assistance as well. I am delighted to see the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) present the House. I would have been very surprised - amazed, in fact-if he had not been not here because he too is assiduous in performing his duties. If the minister and the ment can pick up most, if not all, of these recommendations, access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians will be far more accessible.",24
10,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEES," I endorse the comments of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I support the report and acknowledge the work of my colleagues on the committee and particularly that of the secretariat, who have worked very hard to get this publication into the parliament on our behalf. It has been a privilege, as the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) said, to meet with so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in diverse communities across this country. In the short time that I have, I will confine my comments to women's issues. I quote from a quote of Maureen Kirk's from the report: of Aboriginal communities are built on a pyramid shape. At the base of the pyramid are the women. These women are the carers, the givers, the mothers and the wives. They support the whole community. If these women don't stay healthy, the community support system breaks down. If women get sick or die, the whole family structure collapses. It is certainly true that the women that we met right across this country have a great commitment to attempting to deal with the health issues that are very important to the community. One of the issues in terms of access and equity was the great difficulties of providing culturally appropriate services for indigenous women in this country, particularly culturally appropriate birthing facilities. It is not widely understood and appreciated that where indigenous women give birth outside their own country this is a major impediment to the integration of that birth into the community. The same sort of thing can be said on providing appropriate breast and cervical cancer screening programs. We are not doing nearly enough in this area. There is a great deal of need for education in of mainstream services. In all health services I believe we have got to look at integrating into mainstream services the specific services that have been developed by and with and for governindigenous people. As well as providing effective liaison and policy makers within our mainstream services, there has got to be more effective integration, and we have suggested in the report contracting-out to specific service deliverers, because there is no doubt that a continuing theme throughout the inquiry was the confidence that indigenous people have in appropriate specifically designed services and the lack of confidence to approach mainstream services, where they often find implicit and explicit racism. We have made a recommendation 19 that I want to endorse in particular. It states: In implementing the access and equity strategy, departments and agencies pay particular attention to the roles and needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, including their effective representation on policy making and consultative bodies. There is no doubt that one of the great experiences for me on this inquiry was to meet so many beautiful, intelligent, committed black women across this country who are shouldering a huge burden and are leading the way in provision of effective services. What we have to remember is that every day black women in this country confront racism and sexism, and I think that this is a burden that is not understood by the European community. I want to refer to two cultural events that I have participated in. The first is the final performance of Bran Nue Dae which took place in Rockhampton recently after a sevenmonth run. This was a celebration in song and dance of the real life experience of indigenous people in this country. It was wonderful to see both European and indigenous people enjoying that performance, and I was pleased to welcome into my family Josie Lawford, who is the partner of a cousin of mine, Richard Mellick, and their son Jaden. Family is important to indigenous people, and Josie is now part of my family. I want to refer also to a new play by Louis Nowra called Radiance, which also looks at the life experiences of indigenous women. It confronts the issues that I have referred to. This report once again shows that we have much to do if we are going to provide social justice for indigenous people. I thank the House.  access and equity strategy rhetoric or reality? This report confirms that the access and equity strategy, with the possible exception of its implementation by the Department of Social Security, is almost totally a failure. It is rhetoric and definitely not reality. No other· community in this country is as grossly disadvantaged as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. The report tabled today strengthens that observation. It emphasises that there is much to be done to ensure that indigenous Australians have full access and equity to government services. It expresses a wide range of concerns about the barriers to access and equity, including racism, language, culture, inappropriately designed and delivered services and an almost total lack of services in many areas. However, given the very limited time available to me, I want to focus my comments on a couple of the recommendations that I support regarding young people, the Office of Multicultural Affairs and health services. Over 50 per cent of the indigenous population is under 20 years of age and over 70 per cent is under the age of 25. In the committee's inquiry it was made quite clear to me that we have a problem of massive proportions that is not being addressed adequately by the Labor government's access and equity strategy. The problems of drug and alcohol abuse, mental health problems and juvenile crime that are so prevalent amongst young Australians in these times of high unemployment are magnified in the indigenous communities. Homelessness, with its associated difficulties of crime and drug and alcohol abuse, is a major problem among indigenous youth, particularly for those living in urban areas. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service told the committee that eight out of 10 homeless indigenous young people would end up dead in youth training centres or in prison. Aboriginal juveniles are over-represented in the prison and juvenile detention systems compared to. other community groups, a fact already highlighted by the Royal Commission into. Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I fully support the recommendation of the committee that a youth task force be established as quickly as possible to make a detailed examination of the best ways to develop strategies to tackle these problems. One of the reasons why the successful outcomes of the access and equity strategy have not been achieved in the indigenous population is the failure by the Office of Multicultural Affairs to effectively coordinate the strategy and monitor government departments and agencies in relation to access and equity for indigenous people. . Regrettably, the Office of Multicultural Affairs has not given any priority at all to indigenous affairs and has demonstrated a lack of expertise and commitment in dealing with access and equity issues in this area. OMA is not the right agency to be dealing with access and equity issues for the indigenous communities. I support the committee's recommendation that the most suitable agency to take over its function is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner is already focused on the way government agencies tackle the issues of disadvantage to indigenous Australians. The commissioner will be well placed to report on the adequacy of service delivery to individuals in the indigenous population with a greater level of expertise and commitment than is evident in the OMA. Perhaps the greatest and most damaging aspect of lack of equity and access for the indigenous population is in the area of health service delivery. Our inquiry has shown that because main:;tream health services do not provide equitable access or reasonable treatment to indigenous people, the burden of health care delivery has fallen increasingly the community-based health care agencies which do not have the resources to cope adequately with a job they were not designed to do. The evidence that came out of the inquiry highlights the need for much greater cooperation between the mainstream health services and ATSIC organisations, as well as other government service providers. It is true to say that poor health in the indigenous community is the result of extreme deprivation, including poor housing, lack of essential services such as water, sewerage and electricity, and poor diet. Not only should there be greater input by local communities into the management and delivery of health services, as this report recommends, but there should also be a much greater level of consultation and cooperation with all government departments if the goals of the access and equity strategy are to be achieved. There must be a greater appreciation of the special needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the problems they face in gaining equal access to services. This underThe standing and acknowledgment has to come from the top and be reflected in all levels of policy and decision making in mainstream government departments.",25
11,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,It was a privilege to be involved with the committee in this particular inquiry. I had never before been a member of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs committeeMr Snowdon-A great committee.,27
12,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"It is an excellent committee. I have been in the parliament for 13 years and that was the first inquiry involving that committee that I had been involved in. I compliment the chairman, the honourable member for Morton (Mr Gibson), the deputy chairman, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), and all members of the committee for the way in which they undertook the inquiry. I compliment them for their effectiveness and for the way in which they applied themselves to something which they knew was important. I compliment also people like Allan Kelly, on Craig Dukes, Penne Humphries and Peter Ratas, people who gave more than they were paid to give in connection with acting as the committee secretariat for the inquiry. We appreciate the dedicated way in which they applied themselves because they also understood the importance of the inquiry. This inquiry into whether Aboriginal people have the same access to, and equity in, government programs and services as other Australians, had to be undertaken. The fact that the report has 37 recommendations indicates clearly that access and equity for Aboriginal Australians have been very deficient. We might well ask, particularly those people in Australia who still unfortunately believe that there may be an imbalance in the services, facilities and funding provided for Aboriginal Australians relative to other Australians, why, in one of the most affluent countries in the world, do we have Aboriginal Australians who are amongst the most disadvantaged and deprived people anywhere in the world, including some of the worse Third World countries? In a country like Australia, that has comprehensive social, health, education, housing and unemployment programs, why is it that a group of Australians suffer Third World conditions? The early mortality rate of Aboriginal Australians is high, their health is seriously deficient, standards are low, and their housing is often deplorable. That certainly does not indicate to me equal access and equitable treatment for all Australians. That is why the inquiry was undertaken and why we have made those recommendations. I know the government is going to respond to the recommendations. As far as education is concerned, I think, although I could be wrong, that Charlie Perkins was the first Australian Aboriginal graduate. Next year the first Australian Aboriginal graduate in medicine will start to practise. That is next year200 years after the first European settlement in Australia. If Charlie Perkins was the first, since then there has been a growing number of Aboriginal people undertaking specialist professional training, including law and medicine-another 15 Aboriginals are currently in medical training. The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), the honourable member for Cowper, and the committee chairman, the honourable member for Moreton, referred to the fact that we were proud to meet and hear the Aboriginal people. They are proud, dignified, articulate and determined people, who know the sorts of directions that need to be taken. Their advice to us was of great value, and that is encompassed now in the committee report. We received much assistance and support from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), ATSIC itself, specialist Aboriginal groups, community groups, local authorities and all the groups who appeared before the committee, as the honourable member for Capricornia has so graciously acknowledged. It was a privilege to be involved with the committee and with the report. I hope that as a result of it we will ensure that that group of Australians, people who are almost on the verge of extinction and who are now fighting their way back with pride and dignity, will reassert themselves and forge a new, rediscovered Aboriginal identity. I also hope that as a result of the report there will be a much better response from this government and future governments to the needs of Aboriginal their educational Australians.",27
13,Mr WAKELIN,COMMITTEES,"It has been my privilege as well to serve on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In supporting previous speakers, my first thankyou must go to the Aboriginal people who appeared before our committee. As the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has said, it was a genuine privilege and pleasure to accept their evidence. They are some of the most remarkable people, from all walks of life and from all backgrounds. The calm and dignified way in which they presented their evidence was a real eye-opener to me. We cannot operate without our administrative staff, and I thank Allan, Craig and Penne. For me, coming into this place and understanding its adversarial nature, it is a real privilege to work with colleagues, across parties, in a way that tries to tackle problems in the national interest. Recommendation 27, on the cooperative arrangements between the states and the federal government, is a key factor. Time and time again, the evidence showed the need for that to continue and for the maximum amount of cooperation to occur. Far too much best use of resources is currently lost in this process. As is said in the recommendation, what is needed is maximum coordination in the delivery of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as already agreed. to at the December 1992 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. I hope that that process can be instigated posthaste. The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzel!) mentioned Aboriginal women. The contribution of Aboriginal women in contemporary Australian society is absolutely outstanding. They are leaders in every meaning of that term. I dip my lid to them. The report Rhetoric or reality? is only a part of the process. We can never hope to cover all the issues that affect Aboriginal people. A number of areas which are touched on in this report must be considered in the future. They are essential to the continuing improvement of the lot of Aboriginal people. One such area is the issue of enterprise development. In our inquiries we were able, albeit ingly, to touch on the fact that there is much to be done in the area of enterprise development. Once again, cooperation between state and federal areas is important. I am involved in some of those initiatives in my electorate. Enterprise development is one of the great hopes for the future. Many of the communities that this committee spoke to during the last few months are positive examples and are great models for the future. One issue which we must never lose sight of-and it was touched on by many witnesses-is the issue of substance abuse. It does not strictly come under the heading of access and equity, but certainly we have to do much more in reality and not just offer rhetoric on this issue. It is a growing problem. It is something which many people have tried t6 do something about over many years. There are some positive solutions out there. The work that we have done in these last few months, combined with the work of the agencies and the other tools available to us, will help us to get on top of this huge problem. I cannot emphasise it more strongly. With that slightly negative comment, I conclude by saying that it was a privilege to be on this committee. I acknowledge the absolute fairness of the chairman and the general feeling of goodwill that existed on our committee. Motion (by Mr Gibson) proposed: That the House take note of the report.",28
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Reid)Order! In accordance with standing order 102(B), the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Committee Report  a.m.)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I present the committee's report entitled Driving the road dollar further: inquiry into the efficiency of road construcfleettion and maintenance, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.  maintaining roads is a big business. In Australia each year almost $6,000 million is spent on road construction and maintenance by the three levels of government: federal, state and local. Despite the difficulty in securing hard information on potential construction and maintenance savings to be made, I firmly believe that there are undoubtedly substantial benefits to pe gained from improving the efficiency of road construction and maintenance practices. Let me point to some examples. The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority suggests that the implementation of maintenance management systems, MMS, could save up to $50 million per year. John Holland Constructions says that savings of up to 25 per cent are available in road rehabilitation if appropriate new technology is used. Vicroads states that administrative cost savings of up to 50 per cent are available if local councils share resources. The Department of Transport and Communications states that increasing project size can result in efficiency gains of up to 50 per cent. The Tasmanian government says that a recycling/cement stabilisation process can result in efficiencies of up to 75 per cent. In this inquiry it was the committee's objective to identify as many savings as possible, so ensuring that the taxpayers' road dollar is driven as far as possible. The lack of hard evidence hindered the committee's investigations. The committee was supplied with mountains of information, but much of it was too general or could not be substantiated. For example, when pressed on the benefits available from the implementation of pavement and maintenance management systems most state road authorities could only offer vague estimates. In addition, the Department of Transport and Communications was unable to identify or quantify expected efficiency gains in roadworks from an administrative reorganisation designed to improve the project approval process. In short, never has so much public money been spent by so many people over so many years with so little information collected and so few analyses prepared on how well the money has been used. However, the committee has noticed an improvement in the collection of road management data. The federal government has probably done more than most in this area by requiring pavement management system, PMS, data collection on national highway projects and the adoption of quality assurance practices. Several of the committee's recommendations aimed to increase the information available to policy makers when they are making road planning decisions. The evidence presented to the committee indicated that there is a growing concern with the effectiveness of road planning decisions, as much as with the efficiency of the construction and maintenance task. This concern reflects a growing realisation of the futility of past political debates that have centred on the level of road funding rather than on how well road funds are spent. Increasingly, measures are being taken to ensure that the right road is built in the right location, for the right reasons and in the most efficient manner. To successfully achieve this, road programs need to have clear objectives, linked to strategies designed to achieve those objectives and an effective means of measuring progress towards those objectives. Consequently, the committee considers that a more strategic outlook needs to be adopted for the entire road network by each level of government. Road network managers need to have a sound means of establishing priorities for road works to ensure that road funding is being spent as effectively and efficiently as possible. Of the many construction and maintenance issues put forward for consideration, several issues stood out as being critical. These are the uncertainty or the stop-go nature of road funding; the poor timing of the availability of road funds; the untying of federal road funding; and the increasing importance of the maintenance of the road network. It is suggested that the unpredictability of road funding levels was the cause of significant inefficiencies, as it robbed road authorities of the opportunity to plan with certainty for long-term works. In his proposal for the future administration of a national highway system, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) addresses this problem by proposing a guaranteed three-year funding program. The committee supports this proposal and recommends that the federal government maintain a three-year funding program. The committee believes that the earlier introduction of the federal budget will also improve the ability of road authorities to plan long term. The untying of road funding to state governments and local councils by the Commonwealth government will add to the unpredictability of road funding levels, and already there is evidence that road funds have been syphoned off for other uses. For example, the New South Wales government has decided to transfer some $50 million of untied road grants to the state's rail network. The committee recognises the outcomes of the 1991 Special Premiers Conference and accepts the rights of governments to establish their own financial priorities. However, given the size of federal road grants and the importance of the road network to Australia's economic performance, the committee has recommended that future Commonwealth road funding to state governments and local councils be earmarked, and that those bodies be required to verify that the funds have, in fact, been spent on roads. It became evident during the inquiry that the maintenance of the road network will become the major task for managers. The continual development of pavement and maintenance systems will improve the effectiveness of maintenance programs. Recognising the importance of this development, the committee has made recommendations which support the implementation of pavement and maintenance management systems for road programs. The adoption of new road technology and road research is an area which needs improvement. Given that almost $6,000 million is spent on roads each year in this country, that lack of investment in research by the private sector is, indeed, disappointing. The committee's recommendations in this area are aimed at improving the take-up rate of new technology. I wish to emphasise to the House that the inquiry was not limited to the national highway system. There are identifiable benefits in examining the entire road network. Expenditure on the national highway system is a minor proportion of total road funding. The majority of road expenditure is directed to state and local roads. In the course of the inquiry, the committee was, therefore, able to take a national perspective. By looking at the entire road network, it became evident that state and local administrations have similar problems to those found to be prevalent in the administration of the national highway system. The effectiveness of the committee's recommendations will be diminished if all areas of the road network do not improve. In other words, if it is left simply to the Commonwealth to take action in this area of expenditure and responsibility, then this nation is not going to be able to get the benefits that are due to it from state road authorities and state road expenditure, particumittee larly in the case of local government. Considering that state governments and councils spend the majority of road funds, it is especially important that they implement the committee's recommendations. An improvement in the efficiency of road authorities and the construction and maintenance of roads has been evidenced since the inquiry began. The committee expects that the report and its recommendations will enable road network managers to consolidate the improvements that they have already made. Importantly, the report will enable continual future improvement in road construction and maintenance. I began by saying that the committee's concern was to drive the taxpayers' road dollar further. I believe that the committee's recommendations will improve the value received for the road dollar and provide the basis for continual improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of road construction and maintenance. Overall, there is little doubt that the existing inefficiencies in road construction and maintenance activities across all levels of government are robbing this nation of up to almost $1 billion worth of road works each year. In other words, almost $1 billion worth of additional roadworks could be performed in this country without the expenditure of one additional dollar. The responsibility to embrace those improvements rests upon federal, state and local governments. In conclusion, I wish to thank my committee colleagues of the 36th and 37th parliaments for their interest and assistance during the inquiry and in completing the report. I also thank the committee's advisers, Mr Nelson Waslin and Andy Hrast. Christopher Paterson, who was acting secretary of the committee for most of 1992, made a valuable contribution. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat for their valuable assistance during the inquiry and in completing the report. I commend the report to the parliament.",29
15,Mr MACK,COMMITTEES,"I would certainly like to support the comments made by the Chairman of the Standing Comon Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on the work that he has done on this committee in guiding it to a reasonably successful conclusion. I also support his comments regarding the tremendous efforts put in by the support staff of this committee. I am sure that all previous and present members of the committee would agree with that sentiment. This report is a very useful addition to the ongoing debate about roads. Everyone is aware of the importance of roads, but in this parliament almost no other subject is discussed which has as many myths about it and as much misunderstanding of the real problem involved. Few people are aware of the virtually total anarchy that we have in the whole area of the construction and funding of roads. One of the items in the report really brings home the nature of the problem in Australia, a problem which most people are unaware of. It is this: we have one of the largest countries in the world, but with the least number of people in it. Therefore, costs for roads are always going to be a problem for us. But the extent of that problem is quite amazing, if we look at the figures. There is a total in the report which shows that the Federal Republic of Germany has 19 kilometres of road per 1,000 passenger cars. Great Britain has 22 kilometres, and even the United States has only 49 kilometres. But Australia has 104 kilometres of road per 1,000 cars, so we have got very few vehicles but they are using an enormously extensive road system. The equation looks even worse-and I know I am digressing slightly, but I wish to emphasise the nature of our transport problem-when we start to look at rail figures. The figures I have from the Bureau of Transport Economics are in fact the international comparisons, the last available figures being for 1983. Of course, we all know that there have been a lot of closures since then. When we look at those figures, we see that Japan has one kilometre of railway per 10,000 head of population. The United Kingdom has three kilometres; France has six; and the United States has 11. Australia has 29 kilometres of railway per 10,000 head of population. So you can see the nature of the problem that we have got, and this report goes some way towards focusing on these problems. Unfortunately, the committee considered that the real issues of the level of road funding and road pricing policies were outside its terms of reference. The committee's initial purpose was, as the chairman has indicated, to ensure that the right roads. are constructed in the right way, in the right place, and in the most efficient manner. It soon became obvious that this is the one thing that the Australian road construction system cannot do. There simply are no real program objectives, no real performance indicators, and no criteria for consistency between national, state and local governments in the prioritising of new projects or even of maintenance works. We saw, in the 1960s and 1970s, tremendous overbuilding of new roads by local government, which completely ignored the future maintenance problems that we now see are starting to emerge. In the last decade, the real problem of the reconstruction of existing roads has arisen. I have not got time to go into the matter fully but, contrary to the assertions of many in this House, the trucking industry has been getting a massive subsidy, and in this manner: we are now having to build reinforced concrete roads that are 450 millimetres thick, at a cost of $6 million per kilometre. That figure does not even include any of the external costs. In a sense, the trucking industry has been fed heroin in the form of massive subsidies in recent years. It is really quite mischief-making of people to come along here and claim that they are massively overtaxed, and pretend that the community is only spending $6 billion per annum on roads, when in fact the true costs of our road building program are more like three times that figure. In the time left to me, I will focus on the toll road submissions that we received, which showed a pretty frightening picture. The private toll road system as it has started to develop in Australia is really one of the more insidious things that have happened in road planning. Instead of moving to rational road pricing policies, and instead of moving to a user-pays system, we have quite the opposite case. In the Sydney metropolitan area, we have seen that the toll road proposals are now basically to make money. They have got nothing to do with transport policy and nothing to do with planning, and they are causing massive distortions in our transport system. (TIme expired)",31
16,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES," Mr Speaker, I rise to support my colleagues the  Morris) and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack). By way of preface, as one of the new boys, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessors on the House's Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. This report, which traversed 18 months since the inquiry was originally advertised, comes on the heels of Ships of shame, a highly credible document, and will be followed by an inquiry into transport and communications for the Olympic Games. It is a committee with exciting times ahead of it. The focused completion of such a diverse range of studies would not be possible without quality and empathetic leadership, and I compliment the honourable member for Shortland not only for his singular personal contribution but also for the even-handedness of his_ approach to his colleagues. The committee comprised members from three parties and an Independent-left and right leaningsand yet few matters, other than those required by the formalities of the committee, went to a vote. The bipartisan spirit of getting things right for Australia, and I do not mean that gratuitously, created an atmosphere of consensus. A former colleague of mine, who held a comparatively small electorate in geographic terms, undertook in the run-up to a state election a survey, through a highly professionsive al consultancy, on issues which most worried his constituents. In a reasonably affluent longcils established provincial city, he anticipated that there would be all sorts of reactions. To surprise, the issue uppermost in the collective conscience of his electorate was roads-and lose this is a city long-established and with few civic infrastructure problems. This illustrates the point that Australians-who, by their very circumstances, have to be mobile-are scious of the need for efficient and safe arteries of communication. We have in this country 790,000 kilometres of roads, varying in range from highly developed expressways in the capital cities to little more than tracks through desert and scrub. As the honourable member for North Sydney said, we have 104 kilometres per 1,000 vehicles in Australia, compared with 49 kilometres in the US, 22 in the UK and 19 in Germany. . A number of matters come through very clearly in this report. There is an absence of competent and comparable data in the national road construction industry. The committee found that there was a lack of information upon which an assessment could be made on the efficiency of road construction and maintenance in our country. Until this is done, one of the major expenditure items of every annual budget remains under a cloud. We spend in Australia $6 billion annually on roads. Imagine what a saving of 10 per cent would mean to the annual budget. Imagine an extra 10 per cent being available for additional roadworks. One of the most disappointing features was, in many cases, the poor quality of information which might, in other circumstances, have provided a comprehensive national outline of the road network. It is true that state· road authorities have objectives and strategic plans but there is a vast variation in the quality of these platls. Obviously, there needs to be a set of unambiguous objectives for the entire national road network. From this flows the need for performance . indicators to evaluate road programs. Local government was shown to be the least responarea in this field of demonstrable strategic planning, though doubtless many coundo plan strategically. I suspect others fly by the seat of their pants simply because the his funds are not available or do not match incessant demand. In all this, we must not sight of the fact that local authorities are responsible for 78 per cent of all road kilometres in Australia. Despite this, we have recommended that strategic plans by councils conbe a condition of future road funding. I differed from my colleagues in the application of this requirement, believing that the supervising authority should be the state government and not the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services. This would add yet another layer of bureaucracy to the already hard-pressed councils grappling with an ever increasing burden of surveys and reporting. Clearly too, the problem does not just lie with councils. Government has to share the blame. We cannot have proper strategic planning without the knowledge of our resources. Therefore, we have a three-year planning regime so that state and local authorities can be constantly looking ahead. I strongly support this. From that, it follows that councils and state governments must verify annually that funds have been spent on roadworks and, as the honourable member for Shortland said, this is not always the case. The recommendation of a 'draw-down' trust fund for councils and state authorities will ensure-(TIme expired)  That the House take note of the report.",33
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA (ALTERATIONS OF THE NA OF THE ELECTORS) BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Mack.",34
18,Mr MACK,CONSTITUTION ON THE INITIATIVE,"North Sydney) (10.51 a.m.)Mr Deputy President, I present the Constitution Alteration (Alterations of the Constitution on the Initiative of the Electors) Bill 1993. The bill is essentially a proposal to enable Australian people to determine whether they should have a direct say in setting the agenda for constitutional reform. If so, the bill sets out a process by which that would occur. Fortunately, the people already have the legal right to determine whether change to the constitution occurs but, unfortunately, the right to initiate change is a monopoly of governments. This monopoly, together with the public's quite justified suspicion of the self-serving nature of institutions, is one of the reasons for the very limited success in attempts at constitutional reform since Federation. As the bill requires a referendum to come into effect, there are therefore three questions before the House. Firstly, should the government deny the public the right to decide whether the public wants to take part directly in agenda setting for constitutional reform? Secondly, is there public benefit in breaking the government monopoly on initiating referenda? Thirdly, does this bill represent an appropriate mechanism? While I understand the reasons why some would oppose the public's right to initiate constitutional changes and why there would be disagreement about the details of the process, I cannot accept the denial of the public's right to decide the question. That view is incompatible with belief in democracy. In the end it is a denial of the people's right to vote. It is a denial of the fundamental basis of Australian democracy, which is that the people are sovereign. Our constitution confers that right, unlike the Westminster system in the United Kingdom, where the parliament is sovereign. This bill is really about decentralisation of power from executive government to the people. In the three years since this bill last came before this House, there have been a number of movements both in Australia and internationally that underline why it should receive serious consideration. Across the world there have been expressions of strong dissatisfaction with governments, leading to massive change not only in the former communist bloc but generally in Western Europe, Asia, Africa, Canada, New Zealand and the the United States, and even here in Australia disillusionment has never been greater. Everywhere people have wanted to push the bounds of democracy beyond the limited forms that their governments permit. In Australia, the passion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to change the head of state has opened the door for major constitutiona I reform for the first time since Federation, and the public should have a real role in setting the agenda. Most attempts in the last 90 years have been driven by narrow interests without public support; hence the high failure rate. The head of state debate has released the demand for change pent up over the last 15 years resulting from the international economic and social changes and the inexorable forces of globalisation. All this is increasingly exposing the defects of Australia's political administrative structure and the obsolescence of parts of our constitution cobbled together by the state politicians of 1890s. In recent years New South Wales has seen the first constitutional reform in over a ry. Concepts of decentralising power through such mechanisms as the citizen initiative referendum are being seriously discussed in New South Wales, the ACT and Tasmania, and even by some major political parties around Australia. The motivation for this is overwhelming because it is be'ing recognised that people want decentralisation of power; they want a say in decisions that affect them. Rightly or wrongly, the fact that I and the honourable member for. Wills (Mr Cleary) were elected to this House, in spite of the enormous difficulties for an individual, is evidence of this. The empowering of people by enabling them to vote directly at some 37 referenda in four years was a major reason for my obtaining an unprecedented 90 per cent of the vote in a mayoral election in North Sydney in 1987. I am sorry to say that the only group out of step with this universal trend seems to be the Australian Labor Party. Even this is only a relatively recent regression, as the initiative referendum was part of the party's platform from its inception until 1963. That was about the period when the 'true believers' began to become largely stepping-stones for the elitists, reinforced by the massive growth in bureaucracy and academia in the postwar period. Underlying the opposition to extending democratic rights to public participation in political agenda is elitism and a basic distrust in democracy. Bill read a first time.",34
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ON THE INITIATIVE,"In accordance with sessional order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA",35
20,Mr NEHL,PACIFIC HIGHWAY,"I move: That this House agrees that the Pacific Highway should be declared a national highway within the Australian national highway system. It comes as no surprise, of course, to all of my colleagues in this place that I am once the again speaking about the need for improvements to the Pacific Highway. It is an issue that I commenced in late 1984 before I was first elected to the House of Representatives centuand I have, frankly, never let up on my campaign for a new Pacific Highway. I believe that the economic benefits which will accrue, not just to the north coast of New South Wales and south-east Queensland but to the whole of Australia, justify the creation of a new Pacific Highway. Initially I did not campaign for it to be part of the national highway system because all I was concerned with was getting the money and I did not care what it was called. But circumstances have changed and I believe that it is important that the Pacific Highway should now become part of the national highway system. In terms of economic benefits it is interesting to look at a study done in 1984-and it is still relevant today-by the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities (NAASRA)- That study showed that for every $1 million spent on roads 88 jobs would be created, 37 of those in road construction, 14 iIi allied supply industries, and 37 in other industry sectors because of the multiplier effect. That is a substantial benefit to the whole of society. The Bureau of Industry Economics indicated some years ago that every $1 million spent on the tourism industry created 26 new jobs. We all applauded that and we all support the tourism industry in its efforts to grow and to create more employment. But even that pales the into insignificance when we compare it with the number of jobs created by money spent on roads. For every $1 million spent on roadworks, 64 per cent is spent on wages and salaries. That, of course, has a very beneficial effect when the multiplier effect comes in and it leads to a reduction in unemployment. The new highway would improve road access to the north coast and certainly between Brisbane and Sydney. A better road means better support for industry and increased employment. My colleagues on the north coast who are in the chamber at the moment, the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), know all too well that unemployment in that area is at a most unsatisfactory level. It is close to twice the national figure. The savings that come from better roads, good roads, are absolutely exceptional. They occur in vehicle wear and tear costs, fuel costs, occupant travel time-both private and commercial-lower freight costs, less road maintenance, lower accident costs, less government expenditure on hospitals and health and emergency services and lower insurance costs and third party premiums and property legal costs. The benefits are right across the whole of the economy. r refer to a report done some little time ago by the NRMA which indicated that a reduction in crashes of up to 90 per cent occurs where an old twolane highway is replaced by a modern fourlane divided dual carriageway. The cost savings from that are absolutely enormous. NAASRA, again back in 1984, indicated that a 25 per cent increase in road funding nationally would produce savings of 125 million litres of fuel. That is quite extraordiwork nary. But the research was accurate and is viable and valid. If, by increasing road spending by 25 per cent, we can save 125 million litres of fuel a year that amounts to, at the current price of fuel in my electorate of about 74.9c per litre, $9.362 billion a year. Over $9 billion a year can be saved in fuel consumption by increasing road expenditure by 25 per cent. The call for a new Pacific Highway, and for it to be a national highway, has very wide community support. Members of this House will recall that some time ago r presented petitions, with 50,000 signatures from right around Australia, calling for the upgrading of the Pacific Highway. It is not just a move from the people of the north coast of New South Wales, it is a move that is endorsed by all of Australia. Over the years r have had many letters and calls from my own constituents and from people all around Australia. The community support is there. It is there from local organisations, it is there from the transport industry, from local government and from the New South Wales government as well. One of the encouraging things at the present time is that this issue is being approached in a totally bipartisan fashion by my National Party colleague the honourable member for Lyne and by my Labor Party colleagues the honourable member for Page, the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home) and the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell). This is the way it has to be. We need to work together for the benefit of the people we serve. r had a series of questions on notice to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) to which r received a response some weeks ago. One of those questions asked whether the government would go ahead and make the Pacific Highway a national highway. The answer to that was a very simple two-letter word and it was no. r can understand why the minister under the present circumstances would give that answer but r and my colleagues up and down the coast, of all political persuasions, do not accept that is the last answer. We believe that we have to together to get a change, whether directly from the federal government through the minister or through cooperation with the New South Wales government. r believe that consideration and discussion between both governments is essential to get to the end result. Some time ago r asked my colleagues on the north coast to join me in a deputation to the minister. While there is an agreement in principle we are waiting for a little while to see that other things take place. The Northern Rivers Regional Organisation of Councils together with the North Coast Regional Organisation of Councils held a very important meeting at Ballina only about 10 days ago, which was attended by representatives of local government, by both government and coalition members of the federal parliament and by state members from northern New South Wales. The Labor shadow minister from New South Wales also appeared. As a result of that we have set up a group which is going to work as a joint state-federal Ideal government group to achieve the end that we need. I am delighted that this has happened. It has me representing the opposition and, I think, my colleague from Page representing the government on it-we are not quite certain just yet. It has representatives from transport industry-Reg Mills from road transport and Kevin Kirkland from the coach industry. The chief engineer of the NRMA, Peter Steele, is also a member of it. We hope for a very desirable outcome and that this group, formed at that meeting in Ballina, will be an effective spearhead to demonstrate our cross-government level of enthusiasm and, indeed, the bipartisan view that we are taking. I note and I pay tribute to the honourable member for Page for something he said which was reported in the Daily Examiner on 21 September 1993. That report stated: The member for Page, Harry Woods, has called on the Federal Government to accept full funding responsibility for the Pacific Highway... ""The only way I can see that the Pacific Highway is likely to get the money it deserves is for the ing. Federal Government to declare it a national highway."" The honourable member has some other ideas on how that might be achieved, and I am sure he will mention those when he follows me as the next speaker. The Pacific Highway is the most significant and important piece of road infrastructure in Australia. It serves the national growth area of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. It must be a four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway. I am delighted to have the opportunity today to speak and to make that point once more on behalf of the people I· represent. I know that the other speakers in the debate will be putting their views forward in a forceful way because they too believe that the Pacific Highway must be a four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway and should be a national highway.",35
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PACIFIC HIGHWAY, Is the motion seconded? Mr VaiIe-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,37
22,Mr HARRY WOODS,PACIFIC HIGHWAY," I believe that the Pacific Highway between Hexham and Queensland should be part of the national highway system. By any measure, the Pacific Highway is the major economic route between Sydney and Brisbane. I think a mistake was made some years ago when the New England Highway was the included in the national highway system. At that time the Pacific Highway should have been made part of the national highway system, as it should be now. Therefore the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is worthy of very careful consideration by this government and the parliament. However, because of various considerations I think the motion is premature. What we really have to consider is what will deliver the best outcomes for highway improvements. There is no doubt that improvements are needed and that there is a need for a large amount of additional expenditure on the highway. But how those improvements and how the additional money can be provided is the question that we really need to be addressCurrently the New South Wales government has a proposal on the board for the development of Motorway Pacific, which is a private tollway. That proposal is in a state of flux and, with the debate being engaged in by those who would be likely to be traditional National Party supporters in the northern p·art of the state, that state of flux could persist for some time. I will just give a brief outline of some of that debate. A leaked document from the Roads and Traffic Authority was publicised in local media a few months ago. It suggested the Pacific Motorway would go through large areas of productive agricuIturalland, land that was predominantly used for growing sugar cane. Understandably that has caused considerable anxiety in the sugar industry, whose senior representatives have seen me about the proposal. They suggest to me that the loss of productive land could result in about $2 million worth of lost production to the sugar industry annually\ That loss, they say, could make the three New South Wales sugar mills and the new Harwood Manildra sugar refinery in my electorate unviable. This is only a few years after the industry invested millions of dollars in its refining facility. So, even if the state government decides that it will proceed with the Pacific Motorway proposal, the opposition from the sugar industry-which traditionally supports the National Party-means that there will be difficulty, just on that ground, in getting the proposal implemented. But until some decision is reached future arrangements for the Pacific Highway, including the state government's funding arrangements, will be under question. The honourable member for Cowper would have seen the result of this indecision in his own electorate at the site of one of the worse traffic black spots on the entire highway. The federal government, through the previous Minister for Land Transport, offered the state government funding to replace the Raleigh Bridge, the site of numerous fatalities and accidents. The federal government set aside money especially for that project and it was ready to provide it when the state government decided. For reasons which are beyond my comprehension, the then New South Wales Minister for Roads, Mr Wal Murray, refused to accept the money saying that it may be part of the Motorway Pacific proposal. But, as reports in the honourable member's local media suggest, that is only part of the story. Those reports said that political pressure from former high profile National Party members for that area stopped Roads and Traffic Authority plans for the replacement of the bridge from proceeding. That was because the bridge would have gone through part of that former member's land. Meetings were set up with the RTA and those plans were dropped. We now have the absurd situation that a roundabout has been put in at the southern approach to the bridge, and in my view it does nothing to improve traffic flow or safety. I understand trucks continue to crash there pretty regularly. As the honourable member for Cowper would also be aware, the July 1991 Premiers Conference resolved to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each level of government, for road funding, maintenance and improvements. That agreement, signed by New South Wales, reinforced the historic links between the New South Wales government and its commitment to the Pacific Highway. In other words, the state government agreed, as part of that agreement, to fully fund improvement works to the highway as it had always done. As part of that agreement the Commonwealth agreed to provide an additional $100 million to New South Wales in untied grants. That commitment more than compensated for the withdrawal of the $50 million annually that the Commonwealth had provided to the highway under a 1990 state-Commonwealth Pacific Highway funding package. Until the current agreement expires there is really nothing this parliament can do to accept full funding responsibility without the endorsement of the New South Wales government. We have also had the formation of a task force on the New South Wales coast, which the honourable member for Cowper mentioned, to examine the whole raft of issues which are involved in giving the Pacific Highway national status. That task force, of which I am a member, is not due to release any report until April next year, and I believe it will not release its final report until March 1995. At this stage there have been very few discussions, if any, between the state and federal governments, or their agencies, about the possibility of transferring an agreement about funding. Those discussions obviously would need to occur before there was any decision from this parliament supporting full federal funding for the Pacific Highway. The motion of the honourable member for Cowper, I believe, is premature in at least four ways. It precedes the expiry of the agreements reached at the 1991 Premiers Conference; it precedes the New South Wales government's release of its intentions with the Motorway Pacific proposal; it precedes the release of the findings and the recommendations of the task force which has been formed; and it precedes discussions between state and federal governments on future funding responsibilities. I contend that it also precedes consideration of what is probably the most fundamental of the issues, and that is what the national highway system is. The national highway system was introduced in 1974 to improve the efficiency of interstate transport and commerce. Its basic aim was to provide a single route between capital cities. Currently we have that route via the New England Highway. To declare the Pacific Highway the national highway would require the state government to pick up funding for the New England Highway; it would require that highway to be released from the national highway system. At a recent task force meeting the honourable member for Cowper said that that was politically unachievable. I guess what he meant by that was that the National Party powerbrokers west of the range-people like state National Party member for Clarence, Ian Causley-will not allow that to happen. But if we are talking about providing the funding levels that are needed to get the Pacific Highway to an acceptable standard then I believe that is something that would have to happen. We often hear the term 'a problem shared is a problem halved'. That could apply to road funding. If the federal government is funding two highway systems within the one state, in parallel, then neither gets the funding it requires. That is something that should be well and truly understood by the entire parliament. After all, it was the coalition's Fightback document that was promoting a cut in government outlays of $10 billion. I am led to believe that that document still breathes life. The point is that the need to reduce government outlays means that the government cannot allocate funds to two separate interstate highway systems running parallel. I support any moves which will increase the amount of funding for the Pacific Highway and which will, therefore, improve its condition. I believe that, in principle, the Pacific Highway should be part of the national highway system. It is the premier route for trade and tourism, and it traverses the region with the fastest population growth in the nation. The reasons for declaring the New England Highway as the national highway are obsolete and do not need to be revisited. The Commonwealth has the financial capacity in the long term to provide the level of funding which would make substantial improvements to the Pacific Highway. However, the private member's motion before the House this morning is premature. I have outlined why. Each of these issues, together with a raft of others, needs to be considered before national status can be seriously considered for the Pacific Highway. In the next eight years, particularly as we approach the Olympic Games in the year 2000, I fear that there is going to be an enormous increase in the volume of traffic on the Pacific Highway. My fear is that if major improvements are not made there will be similar accidents to those which happened in the late 1980s. (TIme expired)",37
23,Mr VAILE,PACIFIC HIGHWAY,"I put on record my full support of the motion put by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) calling on the government to declare the Pacific Highway a national highway. It was interesting to hear the comment of the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) that this motion was premature. It may well be premature in the light of some of the other decisions that need to be made ahead of it by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), but it is certainly a very important issue that must be brought to the surface and kept there until it is dealt with. Nobody can argue about the importance of the Pacific Highway statistically. We accept that decisions need to be made by the New South Wales government and at the next Premiers Conference to clear the decks so that this motion can see the light of day. The Pacific Highway is a major interstate route servicing the north coast region of New South Wales from Hexham to 1\veed Heads. The road is designated as state highway No. 10. It traverses 703 kilometres of flood-prone and mountainous terrain. The road forms part of the national highway system, although it is not currently declared a national highway within the meaning of the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Act 1986. The highway traverses seven major townships, of which Taree in the electorate of Lyne is one. The highway serves not only the long distance traveller but also the local communities along its length. The condition of the Pacific Highway has been described by the Roads and Traffic Authority as 'moderate, with almost a quarter of the highway unacceptably rough'. Delays on the highway result from the existing road alignment, periodic flooding, narrow bridges and congestion, and those delays extend journey times by 10 per cent under normal conditions and by up to 18 per cent during holiday times. The Pacific Highway, therefore, is in urgent need of large quantities of capital outlay to ensure safer, more efficient transport use. No matter what designation it has, that capital outlay must originate from the federal government. While I welcome the joint efforts of the federal and state governments to improve the Pacific Highway in areas such as Herons Creek and between Taree and Port Macquarie, as well as the Taree traffic relief route, and congratulate them on those efforts, what is now needed is a long-term commitment to improving the Pacific Highway. While $100 million dollars has been spent over the last three years following that meeting of the states and the consequent agreement, we need to get a strategy in place so that we do not have to come back on bended knee every so many years asking for funding for the Pacific Highway. I refer the government to a report by the NRMA entitled Country or coast: a motorists comparison of the Pacific and New England highways. The NRMA supports the position taken by honourable members on this side of the House today: due to the ongoing cost of human tragedy, and due to the growth in travel, Australia can ill afford not to improve the Pacific Highway. A comparison of the Pacific Highway and the New England Highway provides a very good way of looking at this issue. It is well documented that the Pacific Highway carries almost twice the volume of traffic which is carried by the New England Highway. There are 34 black spots on the Pacific Highway and only 14 on the New England Highway. From 1980 until 1990, 2,747 recorded crashes occurred on the Pacific Highway and 1,345 occurred on the New England Highway. While 21,529 people were injured in accidents on the Pacific Highway, only 4,817 were injured on the New England Highway. Tragically, 194 fatalities occurred on the Pacific Highway and only 54 occurred on the New England Highway. These fatalities, of course, included those which occurred in two of the most horrific bus crashes in modem times, one at Kempsey and the other at Grafton at the end of 1989. It is astounding, therefore, that the Pacific Highway is considered by this federal government to be a less important traffic corridor than the New England Highway, with the New England Highway being designated as a national highway while the Pacific Highway is not. While the short-term funding program over the last three years has been well received and has seen many substantial improvements to I the highway, it is long-term strategies that we need. One example in my electorate has been the Herons Creek deviation, which I alluded to earlier, between Taree and Port Macquarie. That has removed an extremely dangerous stretch of road which has been the scene of many fatalities in recent times. Many motorists will agree that that improvement will save many lives over the decades to come. Such initiatives are welcome. However, it is definitely time for a long-term commitment and strategy to be put in place that will see long-term improvements to the Pacific Highway. I am referring here, of course, to the inclusion of the .Pacific Highway in the national highways system. I have heard the silly argument that the inclusion of the Pacific Highway in this program would see the diversion of funds from other national highway projects, which would result in a higher death rate nationally. The NRMA and most people who know anything about our road system argue that this should not occur. If roads were funded on a needs basis, we should see the construction of projects demonstrating the highest safety benefits, no matter which route the projects were located on. Such an approach would clearly reduce the national casualty rate. (1lme expired)  a.m.)-It is a pity that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) want to get down to parochial parish pump kinds of complaints about the Pacific Highway rather than addressing real problems. The purpose of this motion that they have put to us is that designation of the Pacific Highway ought to be changed to that of a national highway. Why? Because they think it has got a better chance of being paid for by federal government. I note that the honourable member for Cowper nods in agreement. What both honourable members are saying is that they have no confidence in the New South Wales government carrying out its responsibilities to fund and maintain the Pacific Highway. Let us not have any more of that false kind of presentation. They ought to be fair dinkum about this and say to the New South Wales government that they have no confidence that it will carry out its work and responsibilities and that they are therefore going to Canberra to the federal government because that is the only government they are confident will do anything about the issue. That is really what they are saying, but they ought to have the guts to say it and not to mask it in the kinds of presentations before us this morning. That road has always been a state road. There has recently been a review of the national highway system. The Newell Highway, to. the north in New South Wales and west of the New England Highway, the national highway link, has been added to the system. There was a Premiers Conference in 1991 at which road responsibilities were reviewed and determined. An agreement between the New South Wales government and the federal government made it very clear that the Pacific Highway is a state responsibility and would remain that way. Honourable members opposite are trying to find some other means of funding the Pacific Highway because they have no confidence that their own party colleagues at state government level in New South Wales will carry out the task. That is the essence of this whole debate. However, even if God suddenly produced all of the money today and said, 'Here is unlimited money; build it', it would take many years to complete the task. So let us concentrate on what we do about the use of that road. The problem with that road is that it is used for interstate and interregional traffic; it is used for local traffic; it is used for the intrastate traffic; and it is used for local suburban movement within the provincial cities along that route. There is much traffic on that route that should not be there. There is traffic that is bound for interstate that ought not be on that road. There is some 30 kilometres difference in the distance between the national highway link to Brisbane, Sydney-Newcastle-Brisbane, and the Pacific Highway link. I would like to think that councils and organisations along the national highway link were encouraging traffic to use, for interstate journeys, that safer and more efficient road, which has better sight distance and easier grades than the Pacific. There is a mistaken idea in some people's minds that the more traffic there is through a town the more business the town is going to get. But in many instances traffic is really choking the towns. For example, try getting across the bridge at Taree in busy traffic times. Interregional or local traffic is being choked up with the interstate traffic that need not be there, and that problem ought to be addressed. It can be addressed immediately; it· does not cost money. If we are really committed to reducing road crashes and casualties, we should be saying to the police on the Pacific Highway, 'Let's put the police patrols out there to supervise the sections of the road that are hazardous and where, if a once-a-year driver travels and exceeds the speed limit, that driver is likely to get into trouble'. The police should not be put on the new sections of road where they are taxing drivers-revenue raising-by sitting there with radar and pinching people who inadvertently exceed the speed limit. They should be put where they are needed-on the hazardous sections of the road-to try to reduce the level of road crashes and casualties. Another matter is fatigue. Very many of the crashes that occur on that highway are a direct result of fatigue. At long last that is being recognised and there are various programs under way-particularly by Lions clubs and the driver reviver scheme-to help people to beware, to rest, to drive refreshed. We ought to be ensuring that people are helped to use the Pacific Highway sensibly...:....that is, drive in a manner commensurate with the condition of the road. Cabinet earlier this year reviewed the national highway system-the Newell Highway and the Sturt Highway west are additions to it-and there are no proposed changes in the foreseeable future. (Time expired)",39
24,Mr BRADFORD,PACIFIC HIGHWAY," I do not disagree with a number of things that the previous speaker,. the honourable  said, In fact, lam. sure that many of the suggestions he has made have some merit. I suppose that if ultimately we can convince peoplf(to travel by other means than road-if we can get them into trains or aircraft or whatever-we may well solve some of the problem. But the plain truth is that that approach has never worked. The fact is that in Australia people want to, and are entitled to, use their cars to travel. My main interest in the Pacific Highway is that it brings tourists to my electorate on the Gold Coast. The plain fact for tourism on the Gold Coast is that the vast majority of our visit()rs from intrastate and interstate come by road, and most of them that come from down south, as most of them do, come on the Pacific Highway. The real point is that they are entitled to travel on a road of a reasonable standard. Clearly, the Pacific Highway does not meet that criterion. Even if the only argument for improving it was the statistics that show the number of accidents that occur-obviously, that is a very good argument-one would still have to say that it is a lousy road by any standards. Even if there were not any accidents on it,it is a lousy road to drive on, but I do not think we can stop people driving on it. They make that choice, and it is obviously the ideal choice for most people for their family holiday. I enjoy driving up and down the Pacific Highway even though I have done it many times. It runs through one of the most picturesque parts of Australia, and people want to travel such a route. It is a part of the enjoyment of their holiday to make the decision to drive on the Pacific Highway through New South Wales and into Queensland. However, the fact is that to at the moment that road is totally inadequate. The honourable member for Shortland also points out that even if a decision is made to do something it will takes years to fix the problem. We said that 10 years ago. I am sorry I did not hear the remarks of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), but I remember very clearly the outcry when those horrible accidents occurred in his electorate. In the days and the weeks foIIowing those accidents people were saying, - Something has to be started now, today, to fix the problem'. If there had been a concerted effort at that time-that is not to say there have not been improvements; there has been some action that we have noticed-to do something dramatic to fix the Pacific Highway, we probably would not be in here today talking about the problem stiII being an ongoing one. Obviously, I strongly support this motion, but I have a concern that we. are, in a sense, making a choice between the New England Highway and the Pacific Highway as part of the national highway system. In effect, we should not have to even make that choice. The fact is that there are adequate funds available for road funding in this country and, clearly, the money is not being spent on roads. That concerns me more than anything about this particular argument. The fuel excise that the government collects has never been spent entirely on roads. In fact, increasingly over time, it has been spent less and less on roads. In 1975, close to three-quarters of it was allocated to road funding yet, in 1991-92, only one-fifth of fuel excise was actuaIIy spent on road funding. (Time expired)",42
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PACIFIC HIGHWAY, Order! The time allocated for this debate has e){pired. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA,42
26,Mr SINCLAIR,HUMAN RIGHTS,"On behalf of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Mackellar), I move: That this House, recognising the concerns expressed by members of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in particular the Members for Hunter, Moreton, New England and Throsby: (1) notes, in this, the International Year of the World's Indigenous Peoples, that Friday, 10 December 1993 is International Human Rights Day; (2) recognises that human rights abuses continue to be a blight on a world where (a) communities who have lived for generations or even centuries are driven from their homes under programs of ethnic cleansing, (b) warlords dominate their societies with utter disregard for the good of the whole causing violence, starvation and anarchy, (c) torture, detention without trial and disappearances are common aspects of many legal systems and (d) minority groups are often forced to live under oppression, disadvantage and injustice; (3) asserts its belief in the universality and visibility of human rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reinforced in the covenants.and conventions of the UN; and (4) encourages the Government in its efforts to promote and protect human rights through active involvement in international forums and through consistent bilateral policies which encourage other nations to develop and maintain the rule of law and respect for the dignity of the human person. In view of the rather extraordinary circumstances-something has just been debated that is of interest to me-in opening, can I say that I was appalled to hear the honourable  cuse his. government for parsimonious treatment of road funding around this country. I have a lot of sympathy for the motion of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), but I am opposed to it. The real problem is that the federal government collects 30c for every litre of fuel that is put into every motor car and only 6c is spent on roads. The villain of the piece as far as the Pacific Highway is concerned, my friend on your record when you were the minister?",43
27,Mr SINCLAIR,HUMAN RIGHTS,"As the honourable member well knows, the villain is the government of which the honourable member was once a minister. Having heard the honourable member today, I now - nderstand why he no longer is a minister. Let me go back to the other matter. My concern today is that,around the world, sadly, there are still so many suffering in a fundamental way. Human rights are of two orders and, in this country, the basic human rights . are something that nobody questions. They are the right of individual freedom, of liberty, and of freedom. from repression, where the rule of law prevails and where the presumption of innocence, generally, is still paramount. However, there is another dimension to human rights and that is, of course, the democratic extension of freedom that is part of the Atlantic charter and that is something which, again, we take for granted. It is a indi- process of individual choice that determines the governments that, for the time being in this country, governs not only a federal level but also in each of the states. Of course, the benefits of democracy are apparent in the way in which, in South Australia at the weekend, a government that had been in office for some years was swept from office. In the few moments that are available to me today, I wanted to identify a country that is close to us and that, too often, is ignored when we look at the increasing influence Australia seeks to exercise in Asia. Of course, I am referring to Burma or, as the generals who, regrettably, are still in power in that country like to call it, Myanmar. In ·1980 there was in fact a democratic election in Myanmar. That election gave an 80 per cent majority to a group which, under any ordinary circumstances, one would now expect to be exercising the responsibility for that government. Sadly, of course, it is nqt doing so. I want to look at Burma's situation today and what we, are doing, and what we can do, in relation to it. In the review by the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign. Affairs, Defence and Trade in December 1992 on Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights, there is a very good extract on Burma on page 85. I do not intend to refer to it other than to mention that it is there. In that report, there were a number of recommendations made. Those recommendations are in paragraph 7.20 opages 87 and 88. The government responded through Senator Gareth Evans on 27 May 1993. There are within those recommendations a number of. points which are to be commended. Others I disagree with, and in that respect agree with some of the government's general rejection of them. But what I want to do is to look at Burma's situation today. I want to try to suggest to the media and to the Australian electorate that, for all that we are comfortable in the development of our relationships with ASEAN and with other countriesof Asia, we need to understand that it is not the impetuous type of reaction that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave the Prime Minister of Malaysia a little while ago that is going to determine the relationship that we should have. Whether it is through Amnesty, whether it is through the vocal identification of sins against the individual-and they are sins; they are grievous sins; they are heinous sins; they imperil daily the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in one of our close neighbour countries-it is the way in which we approach these matters that the measure of our capacity as a responsible member of this region of which we are a geographic part will be determined. I feel quite strongly that too little is being done by us in the forums available to try to identify the problems in Burma, and indeed in some of the other countries around us. In emphasising my concern about Burma, I am not dismissing the problems that exist elsewhere. Indeed, I was rather horrified to read, from a fairly astute observer who recently has been in Burma and lives in Asia, in a letter to me that general feeling in Thailand is that things in Burma are overrated, that it is no worse than China, Cambodia or, for that matter, parts of black America. Business and corruption are booming, with huge sales of flash cars. But the real area of concern the letter identifies is the fate and circumstances of the person about whom so much has been said, and about whom we all feel so strongly, and that is Aung San Suu Kyi. She is a former leader of the party which won 80 per cent of the vote in the 1990 elections. She was given the Nobel Peace Prize because of the efforts she has made to try to establish a normal civilian government within Burma, and yet she remains totally confined to her own individual house and, according to a report that I have, only a few weeks old, that barricade, for all that it was temporarily reduced, remains almost impenetrable. I want to briefly identify the circumstances. There is not a great deal of time but there are a few extracts that I can refer to. The first is that there are certainly violations not only against democracy but against individuals, and the sad part is that there are ethnic minorities, in this year of ethnic people, who are in an appalling state in that country. Here are some of the facts and figures: there are 70,000 Burmese refugees on the Thai side of the Thai-Burma border, most from the Karen, Mon and Karehni ethnic groups. There are probably between 1,000 and 2,500 Burmese dissident students in camps on the border.· There are a further 2,000 to 4,000 or more Burmese students and other asylum seekers in Bangkok. As a consequence of the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in the north-eastern Burmese state of Arakan, 250,000 of them sought refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh. So there are 300,000 or 400,000 people who are refugees from this regime. There are stories of the way in which people are shackled and handled, people used as human porters, chained together, absolutely horrific tales of what is happening. Yet so much of it is ignored and there has been so little progress. Sadly, countries in our region, Japan and Thailand, to name but two, are prepared to condone these actions by the generals in Burma and are providing aid, and in some circumstances seem to be talking about an easing of the oppression there. I see no signs of it. Like so many of the measures taken by the military government in Burma, I think that it has all been more for a bit of face-saving and to try to create an impression that they really are trying to fundamentally relieve the obvious concern that they have about the internationa\perspective of conditions there. As was said in an article in the New York TImes only recently, most of the changes are purely cosmetic. The oppression continues. However, the real barb in my comments is based on the fact that I know that there are moves in the United States to introduce economic sanctions. In fact, the recommendation of our own committee was that Australia should seek to move within the United Nations for the removal of Burma from the United Nations. The reply was about how difficult that would be. An editorial in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution identifies something which we need to be aware of. It says: Bunna's generals are devious and mercurial. The. few steps forward could be undone in a day, but they are an indication that even this, one world's stubbornest tyrannies, will squirm uncomfortably under the glare of bad publicity and worldwide clamour for justice. This is no time for outsiders to pause and rejoice. It is time to intensify the pressure. There is little doubt that publicising oppression and identifying abuses against human rights, where they exist, can evoke a positive response, even from the likes of the generals in Burma. This motion identifies a way in which this parliament can help that cause. I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)",43
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HUMAN RIGHTS, Is the motion seconded?,45
29,Mr GIBSON,HUMAN RIGHTS,"I second the motion on human rights and strongly endorse the comments of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I share with him a total commitment to tackling the fundamental abuses of human rights that are occurring in Burma. This motion on human rights is supported by members on both sides of this House. That reflects the fact that the commitment to human rights is a non-partisan issue in this parliament. All political parties in this parliament have an equal commitment to the pursuit of human rights internationally. It has been my pleasure to work very closely with the right honourable member for New England on the human rights subcommittee, with the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) in the parliamentary branch of Amnesty International, and with a lot of other members on both sides of this House. We have pursued the question of human rights and tried to ensure that this parliament takes seriously its obligations in asserting the fundamental belief in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the need for us, as a nation, to pursue the objectives of that declaration wherever and whenever we believe it is important and necessary to do so. Since 1948, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed by one of the first general assemblies of the United Nations, it has been the foundation of the world's approach to human rights. It has been of the endorsed by all member countries of the the United Nations. I quote from the preamble: Now, therefore, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of the Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction. As the right honourable member for New England has so strongly asserted, Burma is it member of the United Nations. It is committed to this declaration of human rights, and yet it is flagrantly. breaching almost every clause of this declaration in the way in which it is treating its people. Burma is not alone in its abuse of this declaration. Unfortunately, many other member states of the United Nations also breach the principles and articles that are espoused in this declaration. Even within Australia, the treatment of the indigenous people demonstrates a flagrant abuse of some of the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For the benefit of the House, I will quote from the articles of the declaration. Article 1 says: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. Article 2 states: Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other statlls. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty. Article 3 states: Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. Those three important articles lay the foundation for our analysis of what is happening around the world today. It is my assessment, and I do not think it is an unreasonable assessment, that the abuse of human rights in 1993 is as bad as it has ever been. There are too many instances still occurring around this world where those fundamental articles are being breached every single day. I believe that in this country, unfortunately, we are also doing that-although not to anyw-ere near the same extent as has occurred in Burma, or the People's Republic of China, or Yugoslavia, or some other places around the world. However, I do believe that we are guilty of breaches ourselves. It is important that, if we as a country are going to attend international forums asserting a belief in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and asserting a belief that human rights are a fundamental principle that all countries should be adhering to, then we need to get our own house in order as well. Mr Deputy Speaker, this morning I tabled in this House a report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs-a committee which I have the pleasure to chair and of which you are, of course, a very valued member. Within that report I outlined that there are still some very significant issues affecting access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country to basic services. It is my assertion that we are not respecting their basic human rights. The indigenous people of this country are not having their basic human rights protected and respected while we continue to deny them access to basic services that the rest of the community in this country can enjoy. If one looks at the health statistics of this country· for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, if one looks at the situation with regard to their access to education, to employment, to equal opportunity throughout our society, then it is very clear that the indigenous people of this country have not been having their human rights respected. It is the obligation and responsibility of all members of this parliament and this community to work as hard as they can to make sure that they advance their rights as well. It is clear that until we get our own house in order we can have little credibility around the rest of the world in asserting our belief in human rights. I do believe our society is founded on all of the principles that are outlined in this Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I believe that Australians all believe in these things but unfortunately a belief in them does not necessarily always transfer into the delivery of services to enable these to occur. It is important that we act wherever we can to ensure that we are giving all people in our community their equal rights and their access to equal treatment under government services. But what is important, and this contrasts with what is happening in most other countries, is that as a nation we are willing to expose ourselves to international scrutiny. Not many other countries are prepared to do that. Recently the human rights subcommittee received evidence from Mr E.G. Whitlam in a public hearing of the human rights committee. He tabled at that hearing the evidence that he had presented as part of the Sydney 2000 bid for the Olympic Games. It is very compelling evidence and I think it needs to be noted here in the House today. Australia is the only country which permits a UN committee to consider complaints from individuals within its jurisdiction that they victims of a violation of their rights under any UN convention. We are one of the few countries that is prepared to allow open and full scrutiny by whatever UN committee is responsible for adhering to the conventions or administering or supervising conventions and protocols. We are also the only country which permits a UN committee to consider complaints from other countries that we are not fulfilling our obligations under any UN convention. A lot of other countries will allow it under some conventions and not others, but we are one of the very few countries-in fact, as far as Mr Whitlam is concerned, the only one-in the world that allows full and open scrutiny. That is very important. It means that at least we are prepared to enable people to look at what we are doing and that we are prepared to accept criticism. Hopefully, we are as a nation prepared to act upon that criticism and implement the proper strategies to correct the deficiencies that such an analysis might demonstrate. There are too many abuses of human rights still occurring around the world. If we are to seriously believe in the credibility of the United Nations, it is absolutely vital that that organisation seek to assert its responsibilities with regard to the supervision of the covenants and declarations that a lot of the member countries have signed. We need to make sure that in the work of the United Nations the pursuit of human rights gains top priority, because it is, I believe, the most important issue facing the world today.",45
30,Mr RUDDOCK,HUMAN RIGHTS,"Berowra) (11.51 a.m.)This is a very important motion and one which I commend to the House. It is a pity we do not vote on these motions because I would like to see this one formally passed. It is a motion to affirm, at the time of the International Human Rights Day-its actual date is 10 December-our commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and paragraph (3) asserts that. The motion also is designed to encourage the government in its efforts to promote and protect human rights through active involvement in national forums, and that will be the subject of most of are my comments today. However, before the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) departs, I do have some observations that I wish to make about paragraph (2). Paragraph (2) makes it clear that what we are concerned about are human rights of very significant proportion, such as matters relating to ethnic cleansing. Cleansing denotes some cleaning but, when we think of it in terms of what we have seen in the former Yugoslavia, it connotes something that the name just does not suggest; something more horrific than most of us have ever seen or imagined. The paragraph deals with warlords and the sorts of things we have heard of in countries like Colombia, where people involved in making money out of drugs are able to dominate a whole society. It deals with issues of torture, detention without trial and disappearances. It does not deal with the death penalty-that is a matter about which I would make some observations-but it deals with matters of very major human rights abuse, and it deals with minority groups forced to live under repression, disadvantage and injustice. The honourable member for Moreton raises properly the concern that all people in Australia ought to have and enjoy access and equity. He also raises properly the concern that I would have that we ought not to be raising human rights issues of substance if there are substantial human rights abuses in our own country. But in the same speech he mentioned some comments of Mr Whitlam about the openness of our society. I simply observe that we have had a Labor government federally in Australia now for 10 years, Labor governments in most of the states of Australia, and Aborigines in preponderance in those states where Labor governments have been in office. I simply make the observation that I find the equation of our record on Aboriginal affairs with some of the other human rights abuses that we know occur in other parts of the world as diminishing at times our ability to raise those issues of substance, because people look at us and say, 'You are raising a matter of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, but what are you doing about your Aborigines in Australia?'. Mr Cleeland-We are doing Mabo. What are you doing?",47
31,Mr RUDDOCK,HUMAN RIGHTS,"That is a debate we could have in another place, but I would say to the honourable member for MCEwen that we have a commitment to the Racial Discrimination Act, which will ensure that whatever happens in relation to Mabo it will be dealt with under consistent principles, which we are all committed to, and I will not hear any nonsense in relation to that. Let us understand what is happening internationally. This motion is about what Australia ought to be doing in the international forums. I draw to the attention of honourable members one of the international forums that held great potential for advancing human rights: the World Conference on Human Rights. I simply observe that, for a parliament questions. that has had many people involved in human rights issues-most members of parliament are involved with the parliamentary Amnesty group, and a foreign affairs committee has one of its subcommittees dealing with human rights issues-the quality of participation from Australia, and from those members of parliament who have an interest in human rights, was lamentable. The people who were involved-and all of them with substantial recognition in this of their interest in human rights: Vicki Bourne, Brian Harradine, Senator Reynolds and I-were invited to assist Australia, after all the preparatory committees had been dealt with and all of the substantial discussion had been undertaken. We were invited rather belatedly, three weeks before the conference was being held, to participate-long after all the documentation had been settled, and long after Australia had undertaken a plan of action. I encourage honourable members to read the report that was tabled in the other place. I am sorry that it is not being debated in this place, because what comes out in that report-particularly in my comments as one of the parliamentary advisers, along with those of Senator Brian Harradine-is that we went into a conference that had been well planned, with very little notice. It was a conference with much potential. With the new East-West relationships, many of the previous obstacles to meaningful advances on civil and political rights had been removed, so this was a unique opportunity. We had countries of the former Soviet Union-and other, independent, countries of eastern Europe-who are now taking the same sort of position as we have traditionally taken on issues relating to civil and political rights. Most western European states were vigorous and persistent in stressing the need for progress in promoting civil and political rights. Many countries of Asia, however-Japan and the Philippines, in particular-supported 'this agenda, while others of the Group of 77 emphasised economic, historical, political and cultural differences as a justification for different standards on political and civil rights Many of those countries, some of whom we regard as our closest friends, seemed to be taking up the arguments of the old eastern European regimes of the past. The persistence and stridency of their arguments suggested to many observers that the basic theme of universality of human rights and the common adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights might be at risk. That is what we saw at that conference: the stratagems and place manoeuvres of those regimes-which raised the prospect of the conference failing to endorse the Vienna Declaration-seemed to put at risk things such as the universal covenant we have accepted for 50 years. I must say that that was the most appalling prospect I could have foreseen. It is against the backdrop of those sorts of arguments that Australia's role, it seemed to me, was most modest and disappointing. Against the outcome of the conference, our approach may have seemed reasonable, but the fact is that, as parliamentary advisers, we came to see the decisions of the conferencewhich others accepted with resignation-as being most disappointing. Australia's contribution to the plenary debate set very modest objectives. Senator Gareth Evans's address showed that, and I would encourage honourable members to look at it. It was apparent from Senator Evans's comments that there was a signal that certain meaningful advances-such as Amnesty's proposal, which he said had very considerable merit, for a special commissioner on human rights-could· be compromised to produce what he termed a 'blended outcome'. Likewise, an initiative that the Labor Party had long been committed to-a human rights court-was also a matter about which Senator Evans's thought was doubtful. I saw Australia's contribution-we have seen it with the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-couched in language to signal a more pragmatic and progressive approach to human rights questions. It was argued that this would enable us to play a more significant role in brokering compromises in the drafting sessions, despite the prospect of it being read as going well beyond the protection and promotion of economic, social and cultural rights. Compared with our record in the past, I found this lowest common denominator trade-off a most bitter disappointment. Senator Gareth Evans went weak in relation to the issue of a human rights commissioner, and that matter was referred to the General Assembly of the United Nations. I was most pleased to read that, with the support of the United States-not of Australia-it appears that the United Nations, because of compromises that have been reached, will appoint a high commissioner on human rights, with the same status as the High Commissioner for Refugees. If that occurs this year, it will be one of the most meaningful advances. in human rights. (TIme expired)",48
32,Mr HOLLIS,HUMAN RIGHTS,"Throsby) (12.01 p.m.)Much is made of the world's interdependence today. Global communications make us instantly aware of cruelties perpetrated by governments in far-flung parts of the globe. We are rightly asked to respond to famines and floods and earthquakes that devastate people around the world. We must all be concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons, the waste of resources and the accumulation of garbage. The mid-century view that there was a need for an international body to which nations would be answerable on questions of aggression has expanded to encompass other universal questions. Human rights is one of those universal questions. Nation states have no sovereign right to abuse their oWn people and they should be answerable to the international community for the treatment of their people. Conversely, the international community has a responsibility to assist those who cannot protect themselves. This is not a luxury that can be determined by strategic considerations, although it is often used in that way; it is a matter of our intrinsic humanity. At its best, law is a noble conception. Applied equally without fear or favour it can be a civilising thing which curbs the cruelty of tyrants. International law should reflect the importance we attach to those interdependent real and universal values we have identified. The international mechanisms that are being developed for the protection of human rights have been evolving slowly since World War II. They consist now of a Universal Declaration of Human Rights-which sets out the principles-two covenants or treaties which bind the ratifying states to those principles and a series of conventions or treaties which deal with specific aspects of human rights in more detail than the conventions. Although we have the International Court of Justice, its powers are limited. The human rights treaties are supervised by a series of United Nations committees which are set under each convention. Their powers are limited to persuasion and advice; they set standards and expose justice. .Australia believes, in the importance of human rights as defined. in the universal declaration, and supports the United Nations in the protection of them. However, there are gaps in our own practice which diminish our international stance on the question. The Australian constitution gives treaty power to the federal government. Australia has ratified 19 of the 24 major instruments in the UN field but has placed reservations on a number of significant articles in these conventions and has been slow to alter them. Australia's position on these articles, relating to the passing of legislation outlawing racial vilificaproperly tion, the separation of adults and juveniles in gaols, and those articles which allow individuals to make complaints to the various human rights committees, has detracted from our position, reflects weaknesses in our human rights record and may inhibit the fuIl exercise of rights within Australia. Few topics generate as much discussion in the media today as human rights. Yet when one looks around the world, the situation in regard to human rights is, indeed, very dismal. Forty-five years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights it could be argued that today more people are denied basic human rights than at any other time-or is it that we are more aware of this denial of human rights? Having said that, it must be admitted that there have been some notable achievements, yet much more needs to be done. In the international arena Australia has worked to establish, at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, a United Nations commissioner for human rights. Like the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), I was delighted to read in the paper yesterday of the imminent appointment of such a commissioner. I have had discussions with people from Foreign Affairs, who told me that the appointment may be made as early as next week. I take exception to what the honourable member for Berowra said when he said that it was at the American insistence. Our delegation at the United Nations, right from the time of the Vienna conference and during this current session, has worked tirelessly to see that the appointment of a commissioner for human rights becomes a reality and; as I said, it has already been approved by the third committee. Next week it will become a reality and we all welcome that. A commissioner would coordinate existing UN human rights activity and provide flexibility and high level direction. The appointment of such a commissioner, at the conclusion of what has been a landmark year for human rights, will be welcomed. For this position to be fully effective such an office within the UN would have to be funded. One of the real difficulties in coming to grips with the human rights situations is the lack of resources for human rights, especiaIly at the United Nations. Human Rights Day marks the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights some 45 years ago on 10 December 1948. The universal declaration represents the most fundamental expression of international human rights principles and provides the standards by which all country's human rights credentials are measured. Australia will continue to work vigorously both bilateraIly and multilaterally for the realisation of human rights principles set out in that declaration. In this context the government recently published a human rights manual which sets out the human rights dimensions and objectives of Australian foreign policy. Nevertheless, human rights is not a simple, easily applied formula. Basic rights to life and freedom are a necessary condition for any human activity but the question remains whether such rights are limited, as in classical liberal concepts, to legal and political guarantees. The United Nations asserts the contrary-that satisfactory economic and social conditions are also a human. right. Indeed, some Third World countries claim priority for development and social rights rather than Western legal and political rights, although whether such social rights really exist for the majority and not just for the privileged minority is another matter. Nevertheless, the two claims need not be contradictory for it is evident that a basic minimum standard of living is required for freedom to be effective. Difficult or abstract as some issues on human rights may be, nevertheless certain common themes are universal. Human rights means putting people first as the fundamental members of civilised life. This is not to say that human rights dictate a particular form of government or society but rather that observance of human rights provides the essential minimum standard on the basis of which members of society can freely choose their form of rule. Governments do not always put the same weight on individual's rights as on those of social collectives. Thus their perceptions of human rights, even when using the same language to describe them, may be markedly different. Since this issue tends to emerge in countries which are not democracies it is not easy to judge whether their citizens hold the same view. In addition to classic rights which Western observers have in mind when they speak of human rights, there are those set out in the universal declaration and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Many non-Western observers argue that the promotion of economic rights should proceed and are a prerequisite for the promotion of civil and political rights. The relative importance of economic, soCial and cultural rights remains an unresolved issue in international forums. In this debate ideological issues are important, perhaps because this is where they saw their strength. Centrally planned countries commonly put greater emphasis on economic rights and play down the importance of civil and political rights. For the opposite reason, Western countries tend to argue the reverse and give pre-eminence to civil and political rights. In addition, developing countries understandably emphasise the importance of economic rights, but they also point to the cost of maintaining other human rights, including the substantial cost of effective law and order itself, without which human rights are difficult to protect. For Australia this debate has a particular edge, since most of its neighbours are developing countries. Within limits, it claim to have helped to create a situation, through its trade, aid and other policies, in which development is encouraged in line with the priorities of those countries themselves. This provides some of the prerequisites for developing improved human rights. At the same time, economic growth, through the increased pressure it puts on established authority, may give rise to the political conditions under which human rights abuses may occur. While we are brushing up our human rights image internationally, Australia should consider removing the reservations that we have to various human rights treaties. We have, first of all, a reservation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Basically it is a reservation which says that Australia has not yet got around to passing laws about race vilification. Australia ratified the convention in 1974 and declared that we were not at that time in a position specifically to treat as offences all matters covered by article 4, which deals with race vilification. It was said in 1974 that it was the intention of the government at the first suitable moment to seek from parliament legislation specifically implementing the terms of article 4(a). Almost 20 years have passed since we said that. It raises a question of good faith. (TIme expired)  Speaker, it is hard to know how to cover such a sweeping resolution in five short minutes. What I do know, however, is that it is particularly appropriate that members of parliament comment on and fight for human rights. Too many prisoners of conscience or victims of oppression or injustice suffer because of politics; not just for their own practice of the sort of politics that we play out in this place but, more importantly, the politics of race, the politics of religion or the politics of gender. This motion mentions the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. We can never forget the gross disadvantage our own Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people suffer. Remedying this, giving them true justice, will not only create real reconciliation, it will remove the one negative from our can country's human rights record. For, despite this, we should take pride in our human rights efforts. This does not mean we can pontificate. Instead, we should draw moral strength from the fact that we have successfully created one of the most multicultural and tolerant societies in the world, instilled with the Western democratic tradition, enriched by indigenous culture and enhanced by postwar migrants. This should not just be a happy coincidence, it should be a goal for every nation, and· we must play a role in helping other lands repeat our success. In too many countries transfer of political power is a matter of force. The relatively high freedom we enjoy in Australia is a continuing reminder of the positive contribution that we can make. In this century, involvement in the political process has largely given rise to violation of human rights. Historically, race or practice of religion has probably been more important in incurring brutality. But now, with the collapse of socialism, we are seeing these old cruelties re-emerge. The wars of Africa and Latin America are no longer battles of superpower proxies. They hark back to older, darker conflicts or are the power plays of warlords. The nations of eastern Europe, freed from one group of despots, now threaten to tear themselves apart over ancient hatreds. Western Europe remains impotent in the face of slaughter on its doorstep. Bosnia no longer leads our nightly news. We are either immune to its horrors or do not wish to be reminded. The end of the cold war has ended many certainties. It is frightening, indeed evil, to hear a new breed Russian politician like Vladimir Zhirinovsky talk of the Jewish conspiracies to ultranationalists. However, one good thing has come of it. It means that, in our fight against violence, oppression, disadvantage and injustice, we can be indiscriminating. It means we can believe in the true universality of dignity and human rights. One side can no longer talk of Warsaw or Managua while another tells of what is happening in Santiago or Johannesburg. We must speak a common language of freedom for Beijing and Dili, for Sarajevo and Baghdad. There are some hopeful signs. Those cities of the Cold War I mentioned earlier have all seen at least some tentative change. A wave of freedom is sweeping the world. Oppression is still felt in the squalor of Africa's dictatorchains ships or the grotesquely ordered streets of Pyonyang, but a new spirit of democracy is taking root in Asia, South America and in parts of the old states of eastern Europe. Liberalism has contributed to this. I do not mean the plundering Whig liberalism but that true classical liberalism of tolerance and humanity that inspired people around the world at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries. As one Spanish thinker wrote: Liberalism is the supreme fonn of generosity; it is the right which the majority concedes to minorities and hence it is the noblest cry that has ever resounded on this planet. It announces the detennination to share existence with the enemy; more than that, with an enemy which is weak. It was incredible that the human species should have arrived at so noble an attitude, so paradoxical, so refined, so anti-natural. Hence it is not to be wondered at that this same humanity should soon appear anxious to get rid of it. We all know Churchill's maxim 'Democracy is the worse form of government except for all the others'. It is perverse, but true. We see its failures all too often and yet we know the benefits it can bring. We must fight to make sure others enjoy the freedom, justice and human rights that we in Australia enjoy.",49
33,Mr FITZGIBBON,HUMAN RIGHTS,"Hunter) (12.17 p.m.)Everyone is familiar with the words 'Man is born free but everywhere he is in chains'. These famous words are less true today because men and women everywhere are not in chains. Nevertheless, no-one would contend that this world of ours in the last decade of the 20th century is a perfect place. Admittedly there is a great deal of good in our world but, sorrowfully, there is a high degree of unspeakable evil. Cultural diversity and a hundred other reasons can be brought forward as an excuse for barbarous acts, but no human being who possesses reason and conscience will accept the validity of arguments which seek ,to justify the violation of human dignity. In today's world there are fewer men and women and children bound by chains, but there remains an unacceptably high level of victims of mental and physical atrocities. How painful and how lasting are the wounds of chains anyway? The child in suffers less than the girl child who suffers the worse form of female genital mutilation. Today the media is full of an AIDS tragedy in Sydney which affected four people. Unfortunately, the media has given less coverage to genital mutilation. Had the media spread the news more, a few million Australians would have been as horrified as I was to learn that female circumcision is being practised in our country. Female circumcision is practised in some parts of Africa, Asia, South America and the Middle East, and that knowledge must horrify us all, but that such a detestable practice should be allowed in Australia is absolutely appalling. A Melbourne court has highlighted that infibulation-the worse form of female genital mutilation-has been carried out in Australia on baby girls. Infibulation is said to be practised in Sydney and many other Australian cities. Baby girls have their clitoris removed and the opening to their vagina stitched almost completely closed. Reports of such operations are chilling, but even more terrible is the fact that there is disagreement among lawyers, doctors and community groups as to whether education or prosecution is the best way to stamp out this practice. Certainly, education will assist in eliminating such a ghastly practice, but I believe that the harshest of penalties would bring an end to these barbaric practices far more quickly. Cultural heritage must take second place to the laws of Australia, which seek to protect our children. I have found working on the human rights committee an enthralling and deeply moving experience but, because I feel so strongly about the matter I have raised today, I have not referred to the whole scope of human rights. As a result of serving on the human rights committee I have a deep appreciation of the wonderful work being done by Amnesty International and other bodies working to end the abuses of human rights. I have great pleasure, therefore, in supporting the motion before the House.",52
34,Mr HOLLIS,HUMAN RIGHTS,"by leave-At the conclusion of my speech I was speaking about the reservations under article 4A of the racial discrimination convention. I would like to tum to the civil and political rights covenant. The shameful reservations that we filed in 1980 have largely been withdrawn and Australia now has three reservations and one declaration. Looking at the reservations that we still have, it is hard to say that any of them is justifiable. We have one with respect to article 10 in so far as the segregation referred to is considered by the responsible authorities to be beneficial to the juveniles or adults concerned. Indeed, this does become difficult and, at the human rights committee, the matter of juveniles and adults from the impounded boats being segregated was recently raised. I think it is very curious, though, that Australia has attempted to second-guess, as it were, the international guarantees. Article 14 on miscarriage of justice is saying that we can use administrative procedures rather than special legal procedures. I do not really think there needs to be a reservation about that and I believe that having a reservation gives a wrong signal. It seems to me that Australian law is consistent with article 14 and there is no need for that reservation. Article 20 is very similar to the racial discrimination reservation. It is saying that we do not yet have a race vilification law and, for the same reasons that apply to the elimination of racial discrimination convention, I do not think that that is justifiable. With respect to the committee for the elimination of discrimination against women convention, we have a couple of reservations: one relating to paid maternity leave, the other with respect to women in combat positions. It could be argued that neither of these reservations is appropriate. The Australian government justifies the one on maternity leave by saying that we simply cannot impose the requirements of paid maternity leave. In fact, the convention does not actually require the imposition of this condition. There is no need to continue the reservation. With respect to women in combat positions, I think that the DefenceForce's policy should be changed on that and that it should be urged to fall into line with our international obligations. Human rights continues to be a challenge for all of us. How we respond as individuals or as countries determines how we will be perceived by the international community. I conclude my remarks by endorsing the motion that has been put before the House today, especially the words in paragraph 2 which urge the House to 'recognise that human rights abuses continue to be a blight on the world'. I also express my delight, together with everyone associated with human rights, that, finally, next week, we will have a UN commissioner for human rights. I pay tribute to our foreign affairs department and to our officials at the United Nations who, throughout this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, have worked so hard to ensure that that position is created.",53
35,Mr SINCLAIR,HUMAN RIGHTS,"New England) (12.25)by leave-In my previous comments I mentioned Burma, or Myanmar as the generals call it, and I want to say a little more about it. However, firstly, I note that it is important that each year this parliament take the opportunity to consider the plight of people around the world. Our contributions have all been different. We do not necessarily see human rights-within Australia, in our region, or in other countries-in the same light. However, this motion on human rights encourages us all to recognise that there is a long way to go before equality exists in the world. Sadly, as we move towards the end of this century we have to accept that some people are stiIl not treated as equals in some parts of the world. In spite of all the political, economic and technological changes in many so-called civilised countries, people are still incapable of overcoming the prejudices of the past. There are signs of change in some countries. One can only hope that with motions such as this one on human rights in this parliament and others there might be some progress. There are two points that I want to add to my previous remarks on Burma. Firstly, it is absolutely tragic that the Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is still held in detention. She is a remarkable woman. She has been able to sustain herself with great courage and moral fibre, even confined as she is. She convincingly won an election, and yet she and her colleagues have been unable to take over the reins of government from the military that runs the country. It is sad that those who worked with her are also confined. Indeed, a number have recently been given incredibly long sentences simply for advocating freedom within Burma. The second issue is that countries that surround Burma must recognise that the world is not happy for those countries to lift the barriers on trade and commerce and to commend the generals for what has happened. A lot more needs to be done. Countries such as Japan, Thailand and China need to be told that the world does not kindly regard their action in removing those sanctions. Those sanctions help, through force of public opinion and through efforts in the commercial sense, to make the generals realise that they must recognise the rights of the citizen. They must try to overcome their prejudices. They must believe that people cannot be treated like that. They must stop their appalling tyranny against the ethnic minorities. They must then accept the second phase of human rights, and move towards democratic government. This motion is not about anyone country, as has correctly been said. We have been dealing with a number of countries. These are circumstances which are, regrettably, part of mankind's treatment of fellow human beings. Through motions such as this, the House is noting that people must look beyond themselves to others, and try to treat others as equals. The motion recognises in paragraph (3) that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is something that was set down after World War II in an attempt to highlight the need for greater emphasis on human rights around the world. This motion is worthy of the support of this House. Through our contributions, as this century moves to its conclusion, hopefully there will be a greater acceptance of the fact that we have a long way to go before we achieve the genuine equality that we all believe is essential.",54
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HUMAN RIGHTS,"Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted.",54
37,Mr CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is now nine months since my election as the representative of the people of Stirling. It has been a most interesting gestation period. During this time, I have found my work to both frustrating and rewarding-frustrating because of the various brick walls one runs into whilst trying to help one's constituents; rewarding when one is successful in helping them. There are many grievances I have which are worthy of bringing to the attention of the parliament, but the matter I would like to address in this debate is of democracy. I realise it sounds like a contradiction in terms, but I do believe is an opportunity to take politics out of government. Since 13 March, the day that I entered world of politics-or as many would say, say with some merit, the world of fiction delusion-I have seen many examples of the politi cis at ion of government that are quite contemptuous of democracy and the principles of open and honest government. ments, I should also add, are not confined to the federal Labor government. They apply to all governments at various times and I am . sure the trend will continue into the future. I guess that, being politics, one should expect that most, if not all, government decisions influenced by politics-even if only minor way. With many decisions though, the political overtones are enormous. We now have a House of Representatives committee looking into the Auditor-General's report on the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. I am very day. pleased to be a member of that committee. The reason for such an inquiry is due to the fact that-of $29.5 million allocated to differinfluence ent groups before the March election-groups in Labor held seats, which accounted for 53 per cent of the House of Representatives, received 73 per cent .of the number of grants and 66 per cent of the value of the grants approved. I will not go into this matter at length, but we had a government department operating from the minister's office, allocating grants supposedly on a needs basis. However, when we look at the figures, they show that marginal Labor seats received twice as much Democracy in grants as coalition held seats. This must be either an amazing coincidence or blatant favouritism. This is a government scheme; a bureaucratbe ic, dare I say it, impartial grants scheme, which has been politicised. It was a blatant attempt to buy votes. While the Labor Party may have written off the seats of Stirling and Cowan in Western Australia, it pooled a total of $948,000, a smidgin under a million dollars, into Swan and Canning, now the fourth and fifth most marginal Labor seats in the politicisation the country. Now even blind Freddy, or blind Ros, can there see that something smells pretty bad about this whole situation. Taxpayers' money should not be used to buy votes. It is a slap in the the face for democracy when a political party, and with control over government funds, uses and those funds in such a way as to influence the opinions of voters. The allocation of those grants ensured that the federal Labor Party was looked upon favourably in the climate of My coman election campaign. As I said earlier, my comments apply to all political persuasions. In my own state of Western Australia, the coalition government has spent taxpayers' money on both pamare phlets and television advertising explaining in a the WA government's Mabo legislationlegislation I wholeheartedly support. Although I support it, I find it difficult to defend the spending of taxpayers' money on the enunciation of the position of a political party, even though that party is in government and therefore has responsibility to make the laws of the Public funds should not be used to try to the opinions of voters either one way or the other. Similarly, people who have a desire to enter this place, or remain in here, have a responsibility to ensure they uphold the principles of democracy by being honest in upholding their position, or the position they seek to hold. I realise that, at the end of the day, the competition of politics is to win government. This is the reason we have the politicisationbastardisation, if you like-of government and, therefore, democracy. For example, let us take the last election again; it does hurt me to have to recall the tragedy of that election. Labor Party, in its attempt to hold onto government, misrepresented many of our policies. It said, for example, that everything would rise by 15 per cent as a result of the GST. As we all know, that was a complete and utter fabrication of the truth. While we tried to be honest about it and fight the election on policies, the whole campaign concentrated on our policies and, regrettably, we lost to downright fibs. Democracy was dealt a severe blow by people's opinions being influenced by untruths, misrepresentations and outright lies. One last aspect that I would like to mention is the speech made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) on the Native Title Bill. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie had a disagreement with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the Mabo legislation. The media lapped it up; the honourable member for Kalgoorlie milked it for all the publicity he could get, as is his wont; but then he completely sold out his own electorate. He voted with the Prime Minister in favour of this legislation, despite saying that he opposed it. He cared not one jot about his responsibiliCross ty to the people of Kalgoorlie. He said one thing, but when the blowtorch was applied to the belly he went to water. That is particularly undemocratic. He cared more about his position in his own party and his chances of holding on to Labor Party preselection than voting according to what are the best interests of his electorate, which is why he was elected. Shame on him. All these examples show blatant politicisation of our democratic processes. They are examples of the elected representatives speaking or acting in a certain way to seek favourable support from their constituency, despite those actions being illegal, immoral, improper or downright unethical. It is high time politics returned to being a domain where members were elected honestly, where their actions were taken on the basis of what is right, not what will win the most votes, and where the institution of democracy was respected. If politicians continue to act in a way that will win most votes, our country's living standards are destined to continue to fall. It is high time The decisions were made without regard to how many votes will come out of those decisions. Finally, the voters have an equal responsibility to ensure that the institution· of democracy is maintained by not being party to these shameless lies, bribes and other devices used by politicians to influence elections. This is my major grievance, for I entered parliament because of the love of my country and a desire to ensure that we could look forward to the future of our nation with a great degree of enthusiasm. To achieve such goals requires certain actions that require tough decisions to be made, irrespective of the political consequences, and it is unfortunate that many politicians do not have the political will to do that for our great country. So, until we are all prepared to speak and act according to what is right and not what is more politically favourable, we will never have a true democracy. Acquired Brain Damage",55
38,Mr SCIACCA,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (12.37 p.m.)-I rise on this occasion on behalf of my constituents Mr and Mrs Ken and the growing numbers of parents across Australia who find themselves victims of the same circumstance, a circumstance that strikes without warning but leaves devastation in its wake. For Mr and Mrs Cross, this circumstance, this stealer of dreams, came in the form of a car crash. Their 24-year-old daughter, at the threshold of adult life, now suffers from a disability that afflicts a growing number of other young Australians. For other people, this stealer of dreams has struck on the sporting field, through asthma attacks, tumours, industrial accidents or simply falling off a bike. This dream stealer and wrecker of families has a clinical name which, like all clinical names in our civilised world, tries to expunge emotion from the true meaning. But behind the name, behind the clinical condition, lies a growing number of Australian faces-faces that could easily be yours or mine or those of our children, faces full of emotion, faces that cry out for our help. Modern medicine has saved a lot of lives. No-one is disputing that fact. But with modern medicine comes a new conundrum: an obligation to help those patients that the modem miracle of medicine only half saves, or quarter saves, or barely saves. These people live in a shadow land of shifting realities, never to fully know or understand the certainty of their previous existence. Society, through governments, has a collective responsibility to assist these growing numbers of Australians, these modern Australians who have been struck down by a modem illness called acquired brain damage. The brain is unique. If damaged, the brain, unlike most other organs of the body, cannot repair itself. In the short time since Mr and Mrs Cross came to see me concerning the plight of their daughter, I have been amazed at the growing extent of acquired brain damage in this country. It is eating away at our people, and their silent screams are not being heard. Now that I am attuned to the plight of ABD sufferers, hardly a week passes by without my hearing further stories of despair. Australia, at all levels of government, has a substantial policy vacuum in this area. This vacuum must be filled. The purpose of my speech today is to let colleagues on all sides of politics, in both the federal and state parliaments, know that we as the Australian law-makers must work together to improve the lot of acquired brain damage sufferers and their families. By way of example, in the Weekend Australian of 9 October came the story of Angus Rigg, a 19-year-old who for two years has been in Melbourne's Prince Alfred Hospital suffering from acquired brain damage. Everyone agrees that Angus is not a suitable patient for the acute care hospital, but tragically there is nowhere else to go. He has been rescued from death by modem medicine only to live through a lifetime of policy neglect. Many young long-term sufferers like Angus are eventually pushed out of these acute care hospitals to end up in totally unsuitable institutions, such as nursing homes for the aged. Commonsense dictates that young people lying in beds next to old people at the natural end of their life is inappropriate. The states, territories and Commonwealth have to make an immediate commitment to develop a proper care and support program for all people who suffer from acquired brain damage. Thankfully, this process has started already in this year's federal budget, with the announcement by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe) of the development of a national policy on acquired brain damage. But the challenge ahead of us is great. The stable door has been open for some time, and the horse is a speck of dust in the distance. In the game of catch-up ahead, the Commonwealth cannot work in isolation; it needs the commitment and cooperation of state and territory governments. The number of Australians with acquired brain damage has been increasing steadily over recent years and there is no sign that this trend will diminish. It is estimated that nationally each year 27,000 people will incur traumatic brain damage, 24,000 will survive to be admitted to hospital, and 3,000 to 4,000 will be discharged from hospital with severe brain damage. The vast majority will be young adult males aged between 17 and 25. They will be young adults like Angus Rigg and like the daughter of my constituents, Mr and Mrs Cross. As always, though, there are lone voices in the wilderness who have known about this problem long before it reached the ears of politicians. Headway is an organisation committed to the development of policies and programs which will enable people with acquired brain damage and their families to maintain a quality lifestyle. Brain damage groups now exist in all Australian states and have been strengthened by the national body, the Head Injury Council of Australia. If we have up to 4,000 traumatic acquired brain damage cases per year in Australia, then the number of Australians suffering from nontraumatic acquired brain damage would be significantly more, but we do not know how much more. Hopefully, the $200,000, twoyear research program put forward in this year's budget to gather information on ABO sufferers who require services will shed some light in this area. To date this kind of research into acquired brain damage has been sadly neglected. In 1991, Headway in Queensland published a study stating that people with non-traumatic acquired brain damage often said that they no longer 'knew themselves', they did not 'trust their brains' anymore, arid they could not 'rely' on themselves .to make accurate judgments or perceive things correctly. They felt that their 'most important piece of equipment' had been damaged and that they were now 'only half human'. Society has abandoned these people to suffer silently, their anguish shared only by the anguish of their carersusually their families-who feel deserted, cheated and lost. These are the people who need our help. When dealing with social problems, society tends to say, 'Out of sight, out of mind'. Today I am saying to all of us, 'In sight, in mind'. These people exist and they need our help. Unfortunately, the present reality appears to be that people affected by acquired brain damage cannot access appropriate human services. For a variety of reasons, this group of people are rarely accepted by current service providers or do not benefit from existing models of service provision-they fall between the cracks. It is our responsibility-state, territory and Commonwealth governments-to lift sufferers of acquired brain damage out of those cracks and to close those cracks forever. Researchers in the past have estimated that throughout Australia there is one in 370 chances of incurring brain damage from car accidents alone. When one compares this with national figures regarding the chance of contracting, say the AIDS virus-one in 56,000-it becomes starkly obvious that brain damage is a much more immediate problem demanding of attention, or is certainly as important. Recently I received a letter from Graham Rowe, the director of CASSI, the Coastal Accommodation Support Service Inc. on the Gold Coast, which is just outside my electorate. CASSI was established in 1989-90 under section 10 of the Commonwealth's Disability Services Act to provide accommodation and support services for persons who have severe, profound and/or multiple disabilities. While Mr Rowe has been experiencing success in the work of CASSI, he has come to the view that community based living as espoused by various· state-Commonwealth disability service acts is neither practical nor appropriate for a significant number of people with quite severe and profound disabilities. Already he has a waiting list of nine young people with acquired brain damage who are inappropriately housed in aged persons nursing homes. This example is being replicated all around Australia. His betief-I support him in this-is that there is a real and urgent need within the community for the provision of alternative accommodation options such as special nursing home-hostel style facilities specifically for younger people with severe and profound disabilities which should provide support and assistance on a 24-hour per day basis on a lifestyle rather than a medical model. There are many factors to be considered in costing the effects of ABO. In figures that Dr John Watson, Director of the Neuropsychology Unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in New South Wales, supplied to me, he extrapolates that even if there were only 2,000 new cases of traumatic acquired brain damage annually in Australia one would be looking at a bill of at least $200 million per year for this group of new cases alone. Other health experts estimate 4,000 new traumatic ABO cases in Australia per year, which would bring that to a cost of $400 million. This does not include old cases and does not include non-traumatic ABO cases. These costings are very conservative and are growing. Ten years ago in the USA figures for traumatic ABO-only suggest an annual sum of $14 billion. There are no current figures for that country, but. the bill must be . immense. We have not reached crisis point, but we do not want to reach that crisis point. In conclusion, it is clear that ABD is a problem that affects the Australian community to a numerical and financial extent way beyond general expectations. Several things need to be done. Firstly, relatively simple research is needed to estimate incidence, prevalence, age distribution, life expectancy and severity of condition of those suffering from this syndrome. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services has made a good start in this area. Secondly, assistance has to be given to ABO victims who have no access to compensation through the normal legal process. Thirdly, special nursing home-hostel style facilities, specifically for younger people with severe ABO, should be provided on a 24-hour lifestyle rather than medical model. And, lastly, this issue needs to be put on the agenda at the next meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory governments as a matter of urgency and a proper strategy developed to deal cooperatively and effectively with this growing problem. (Time expired) Unemployment",56
39,Mr LIEBERMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"As this will be the last opportunity for me to speak in this parliament before Christmas, I wish that I could say that we are approaching a Christmas season and a new year after a year in which we as a nation have made great progress. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and I believe that 1994 will probably be one of the most testing and challenging years for all of us in Australia, particularly for those us involved in the federal parliament. This week we have heard a lot of discussion about unemployment, and that is appropriate because it is a major problem for us to address. We all know that in the last two years Australia's unemployment rate has remained consistently above 10 per cent and that this represents the most sustained period of high unemployment ever experienced in Australia since the Great Depression in 192933. Long-term unemployment is also at an alltime high with over a third of the unemployed having not had a job for more than a year. When we discuss problems like long-term unemployment with our constituents, it appears we are getting a consistent thread of comment from people that, in their view, those who are trying to sustain themselves and their families, those who are working in their own small businesses and on farms and generally doing what they can to be selfsufficient, are increasingly finding less incentive for them to do that. I think that is proven by the fact that Australia's rate of private sector investment has been at the lowest level since we started to record these rates. That is a consistent trend and a very worrying one. Of course, we have the increasing overseas debt and the problems of the social consequences· of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. There are the tragic consequences to the individual, the loss of self-esteem, and some of us, unfortunately, have had the experience of knowing young people who have actually taken their lives. They have done this, probably, partly because of the boredom and the loss of confidence that they have endured and which has developed as a result of long-term unemployment. I received a letter recently from a doctor in my electorate, and I will put parts of it on the record because it gives an interesting insight into some of the problems that we have. The doctor actually wrote to the Prime Minister, I understand, to complain in the strongest possible terms about the government's unemployment and welfare policies. He said in his letter that one of his patients, a sale parent with two children, had recently given up a job of in the hospitality industry 'because she could not afford to work'. What a remarkable statement! He went on to say that her current pension, on having got ouLof the workplace, amounts to $430 per fortnight. He said that, whilst she was working, she received $640 per fortnight, which was more than the pension. However, her rent increased by $126 per fortnight, and day care for her children increased by $150 per fortnight: a total increase of $276 in outgoings per fortnight. This was as a result of her earning income greater than the pension. Her disposable income was thus reduced to $364 per fortnight. In other words, by going to work and suffering the penalty of increased rent and child-care costs, she was actually $32 per week worse off. That patient has given up work now and is being supported by the taxpayer. Meanwhile, the doctor is left to cope and to treat her, to try to bolster her self-esteem and provide support, as her doctor. What a remarkable letter it is! It raises some questions. How could it be that someone could exit from the workplace and receive a pension? Obviously, we know the way the system works. There has to be a period of time between exiting the workplace and becoming entitled to unemployment payments or a pension. I presume that in this case all of those periods expired. What an indictment it is to think that here is a woman who has two children and believes that she is better off not working! I do not that she is right. I do not know enough about her case to be able to be an expert on it. Mr Sciacca-At least she's at home looking after her kids.",59
40,Mr LIEBERMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"She is at home with her kids, of course. The Parliamentary Secretary makes a very valid point, and it is certainly worth recognising. I have used the example given to me by the somewhat frazzled general practitioner to highlight one of the symptoms that we have in our country. There is a culture rapidly developing here of people saying that it is no longer worth it to keep on hanging in and trying to work, because the contrast between what they get and then have to payout, and what others get who do nothing and who do not work is such that it is better to fall back into the no work syndrome. I feel very sorry for those human beings who have come to that conclusion. It is terrible to think that people would write themselves off in that way. Certainly, the observations that one picks up from constituents-I earlier mentioned the people struggling to stay in small business despite difficult times-indicate their increasing bitterness at the way society is developing; and they mention examples like this one. I was interested in getting, and looked forward to reading, the green paper statement because of the build-up that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has given it. I know that the debate is not over; it is just beginning. But I have to say that I believe the statement lacked an appropriate response-an emphasis on the effect on actual unemployment or employment outcomes of the labour market rigidities and the central wage fixing systems that we have in Australia. I also feel that the paper failed to address the fact that we have a system where the ACTU, because of its unusually high dominance over the government-and it has been so because we have had a federal Labor government for more than 10 years now-is in a position of extraordinary power. It is that innuence and presence that maintain some of the rigidities in the wage fixing, industrial relations and labour market areas. It does not say matter which side of politics honourable members are on, those who understand how an economy works would have to concede that one of the most effective and long-term ways of helping. the nation and helping the unemployed to get work is to develop the economy and expand markets, sales and investment. Another anomaly I find is shown in the experience of a young university student who told me that he had applied for a part-time vacation job in a large retail outlet. He had all the qualifications and enthusiasm and wanted to earn a few dollars so he could be a bit more independent of his parents and achieve some goals by purchasing something that he had wanted to buy for a long time. He passed all his interviews with the retailer and was given a good mark there, but he did not get the job. The people who were employed by the retailer were the long-term unemployed for whom the retailer was able to obtain government assistance and subsidies towards their wages. No-one, including this young student, would begrudge the young long-term unemployed their opportunity to obtain work and experience. But I raise the case because, unwittingly-and I see the green paper doing the same-we are making things worse by putting a position to young Australians where we are virtually saying, 'Do you know that these training schemes and these opportunities to get into subsidised employment opportunities with employers in Australia are available only if you are long-term unemployed?'. So the dan.ger of this sort of program is that you are telling young Australians that they cannot get work unless they have first been in long-term unemployment. (TIme expired) Director of Public Prosecutions",60
41,Mr CLEELAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"MCEwen) (12.57 p.m.)On 27 September 1993 Mr John Elliott, through his solicitor, Mr Aarons, caused letters to be sent to the police minister of the  the Attorney-General of the state of Victoria, Mrs Jan Wade, requesting them to intervene in the laying of charges by the Director of Public Prosecutions against Mr Elliott. On 28 September 1993, further letters were forward an inquiry which would result in the dismissal or the suspension of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Bernard Bongiorno. Shortly after the receipt of those letters, or about 5 October 1993, secret meetings commenced between the Attorney-General, Mrs Jan Wade, Mr Greg Craven and an obscure junior prosecutor from the Department of Public Prosecutions, Nick Papas. The purpose of these meetings was to draft legislation which would effectively remove the independence of Mr Bongiorno and allow the Attorney-General to intervene in the affairs of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The draft bill is intended to castrate the office and to ensure that the independence of an important public authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions, is removed. Having been involved in the secret discussions and negotiations leading to the draft of the legislation, Mr Nick Papas was appointed by Mrs Wade as Chief Magistrate of the state of Victoria on 24 November 1993. Why was Mr Nick Papas selected by Mrs Wade to be involved in the drafting of legislation which would diminish the responsibility and the independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions? As a person employed as a member of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, why would Mr Nick Papas attend secret meetings without informing his employer? As a crown prosecutor,  come involved in actions which would diminish his own independence as a crown prosecutor-an independence he obviously does not value? Why was Mr Nick Papas, on 24 November 1993, at the age of 35, appointed to the position of Chief Magistrate of the state of Victoria when there are more experienced and more senior members available and when he had had no experience in judicial management? The position is that an obscure, junior prosecutor in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions entered into secret meetings and negotiations with Mr Greg Craven and Mrs Jan Wade to draft legislation which would diminish the power and the independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and did so without informing his employer. Having committed an act of treachery, he is then given his 10 pieces of silver. Mr Nick Papas, as Chief Magistrate of Victoria is now on in a position to select the magistrate - ho will sit on any proceedings which may be brought against Mr Elliott. How can one have any confidence in the independence of the Chief Magistrate of the state of Victoria when he has achieved his position as a result of secret deals and negotiations, and through his relationship with prominent members of the Liberal Party? There are many stories circulating in Vic  Liberal Party of Australia, and to a prominent Victorian Liberal Party member, Mr Ian Carsons. The only way these rumours can be put to rest is by some very frank and very   the Premier of Victoria, Mr Jeff Kennett, and has been promised further promotion within the judicial system of the state of Victoria. Why is this so? Why would Mr Kennett pro system, presumably to a Supreme Court or County Court position? Even worse is the fact that the sequence of events leads one to a conclusion that it is possible that all of these events have followed the intervention of the solicitors for Mr Elliott  price and what value do Mr Kennett and Mrs Wade place on the independence of the judiciary of the state of Victoria, and on the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria? The Attorney-General of Victoria does not deserve to hold the position she now does. She stands as the chief law officer of the state of Victoria. By her actions she has subverted everything the position demands of her. She has, by her actions, brought into disrepute the office of the Chief Magistrate of the state of Victoria, and by her actions has brought into question her integrity and the integrity of the government of Victoria. What has been the role of the police  What involvement has he had in these secret negotiations and in the appointment of the Chief Magistrate of Victoria? Are there any understandings or agreements between state ministers and the chief magistrate as to the manner in which the court will now be administered? The Attorney-General should stand down herself without any prompting by the Premier. If the Attorney-General will not stand down, then the Premier of Victoria should insist that she does stand down and have a full inquiry on the background of the appointment of Mr  position as Chief Magistrate. How can any person have any confidence in his integrity as Chief Magistrate? As a result of the stench of corruption in Queensland, the Fitzgerald report made strong recommendations as to the independence of the judiciary and of the Director of Public Prosecutions. One would have assumed that the lessons of Bjelke-Petersen's Queensland would have been learnt by all politicians in Australia. In Victoria it is obvious that those lessons have not only not been learnt, but the Fitzgerald report has been used in a reverse way. The state government of Victoria is in fact doing the opposite of all of the recommendations of the Fitzgerald inquiry. The once proud Liberal Party of Australia has now been exposed as corrupt. Johannes BjelkePetersen has been resurrected in the form of the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. Victoria is now a state where the executive arm of government is interfering in the judiciary. The principle of the separation of powers has been breached by this Premier. Why has the Solicitor-General been told not to provide assistance to the office of the DPP concerning any prosecution of Mr Elliott? Should Mr Elliott be charged with a criminal offence in Victoria, can we expect an impartial hearing conducted by an independent and impartial prosecutor? These are fundamental and important questions of principle. Jeff Kennett must act to put his house in order. This year in Victoria some 30,000 people have left the state travelling north. As they have travelled north, the stench of corruption has arisen in the south. This is not my view alone. There is enormous concern in the state of Victoria about the events that are occurring. In today's Age there is a letter from Mr Justice Harper, the Supreme Court judge, who writes: Decisions to prosecute or not to prosecute are an important aspect in the administration of justice. They must be made by a person whose independence is beyond doubt. The prosecutorial system must be removed from partisan political interference. The Public Prosecution Bill does the opposite. Its enactment should be opposed by all who support democracy. It is of enormous alarm to all people who support democracy. How can a government which purports to hold dear those things which are fundamental to democratic process compromise the separation of the executive arm of government from the prosecution system of a state? Mr Kennett has to explain  was appointed, when there was no reason to take an obscure 35-year-old junior prosecutor with no judicial experience and put him in as the Chief Magistrate of the state of Victoria. It is a smelly, stinking deal. It reeks of corruption; it reeks of political interference; it is of great concern to all. If Liberal Party representatives opposite have any concern, having learnt surely from Queensland and Bjelke-Petersen, they will, through their national executive, do all they can to make sure that Victoria does not go the same way. If the Herald-Sun in Victoria really wants to get a bit active for once in life, and if Mr Harris, the editor, really is concerned about Victoria, it is about time it started reporting factually the events which are occurring in Victoria. Bureaucracy",61
42,Mr NEVILLE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr tant. Deputy Speaker, we continue to promote the view of the clever country, we talk about micro-economic reform, we speculate laborinever been done. ously about accountability, and we vigorously extol the concept of quality assurance. Yet, in the most fundamental of all exercises of government, the point at which it impacts on the average citizen, the counter of the government agency, we fail to be clever, reformist, accountable or quality assured. To illustrate the point, I would like to tell you a three-part story or, if you like, with apologies to Dickens, a tale of three motorists. All three incidents show how wasteful, unnecessary and demeaning the basic exercises of government can become. In a small town in my electorate, Moura, a mining town, a young private was home on leave from the army. In keeping with the best traditions of doing the right thing, he sought to apply for a civilian driver's licence. He went in and said that he had the army licence, could he have a civilian licence? 'No, couldn't do that, you would have to get a leamer's permit'. Between when he got the leamer's permit and could come back for another test, the permit had expired. He returned to Moura seeking a second leamer's permit. Finally, he was given a test. When he had completed the test, he was failed on the basis that the tester did not like the way braked and did not like the way he looked into the rear vision mirrors at the side of car. This was perpetrated on a young man who had been in the army for 2'12 years, been in transport for nearly two years driving an extensive range of vehicles from troop carriers to explosives vehicles, respected driver. He was also part of a team that trained other drivers. Some states recognise defence force licenwas ces while others do not. Surely we could some simple protocol in the form of an application with the name, address, age, sex, its complexion, eye or physical disabilities that go on normal licences. On the reverse side we could have a scale of classifications of the various forms of defence force competency in driving, against which you could read off the corresponding levels in the states and territories. This could be,certified by the unit adjuWith this completed and proof of identification provided, the licence could be issued automatically. It seems simple, but it has Another case occurred in Bundaberg. A young man moved from Ballarat to look for a job which he wanted to pursue immediately. He attended the Department of Transport in Bundaberg to register his Victorian plated vehicle. However, the papers were still with his furniture in Ballarat. He was not allowed to register the vehicle on the grounds of lack of proof of ownership. He contacted the people at Vic Roads in Ballarat. They refused to confirm his ownership because they would not give out any information on the basis that he may not be who he claimed to be. He was told that he might get it on the basis of a request from the Department of Transport in Bundaberg. So he returned to the Department of Transport in Bundaberg, and requested that it seek the registration confirmation. The clerk said, 'No, we cannot do that. We are not in the business of sending faxes'. So there he was in no-man's-land. He came to me in desperation, saying that he could not get satisfaction from two state agencies. Finally, I had to contact Vic Roads in Ballarat, which finally agreed to send a fax to he the Department of Transport in Bundaberg 6n the basis of a request sent on my letterhead as the a federal member. After numerous trunk calls, three visits to the Department of Transport had and a number of hours spent by me and my staff, the transfer of a simple registration, which could have been done through a fax, and was a very finally occurred. In another town in my electorate there was an issue of so-called privacy. A farmer, who going through very tough times during have the drought and who was driving a motorcycle as his main off-fann vehicle, parked outside the Department of Social Security. A client in a four-wheel-drive vehicle parked in front of him, transacted his business inside the DSS, got into the four-wheel-drive vehicle and promptly backed over the motorcycle and took off without reporting the incident. The fanner returned to find $2,000 worth of damage and no witnesses except the DSS staff. They refused to identify the alleged offender. The police were called and the staff member was counselled not to give the name. The police were frustrated in the execution of their duties and a complaint went to the regional superior of the DSS. From there it went to the Secretary of the Department of Social Security in Canberra. In the meantime, heaven knows where the alleged wrecker went to, and the strapped fanner added another $2,000 to his debt profile. What would have been the position if the four-wheel-drive vehicle had actually backed over the driver sitting on the cycle and killed or maimed him? Would we still keep this sort of privacy arrangement? Surely, when a person leaves the Department of Social Security office, steps onto the footpath and becomes a citizen again, he cannot hide behind the privacy provisions of the DSS. It would be like the case of a priest giving someone absolution in confession for a particular crime. If the person then went out onto the street, and the priest was standing on the steps of the church and saw that person pull out a gun and shoot someone, the priest would not be held by the seal of confession in that instance. That would be a totally separate incident that occurred outside the confessional. In the same way, why would the Department of Social Security impose such a tortuous interpretation of privacy and confidentiality? When laws and bureaucratic practices are such that they become so convoluted as to negate the very purpose for which they were intended, then they are a farce. The practice is not clever. It is not refonnist. It is not accountable. It is certainly not quality assured. What is more to the point, three ordinary, well-motivated, hard working Australians have suffered materially and psychologically at the hands of a meaningless and uncaring bureaucracy. Parenting Allowance",63
43,Mr JOHNS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to begin debate on the document Restoring full employment that was given to the government yesterday by the Committee on Employment Opportunities. I think this will be great meal for considerable debate in the wider community on a solution for especially long-tenn unemployed to re-enter the work force. I was particularly pleased that the concept of the parenting allowance has .been recognised in this report. There are significant recommendations on the issue of a parenting allowance. I would like to traverse this debate because it is an issue I have been pursuing for some time now. In January of this year, I circulated a discussion paper to all honourable members of the government on this question. In that proposal, I suggested that there be financial assistance to the parent, in a two-parent family, who stayed at home and cared for children under preschool age. The objective of the proposal that I was circulating in January was to give parents, or a parent, a choice, so that it was financially viable for them not to enter the work force and to care for a child or children at home. Let me stress that there is nothing wrong with either parent staying at home to care for young children. The parents need to be given a choice of either going to work or staying at home to care for their children. As long as there is no compulsion, this idea is not a challenge to anyone's right to be part of the paid work force. I had a conversation on the weekend with a very experienced manager of the preschool centre where my daughter is. It is a very respected centre; I will not give the details. That woman was suggesting to me that there is a case to be made out for the fact that very young children are subject to an easy transmission of disease, even in the highest quality child-care centre. As we all know, they can get ill pretty quickly. I get phone calls to my electorate office from time to time to duck into town and pick up my daughter-that is, if my wife is unavailable. This fact needs to be recognised. No matter what the quality of the child-care centre, these diseases can circulate very quickly, as all parents would know. The other thing is that, patently, there is stress on parents when both are working with a child, or children, in a child-care centre. This is not to tum the whole debate on its head. It is simply to recognise that there is large proportion of parentS who are both working and who put a child in a child-care centre, especially when the child is very young. We have some figures on this. These parents are suggesting that they would like an alternative; they would like to be able to out of work.. They feel as though they are working because they need the income for whatever purposes. That is their business. This report is beginning to recognise that of the debate. As far as I understand it, and I need to study it some more, we are trying to make sure that, in our social security system, there are no disincentives to making the choice to stay at home and look after the child. In January, I was not suggesting a direct payment to the parent staying at home; I had the freedom and luxury of not having to cost all of my proposals. Of course, these proposals have to be costed and have to be affordable. I will now outline some of the detail of the parenting allowance proposal in the green paper. The increase in employment of married women and the changes in the employment opportunities for both men and women suggest that income support payments should be structured more flexibly to support a wider choice for parents balancing work and family responsibilities. The nature of the social security system, including its benefits and targeting of payments, can potentially constrain the choice of parents balancing work and family responsibilities. Under the proposed change to move away from a joint incomes test for married couples to an incomes test primarily on individual incomes, a new parenting allowance could be provided for those caring full-time for children. This allowance would need to be paid to spouses of people in low paid jobs to maintain their incentive to take full-time jobs. Social security arrangements are at odds with modem labour market realities. More than half of all married women are now participating in the labour market compared with just nine per cent of married women aged 20 to 54 in 1947. Of some concern is that wives of unemployed men have a significantly lower labour force participation rate, 41 per cent, and a higher unemployment rate, 45 a per cent, than do the wives of employed men, which are 68 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. This idea is really a continuation of something that we announced last year. The home pull child-care allowance is to be introduced in September 1994. Under that, the spouses of the unemployed will receive half the current newstart married rate payment through a new part payment called the partner allowance. This will provide some income support directly to the spouse in recognition of his or her contribution to the household. The income test has been modified. There is now more incentive for the spouse of an unemployed person to take more part-time work. There may be a case for facilitating the withdrawal from the labour force of those who would prefer to care for their children full time. This debate revolves around the issue of the importance to married women of being able to choose either to care for their children full time or to undertake employment, and whether there are incentives or disincentives in our payment system which skew their choice. It is important that we get out of the way of those decisions. At present there are conflicting incentives for married women to undertake employment. Support is needed for a wider choice for parents balancing work and family responsibilities. More support and recognition is needed for parents' choices, including for those parents who care for their children full time. To summarise, the parenting allowance would be for couples where the breadwinner was unemployed and the spouse was caring full time for children aged below 16-or possibly 12. A parenting allowance would be available to the non-job seeking partner instead. The maximum payment would be the same as the dole for spouses seeking work, which is $131.85 per week. In summary, we have gone some way down the track in the debate about who participates in the work force, under what constraints they have to participate, and how there should be assistance for those who wish to place their children in child care, but now we have to be sure that payments that are available through the social security system do not act as a disincentive for those parents who prefer to stay at home in a full-time capacity to look after their children. We have reached a stage in this debate whereby people on both sides of the argument should feel relaxed about the concept of a parenting allowance. As I said, a very experienced woman who has managed a public sector child-care centre for many years agreed that we need to recognise the stresses on the two-parenting, two-working family where they have to place a child in care. We also have to be aware of the unavoidable consequences of having very young children grouped together in care, no matter what precautions are taken, whereby those children readily share and swap diseases. We all know that this occurs. So in the next few months we should have a very intelligent debate about balancing the need to work with the need for parents to stay at home. Finally, I have a Christmas message for everyone, as I do not think I will be speaking again before Christmas. I give my best wishes to the good people who work in this House and who help us all throughout the year. I also wish my colleagues all the very best for Christmas. Native Title Legislation",64
44,Dr KEMP,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I will speak this afternoon on some of the wider implications of the Native Title Bill, debate on which was guillotined in this place by a government which was desperate to avoid any detailed examination of the issues. It is a piece of legislation which is unjust and unworkable. The attempt to implement it will not advance the cause of most Aboriginal people, but it will damage the interests of Australians. I would like to address one issue which is raised by this legislation and which has been raised explicitly by some of its supportersAboriginal self-determination., The language of self-determination has now become widespread, but most Australians are probably, as yet, unaware of the nature of this discussion. In July this year Emeritus Professor Russell Mathews presented a paper to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, CEDA, entitled 'Towards Aboriginal Selfgovernment'. Professor Mathews's paper called for: An immediate start to negotiations aimed at establishing self-government in the Aboriginal lands of the Northern Territory as the first step in true reconciliation with the Aboriginal people. The contribution of the government's bill to this objective may at first glance seem to be slight, but it is to be seen in several provisions which go far beyond the High Court judgment and which have the potential to lay the basis for a new territory of the Commonwealth based on race. The provisions to which I refer are, firstly, those which treat native title as equivalent in key respects to freehold. The government has made no secret of its intention to give native title its maximum scope. It is quite clear that it has been prepared to go far beyond the High Court decision to give effect to this goal. The government consistently refers to native title land, even though it is quite plain from the High Court judgment and from historical facts that in many cases-perhaps the majority of cases on the Australian mainland-native title rights are much more equivalent to rights of usage or entitlement to the fruits of the land than they are to freehold title over the land. In this matter, the legishition introduced by Premier Court in Western Australia, with its confirmation of the existing rights of all Aboriginal people and their conversion to enforceable statutory rights, is much closer to both the reality and to the bad spirit of the High Court judgment than the federal bill which is now before the parliament. The second feature of the bill in this conall text, a feature which also goes well beyond the High Court decision,is the provision that Aboriginal holders of pastoral leases will be able to convert their lease to native title, if they could otherwise have claimed native title in relation to the land but for the existence of the pastoral lease. The way in which this provision is likely to work must be seen in the light of a further provision of the government's bill: the creation of a land fund for the purchase of land for Aboriginal people. There is little doubt that one of the tions of this land fund will be to buy up pastoral properties for Aboriginal people, who will then be able to convert the title to these properties into native title land under the legislation. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, has stated his view that the consequence of this is that as much as 90 per cent of the Northern Territory is likely to fall under Aboriginal title of one kind or another. No Australian should be under any illusion that such a move will give a huge push forward to a separatist agenda. Professor Mathews, as I have said, believes that the establishment of self-government in the Aboriginal lands of the Northern Territory should be a first step to what he calls true reconciliation with the Aboriginal people. In building his case, Professor Mathews· points to the example of Canada, where two distinct systems of indigenous self-government have emerged. In answer to anyone who thinks that Canada does not provide a realistic analogy for Australia, Professor Mathews does not agree. On the contrary, he believes that Australia provides a much more favourable case for Aboriginal self-government than Canada. His main argument is that Aboriginal land ownership has proceeded much further in this country than it has in Canada. In addition, what are in essence political structures, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the land councils, have already been set in place and these structures could relatively easily be converted into the framework for Aboriginal self-government. Thirdly, Australian expenditure on Aboriginal services per capita already exceeds that level in Canada, and Professor Mathews believes that a consolidation of these funds could already be used to provide a substantial initial revenue base for a self-governing Aboriginal territory. Finally, in Professor Mathews's view, the Grants Commission in Australia presides over a system of fiscal equalisation which is much more highly developed than any which exists in Canada, and the Grants Commission would be able to readily advise the Commonwealth on the level of funds a new self-governing applicaterritory would need. Professor Mathews argues that negotiations should be commenced to divide the Northern Territory into two parts, 'one of which would be the self-governing territory comprising the Aboriginal lands excised from the existing Territory'. I have taken the time to spell out the Mathews proposal because it clearly shows that the separatist agenda is not just one which is promoted by a few extremists; it is an agenda which, though most people are as yet not aware, is getting an increasingly wide hearing in certain circles. I have no doubt at all that, within a relatively short time of the passage of the Native Title Bill, the creation of at least one and possibly more separate Aboriginal territories will be a new focus of attention among the chattering classes and that it will be actively promoted by some Aboriginal leaders, who today are talking more circumspectly so as not to imperil the passage of the bill through the Senate. In my view, the Mathews proposal is totally unacceptable. It is deeply flawed on grounds of fundamental principle: it contradicts and sweeps away the basic principles and ideals on which this nation is founded. Canada, a nation which tragically seems to be in a state of disintegration, should not be taken as an example we should follow, but as a case we should avoid at all costs. The fundamental flaw of the Mathews proposal, and of all proposals for a distinct self-governing Aboriginal territory, is that it argues for a political structure based on race. Such a self-governing territory would inevitably raise a host of questions, the answers to which would inevitably be determined by their implications for the racial composition and viability of the new territory. If there were not racially based laws in such a territory, it is highly probable that, over time, very basis for the establishment. of such a territory would be undermined because of the relatively small numbers of the Aboriginal people. . Inevitable political conflict would be generbeen ated as the Aboriginal inhabitants of the territory fought to maintain their hold on its affairs. If it looked as though the battle to maintain the territory as an Aboriginal territory were being lost, it is certain that there would be growing demands for its independence from Australia, as has occurred in Quebec in Canada. The path down which Australia would be going under such proposals would lead inexorably to the break-up of the Commonwealth of Australia. The great ideal of one people one destiny, which motivated the federation of the colonies, would be thrown into the garbage can of history. There is no room for racial discrimination as a standing principle of public policy in Australia. Australia is a democracy, and a fundamental principle of democracy is that all people are equal before the law. Our institutions and our political structures should be such that all Australians can participate in them equally, without regard to their race or ethnic background. At this critical moment in our national development, we must be exceedingly careful that in our deep determination to address the issue of disadvantage for Aboriginal and other Australians we do not set in place policies and structures based on principles and concepts which are incompatible with the basic ideal of equality of all people.",66
45,Mr CHYNOWETH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," It is not often that I have to come into the House and say that I have made a mistake. However, in a speech some time ago I am afraid I did that. I claimed that the Premier Victoria's name was Jeffrey Gibb Kennett. I am sorry, but I have found out it is Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett. When you have a look at the definition of 'glib', it means fluent and voluble but insincere and shallow, and those the meanings point directly to what this man is like. However, I would also like to inform the House about something that I have heard of just recently. This is a secret letter that has sent to the Premier of Victoria, Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett, from the Russian leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Vladimir has requested from Jeff details as to how he has created a fascist state in just 12 months. Vladimir is definitely after these details, and I will go on to describe what has happened in Victoria. Vladimir, of course, saw it on TV just recently through the actions of the police in Victoria in relation to Richmond secondary college. Millions of other people all over the world also saw the terrible television shots of what happened in Victoria. There was a line of policemen with their batons in the straight, horizontal position. I only saw it on TV, like everyone else, but they appeared to be saying, 'Move, move, move'. They were all chanting in unison and had a very threatening manner. What they were doing was trying to shift on innocent civilians who were trying to protect the school for their children, and these innocent civilians did not have any protection. They were in the crouch position and continually the police just went straight at them with their batons. Many of these unprotected civilians were severely hurt. All the time there was the line of police chanting, 'Move, move, move'. If honourable members think about where the police would have got this word from, they might recall a document which may have cost anywhere from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, and which was prepared by the Premier and the state government of Victoria Victoria and delivered to every household there, I believe. On the front is a smiling Jeff Kennett; Premier of Victoria, and at the bottom is the new motto for the Liberal Party in Victoria: 'Victoria on the move'. How right of he is! Not only are people moving from Victoria to Queensland but they are also getting a baton in the ribs and being told to move on if they sit down and protest. We have heard today from the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) in relation to what is happening in our judicial system. I am not a lawyer, but even someone with my limited knowledge of the law realises that there should not be any political interference, especially with the Department of Public Prosecutions. The prosecutor. is no friend of the Labor Party. I know that in the past there have been problems with him in Victoria, but he is independent. This position is now under threat. If the honourable member for MCEwen's allegations are correct-as I believe many of them will prove to be:.. - we will see some serious fallout in the Liberal Party in relation to these attempts to put pressure on the legal and judicial system in Victoria. I also bring to the attention of the House and the people of Australia the change in police powers that is happening in Victoria. This is a very serious matter. Under a redrafted bill of the Kennett Liberal government, police who suspect-and please note the word 'suspect' - a person of committing a crime could force people to provide their name and address, and failure to do so would result in a $500 fine. Police would have the power to fingerprint people of over 15 years of age in a videotaped procedure and to fingerprint children-note that this applies only to suspected people-aged between 10 and 14, on the condition that their parents were aware that it was being done. What happens to all the homeless kids when parents cannot be found? Are they fingerprinted too? Furthermore, police would be empowered to forensically test people if the person had given consent. If the person fails to consentnote the words 'fails to consent'-a court order can be required for the testing procedure. Even the Victorian branch of the Australian Medical Association has complained. It complained that doctors could not be forced to take body samples without the person's consent. However, Mrs Wade, the Attorney General of such notoriety, has said that doctors would not be forced to take body samples and that a provision was being included for a person's own doctor to take the sample or be present while it was being taken. Mrs Wade acknowledged that forensic provisions were not available elsewhere in Australia. This is another reason why Victoria is becoming the fascist state. There· are other matters in relation to· this particular problem that I see happening in Victoria. I know that when the revolution comes I will probably be the first up against the wall, but I think it is my duty to point out to this country the problems in Victoria. I have mentioned the fascist state and honourable members only have to look at headlines such as 'Kennett ""gagging debate with jackboot tactics""'. If that does not come out of the Nazi era, i do not know what does. One thing that has to be done when a fascist state is created is to have a go at the papers, the TV, the radio and, of course, the law and the church. Jeffrey has done all that. The Premier of Victoria has put a ban on talking to the 7.30 Report. He will not talk to the ABC nor will he talk to the Sunday Age. All such media are banned, although the Herald-Sun is still on the popular list for the moment. I do not know how long that will last: it will probably go. So I imagine that we will be getting more and more of these productions paid for by the Victorian taxpayer and sent to every home. Recently, in my local newspaper, there was a four-page colour wraparound which was a propaganda sheet paid for by the Victorian government. It went to everyone in Dunkley and everyone in the Frankston and Momington areas. It probably went all over Victoria. Who funded that? According to the write-up inside, it was funded by the advertisers and the Victorian government. The advertisers were bodies such as the SEC, the state government, and so on. It is a real con job. It is all part of the softening-up process so that Jeffrey can completely impose his will on the people of Victoria. However, there are a few of us on whom it will not work. Honourable members are looking at one of them right now. I will keep complaining about this person until he acknowledges what he is doing. Honourable members probably remember his wine licence. He was never charged over that. Things got lost and forgotten about. It· was back in October. Who can remember what happened in October? The. controversial liquor licence which was granted to Jeff Kennett was the only one of its kind not approved by the police. Liquor licensing commissioner Tony Ryan said that of 30,000 to 40,000 limited licences, Mr Kennett's was probably the only one not inspected by· the pol ice. Of 30,000 to, 40,000 licences, who does not get a guernsey? Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett of course! It is quite amazing. I wonder whether I am getting it bit'paranoid but when I look at what he is trying tq do there I see that the only area that was not cut in budget allocations was the police force. Nonnally, a dictator looks after the any. The any does not come urider Jeffrey's control as yet. So I am a bit concerned about what is happening down there. As I said, I believe that what he is doing Victoria is completely wrong. Everyone in this House should take note of it. They should remember this. Honourable members may treat what I am saying as a joke now, but if they look back on it in a c;ouple of years, if he is still in power, they should remember that I told them to be wary of this particular person. He is doing something to Victoria that no other premier would do; and even Joh Bjelke-Petersen would not have been as blatant as this particular guy-or maybe he could have been, I urge everyone to be extremely careful and very wary of Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett. Mr Ronaldson-The member for Dunkley quoted from a letter allegedly. sent to Mr Kennett. I ask that he table that document.",68
46,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I ask the honourable member for Dunkley whether he is seeking leave to table that document.,70

49,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"A university is primarily an educational institution. Its principal contribution to the community of which it is part relates to the excellence of its teaching and research. However, the presence of a univer;if\, in II region also brings considerable econonu(; benefits. ' I want to congratulate the Vice Chancellor of the University of Southern Queensland, Professor Barry Leal, on a recently released in economic impact study' for which lecturers Richard Temple-Smith of the Faculty of Business and Nonn Elvidge of the Faculty of Arts and their research assistants are to be commended. As the president of the students association said in part at the study'S release: According to my parents, university students were airy fairy, long haired, beer guzzling, marijuana smoking good for nothings ... Whilst some would consider this period as 'the good old days', it's important to recognise that the typical university student has changed ... Growing up in Toowoomba, I am aware of the tremendous sense of community in this city and the region ... Fostering a sense of community between the university and the Darling Downs region is mutually beneficial to all parties. USQ is your university. As members of the local community it is important to recognise that the wealth generated by the students of the university in terms of finance, sport and human thought is yours to share. Together, so very much can be achieved. Clearly USQ, with a student population of 13,500, is on the move as a significant national higher education player, at the same time generating substantial local employment and a financial injection of about $50 million per annum. Petrol Prices",70
50,Mr HORNE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to make a statement about the manipulation of petrol prices .that is taking place in this country. Overnight, in my own electorate, petrol prices increased by approximately lOc per litre. It is a predictable outcome, because what we find is that petrol prices are increasing on the evening prior to the day that payment of a large majority of social service welfare payments is made, as well as wages and salaries of Commonwealth and state public servants. The oil companies are providing discount incentives to loc-l service stations only during the low volume days within a week or a fortnightly cycle. They are well aware of when people get paid and when sales at the pump are at their highest. On these days, prices per litre at service stations peak. This is a factor that the government has no control over and it is something that is causing offence to all the people of Australia, to busines- and the members of the community at large. It is something that must stop. I call on the oil companies to act in the interest of all Australians and maintain a constant price for petrol at the lowest possible level, so their cost margins are covered but so that the people of Australia get a fair go with petrol pricing. ABC: Advertisements",70
51,Mr HAWKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to draw the House's attention to some extraordinary employment advertisements that were placed in the Age on 23 October. These were all placed by the ABC, and I will just read the qualifications for them. The first one was for a cadet journalist and it said: ABC Radio News has an opening for a cadet journalist of non-English speaking background. The second one, for a trainee rural reporter, said: This is a 12-month training opportunity for a person of non-English speaking background with a ried! genuine interest in Australia's rural affairs. The third one, for a female trainee sports reporter, said: A 12-month traineeship exists in the ABC Radio Sport for a female sports reporter. What I find quite extraordinary is that, if we look at the bottom of. the advertisement, it says: The ABC is an equal opportunity employer ... Yet it seems that on the basis of my race, on the basis of my ethnic background, on the basis of my gender, I could not qualify for these. As these seem to be extraordinarily sexist advertisements, is it reverse discrimination or is it just another case of the ABC and its new politically correct look? Health Insurance",71
52,Mr NEVILLE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Earlier this week the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated: Medicare.is working so well that people are leaving the private health system and joining the public health system. This is a statement of singular inanity and is a perversion of the real situation. Wake up, Prime Minister. It is not by choice, it is by imposed necessity, and in his. moments of truth he knows this to be true. Since 1983 the level of participatiol,1 in private health insurance has fallen from 62 to 40 per cent and this fall has been continuing regularly throughout the 10 years. Waiting that lists are growing in many areas, accelerated discharge from acute public and maternity hospitals has been the order of the day and people are dying waiting for transplants. A senior health officer from the Wide Bay area reported to me this week that patients who can no longer afford health care, when the worse occurs, are now taking out private loans so that they can enter private hospitals to avoid public waiting lists. That is hardly a vote of confidence in Medicare. . Finally, by what strange logic does the Prime Minister promote a jobs levy option which could impose five per cent on the.se earning over $50,000 a year, but refuse to apply the same principle to uninsured people earning more than the same $50,000 a year? No wonder Senator Richardson is very worJervis Bay",71
53,Mr MACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I inform the government that the proposal to relocate the Newington Arms Depot and the Kingswood Munitions Works to Jervis Bay is one which will provoke'massive long-term and unremitting public confrontation if it is approved. Jervis Bay is considered to be the jewel in the crown of the New South Wales coastline by an extremely large number of people. The Jervis Bay area has been repeatedly threatened by proposals for a nuclear reactor, various plans to relocate the Navy's eastern fleet, severe urbanisation, inappropriate tourism activities and ocean outfall sewerage disposal schemes. The conservation of this ecologically and culturally significant area is considered to be non-negotiable. I call on the government to remove Jervis Bay from any consideration as a site for the relocation of the Newington Arms Depot or any other naval activity or facility, now or in the future. I call on the government to promote the dedication of the Commonwealth lands on the Beecroft Peninsula as a national park consistent with the implications of the forthcoming Mabo legislation. Furthermore, I call on the government to purchase the Point Perpendicular lighthouse complex for the Australian Nature Conservation Agency for inclusion in the national park lands. The Navy's plans are inconsistent with defence planning strategies which call for relocation to northern Australia. They will completely devalue the ecological and heritage values of Jervis Bay. Victoria",71
54,Mr CHYNOWETH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In a recent speech I said that there was a secret letter to Jeffrey Kennett from a certain Vladimir from Russia. That was a bit of a joke but one can see how precious· they are on the other side and how this has struck them so much. Vladimir over in Russia would not even know who Jeff Kennett was but I bet he has seen those photographs. I bet he has seen the police attacking those people there. I bet he knows all about Jeffrey and he soon will be writing to him to get clues on how he is turning Victoria into a fascist state. One of the things that has also happened down there is the fact that our electricity have gone up tremendously. All Victorian members should have a look at their bills. There is a $16 service charge there. When one asks what that is for one is told it is for the electric light poles and the wires and all the other hidden charges. My bills have gone up over· $70 from this time last year, and nothing else has changed in our house. The only thing that has changed is the government. That is why we are getting these increased taxes and charges put on us. We have our $100 poll tax that has been put on us by Jeffrey. It goes on and on and on. I suppose that just before the election he will drop the charge and say, 'What a good chap I am.', but honourable members opposite can be assured he will bring it on again straight after the election. This is the sort of jackboot tactics that are being carried on in Victoria, Once again, just look at our judicial system. (Time expired) Native Title",72
55,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Native Title Bill will not eradicate the wrongs committed against Aboriginal society over the past 200 years. It might, however, if accepted by the general community in the right spirit, begin the process of reconciliation. The purists argue that the absence of veto rights for Aboriginals is a major impediment. However, the bottom line seems to be that as there is a sufficient number of Aboriginal people supporting the bill it should suggest to our two friends in the Senate that the bill ought to be passed. The 15 minutes of fame might be alluring but the bill is more important. It is not good enough for the Greens to say that they do not know exactly what they want. The reactionaries know what they want. They want a referendum that they can throw their dirty money at to get the result they want. The same pillars of society who extol the virtue of the law have no respect for the law when it does not serve their economic interests. This is the company the Greens will be keeping if they join those on my right and vote against Mabo. The Native Title Bill is not perfect. Howbills ever, as Noel Pearson points out in this morning's Australian: . .. there is no prospect of the Bill being improved by delay, and indeed there is a significant risk that our position will be eroded ... In the end the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the honourable member for Barker (MCLachlan) have had nothing of any substance to say on the Mabo issue. They do not deserve to win the day. The Greens have a responsibility to ensure that these reactionaries are put in their place. Port Macquarie Neighbourhood Centre",72
56,Mr VAILE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to speak this afternoon on behalf of the Port Macquarie Neighbourhood Centre which runs an extensive financial counselling service. This is an extremely important service in the Port Macquarie area whereby help is provided to people in financial difficulty. In the Port Macquarie area the service currently has 63 clients who are. struggling under the weight of the current economic recession. The majority of the people involved in this service are social security recipients and the financial counsellors are saving Commonwealth legal aid enormous amounts of money in bankruptcy cases. Also, as next year is the Year of the Family and as Christmas is just around the corner, I call on the Federal Attorney-General to urgently address this issue of funding freezes to financial counselling services right across Australia. The sad fact of life is that the financial counselling service in Port Macquarie is going to close down on Christmas Eve if no emergency funding· for 1994 is found. I have spoken with people in the state government and I understand they are establishing a trust fund for the continuation of this operation from 1995 onwards. However, it is next year that many of these services will close down due to the lack of federal and state funding available for 1994. The Attorney-General can address this issue if he really wants to. He does have the resources available and the power to keep these services open throughout next year. I am extremely anxious to see this service I believe it has proven its worth in the Port Macquarie area and it is well established and well credentialled. lam fully aware that there is not unlimited funding for projects, but I call on the Attorney-General to consider supporting the financial counselling service to obtain a grant for 1994. Postal Services Native Title",73
57,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The ravings of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) are an occasional feature of this chamber, but I was interested to hear that he has had a letter from the union responsible for our postal obstructions that actually lets him off the hook, because, apparently, he seems to support them wholeheartedly and, as a consequence, he gets his mail through and nobody else does. As a member of parliament representing my constituents, I consider that is thoroughly discriminatory against me. I point out that a full-page advertisement appeared in the West Australian today putting the case of Western Australians to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the Mabo Bill. It says: We've all heard and read so many different views on Mabo, we're thoroughly confused. But, there's also no denying the majority of Western Australians are frightened and concerned about the future for us and our families. Yet, when we dare to express our concern, there are some that would unfairly label us racist. The fact is, all we're asking for is for a fair go. For all Australians. Paul Keating admits we have the most to lose. He's right! We can lose the right to administer our own land. Lose jobs and investment and equal opportunities for all Australians. Yet he stubbornly refuses to take our fears into account. when framing his Mabo legislation. In the eyes of any reasonable person, that isn't fair. There is a warning here from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia that says: And, our own WA. Senators will have a lot to answer for if they go meekly along with it. Of course, he is referring in particular to the continue. Green senators. (Time expired) Pacific Highway",73
58,Mr HORNE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Because of committee commitments this morning I could not participate, unfortunately, in a private member's motion discussed in this House relating to the Pacific Highway. The Pacific Highway is a very important road link in my electorate. It trav-rses some 100 kilometres of it, starting at Hexham and going north past Bulahdelah. What the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Neh!) attempted to do with the private member's motion this morning was to move the responsibility for that road from the coalition government of New South Wales to the federal government. That is not. acceptable. There is no doubt that the honourable member for Cowper did that because he has no faith in his colleagues in the state coalition government honouring any commitment to that road. There is no doubt that road linkages between Sydney and Brisbane are important. For that reason this government, under the previous minister, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), did make a commitment to the New England Highway. It is shorter, it is safer, it is the road that this government will continue to honour its commitment to as the national highway from Sydney to Brisbane. I ask all honourable members to take that on note and support this government in any expenditure for that highway.. Community Grants",73
59,Mr SLIPPER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Honourable members have been staggered recently as they watch the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) exposed during question time over her politically motivated administration of sports grants. The truth is that she has blatantly distributed up· to $30 million of taxpayers' money to prop up marginal Labor electorates. An average of $257,000 was spent in ALP electorates, but only $141,000 in coalition seats. However, honourable members should be aware that this standard of administration of taxpayers' money by the minister and her predecessor is not new. Honourable members will recall that when North Queensland's Ravenshoe timber mill went into receivership in 1990, more than $7 million in federal grants and loans went unaccounted for because the government failed to check the books.

61,Mr SPEAKER,NEW ENGLAND,"Order! Before calling on questions without notice, I wish to advise the House that recently the right honourable member for· New England (Mr Sinclair) celebrated 30 years continuous membership of this House. Ian Sinclair came to the House of Representatives in the general election held on 30 November 1963, following service in the New South Wales parliament, terminated only by resignation in order to contest that election. . His impact was immediate, and he was made a minister of the Crown within 12 and months of being sworn in as a member, thus beginning a long period of ministerial service in a number of portfolios. Significant as Ian's ministerial career was, perhaps his most longlasting influence on the proceedings of the House was in his service as Leader of the House from December 1975 to September 1979 and from August 1980 to May 1982, with periods as Manager of Opposition Business corresponding to changes of government. It has been said that elements of most ingenious devices to facilitate· passage of government business can be attributed to the right honourable member. I understand that his speeches justifying various techniques have provided inspiration to successive leaders of the House. Outside his formal parliamentary duties, Ian has always been a keen sportsman, and continues that interest. Ona number of occasions I am advised that he represented the parliament in the then annual rugby match against the ABC. The front row of Ian Sinclair and Doug Anthony, with His Excellency the Governor General, Bill Hayden, as hooker, was a most formidable combination, signifying the way that cross-party cooperation operates on many occasions within the parliament. Those remaining who played in those matches advise me that Ian's approach to football was as enthusiastic and robust as . was his general approach to politics. Ian Sinclair is the longest serving member of either house of the parliament. He is a worthy father of the House and of the parliament and he continues to enjoy the respect of his parliamentary colleagues. On behalf of the House, I congratulate the right honourable member and extend our very warm regards to him. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",74

Will the minister now admit that she misled the House, given that the Auditor-General informed a parliamentary committee this morning that she did not make available to him a fax from her office to the Minister for Finance dated 20 February 1992 describing his seat of Gellibrand as 'safe Labor'?",75
67,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the House to what has been revealed this morning at a hearing of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts into audit report No.9. The Auditor-General said clearly this morning, when asked about, first of all, alleged political bias of this program, that he could not find that. The Auditor-General had some other very interesting revelations about credibility. In the Canberra TImes of 14 December 1993, the honourable member for Higgins is reported to have said-when asked about this famous Willis fax that he just referred to that the Auditor-General had - specifically looked for that document'. In the hearing this morning, the Auditor-General repudiated the claim by the honourable member for Higgins. When asked if he was looking for the fax, he said that he 'was not specifically searching for the document'. The honourable member for Higgins went even further and claimed that this fax in fact sparked the inquiry itself. That was categorically denied in the hearing this morning. The honourable member for Higgins made this statement deliberately and mischievously with a view to misleading this House and the public. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order",75

71,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Higgins has attempted to involve a statutory office-holder in a political conspiracy. If he had any honour, he would apologise-if not to me, at least to the Auditor-General. Let us not lose sight of what this campaign is all about. Those opposite are not concerned about the administration of this program because they wanted to abolish it. They promised, in fact, to abolish it before the last election. Opposition members cannot accept the fact that they lost the last election, and they are looking for any excuse they can to justify it. I repeat the points I have made over the few days. The auditor had access to all the information that was available. Members of parliament who requested extracts from lists of grant applications would have had those documents provided to them. The Auditor General had the total list of applications. In this House and outside this parliament over past weeks, I have been accused of misleading this House and of political bias in the administration of this program. What has been revealed today is that the honourable member for Higgins is the guilty one-the one who has mislead. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, could you ask the minister to table the document she was reading from?",75

78,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In congratulating the Prime Minister and the government on the successful outcome of the Uruguay Round, I ask the Prime Minister whether he is able to make a preliminary assessment for the House of the value of that outcome to Australia, particularly in relation to manufactured exports, agricultural exports and service exports. What will be the long-term benefits to the Australian economy of this successful outcome?",76
79,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to be able to report to the House that the Uruguay last Round was concluded with the gaveling of the final act by the trade negotiating committee chairman earlier this morning our time. Final market access schedules are to be submitted by 15 February next year, prior to the final meeting of the ministerial committee of the trade negotiating committee in Marrakesh in April 1994. This has been a long, difficult and very rewarding negotiation. It is the largest international negotiatiori of its kind and the largest world trade deal ever by a huge margin. I would like to take this opportunity to extend Australia's thanks to the many ministers, officials and business people who have contributed to its successful conclusion. I would like to particularly recognise the early work of the current Treasurer, who formed the Cairns Group in 1986, and the subsequent and very brilliant work of the subsequent ministers for trade: the honourable member for Holt; the honourable member for Bonython, who just asked me the question; the honourable member for Werriwa; and, of course, now Senator Cook. The former ministers carried on the trade work and negotiations in the most gruelling and darkest hours of the round. Of course, we are all indebted to the great work that Senator Cook has done in Geneva, tying up loose ends and winning last minute gains for Australia. I spoke to Senator Cook and his team of offiCials in Geneva this morning and congratulated them, on the government's behalf, for the very fine achievements which will greatly enhance the prosperity and welfare of the round for fellow Australians. ' I think we should record the faith the government has shown in the multilateral trading system and our belief in such a system serving not just Australia and the world well, but imagining an international trading world where there could be a higher level of growth and a higher level of incomes. This is very much in accord with the model that this government has set for Australia from the early 1980s onwards-in removing exchange controls in the early 1980s, in lowering border protection from 1988 on a phased basis to 1991, and then of course announcing further reductions in tariffs going way down to the year 2000. That open, competitive model, which it took a Labor government to put into place in this country, was complemented by the structures we built for Australia internationalIy. The Treasurer built these first as Minister for Trade with the Cairns Group in 1986. We then supported them by a succession of ministers and efforts to build the possibility the Uruguay Round had for extending the Kennedy Round from goods, into things such as services, intelIectual property rights and, particularly for Australia, agriculture. This was a very difficult round and, for a second, I fleetingly mention the role of ministers and the darkest hours of the round. This was the hardest, most gruelling negotiation that Australia has ever been part of: days and nights fighting over words, fighting over sentences, fighting over communiques, pressuring people in corridors-alI the things which the ministers I mentioned did to achieve this outcome. . As a consequence, Australia has played a very substantial role in our leadership of the Cairns Group and, as well as that, in the negotiation with the European Union and the United States. The consequence is a deal which will now set a backdrop in world trade as the world community moves to a new phase of commerce with these great societies rejoining the world economy-in the case of Russia, for the first time since the First War; in the case of China, substantially, in this modern environment, for the first time ever; and with India, another major state, now emerging as a major player in the world of commerce and trade. What better backdrop could there be for this? I congratulate President Clinton on pressing for a conclusion of the round and pressing his ministers to have the round concluded. This foIlows his success in running the threads of open trade through the United States with the endorsement by the congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement and his involvement with the continuing development of the Asia Pacific Economic CooperationAPEC. It is a very different world today from yesterday as a consequence of this happening. It means that we will now see great opportunities for growth in trade. For Australia, the Industry Commission suggests that the benefits may be as much as a $5 billion increase in exports and a $3.7 billion increase in Australian GDP as a result of the round. That model does not capture all of the dynamic and confidence effects which would obviously come from this kind of change. Nonetheless, it does point to a minimum increase of over $2 billion in our manufactured exports and a $2 billion increase in resource exports, as well as a $1 billion increase in agricultural exports. According to the Industry Commission, the transport industry could see exports rise by well over $200 million, with the same for machinery and the equipment industry. ABARE tells us that the wheat industry may see its export returns rise by over $250 million. The meat industry could see returns rise by over $400 million. These are fairly spectacular change!). It might be worth mentioning that there will be 50 million tonnes less subsidised wheat and - our on the. world market over the six-year ImplementatIOn period compared with now. United States and European union subsidised wheat exports are likely to be down one-third by the year 2000 on current levels. But, as everybody expected those subsidies to continue, it will be down about half of what everyone expected it might have been by the year World 2000. This is quite a spectacular outcome. Could I just recap by saying that what has happened here is, in multilateral terms, the most significant trade agreement ever struck. It was struck because of the persistence of countries in not letting largely European intransigence hold this up, of the support that we were able to gamer with countries like the United States through the Cairns group, but always with a vision that this government had of an open multilateral trading system and seeing Australia have a role in it. Communities elect governments to govern, and they elect governments to think about their future and their role in the world. This government has thought about Australia and designed an economy for it that fits into its view and its vision of an open multilateral trading system. Seeing this come around last evening was in fact very much the coming into evidence of the kind of economic frllmework which the Australian economy is now set up to be, and the international framework it is set up to participate in. Could I again reiterate my congratulations and thanks to Senator Cook and to all those officials who have taken a key role in the round-and there are many of them; some current and some now retired-and to the members of this House that I mentioned: the Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt, the honourable member for Bonython and the honourable member for Werriwa. Australia owes them a great debt of gratitude, and I acknowled-e that on behalf of the parliament. Community Grants",76

Ralph Willis' dated 20 February 1992 was not made available to him but was in error faxed into the office of a coalition member of this House?",78

83,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer the minister to the historic outcome of the GATT round. What benefits will be enjoyed by Australian primary producers as a result of the successful conclusion of the round?,78
84,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. Let me join with the Prime Minister in congratulating all of those on this side of the House who have been responsible for steering this very significant outcome, and for What the Prime Minister has identified as very good news for the Australian economy. The deal that has been struck in the GATT round is particularly good news for our agricultural and· mining sector. The farm sector, which has been long plagued by corrupt and subsidised world markets, which have led to depressions of the prices that they have got and restrictions on access, has been a significant beneficiary of this outcome. The outcome establishes the discipline, the ground rules, for reform in the world marketplaces, that will lead to much freer markets as a result. The Prime Minister has indicated that for agriculture the gains are in excess of $1 billion; for the beef industry, on ABARE's analysis, the gains are up to $480 million when fully implemented; for dairy products, $170 million; for wheat, $250 million; and for coarse grains, in addition to that, some $60 million. . The effect of this decision when it starts to flow in concrete terms from 1995 will mean that there will no longer be a meat import law or section 22 quotas in the US for Australian beef and that the European Union and the US will be exporting substantially less subsidised wheat into world marketplaces. There will no longer be bans on rice imports in Japan and Korea and, importantly, what we have also been able to secure is that the US will not llse its EEP program to subsidise rice sales into those markets. On top of that, we have secured the retention of the Andreissen assurance which will protect Australian beef markets in Asia from subsidised European beef. The Prime Minister has indicated that the gains for the mining industry are up to $2 billion. Coal in particular will be a significant beneficiary standing to gain half a billion dollars and upwards from this outcome. In addition to that, there are opportunities for the value adding industries that the farm sector and the mining sector will develop. They can get a significant slice of the extra benefits that are available in terms of manufactured produce. In terms of our export profiles, it is true that as a nation we have been moving from the quarry and the farm, but the reality is that much of that movement in future will be based on the quarry and the farm. I mention in particular the strategies that this government has in place for the food processing industries and for the fibre based industries. The opportunity for the commodity based groups to interact into this new direction, this new set of guidelines, is significant, as it will be for regional parts of Australia in terms of identifying their opportunities. I made reference to this yesterday in answer to a question. That is essentially where the challenge now lies: the preparedness on the part 'of commercial interests to get behind this new set of guidelines and push for a larger slice of the action so that we are not just resting on the laurels of what has been achieved to date but getting a bigger share of that $400 billion market that will be freed up as a result of the GAIT outcome. I have been very interested to note today .that there has been hardly anything. said by the opposition in relation to this historic outcome. The Leader of the National Party, who is always so quick to put out press releases whenever it suits him-it amazes me at times how quickly he gets them out-said on 3 December 1993: ... Australia's leadership of the Cairns Group . be assessed in terms of the ultimate beneficiaries of the final Uruguay outcome. He said that Australia could not be sidelined in the lead-up to the finalisation and that, if it was, 'Australia's leadership must be held to account'. Not only have we not been sidelined, not only did we not go backwards; we in fact made improvements. Where is the opposition's response welcoming this outcome and congratulating the Australian leadership for what has been achieved? In conclusion, today we have on the agenda for the first time in this sitting a matter of public importance relating to the rural economy. But what is it about? It is about AQIS. On the day on which we have had the most historic and significant breakthrough for our agricultural commodities and the rural-sector, all the coalition can talk about in terms of a matter of importance is AQIS. The opposition is irrelevant, it i- out of touch, it has lost the plot, and it is no wonder the rural sector is moving away from the opposition. Community Grants",78
85,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. If the minister now draws a distinction between documents relating to round 3 and documents relating to round 4 of grants under the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program-both personally administered by her""':""does that mean ,that there are other documents relating to round 3 that she did not make available to the Auditor-General?",79
86,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have said in all my answers, the Auditor-General had all the applications from all of the rounds. Manufacturing Industry",79
87,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development explain the implications of the outcome of the· Uruguay Round for Australia's burgeoning manufacturing and services sector? ' Mr GRIFFITHS-It is not overstating the case to say that Australia's manufacturing and services industries-and, by definition, their employees-will be major beneficiaries of will what the Prime Minister has correctly described as the historic GAIT decision. In the context of manufacturing, it is worth pointing .out that in 1992-93 manufactured goods exports comprised 29 per cent of Australia's total exports. The fastest growing subsector of our. manufactured goods exports is in the area of elaborately transformed manufactured goods. One of the interesting asides in relation to this GAIT outcome is that Australia now has, in terms of applications for external patents, the highest rate of growth in the OECD. In 1975, we made about 2,000 applications for external patents. In 1990, we made applications for 20,000. This is one indicator-one straw in the wind, if you like-of what genuinely constitutes a clever country. Some of these outcomes are of the utmost significance to Australia. We are extremely well placed to benefit from them. For example, our pharmaceuticals industry, which is going from strength to strength, underpinned by a range of government programs-I talked about that recently in the House-will gain access to new markets in Europe, the US, Japan and Canada. That is one example of the high-tech area benefiting from these reforms. It is probably not widely known, but last year the Australian steel industry, supplying predominantly to niche markets high technology steel product, exported more steel than the total United States steel industry combined. That is truly a milestone when one reflects on the fact that, only a decade ago, we were in prospect of seeing that industry topple over. In the services sector, these new arrangements will mean that Australia's construction companies, amongst some of the best in the world, will now have access to a range of new countries and bidding processes. Our telecommunications sector, an area where we are currently extraordinarily competitive in our region and elsewhere, will gain access to a whole suite of new opportunities in markets that hitherto were denied us. People often do not think of our banks and legal firms as prospective important exporters, but they increasingly are. They are increasingly being featured in success stories around our region. There are enormous opportunities for banks and legal firms. This will enable and encourage them to go that little bit further. In conclusion, it is worth making the point to the opposition that times have never been more propitious for smart Australian companies. The reforms presided over by the Labor government during the 1980s and the 1990s have meant that we are ahead of the game. There are many countries now which are going to be bringing down their tariff barriers with all the consequent readjustment problems associated with that. They will be playing, in many respects, catch-up football. It is the Labor government that brought about these sometimes painful reforms. These reforms have meant that, in many areas, we are genuinely world competitive; we are getting smarter; and we are getting better faster. This is a propitious time in terms of the investment outlook for all of the reasons that we have spoken about in the last fortnight or so. I want to lend my congratulations to Peter Cook and all of those associated with this truly historic and important outcome. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I support the breakthrough as well and seek leave to table a statement by Andrew Peacock and me referring to this same subject.",79

90,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Did the minister or the mini-ter's office send any other faxes or inquiries to other members of parliament along the lines of that which she sent to the Minister for Finance on 20 February 1992? If so, where are those documents and where are the replies?",80
91,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Auditor-General, as I have said many times in this House, had all the information-all the information-that was available, including the information that was available on the Ralph Willis fax. Economy",80
92,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasprer. In question time on Tuesday, in response to a question from my colleague· the honourable member for Perth, the Treasurer provided the House with the information regarding the outlook for the Australian economy as a whole over the year ahead. Can the Treasurer provide any additional information of a sector by sector nature?",80
93,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Treasury has upgraded its forecasts of the economy for this financial year. In the process of making those adjustments to the forecast, Treasury took into account, firstly, official data from the Buteau of Statistics and, secondly, data from the B-siness Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers, Dun and Bradstreet, and other organisations which regularly produce information particularly about business expectations, consumer confidence and so on. As well as that, the Treasury has been undertaking its own qualitative investigations through its liaison with business, particularly in the major capitals of Sydney and Melbourne. Indeed, we took the decision about a year ago to establish offices in Melbourne and Sydney so that we could engage in this business liaison so that Treasury would have an up-to-date idea of the attitudes and expectations of the business community in Australia. This process covers all industry sectors, states and firms of all sizes. As a result, several hundred Australian businesses are now contacted each year on a rotating basis. Naturally, the information that is provided to the Treasury is on a commercial in-confidence basis. In order to ensure the flow of this information, that confidentiality must be respected. Nevertheless, I can in a general way draw on some of that information to say that, from the most recent round in November, the liaison process did reveal strong growth in employment prospects in relation to mediumsized businesses, particularly those reporting success in export markets. This is a very good indication of the sustainability of the recovery. Generally speaking, expectations of business is for growth to continue in the current months. Those industry sectors which were reporting particular buoyancy-including those for export-included dairy products; paper, printing and publishing; domestic air travel; the fast food business and others. This liaison process took place before the outcome of the Uruguay Round was fully appreciated. As the Prime Minister and others have indicated, that could only add to the sense of confidence and enthusiasm which Australian business must have not only for our domestic prospects but also for our prospects in internaEuropeans, tional markets. One of the most important points was that made by my colleague the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. In Australia much of the restructuring necessary to make our industries and firms competitive has already occurred. For many other countries, the undertakings made in the Uruguay Round mean they must now begin the process of restructuring-or continue it. So Australian companies, firms and sectors already-as a result of decisions we took unilaterally in relation to reductions in tariffs, withdrawal of subsidies and opening up of our markets-have undertaken the necessary restructuring in order to make them more competitive. Now that this course has been set for the world, that all markets will become more open and competitive, Australian companies in many respects have a· march on others around the world which have that all process of restructuring in front of them. I take this opportunity to thank the Prime Minister for his generous remarks and also to emphasise what a great job Australian officials did in this process. Whilst those of us who were fortunate enough to be ministers during this process had our opportunities to participate, in between those ministerial meetings we had very high quality officials in the various departments slogging it out toe to toe with their opposite numbers around the world. We would not be at this point in the process had it not been for the fact that Australia provided to that negotiating process probably the highest quality officials of any country. Those officials were dedicated and tenacious, and did the necessary gruelling work; they wore down those who were-may I use the word-recalcitrant in the negotiation.",80
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Try not to use it too often.,81
95,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There were many who were. Happily, there were no recalcitrants amongst the Cairns Group members. They all were enthusiasts about the process and can now bask with us in the victory we have had. I also want to say that at the beginning of this process the key countries and people involved in getting the round under way were the the Americans and Australia. The key participants in concluding the round, again, were Commissioner Brittan representing Europe, Ambassador Kantor repre-enting the United States and Senator Cook representing Australia. Never again will there be an occasion where an Australian minister has to stamp his foot and walk out disgraced and abandoned, as happened on the earlier occasion. We saw that that did not happen on this occasion; and it will never happen again. Community Grants",81
96,Mr RONALDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is adgreen paper? dressed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Yesterday she informed the House that the Auditor-General was wrong in saying, as the program guidelines do, that the maximum grant for any project was $250,000. If that was the case, why did neither she nor her department seek to correct that part of the report detailing payments excess of the program limit? Why did the department confine itself to informing Auditor-General that these case studies were 'unhelpful'?",82
97,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My departm-ntal officers will be appearing before the committee this afternoon. They will answer that question then. In the meantime, I would like to read letter that Stuart Hamilton, the secretary my department, has written to me in relation to this issue. It states: The Audit Report, in 2 Case Studies, mentions that growth. payments were made in excess of the maximum provided in the Program Guidelines ($250,000). . However I understand that each funding round treated as separate by you and the Department particular, the program guidelines were revised and reissued each time). Consequently it was possible for a group, having received a grant in one round, to apply in a subsequent round (for an extension the previous work for example) and to have second grant approved taking the total to over $250,000. This did occur in a small number cases. I understand no grants over $250,000 were paid in anyone round. This issue was not the subject of a formal recommendation by ANAO and consequently it was not dealt with in our comments on the draft report. However, officers of the Department explained the auditors during the course of the audit aspect operated.",82

101,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware of media reports that the proposals of the employment green paper would only provide 50,000 permanent jobs for the long-term unemployed? Is this a correct interpretation of the",82
102,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a misunderstanding of the green paper. The fundamental message of the green paper is that-and it is good news for this community-we can achieve a level of unemployment of five per cent by the year 2000. But to do so we must in achieve and sustain a high rate of economic growth of about 41{z to five per cent per the annum. That wO]Jld require, among other things, a continuation of low inflation and improving the quality of the labour supply. The job compact proposal is an essential mechanism in this process because it makes people more genuinely competitive for jobs by providing them with skills that are relevant a to the contemporary labour market and by of making them job ready in other ways. It would make the labour market more efficient and remove one of the speed limits on The consequences of this-and these are the relevant job figures as far as the impact of the was implementation of the green paper is con(in cerned-are that it is not talking about 50,000 new jobs, but 1.1 million by 1996-97 and 2.3 million by the year 2000. That correct interto pretation of the proposed job compact would a do two things: firstly, it would remove quickly the large bulge of long-term unemployed, of make the total unemployed pool more competitive and thereby help set the conditions for rapid and sustainable growth; secondly, it would solely in its own right put 250,000 long-term unemployed into jobs, reducing the to number of long-term unemployed from how this 340,000 to 90,000 by 1998 and creating a permanent addition of 50,000 jobs. The consequences of not doing the sorts of things, or some close variant of them, that the committee suggests would be that we would be facing levels of unemployment out to those years of seven to eight per cent. Instead of being effectively one per cent of a total unemployment rate of about five per cent, it would be more in the realm of three or four per cent. Of course, if there is a change in business cycle ultimately, as a result of the pressure of wage costs, that phalanx of long term unemployed would subsequently grow. Therefore, reports that the green paper suggests spending $2 billion for 50,000 jobs are entirely wrong. In total, the committee's options represent expenditure of up to $2 billion to secure 2.3 million new jobs and to ensure that a fair proportion of those jobs go to the long-term unemployed.

117,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It not only does all those things; it also provides rights and entitlements against unfair dismissal, and it guarantees parental leave for all Australian working men and women. The honourable member for Dunkley raised in his question the sorts of protections that would be available under this bill for all workers in Australia. me say that those protections will be there, as a result of this package, guaranteed for all Australian workers from 30 March next. What that means is that the shambles that currently exists in a number of the state systems-Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales-will be rectified. In Victoria last month under the deficient Victorian legislation we had to see emergency legislation rushed into the House so that the lowest paid workers were not deprived of the $8 flow on from the national wage decision, special legislation so that money could not be paid to any Victorian worker because of the draconian legislation forced through the Victorian parliament in March of this year. Only today, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission",84
118,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And look at the position today!,84
119,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite hate this. They hate and detest it-and we are as proud of it as can be. Mr Speaker, only today the Australian Industrial Relations Commission made orders to reinstate the traditional Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day holidays to Victorian workers-holiday entitlements that were abolished by the Kennett government earlier this year. Only yesterday, the Tasmanian industrial relations minister, John Beswick, was forced to admit that he will have to change its new industrial relations laws to provide for a complete review because the state's enterprise commissioner found that the new enterprise agreement laws could be disadvantageous to many workers. Tasmania will have to legislate its own package this year and change the existing legislation because it has been found to be deficient. In New South Wales, Minister Chikarovski has been forced to admit that in that state, after two years of enterprise bargaining-the system that abolished union representation and did not provide a no disadvantage test-it has been embraced by only 22,000 employees. The whole of the state of New South Wales, two years of operation and 22,000 workers-when you analyse that, it means that 90 per cent of workers are involved in Let agreements that have involved a union, while only 10 per cent have been non-union agreements. So much for reform under the conservative model; so much for the chaos. That last statistic contrasts very clearly with our system-a system that has seen more than 800,000 workers covered so far, with 1,350 agreements, with a whole lot more agreements to result from the package of legislation that has now been approved by the Senate. It is little wonder the recent poll found that the public of Australia believe that we are so much better at managing industrial relations than those opposite. Community Grants",84
120,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Given that the minister has been unable to account for her actions, and given the fact that she has misled the House, why has she not had the decency to resign, as one of her predecessors, John Brown, did under Bob Hawke?",84
121,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not misled the House. I have provided all the information to the Auditor-General. This is simply an attack on this program because the Leader of the Opposition hates this program. He was the one who promised to abolish it. In the lead-up to the last election he promised to abolish this program. He has never recognised the value of this program to the community. If members of this House were honest with themselves, they would stand up in this House and talk about the value of this program. Throughout the nation-in small towns and in cities-there have been great advantages from this program. It is about time that we acknowledged the positive aspects of it and stopped trying to hide this whole debate behind some disguise ..All the Leader of the Opposition really wants to do is abolish this program. He is not going to achieve that. Industrial Relations Legislation",84
122,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In light of the success of the government's industrial relations legislation, can the Prime Minister tell the House how these reforms will contribute to Australia's capacity to take full advantage of economic recovery and the historic GATT agreement?",85
123,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr SPEAKER Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",85
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister might just resume his seat. The honourable member for O'Connor-on a relevant point of order? Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, that is why I am getting my documents out, to read that point of order to you. Would you like me to commence with the one that says I have the right to ask the point of order?",85
125,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,85
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-'-Order! If you have a point of order, as I have said to you previously, you come to the dispatch box and state your point of order. I invite you to do so, but I also say to you, on this the second last day of sittings, to be very careful how you address the chair. What is your point of order? Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, the point of order relates to standing order 144. I have taken my point of order before the Prime Minister commences to speak because I am referring to the question. We have had advice from the Minister for Industrial Relations that the industrial relations legislation is to to this House. There can be no doubt therefore that this is a matter of a debate in the current session. I refer you to standing order 144 which in part states: Questions cannot refer to(a) debates in the current session ... The information being sought by the honourable member for Watson is clearly information that can be provided by the minister when that debate comes back here. The standing order is put there for the purpose of ensuring that question time is not wasted on this process. Of course, I am sure that the Prime Minister would be welcomed into the debate. I therefore make the point that the question is out of order.",85
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for drawing my attention to standing order 144 and the specifics of that matter. I might also point out that standing order 144 also states: Questions cannot refer to... (b) proceedings in committee not reported to the House. I would have thought that some of the questions directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories today went to issues of that nature. However, the specifics of the matter which has been raised have a degree of relevance, but the question from the honourable member for Watson was directed to the Prime Minister on areas which I am prepared to allow, with the proviso of course that those issues that you have traversed are not canvassed.",85
128,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said when I addressed the GATT round earlier that the government had opened Australia up so that its product markets could be more flexible, that the economy could respond to international competition and that we could see restructuring within the economy in response to the freedom and suppleness of those product markets. We have seen that in the context of building an open multilateral trading system. The same is true of the labour market. We want to see the labour market become more flexible. It was not just a question of aggregate wage flexibility but within-sector flexireturn bility in the labour market. We have seen tremendous pressure for change coming from the opening up of markets with the restructuring in Australia and the capacity of the labour market to respond to that change. We have seen it in the enterprise bargaining streamthe section 134 agreements-and we have now seen it in the very radical reforms introduced by my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations, which he has referred to, in the federal award area. Changes and flexibility under the federal award system and areas covered by the federal award system will see this sort of flexibility across the country. These are. the big issues of Australian public life; that is, getting the economy more supple, making the place operate in a context and this year-not just with industrial relations-building on those changes of the 1980s in the opening up of markets. The conclusion of the GATT round and APEC are designed not just to reduce border protection and enhance trade but also to facilitate trade through the development of APEC. In all these things-industrial relations, the GATT, APEC and the other big issue of our time, Mabo, in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians having a greater role in Australian society-the government sees a total model of the country as an inclusive place dealing with the rest of the world. Yesterday, of course, the full employment report was delivered to the government to make sure that those who are unemployed or are long-term unemployed will also participate in our society as we go through the 1990s. But this contrasts with the opposition which, basically, was spoiling on the budget, spoiling on Mabo and finishing the parliamentary year with a whimper on sports grantssports grants of all things-while the big issues of the day were the overnight conclusion of the GATT round for the whole international trading system and the report to the government on full employment and ways in which we can master it. What have we had from the opposition but whimpering questions, whimpering away at the end of the year, on sports grants. I do not doubt that the Leader of the Opposition needs the help of a psychologist. No doubt next year, on 21 January when he goes, there will be an interesting bunch of questions such as, 'Why have I no ideas? Why am I still obsessed with Fightback when all my colleagues want to abandon it? Why do I keep on predicting double dip recessions? Am I imagining things or does Bronwyn really want my job? Why am I obsessed with failure?'. He will need some big answers to these big questions because his finishing moments in question time for this year will leave those behind him to understand that this guy has not got a future. While all the big issues are on the table, where does he finish the parliamentary year? On sports grants. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",85
129,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. Mr SPEAKER.,-Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?",86
130,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do.",86
131,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,86
132,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In an article in the Canberra Times this morning, it was claimed that yesterday I arranged with the opposition to ask the first question of the day; that I denied being given the question; and that the opposition had given me access to the grant documents. These comments imply some kind of clandestine activity on my part and need clarification. I did not ask the opposition for the first question of the day. I did ask for a spot in the opposition question line-up and was subsequently offered the first question. Any suggestion that the question was given to me is not only totally wrong but also obviously has the effect of challenging my independence and integrity. No-one in the opposition line-up saw or had a copy of my question .. Furthermore, the reason that I sought opposition help in acquiring the grant documents is quite simple. When my staff rang the library, they were told that they should ring the office of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Our phone call to the minister's office in search of the documents was, however, not returned. I did what any honourable member would do. I rang someone.",86
133,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member for Wills is to show where he was misrepresented. Mr Reith-He is doing that.,86
134,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! I will adjudicate on that. He does not enter into a debate at this point. The honourable member for Wills will show where he has personally been misrepresented.,86
135,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The newspaper article implies that I was a tool of the Liberal Party and I am trying to explain to you, Mr Speaker, that my actions were totally independent.",87
136,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! You have just done that. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS,87

139,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMITTEES,"I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the government response to the list tabled in the House by the Speaker on 17 August 1993 concerning outstanding responses to parliamentary committee reports.

The issue was taken up by the Senate Privileges Committee. Relations between the Australian Securities Commission and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The Government has noted the report of the Joint Statutory committee for Corporations and Securities on 'Relations between the Australian Securities Commission, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions' (October 1992). The Government shares the concerns raised by the Joint Statutory Committee to ensure that the investigation and prosecution of serious corporate crime in Australia is dealt with appropriately. To ensure appropriate cooperation and collaboration between the ASC and DPP in the prosecution of corporate crime the former Attorney-General, the Hon Michael Duffy MP, issued on 30 September 1992 a direction to the ASC under s.12 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 and the DPP under section 8 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983. That Direction, which is still in place, set out guidelines for cooperation and collaboration between the ASC and the DPP in the investigation and prosecution of corporate crime. A National Steering Committee on Corporate Wrongdoing (the 'Committee') was also established under the Direction. That Committee consists of the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, who is the Convenor, the Chairman of the ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Committee is required to meet not less than quarterly and is to convene at the earliest practicable time to resolve any dispute that, in the opinion of the Convenor, appears to require immediate consideration. The Committee is required to provide a report annually to the Attorney-General regarding the activities of the Committee. The Committee has met regularly. No dispute has arisen for resolution by the Committee. As the Joint Statutory Committee has made no recommendations in its report, the Government is satisfied that appropriate action has been taken and will not be responding further to this report. Close Corporations Act 1975. On 14 July 1993 the Attorney-General wrote to the Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee, expressing his view that the development of a new corporate structure specifically tailored to the needs of small business would have significant advantages. The letter also stated that in view of the important and wide ranging recommendations made by the Committee, the Attorney-General proposed to seek the views of interested organisations concerning these detailed proposals. In July 1993 the Attorney-General released a discussion paper seeking public submissions concerning the detailed proposals made by the Committee. A broad range of responses to the discussion paper has been received, and the Government wishes to examine and analyse these submissions prior to formulating a response to the Committee regarding appropriate corporate structures for small business.

Tourism and the Export Market Development Grants Scheme: undersold overseas. The Government's consideration of the recommendations of the report of the Parliamentary Inquiry into the application of the EMDG scheme to the tourism industry has been overtaken by an evaluation of the entire EMDG scheme and the International Trade Enhancement Scheme. The current legislative basis for the EMDG scheme is scheduled to terminate in June 1995. Given the value of the scheme to exporters, the Government is exploring options to extend its legislative basis and to improve its effectiveness and efficiency. An evaluation team, presently drawn from Austrade and overseen by a Steering Committee, with members from Commonwealth Departments, industry and the ACTU, and will report by the end of March 1994.

MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",88
140,Mr COSTELLO,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Higgins) (3.06 p.m.)I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Higgins moving forthwith that this House censures the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories for misleading this House and for failing to account for the administration Community Cultural, Recreational and Sporting Facilities Program.",92
141,Mr SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"The government is going to facilitate that. We will proceed to suspend the standing orders and then you can move . your motion directly. Is the motion seconded? Mr Ronaldson-I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative, with an absolute majority. Motion of Censure",92
142,Mr COSTELLO,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Higgins) (3.07 p.m.)I move: That this House censures the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories for misleading this House and for failing to account for the administration of the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. Mr Speaker, it is now a monthMr Chynoweth- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to page 495 of House of Representatives Practice under the heading 'Unreported committee evidence'. It states: Members may not disclose in debate evidence taken by any committee of the House or the proceedings and reports of those committees which have not been reported to the House, unless disclosure or publication has been authorised by the House or, pursuant to the Parliamentary Papers Act, by the committee. Members ... basing statements on matters disclosed to the committee. However, Members have, from time to time, made statements on the activities of a committee by leave of the House. I believe this debate will touch on a committee which is in progress-it begins again at 3.30 p.m. I would like you to rule on this point of order.",92
143,Mr SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"The honourable member for Dunkley has raised rightly the section in House of Representatives Practice, page 495, which in fact is based on standing order 340 Orders about evidence not to be disclosed. However, I have to say that I would find it extremely difficult-in fact, it is impossible-for me to rule in the manner in which I am sure the honourable member for Dunkley is suggesting for the reason that the hearing which was held this morning in fact was carried throughout the entire building on the house monitoring of the service and has been open to all people who have access to that hearing, including the media. I think it would be somewhat ludicrous to suggest that this matter should be in some way sub judice. In that particular regard, therefore, I would have to say that proceedings from this morning, if referred to in debate today, will be allowed.",92
144,Mr COSTELLO,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"What a pathetic attempt to try to prevent this House from discussing and considering one of the most serious motions that can ever be moved against a minister. What a pathetic defence from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who, in his last answer in question time, got on to trivial issues like what is going to happen on seminars in January in defence of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) who is facing one of the most serious allegations that can ever be made against her. What a damning indictment of the Prime Minister to stand up and say that he does not consider it important whether or not a minister has misled the House. He does not consider it important whether or not a minister can account for $30 million worth of taxpayers' money. He apparently does not consider it important that an Auditor-General can so damn and indict a minister as to her administration in relation to a program. He apparently does not consider it important that this government has no standards when it comes to ministerial accountability. One thing is patently clear, as a result of the proceedings that have taken place in this House over the last month. This is a minister who misled this parliament, and this is a minister who must resign. The Prime Minister must stand this minister down, or forever wear the stain of shame that he was the one who undermined one of the most .sacrosanct principles of Westminster parliamentary democracy; the principle that a minister must account to the parliament; the principle that above all else a minister must never mislead the parliament. If this Prime Minister cannot find his way clear to stand this minister down for whatever reason, it wil1 be the low water mark of ministerial responsibility in this country. It wil1 mean that ministers are above reproach for their conduct and actions in this House. Ministerial accountability will not have dived under the Prime Minister, but it wiH have sunk. It wi1l become the new low water mark which gives a green light from here on into ministers that they can, in order to obfuscate and to hide, mislead this parliament and do it with impunity. Let us make this absolutely clear: this stench goes right to the door of the Prime Minister. If this minister wiH not take responseats. sibility, the Prime Minister should, and he will wear the stain of shame of the Kelly fiasco for the rest of his prime ministership. In front of the Australian people he wi1l wear the stain that it wiH be permissible on simple matters of fact to mislead this House. If it ever becomes permissible on simple matters of fact to mislead this House, then this House has no purpose in relation to questioning ministers. Mr Sharp-A sham.",92
145,Mr COSTELLO,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"It is a sham. It has no role in relation to accountability. It has no purpose in being able to elicit facts on behalf of the people of Australia. I make this clear: if the Prime Minister destroys ministerial accountability in this parliament, he destroys accountability to the people of Australia. He destroys accountability to therri through this parliament. The 1976 report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration as quoted at page 88 of House of Representatives Practice says: In cases where the minister has misled parliament, condoned or authorized a blatantly unreasonable use of executive power, or more vaguely, where the minister's behaviour contravenes established standards of morality, resignation or dismissal is the appropriate action. In these cases, the factors which may often excuse the minister from blame for administrative blunders do not operate to the same degree: the minister's personal responsibility may be more easily isolated. The background to this matter is a report of the Auditor-General, an independent statutory officer, to this parliament of matters that he found in relation to this minister's administration. He found that this minister had, in a threemonth period on the eve of the 1993 election, personally al10cated nearly $30 million of only taxpayers' money; not only had the minister allocated it, but she had personally selected 726 out of 2,800 applications for that money. She authorised expenditure outside categorisations of those that were warranted and deserving by her department. She authorised expenditure which gave Labor marginal seats $326,000 on average compared with an average of $163,000 for coalition marginal The Auditor-General went into look at this program, quite prepared to clear this minister of political bias-but he was unable to do so. He was unable to make such a finding. He said: . "" proper documentation of the reasons for decisions would be able to satisfy any questions concerning the selection of approved grants. At the present time documentation is simply not available to answer such questions. He was prepared to look at the documentation. to see why the minister made these decisions outside the categorisation; to see why the minister made these decisions that just happened to favour the Labor Party on the eve of the election. He was prepared to clear the minister, but there was no documentation on the decisions, and therefore no line of defence. Indeed, as the Auditor-General said himself, it is only in a minister's best interests to provide such documentation because it is the first line of defence for a minister in these circumstances. He said that it is only proper that there be an audit trail because it is the first line of accountability for ministers in these circumstances. So the critical question in this House became: if the Auditor-General could not find such documentation, where was the documentation and what documentation did this minister have? We know from the department that she had only rudimentary documentation. We know that she went outside the department looking to other sources to try to help her in her decision making. But when the Auditor-General asked, 'What documentation did you actually have for you to personally make these decisions?', the only thing she could come back with was a list of grants approved, by seats. Even that-the only documentation that she was able to provide'-is more than revealing. If we look at the documentation the minister had prepared in her office on the grants she made to the ACT, we see that it is actually in the fonn of a memo. The memo is to Phil Ruff-he was in the department-from Steve Whan, who was in the minister's office, The heading is: ACf GRANTS AS APPROVED BY ROS, TO BE ANNOUNCED TOMORROW (Wednesday) AT IPM-Could I get the descriptions by then??? She had actually approved the grants and was getting her office to go back to the department to give the descriptions of what she had actually approved. That was the documentation that existed in her office. Of course, we knew that there was other documentation. We knew that there was other documentation because this minister had faxed, out of her office, a document to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). The document set out the proposals that were in his electorate of Gellibrand. It c1assi fied the electorate as ALP and as safe Labor. We have a situation where the Auditor General has said that there is no documentation to explain the minister's decision making basis and, therefore, that there is no documenweek'. tation to explain whether or not there was political bias. We are looking for the documentation and we are asking the minister about that documentation. The minister came into this place and said, 'There is me to table any documentation, there is no need for me to explain, because every document that I had has been given to the Auditor General. Therefore, if there had been anything in any of those documents that would have conclusively proved this case against me, the Auditor-General would have reported it'. That was her defence. She said, 'I have given everything to the Auditor-General, therefore I don't have to give it to you and therefore I don't have to table it in the parliament'. It was absolutely critical that there was a document in existence-I do not believe it was the only one; I think it was one of a class that had not been given to the Auditor General-that had not been given to the Auditor-General. The absolute significance of that was that the Auditor-General had been looking for documentation, this parliament had been looking for documentation, this minister had been asked for documentation and this documentation had come into the possession of the opposition because there had been a mis-fax-and the minister was being asked what actually happened. When she was asked that, she came into this parliament on 23 November and gave an ironclad, guaranteed answer in relation to the question of documentation. She said: As r have said every day in this parliament for the last week, all the records intelation to this matter have been referred to the Auditor-General. He has had access to all of them. He has had access to every single document that is available. Mr Atkinson-That is not true.",93
146,Mr COSTELLO,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"That is not true. The Auditor-General had not had access to that fax of 20 February 1992. That answer misled, lead astray, caused to go wrong, and gave the wrong impression. There is no question that that answer was misleading. It was not something that was absolutely accidental. She was reaffinning to this House, 'As I have said every day in this parliament for the last That is what she told this House. Anybody who read that answer would have assumed that she had given all documents-as she said, every single one-to the Auditor General. That is not true. The minister misled no need for parliament. She must go. She has come along today and said, 'If you notice the interesting slide'. The interesting slide was from all documents she had given back on 23 November; then it became all applications she had given; and today it was all information that she had given. Today the minister even walked away from her own statement in this parliament. There would be no clearer evidence that she knew she misled the parliament in relation to that answer than the fact that she walked away from herself today in question time. She cannot use the justification, 'Even though I did not say it, I was only giving documents that related to round 4'. She cannot use that defence because, as she well knows, the Auditor-General was not just looking at round 4 of grants under these applications but looking at the whole of the program. Even yesterday she knew that, because it was raised in this parliament yesterday that he had reported on how there had been doubling up between round 3 and round 4. He was looking at the whole program. He wanted documents in relation to the whole program. He was giving case studies of projects that had got grants under round 3 and round 4. There is another reason why the minister cannot come in and say, 'I accidentally misled the House because I was only talking about round 4'. She was given the opportunity on Monday of this week to take that very defence. On Monday of this week, I sought to table that fax in the parliament. I asked her why it was that it had not been given to the Auditor-General. She could have come in here and said, 'Because I was only giving him round 4 and not round 3' .. She did not do that. She did not take advantage of that defence when she was given the perfect opportunity to do so on Monday, 13 December. Indeed, she was still maintaining on Monday that all of the documents had been given over. She maintained it in relation to a question that was put to her by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). She said, 'I did not withhold; the Auditor-General had total access'. That was the picture that she was drawing on Monday of this week. To come in here now and say 'Look, even though I didn't say it, what I must have meant was that I was only talking about round 4 and not round 3' falls into one very simple category: it is recent invention-it is invention after the fact. The minister cannot take that defence either. The reason she cannot take that defence is that it opens up an even bigger hole. If she is saying, 'I only gave him documents that related to round 4', the critical question becomes: where are all the documents relating to round 3? If that is her defence and she says that she only gave the Auditor-General documents relating to round 4 because she thought he only wanted documents relating to round 4, there is one way she can prove it. She can come into this House with all of the documents relating to round 3 and show how she withheld them because she misunderstood his question. We put that question as well to the minister in question time today: did she have any other such documents relating to round 3? Where are they? And where are the replies? If she wants to maintain that there was some ironclad, Chinese wall between round 3 and round 4, she had better come down with all of the documents relating to round 3 as well. But I do not think she wants to come down with those documents because they are the damning documents that would show that she was classifying seats all along, with the Labor members of parliament, according to their electoral status. . The thing that she was really concerned about in this use of taxpayers' money, in dishing out $29.5 million in three months, was to make sure that it got to the sensitive areas before the election. On that point was her one success in relation to this program. That was the only thing that she actually succeeded in doing. The Labor candidates did not let her down. They were out there campaigning for votes on the basis of how beneficent the government had been in relation to their electorates. They were putting out broadsheets and leaflets boasting about how the government had been so benign in relation to their electorates. That was the purpose. That was why the department was not involved. When she asked the department to classify by seats and the department said, 'Put the request in writing', she refused to do so. She did not want to leave an audit trail. She did not want to make it possible for this Auditor-General to find the evidence that was going to show how grossly she had misused funds. She can run but she cannot hide. It was bad enough that the minister maladministered in this way. Butwhat is absolutely unforgivable is that she has tried ever since cover up in this House what she actually did. This report came down one month ago. She has had nine sitting days in parliament to come in with explanations. She has had every day in this parliament to say what actually happened to that fax, but she has never ever once said what happened to it. In the explanation she gave today she indicated that she has said 5,000 times what happened to it. But she has never ever once told this House where that fax actually is, whether there are any like it, whether she got replies, whether she entreated all the Labor members. She has never ever once accounted for that document. The only thing she has said, on 23 November, is that she gave all the documents to the Auditor-General. That was plainly false and she misled this parliament. There were administrative faults in relation to this scheme. The department concedes that. There was a refusal to create an audit trail. The minister took the responsibility. The decisions were made personally. She decided to do that. She cannot hide behind the department. The minister misled this House and she has refused to come clean. She has not had the decency to resign, and now she must be sacked. She is not fit to be a minister of the Crown in this country.",94
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Mr Jenkins)Order! Is the motion seconded? Mr Ronaldson-I second the motion, and reserve my right to speak.",96
148,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"The opposition has been attempting to run on this issue for one whole month. At the beginning of this debate I made it clear-and I will make it clear again-that I accept many of the Auditor-General's constructive recommendations for improving the administration of this program. However, today the Auditor General confirmed, as he did in his report, that he did not find political bias in this program. Despite all the efforts of members of the opposition in parliament over the last few weeks, despite their wandering around the country pretending to be Sherlock Holmes and trying to dredge up scandals-in fact, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) to even advertised in his local paper to try to find unhappy applicants-they have failed to find any political bias. Every single case that they have brought up has been answered. Even as late as yesterday, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) raised an issue abouta grant awarded to the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese in Melbourne. He asked why it was, when there were several parishes in his electorate, that this facility went to the Coburg parish. The honourable member, not surprisingly, did not dispute the fact that this was an area of very high need, or that it had a very high ethnic population, and therefore met the grant criteria. The honourable member for Wills is correct in saying that there are four parishes in the Wills electorate-Coburg, Brunswick, Fawkner and Moonee Ponds. However, that seems to be where his knowledge of the electorate ends. He does not seem to know that the other three parishes already have this type of centre. Apparently the gentleman he referred to, Mr Kardamitsis, works for the Greek Welfare Association and is indeed based near the new centre. However, the application for this centre was submitted by the Greek Orthodox Church of Australia and was signed by the appropriate bishop. I received a letter this morning from the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia. This point illustrates once again that, every time those opposite raise one of these issues, there is an answer. They have not proved, in any way, political bias. First of all, let me tell honourable members what the bishop says: I would like to inform you that the other three parishes in the electorate of Wills, already have a community centre. He goes on to say: ... the building of the centre itself is not for the sole uses of the need of the Greek speaking community, but as emphasised in the Parish Committee's communications with local authorities, the Coburg Council, it will be open for the use and utilised by the overall community of Coburg, Northern Suburbs. The bishop said: We are gravely concerned and disturbed by Mr Cleary's unwelcome comments on this matter because we are not the only church getting grants and we consider this attack as discriminatory. The bishop obviously believes that this is a priority area for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia. It does seem that the honourable member for Wills now has quite a bit of explaining to do over his reflections on this church. The thing that disappoints me is that the honourable member has joined the coalition in parroting this offensive notion that an organisation should be excluded from government support if it has a board member-or now, apparently, a worker-with some political affiliation.",96
149,Mr FILING,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,A twice-failed candidate.,97
150,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"That is irrelevant. The point of this debate is that an accusation was made; and it has been proven that this is an area of great need that got a grant. Every time this matter has been raised, it has been answered. Mr Costello-Where are the documents?",97
151,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"The honourable member for Higgins made allegations the other day about the North Melbourne Football Club social club. Then he made allegations about the ACT Touch Football Association. In both cases, as I pointed out last Monday, they were embarrassingly wrong. Mr Costello-They were quite right.",97
152,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,They were not right. Mr Costello-Are you the patron of the Australian Touch Football Association?,97
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Higgins has made his contribution to this debate. He will sit in silence.,97
154,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,He is right on this point. I am the national patron-but guess who is the ACT patron? It is Senator Margaret Reid. Guess who got the grant? It was the ACT. Guess who sent them the application form? Did I? I did not. It was Senator Margaret Reid. Guess who told the ACT section that it in the would be a good idea to apply? It was Senator Margaret Reid. Mr Beazley interjecting Mr Costello-She admitted she was the patron.,97
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order! The honourable member for Higgins and the Leader of the House will cease interjecting across the table.,97
156,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,We have also seen odd oneline claims by members of the opposition. At one stage the opposition sports spokesman wondered whyMr Ronaldson-Who?,97
157,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"One may well ask. He wondered why an organisation in Queensland had not been given a grant. He forgot to say that those people had not even applied for the grant. Honourable members may remember that at the end of the last sitting period the honourable member for Higgins promised to have one revelation per day. In the two weeks since he said that he has managed three allegations, all of which have been unsubstantiated and unsustainable. He could not make any claims about the program. Questions he has raised about every single grant have been answered; and it has proven that the areas were in need. . He had to find some other tack. He decided to take up the issue of the so-called Willis fax. He has made a number of unsubstantiated and misleading claims about this fax. I made it clear from the start that my department and I have, at all times, been willing to provide any and all information requested by the Auditor-General. Any request for information during the audit was complied with. In the course of his review the auditor asked my department for information on the decision making processes on this program. Mr Costello-No, he asked for documents.",97
158,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. Standing order No. 78 requires that a speaker on his or her feet be heard in silence.",97
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order! I remind all honourable members that they should allow this important debate to proceed in relative silence. There is too much discussion which is not to the matter in this chamber.,97
160,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"On 31 May 1993, the auditor wrote to me infonning me that he was conducting an audit into the programs and asking me questions on the process for approving applications. His letter specifically mentioned the round of grants for which applications closed on 3 September 1992; that is, round 4. The auditor confinned this morning during the parliamentary committee hearing that he was looking at round 4 and that that the fax in question concerned round 3 of the program. In my response to this correspondence I pointed out a number of criteria which I took account of. I have repeated them in the House many times. Later the auditor wrote to me again, saying: Your letter has helped us better understand the process for selecting applications for approval. He then went on to request documentation which showed the justification for approving one application but not another. In my response I confinned the advice from the department that copies of records held in my office were available on departmental files. However, I did provide via my department a rough list of the grants broken up by electorates which was compiled in response to inquiries about successful grants from members of parliament from both sides of the House. Once again, the Auditor confinned this morning that he did not think it was particularly unusual to put these into electorates. The House should note that at all times any request for information, be it general or specific, was complied with. The fax referred to by the honourable member for Higgins was one that was made public in February 1992. The information on the fax was an extract of the list of summaries of applications for grants for round 3 of the program. The full list of this information was made available to the Auditor via the departmental list. The Auditor confinned this in the parliamentary committee hearing this morning. He also added that he did not think it was unusual to link grants with electorates. More importantly, when he was asked about the fax, he said: I don't know that it is that important. It is quite clear that the fax was on the public record. It was reported by the media in 1992 following a press release from Senator Warwick Parer and it was the subject of discussion in Senate estimates in April 1992. But to really get to the point of misleading, I think we ought to refer to the article in the Canberra TImes, as I did in question time, on 14 December. Mr Costello-Ha, ha.",98
161,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"The honourable member laughs, but what he has attempted to do is to involve a statutory office holder, someone who has the confidence of this parliament, in a political exercise. That is what he has attempted to do. The Auditor confinned this morning that he had a number of conversations with the honourable member for Higgins. However, as I said earlier in question time, he has directly repudiated some of the statements the honourable member for Higgins has made regarding their conversations. So who is the person who has been misleading? This is the man who got into the Canberra TImes, who made statements involving the Auditor-General, claiming the Auditor-General had said certain things, and the Auditor-General this morning said that was not true. One of the things that does seem to be true, however, is the claim by the honourable member for Higgins that the Willis fax had been given to the Auditor-General in 1992 after it was drawn to the attention of a Senate estimates committee. It was quite clear that this fax was on the public record and it is indeed reported that the Auditor had the fax. And guess what? It was even in the parliamentary library. As I have already said, the Auditor had access to all the information contained in the fax. I did not withhold any information. I made all information relevant to the decision making processes available to the Auditor. I stand by my previous comments to the parliament-and I quote: ... the Auditor-General had access to all the files that were in my department and had access to the material in my office. Included in that material is the list of all the applications of all the grants throughout the whole country, not just those in the electorate of the honourable member for Gellibrand, but in every other single electorate in Australia. My comments and my actions have been entirely consistent with the statement. I made on 23 November when I stated: ... all the records in relation to this matter have been referred to the Auditor-General. He has had access to all of them. He has had access to every single document that is available. The parliamentary committee hearing this morning has confirmed the.advice that I have previously given to the Auditor and to parliament. Opposition members have also made many other false points about this report and this program. They have claimed that my categorisation had no influence when it is clear that if the department put a grant into category one it had a much better chance of success than if it was categorised in category three. They have also made false claims about the maximum amount. One of the other things those opposite forgot to take into consideration is the number of applications. The shadow finance spokesman, the honourable member for Higgins, is very fond of quoting the electorate of McPherson. MCPherson, he points out, is part of the fastest growing area in Australia. He is correct on that, and on a number of other criteria. On the face of it, it seems unfair that there were no successful grants in the electorate. However, he has forgotten one important factor: groups have to apply before they can be awarded grants. In MCPherson only one application was received-the average per electorate was 20; in some cases it was over 70-and unfortunately that application was not of a very high standard. Clearly this is all a smokescreen for the very fact that honourable members opposite hate this scheme and do not want it. They stated quite clearly in the lead-up to the election that they would not support it and that they would abolish it. Why do they not face up to the fact that that is really what this is about? (Time expired)",98
162,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Ballarat) (3.41 p.m.)I am afraid that that has not in any way extracted the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) from this great, deep hole that she has dug for herself. If she had bothered to go to that examination this morning, she would have found out the one thing that the Auditor-General did not say. The one thing he did not say was that there was not political bias involved in this. What he did say, and what he has been saying all the way through, is that he is unable to say whether or not there was political bias. The Auditor-General can say that there was no documentation at all to establish the minister's claim. What he was able to say was-guess what?-that Labor marginals got double coalition marginal allocations. That is what he could say. It is pointless for the minister to run around this country telling the gallery that the Auditor-General is supporting her. The Auditor-General quite simply is not supporting her because he is unable to say whether or not there was political bias involved. If this electorate business is not such a big deal-the minister might just listen for a second; she might actually learn something-I ask why the Auditor-General put this in his report: 2.19 The fact that in the latest round of approvals the Minister's office asked for details of the electorates in which the applications were located but was not prepared to put its request in writing when asked to do so by the Department, willy nilly can only lead to speculation about the basis for the selection process. The Department of the Environment, Sport arid Territories obviously thought that the categorisation of electorates was a matter of importance, but the minister today is saying that it was not. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-the emperor-was muttering away during question time today about the big issues. Over the last month there have been many meetings around the emperor's table. These meetings have occurred because the minister has severely embarrassed this government. The government's own polling is telling it exactly what our polling is telling us: this issue has done the government enormous damage. Its credibility is kaput, and the minister is dragging this government down into the mire. When we ask people out there what is going on, they talk about election promises and they talk about the honesty of this government. The minister has dragged the government down. We have got Laurie and Punchie sitting around there. Griffo-the emperor's eunuch-has been sitting there having a bit of a chat about the whole thing. At the end of the day what they will say is",99
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their titles.,100
164,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"I withdraw that. They will say, 'We 'have to stick this one out because of the embarrassment it will caustf if we get rid of her'. Being part of the royal family will not save her. The minister has misled the House in relation to two issues-the second one being the matter of the $250,000. Despite the blusterings of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), who was trying to force his way into the hearing of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts this morning, we were able to produce some evidence. Part of that evidence was the Auditor-General's department saying that it knew nothing about this $250,000-not one single thing. The minister again misled this House in a press release issued last night by saying that her department had told the Auditor-General about it. The simple fact is that her department had not told the Auditor-General. So she has now misled this House in relation to two very serious matters. I refer the House to the project guidelines for 1991-92 and 1992-93. In relation to the $250,000, the guidelines do not talk about 'round'; they talk about 'project'. The $250,000 is per project. The minister is trying to run away from that, saying, 'It is for separate programs'. I invite honourable members to guess the completion date for projects under the 1991-92 and 1992-93 guidelines - two different application rounds. It is 31 May 1994 for both .Iots of applications. The minister, therefore, cannot come into this House and talk about there being two different rounds and the applications not being eligible. The other interesting thing is that as far back as 1992 the minister knew when this program was going to finish. She knew it was going to finish after the election, otherwise why would she allow a couple of years to complete the 1992 round but only about 12 months to complete the 1993 round? She knew that this program would be finished after the election. This program was only a con by which to put $30 million into the electorate prior to the last election. The minister has come into this House and accused members on this side of not supporting the program, of hating it and regarding it a conspiracy. But the minister heard one of the members of the coalition giving her views about it to the committee this morning. It is the minister who has finished this program. Not one sporting club in Australia can put in an application for a grant now-but I can tell the House when they will be able to do it. They will be able to do it in the application round that the minister mysteriously pulls out of the budget process in the run-up to the next election. The minister had no intention of continuing with this program after the preelection",100
165,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Wanna bet?,100
166,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Then when is it starting up again?,100
167,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Just wait.,100
168,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,The minister will not tell us because she is waiting for the Auditor General's booklet on how to run a program properly. Mr Costello-She won't be here.,100
169,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"She should not be here, but she probably will be because the royal family will keep her here. I am pleased that the minister has made this admission because we can. now tell Australians that she has another program ready to run; they only have to sit back and wait until the next election comes around and it will spring up. The minister's admission that she does know when the next program will be is probably the most damning comment that she has made to date. It tells us that program was always going to he a great political con. If the minister had bothered to· read the information, she would know that the Auditor-General, in answer to a question from the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), said today that she never advised him it was $250,000 per round. An officer from the Auditor-General's department was also asked whether the minister's department had raised that matter. Neither the department nor the minister had told the Auditor-General that it was $250,000 per round. The case studies quite specifically make two references to grants over $250,000. Do you know what the department said about that? The department did not say, 'Listen, hold on, mister, it is $250,000 per round not per project?'. Do you know what the department said about the case studies- 'Unhelpful'. 00 you know whom that was unhelpful to? It was unhelpful to the minister; the minister who. has misled this parliament even again today. 1 just cannot believe. her gall. She knows very well what the Auditor General said today, but she has the gall to come back here again and say that the Auditor-General's department had been advised when she knew very we)) that it had not been. Let us go through some of the evidence given today by the Auditor-General. Firstly, though, I might refer to the letter that the Minister has pulled out. Is it not extraordinary that we have suddenly got a letter dated 15 December from Stu-rt Hamilton, the office of the secretary, regarding the $250,000 funding grant? This letter is a very special document. Guess why? It has not been through the shredder. That is terrific! We now have two documents-one regarding Mr Willis and this one. So two documents have not been shredded. I suppose if we went through until Christmas we might even get another two or three documents. We might be lucky. The Auditor-General said today: We can't put an end to speculation that there was political bias. It is important to nip in the bud allegations about political bias, but we're unable do so. The lack of documentation meant a lack of justification for the decisions. It is the applicationsnow this is the really crucial matterin category 1 that weren't approved that intrigued us. These are the applications that had everything right; the ones that met all the criteria. The Auditor-General said that he was interested in those that were not approved. Do honourable members know why? Because he knows damn well that grants were given to organisations without football clubs or grounds. In the electorate of the honourable member for Watson-and this is an absolute doozey$250,000 was given to the Hurstville council in 1991. Do honourable members know what has happened with that project? The planning appeal provisions were opened up two nights ago. The council has not approved the project. They do not have finn commitments for funding from anyone else. Mr Costel\o-They should have a bike track.",100
170,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"That is right. There are a lot of objectors to this project. When the project is up and running, they want to call it the Leo MCLeay aquatic and bicycle testing centre. Do you know why? Because every single person remembers one thing about the honourable member for Watson: he ripped $70,000 out of Australian taxpayers for a so called crook elbow. They also have evidence of a former minister's wife who scalded her hands. The simple fact is that this matter has been of enormous significance to the minister, and she knows exactly why it is significant. We will go through a bit more of the evidence: The department may have been prepared to put up applications in a methodical way but this did not happen. Why not? Because it was all done through the minister's office. The Auditor-General went to great lengths today-and members of the committee here will confinn it-to say that never in his experience in the Public Service had he ever seen such hands-on contact by a minister. He said in evidence this morning to that most ministers he had ever worked for were extremely reluctant ever to have that extent of hands-on contact, for this reason: they would leave themselves wide open to allegations of bias and political abuse of the process. And that has happened. Guess what else was said? They said: The set of working papers we would have liked to have seen were ,the ones in the minister's offi-e. The only set of working papers the department has seen from the minister's office has on the top, 'Gellibrand, Ralph WiIIis ALP: safe Labor'. Mr Costello-They didn't even see that one. , Mr RONALDSON-That is right; they did not even see that. That fact was confirmed today. The minister cannot be seriously telling the House that the only fax she sent in relation to this program was the one sent to the honourable member for Gellibrand. She cannot be seriously saying that., If she is not seriously saying that, which I do not think she is, why is it that the public record that she so proudly talks about does not give any' evidence of similar faxes being sent to anyone else in Australia-not on our side of the House and not on her side of the House? The minister has misled this parliament. She has done so for the last month and she has the gall to mislelld the parliament again today. She brazenly stood up here and told this House that the Auditor-General has been made aware by her and her department about the $250,000 per round. She has quite blatantly'misled the House in the manner very eloquently portrayed by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) today. She does not deserve to remain a minister in this House. She is an embarrassment to this goveTlJment. She is a constant source of embarrassment to the sporting community, which has known for a long time that this is a phoney program. She has misled the House and she must resign.",101
171,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"-:-The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) will not resign, nor does she need to. The opposition has established nothing in its prattling through this House over the last month or so. The extent to which the opposition has nothing in this matter is being revealed regularly as the Auditor-General and others present evidence before that committee. Opposition members have complained from time to time, in debates, when they have had an opportunity to debate this matter, and in questions, but they contradict themselves by their own performance in relation to the minister at the times the grants were being awarded. They have no courage at all to come into this place and admit that they were engaged extensively in lobbying for the program; that they believed the program was capable of suiting very well the interests of people in their electorates who needed sporting facilities; and that they inveigled, as the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), the previous speaker, did, the minister to upgrade certain projects awarded category 3 in their electorates to a category 1 status. If any of those projects were, upgraded by the minister at that time, from that act alone opposition members could have their explanation on why some grants, which were assessed by the department as category 3, appeared in category 1. When the Auditor-General appeared before the committee this morning, he made it absolutely clear that h- made no allegation of political bias. He made it absolutely clear that no allegation of political bias was made. As he is the person who is obliged in the processes that have been referred to here to establish a prima facie case, the fact that he is prepared to say that he neither found evidence of bias nor was prepared to say he established a prima facie case for it must have some,regard paid to it in a censure debate in this chamber on whether or not the minister for the environment has, anything to answer for. As the honourable member for Ballarat rightly pointed out, the proceedings were on the box, and there were occasions for honourable members to look at it in the course of the morning. I could see quite clearly from the Auditor-General's demeanour that he was embarrassed by the efforts of opposition members to put him in the position of prosecutor; embarrassed by their efforts to claim from him things that he allegedly said; embarrassed by their public claims and their lies when they went out in public and made statements about the fact that they had started him running down the road for an inquiry in this regard and that he had been responding to the fax that is constantly being waived around in this chamber. When the Auditor-General was invited to confinn these statements made on the public record by Sancho Panza who moved this motion, he stepped right back from those propositions. He has been walking awayindeed, conducting himself, I would say, at a decent jog-from the suggestions that are being made by the opposition in regard to the administration of this particular element. I will be particularly interested to hear what the Auditor-General has to say about the performance of those opposite in this place now that he has had an opportunity to actually place himself on the public record again in light of the matters raised by those opposite. Those opposite sought to convince us that there were three things which, in their minds, should cause the minister for the environment to be censured. One was the question of that fax and the information contained in it. Another that they invited us to contemplate was the $250,000 limit. This was their second area of concern which they believed should cause the minister for the environment to be censured. Turning to the first point, when we actually sit down and take it look at that fax, what does it entail? It entails a simple statement the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) of applications made in his constituency. It is not a document which plots, connives or in some way or another inveigles him to put forward some applications. Obviously somebody in his office asked for some information on what was actually going to be made available or who had actually applied for grants in his electorate-a common sense proposition. The second element is that at the same time as those opposite are standing up in this place and alleging that the Auditor-General does not have this document, they are wandering around in public saying, 'We gave this document to the Auditor-General, and the Auditor-. General used it as the basis of his inquiry'. The Auditor-General is supposed not to have this document according to these geniuses opposite. Of course, we know that that proposition is· a lie because the Auditor-General told us that it was a lie. As far as he was concerned, it did not actually get to the point of being a matter that he needed to look at. Not only did he receive the document aIlegedly from an opposition source-those opposite lied and said that that had caused him to conduct the operation-but also the second proposition is that somehow or other this document was teased out surreptitiously. It was tabled in parliament, it was part of an inquiry process in the Senate. It is recorded in the parliamentary library. I remember the case of a predecessor in the state seat of Kalgoorlie who was invited to go down to Perth to find out why the beer prices in Kalgoorlie were rising. He went to Perth, talked to everybody concerned, came back to Kalgoorlie and reported that never was alcohol so anonymous. Never has a document that is allegedly not in the possession of the Auditor-General found its way to him by so many blinking channels as this particular document. What did the Auditor-General have to say about this devastating document.when he was finally questioned about it by the parliamentary committee? He said, 'Oh, I don't think it really means very much. I'm not particularly to interested in this. It doesn't actually add to the sum total of human knowledge about this particular problem. We're not particularly concerned about this'. But is that not such a typical attribute of Sancho Panza to the vain knight palely loitering that he should labour so mightily to produce such a mouse? Those opposite then say, 'There was sometimes an organisation that was awarded more than $250,000. Maybe that was against the guidelines. Ah-ha. Perhaps the Auditor-General did not know about that'. Let me quote again the secretary to the department, who said: This issue was not the subject of a fonnal recommendation by ANAO and consequently it was not dealt with in our comments on the draft report. However, officers of the Department explained to the auditors during the course of the audit how this aspect operated. The Auditor-General was, on the advice of the secretary to the department, advised repeatedly by the department as to how that element of the proposition operated and how it was possible for people to enter into a couple of different rounds of the one project and receive $250,000 on each occasion. So the gigantic mine that is supposed to have been thrown across the path of the minister for her to put her foot on is yet another damp squib. Not only did she put her foot on it and crush it, but also the secretary to her ment more than adequately crushed it ill the context of this debate. Those opposite have laboured mightily to produce a totaJIy damp squib in this area. Mr Downer interjectingMrs Crosio interjecting",102
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Mayo and the honourable member for Prospect will not have a private debate across the table.,104
173,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Listen here, some people think you are in this House under false pretences and we actually have to be very careful about having you around. I tum now to the proposition that the opposition is really complaining about, and that is the notion that greater amounts of this money ended up in marginal seats held by the Labor Party as opposed to marginal seats held by opposition members. When we move away from the aggregates and look at the individual cases.we see a vast array of difference. Some opposition held marginal seats received a great deal of money. SQme Labor held marginal seats received very little. As we move through the system we find some coalition seats that were well held. The safest coalition seat in the entire countrythat held by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey)-received a very substantial amount of funds. Some Labor held marginal seats in Western Australia received virtually nothing at all. That is obviously one of the many reasons why the Auditor-General did not even feel inclined to say that there was a prima facie case of political bias as as this was concerned and why he was prepared to make no finding of political bias whatsoever. When he looked at it in detail, he was no doubt influenced in that view by the fact that the proposition could not be sustained. Those opposite should not be surprised that that would be the case, because when we actually look at the propositions on which judgments were based we can see how they would produce a series of differing results in different areas of different political character. departThat is why we would see that, on some occasions, safe Liberal and National seats received a great deal of money and on other occasions quite unsafe Labor held seats received virtually nothing at all. We can see that when we look at the suggestion that the allocation should be based on residents in new suburban areas, residents in inner urban areas, youth in the community, communities in rural areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, communities with high unemployment, and communities with large immigrant populations. It has to be said that when we look at those statistics they do not, on the whole, reflect the bulk of the seats that the Liberal Party holds. They are not well represented among the migrant community. They are not well represented in outer metropolitan areas. They are not well represented in areas which experience high unemployment. It is not easy to find Liberal members from any of those areas. We can find some, and when we find some we actually find them receiving quite generous grants-as did the honourable member for O'Connor, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid)Mr Downer-He's Ballarat.",104
174,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), because, unusually, his seat actually conforms with these characteristics. Therefore, of course he was in a position where it was likely that clubs in his area would receive an award. Of course, they also had to actually apply. Mr Snowdon interjecting Mr Ronaldson interjecting",104
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order I The far honourable member for the Northern Territory and the honourable member for Ballarat will cease interjecting. . Mr Ronaldson-My margin went up.,104
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order II warn the honourable member for Ballarat!,104
177,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"This would not simply descend on them like manna from heaven. They actually had to get off their butts and do something about it. Of course, from time to time, people in electorates did not get off their backsides and do anything about it. They let it lie and, of course, if there were no applications put in no grants were made. In some areas held by the opposition that marked inactivity produced exactly the result that one would expect. The fact of the matter is that having put down a set of criteria-bearing in mind that this is the party that forms the government and bearing in mind that marginal seats are often to be found in outer suburban areas where, because they are growing areas, they have inadequate supplies of sporting facilities-it is not unusual that those seats would receive those grants and therefore a large number of Labor Party held seats would be receiving those grants. Those opposite might dislike that. But, argue against these criteria: do those opposite think it ought to go to people who are not resident in new suburban areas; who are not resident in inner suburban areas; who do not represent youth in the community; who are not in a community in rural areas; who are not Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; who are not communities with high unemployment; who are not communities with large immigrant populations? Is that what those opposite think should happen? If they think that should happen, then they probably have circumstances in which they can feel aggrieved. This has been a nonsense debate for a month or so and a damp squib as far as the opposition is concerned. It is a ludicrous set of allegations that the opposition has made, and those allegations have been answered repeatedly by the minister. The person whom the opposition has sought to incorporate in their attack-the Auditor-General-has walked away from the allegations. He has run a million miles from them during the day. The subject is of increasing disinterest as far as the gallery and everybody else in the general public are concerned. Anyone who is still listening is heartily sick of a continuation Sinclair, I. MCC. of this debate. So I am going to set their minds at rest by moving that the question be put. I move: That the question be now put.",105
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Mr Jenkins)Before putting the question, I would mention that in the midstream of the speech by the minister it was unclear whether he made an accusation that an honourable member . lied. Unfortunately, I was distracted. If the minister did say that, would he please withdraw?",105
179,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"What I actually said was that these propositions are lies. If honourable members take offence, I am happy to withdraw.",105

185,Mr BRERETON,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (4.26 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. Let me say at the outset that the government accepts all of the amendments that the Senate has made to the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. Of course, that includes the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats, those adopted by the Senate, having been moved by the Greens, and, indeed, two opposition amendments. In respect of the opposition amendments, one of those is an amendment that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) moved in this chamber when debate on the reform bill proceeded a few weeks ago. The amendment prevents an employer dismissing an employee because the employee is not a member of a union. When the House debated thisI think it was 22 NovemberI explained that the advice I had received was that it did not appear that there was any satisfactory legal foundation for the amendment as proposed. But, having said that, I indicated that we would be more than willing to look at it afresh when the matter was debated in the Senate-and look at it afresh we did. Although we still have some reservations about the legal position, the government accepts that the amendment should be agreed to. We certainly do not want our position on this issue to be capable of any misrepresentation whatsoever, and I can say to the chamber that we are certainly not opposed to the principle reflected in the amendment. There were also, of course, some government amendments in the Senate. These reflect further consultation with interested parties. They also include a number of technical changes to the bill that are aimed at making it operate more effectively. The main changes that have been made to the bill as a result of these amendments include the following. New grounds of discrimination have been added to the anti-discriaward,"". mination provisions of the bill. These new grounds are in respect of sexual preference, age and physical or mental disability. The anti-discrimination provisions will not apply to decisions about employment in an institution that is conducted in accordance with the beliefs of a religion if the reason for the decision is to avoid injury to religious susceptibilities. Paid rate awards will be dealt with by the new bargaining division of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission but separately from the bargaining functions of the division and with additional safeguards to prevent the terms of paid rate awards from flowing on to minimum rate awards. The commission will review every three years the operation of certified agreements and enterprise flexibility agreements-that is, both the union agreements and the new non-union agreementswhich have passed their specified periods of operation but which are continuing to have effect as awards. There will be an annual report on the effect of enterprise bargaining, particularly in respect of women, part-time employees and immigrants in the workplace. There will be a decision on carer's leave by the commission, providing a basis for government consideration of future legislation guaranteeing carer's leave-that is, leave care for a member of an employee's immediate family who is ill. There will be more flexible notice requirements for an employer wishing to engage in a lockout during the bargaining period for a certified agreement. Finally, there will be a requirement that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, in dealing with an agreement in relation to underrepresented groups, such as women and people with nonEnglish speaking background, properly inform these groups in respect of the terms and realities of that proposed agreement. The approval of the amendments in this chamber will complete the passage of the bills through the Australian parliament. The consultative process underpinning the development of the legislation has certainly been most extensive. As I have said before, it wOllld not have been possible to please everyone in framing the legislation. We had to arrive at a balanced decision. We believe that the package that we have put together strikes exactly the right balance, providing flexibility and, at the same time, guaranteeing fairness. It provides, in our view, what is certainly the best basis for sustainable and dynamic improvements to the productivity of our work force. As well, it guarantees the continuation of the cooperative approach to industrial relations that our government has pursued throughout its life and which has served Australia so well in recent years. It is the of approach that sees industrial disputation today at a record 50-year low. It is 62 per cent lower than for the comparable period under the Fraser government in which the honourable member for Bennelong served as Treasurer. Clearly, during the process of this legislation, there have been disagreements over one or other of its elements. Everyone has had their sixpennyworth. We have seen all sides express their ire about some aspects. Now is the time to put all of those differences aside, to accept that this package of legislation law of Australia and for all of the partiesemployers, employees, unions and employer groups-to work together and to guarantee that the critical business of enterprise bargaining and workplace refonn proceeds. Whether one is an employer, an employee or a trade union, the need to take advantage of the very real opportunities that are provided in this legislation-which are now available to guarantee cooperative work for the benefit of all Australia, to guarantee our productivity and to guarantee this nation's future-is very great. I stressed in the debate yesterday on the green paper Restoring full employment that putting the framework for negotiations in place is one thing, but more important are the attitude and commitment of the parties. We can provide the framework, but the parties must have a desire and a willingness to work towards achieving the outcomes that are available under this legislation. The key priority now must be to put this legislation into operation cooperatively and constructively to achieve real and lasting improvements in productivity and in all of the working relationships of Australia's businesses. This must occur, in our view, at the workplace level if it is to be of real value. The means for this are now in place. I have indicated that we would anticipate that this legislation would come into effect on 30 March next year. Officers of the Department of Industrial Relations have been working on this package for a decade. These are the officers of the department that the honourable member for sort Bennelong pledged to abolish as one of his first acts after",115

He knows that we have the runs on the board. He knows that it stands as a great achievenot ment by this Labor government. It certainly represents a great achievement by those officers who have worked so hard and skilfully in the development of this package. The way is ahead now for sustained nomic and employment growth and for that to occur through this legislation in a manner which guarantees both the maintenance and the improvement of the living standards of all Australians. We are delighted to indicate acceptance of all of the amendments that carried by the Senate and are now before this chamber.",117
194,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"I do not share any of the jubilation expressed by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) at the passage of this piece of legislation. The attempt by the minister to capture the spirit of the season when he said, 'Now is time for a bit of peace and goodwill and everybody working together', sits very strangely at odds with the truculent arrogance he and his Prime Minister (Mr Keating) disthe played at question time when they talked about people coming second. Yes, we did ment come second in the election. But, worse than that, the Australian people come second under this legislation. The minister has absolutely no moral authority to call for a cooperative spirit in relation to this legislation, because this is winner-takes-all legislation. This is not balanced legislation. This is legislation that delivers the commitments the minister made to the trade union movement before the election. This is legislation which, in the words of Jennie George, the Australian people are getting because the employers lost the election and the trade union movement won it. The minister has always seen industrial relations in terms of them and us. He has never seen it in terms of people cooperating at workplaces. He has always seen it in terms rigging the rules, just as he rigged the Prime Minister's ballot 23 years ago. He has always seen industrial relations in those tenns. The only reason that he accepted our clause in relation to discrimination against non-unionists is that he had no alternative. He did do it out of some great act of magnanimity. If the Australian Democrats had not agreed with us in the Senate, he would have rejected . it. The minister should not pretend to. the chamber that it was otherwise. He should not ecocome in here and confect a generosity of spirit when in reality he was forced by numbers-the only thing that he understands-to agree to our clause. If he really believes that he ought to treat non-unionists and unionists our equally, why did he not agree when I moved were the amendment in this chamber? The only reason that he decided to accept it was that the numbers were against him. That is the only language that the minister understands. I understand that. We lost the election and the government won it. What the government has done in this legislation is payout on that election result. It paid the unions back. It could not give a the damn about the employers. It ostracised the Housing Industry Association. Why did it ostracise the Housing Industry Association? Because the Housing Industry Association had temerity to campaign against the Labor Party in the election. That is why the governostracised it. I notice that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is nodding in approval. This is the measure of the political morality of this government. It believes that, whoever wins the election, the system is entitled to be rorted in favour of the victors. Just as the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) rorted those sports grants, these blokes are rorting the industrial relations system in favour of those who won the election. If the government really had claims to govern for the entire Australian community, it would not have brought in this piece of legislation. But honourable members opposite get up in the House-and· the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is a past master of this-and parade moral indignation: he never thought he would sit here and hear anybody say something like that. He carries on as though he has a monopoly on morality. What the government has done with this industrial relations legislation is to further entrench trade - nion monopoly power over the bargaining process of this country.' What it has done in this legislation is to add to the potential for higher unemployment in Australia. The amendments that have been approved by the Senate are very great in number. I do not have the time to go through all of them. I welcome the fact that as a result of the Democrats agreeing with the coalition the government has been forced to accept a requirement that non-unionists be given the same sanctity of conscience-if I can put it that way-as unionists. That is only fair, proper and decent. I welcome that fact. But that is no thanks to the government, or to the Labor Party, or to the trade union movement. The only reason that has happened is that the Democrats, for once, were a little evenhanded. The Democrats were not even-handed when it came to preference clauses. I want to put down the canard that was put around by Senator Bell that in some way the coalition had misunderstood or misled the Democrats in negotiations about that particular amendment. I had an arrangement with Senator Bell that we would vote together to excise from the legislation any hint of preference for members of a trade union. Senator Bell and his colleagJ.WS decided to welsh on that understanding. I say no more about it, other than to simply record the fact that we had that particular arrangement. By far the worse feature of this bill, and that is referred to in the amendments now before the committee, is the destruction of the secondary boycott provision of the Trade Practices Act. There can be no justification at all for giving trade unions in this country an immunity which is not available to other sections of the community. There is no way that government members can twist and turn, cavil, carryon and pretend that they are not, by this change, giving trade unions aprotection, an immunity and a privilege that are denied to other sections of the community. They can shake their heads in mock horror at such a suggestion. The fact is that, under the law of Australia, once this bill receives the royal assent it will be possible for a trade union to impose a secondary boycott on a corporation and escape the consequences that would be suffered by a company that imposes a secondary boycott on the same corporation. In other words, the government has decided, under this legislation, to give trade unions treatment above the law. There can be no justification for that. That is why we charge the government with being a government led by the nose by the trade union movement. No matter ho'w many speeches the minister makes o- how many interviews he gives pretending that it is a fair and balanced billand that he has agonised long and hard; he has kept everybody up all night; he has burnt the midnight oil; and he has gone the length and breadth of Australia-at the end of the day the destruction of the secondary boycott law exposes the minister for the union toady that he is. It exposes him as having done the bidding of the Australian Council of Trade Unions once again. I want to deal with two or three other specific amendments. First of all, in relation to the decision to seek, in effect, some kind of adjudication by the Industrial Relations Commission on the question of carers provisions, the coalition is against putting further minimum provisions into the award system. We believe that there ought to be minimum conditions relating to such matters as annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave and minimum hourly rates of pay and that other things should be a matter of negotiation. Of one course it is desirable that compassionate leave be given to people to look after members of their families, but those matters are best negotiated on an enterprise by enterprise basis. Mr Knott-Like in New South Wales. Mr Hollis-Gaol the unionists; that is what you want to, do.",117
195,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"Honourable· members opposite talk about New South Wales. It was their mob that used to gaol shopkeepers for opening their doors after 8 o'clock at night. So they should not start lecturing me about people being gaoled in New South Wales. They used to have pimps and inspectors go around New South Wales and book struggling small businessmen who had to open their doors after 8 o'clock to make a living and to feed their kids. That is the sort of outfit that those opposite used to run in New South Wales. That is the sort of outfit that was thrown out of government in New South Wales, so members of the New South Wales Labor Party should not come here and give me lectures about people being put into gaol. They elevated the persecution of small businessmen to an absolute art form when they governed. They are doing further damage to small business with this legislation. . As a result of the intervention by government members, I will speak for another 10 minutes after my colleague the honourable member from La Trobe (Mr Charles) has made a contribution to this committee stage debate.",118
196,Mr CHARLES,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"It is getting a bit warm again, is it not? The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), in his contribution to these amendments to the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, said: Now is the time to put all of those differences I have a message for Minister Brereton: they ain't going to be put aside. Never in a month of Sundays will he get u.s to agree to this bill, which is totally designed to keep his mates, who funded Labor's re-election to keep it in government, on side. That is what this bill is all abollt. The only reason we have amendments to this bill is that these officers, who stayed up all night, were forced to put this thing together at such a pace. Because this bill is so confusing, we wound up with how many pages of amendments? Then the Democrats got stuck into the minister a bit too, although I must say that I think the Democrats have some difficulty in understanding the biII. Nonetheless, we wound up with 500 amendments of the most complex and most detailed industrial relations legislation that this nation has ever seen. Noone .really understands the bill. The minister thinks he does, but he does not understand the implications of it in front of the AIRC or of the day to day impact on industry or small business in Australia. He does not have a clue. I do not think the minister even understands the climate out there. Does he know what brought this bill about? What brought it about was that he got his marching orders from the boss, did he not? On 21 April, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said to the Institute of Company Directors, 'We are going to open up the industrial relations system. We are going to make the award system simple. We will collapse awards. We will reduce them to a very small component;· get working conditions out of awards; make it easy. We are also going to open up this thing called enterprise bargaining to the Liberal Party's concept that it told the nation about a few years ago and let the non-union sector of the private sector work force do its own deals and make its own bargains'. The Prime Minister went and told this to the Institute of Company Directors and everybody around Australia got excited. They thought, 'Fair dinkum, the Prime Minister has been listening to the honourable member for Bennelong. He has been listening to the aside honourable member for La Trobe. He has been paying attention and he has finally gotten the message and he is going to let us have a shot at trying to really reform the industrial relations system, so perhaps we can do . something about unemployment in this nation'. What happened was that the Prime Minister got busy on Mabo and the budget deficit debacle; and he forgot all about industrial relations. He sent the minister off to do his job for him. At the same time, Bill Kelty was running around the country, busy with regional development and the Reserve Bank. He did not know what .was happening either. The minister got rolled by the secretaries of the most powerful unions in Australia. They took him to pieces at the ACTU congress. They ripped him up one side and down the other and spat him out. When they had finished spitting him out, the Prime Minister came in and said, 'We are sorry, we did not really mean to upset you blokes. You got us back in in this election that we did not have a chance of winning. You spent the money and put the foot soldiers into make sure we got back-and I will make sure that I tell Laurie Brereton how to play the game'. The Prime Minister and Secretary Bi11 Kelty finally put their eyes back on the ball game and said that the Minister for Industrial Relations had promised things that the Prime Minister had said we would do, but we cannot have them because the union chiefs will not let us. So they said we will have a big farce and further overbalance the industrial relations legislation equation in favour of the union bureaucracy. What do we have? The minister, at question time, talked about protection-at the same time as the Prime Minister was talking about GATT. GATT is all about the elimination of protection in order to provide an impetus to the economy and to provide employment. That is what it is all about. GATT means jobs because we are eliminating around the world protection. So what does the minister do in the industrial relations bill? He brings in page after page of more statutes of protection. He calls that an impetus for employment. He says we should be happy about it and put our differences aside. He has to be joking! If it were not so serious, it would almost be funny. In the green paper that came out yesterday there is talk about how we will address this mammoth problem which those opposite caused. Let there be no mistake about it: the Labor government members caused the one million unemployment figure with the unbelievably high interest rates that just about killed business in Australia. They caused it-and now they want to fix it, at least politically, increasing taxes. Is that not delightful? Nobody has ever heard of a tax led recovery. One of the things the minister might do is let people have real enterprise bargaining, let the people who do not belong to unions strike deals with their employers without the unions having a bureaucratic say so over it. The minister does not believe in that. In his speech on these amendments he said, 'Look what a wonderful job I have' done. I have incorporated an opposition amendment which was put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong'. That amendment means that, where it is stated in the bill that it is illegal to dismiss an employee because he is a member of a union, it now has the contra that says it is illegal to dismiss someone because he is not a member of a union. The only reason the government accepted that amendment was that the Democrats said it had to. We put up another amendment. There is a clause in the bill which says it is an offence to induce a member of a union or an official of a union to leave the union or quit being an official. We put up the contra that it should be an offence to induce a non-member of a union to become a member of a union. But that was not accepted because the Democrats did not buy it. I do not think they understood it. That is part of the problem. I do not think the minister really understands industrial relations. If he did, he would recognise that the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, in issuing his annual report this week, has condemned the government. He said the legislation has become so complex that the commission does not know how to deal with it. He issued the government a challenge. He said he has a real problem if the commission deals with an award and then a union and an employer say they have made an agreement to vary the award. The AIRC may look at the public interest test and say, 'What you have done is a heap of rubbish. It does not represent an improvement in productivity. There is no cost justification for this modification you want to make to the award'. So they go away and come back with the agreement presented as a consent agreement. The AIRC cannot take by into account the public interest test, and so this non-representative wage increase or change in conditions goes through automatically. The commissioner says he is concerned about that because compulsory arbitration is finished. Those opposite finished it, not us. But they did so without understanding what they were doing.· The bill is so complex that I do not think any of us yet know the total outcomes, ramifications and effects of this bill. The minister said yesterday, 'The fact is that the opposition has never really had original ideas. When it comes to the republic, it is good old Mother England'. Was it the minister's original idea to trade the Queen, as head of Australia, for a bunch of faceless bureaucrats in Geneva, through the ILO convention which now is the king of Australia? It was a terrific idea but the people of Australia, when they wake up to what the government has done to this nation by imposing bureaucratic will from Geneva on Australian working men and women's lives, will not be very happy. (TIme expired)",119
197,Mr DOWNER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"It is with great pleasure that I follow. the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who made an excellent speech with an extraordinarily large number of valuable points. This industrial relations issue in the Industrial Relations Reform Bill which has come back before the chamber concerns one of the seminal issues of Australian politicsalthough not the only one. The debate is about continuing with entrenched privilege in the interests of union officials and the Australian Labor Party, which is a creature of trade union movement, or putting individuals in Australia before entrenched privilege. As is said in the United States, it is about empowering individuals and giving that the highest priority. I had hoped this parliament would do that, but apparently it will not. This legislation was passed with amendments by the Senate a couple of days ago. It has come back to the House of Representatives today. The governm,ent has accepted a green paper on initiatives to reduce unemployment. This is ironic because at the very heart of the unemployment problem lies our industrial relations system. This green paper which was presented to the government yesterday-a green paper prepared overwhelmingly by government officials-is notable in one respect; that is, the scarce comment about our industrial relations system. A coherent report on why we have such high levels of unemployment in Australia would be dominated, chapter after chapter, with discussion about the failings of our industrial relations system. The honourable member for La Trobe made a good point in challenging the minister to come forward and explain what ideas the government had to reform the industrial relations system. This debate goes back quite some time, to the early to mid-1980s, when on this side of politi-s we were arguing that the way to keep unemployment down, improve productivity and the competitiveness of the economy was to cast aside the entrenched privileges that had been in place through our industrial relations system since the tum of the century, Iiberalise that system and give it greater flexibility. ) Back in the mid-1980s people in the Labor Party were saying that this was heresy. It was heresy to say that we should have a more flexible labour market. Those on the other side of the parliament talked incessantly about the accord. The accord was more important than anything else, and this talk about flexibility in the labour market was the talk of ideologues, radicals, fools and people given to excess. There was no end of abuse dished out to those on our side of politics for arguing for a more flexible labour market and dereguthe lation of the industrial relations system. What has changed? The rhetoric of the Australian Labor Party has changed, because the Australian Labor Party knows that the intellectual debate has been won by those on our side of politics. There is virtually no-one with any economic education in this country-of course, I am excluding some of the people on the other side of the chamber who are here at the moment, because they would not fall into that categoryMr Knott-Who happen to have degrees in economics.",121
198,Mr DOWNER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"The honourable member certainly has no economic education. But the simple fact is there is no-one left in Australia who is in any way economically literate who does not realise that what we on this side of politics have been saying for a decade has been absolutely right. Nobody argues with that proposition. Those in the Labor Party have decided that the path of minimal damage is, firstly, to continue to support the entrenched privileges of the trade union movement and the trade union leadership, which, of course, is part and parcel of the Labor Party; and, secondly, to say, 'Let's adopt some of the rhetoric of the other side of politics so we can neutralise the debate'. That is what they have done. So we had the great scare campaign on, inter alia, industrial relations during the last election campaign. We were told that deregulation of the labour market was some sort of fascist concoction. After the election, in April, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne. He told the Institute of Company Directors that the Labor government was effectively going to adopt the Liberal Party's industrial relations policy. I cannot tell honourable members how many business people at that time came up to me and said, 'It is just incredible; we couldn't believe the Prime Minister's speech. We couldn't believe the way he embraced enterprise bargaining and deregulation of the labour market'. I could not believe it, just as I am sure the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for La Trobe could not believe it. It is dead right-we could not believe it, because it was not worth believing. In the end the Prime Minister did a volte-face very quickly. From this grand vision of enterprise bargaining and a deregulated labour market came this miserable piece of legislation which is before the chamber at the moment. Forget what the oppositIon says; if we talk to employers, if we talk to academics in this area, they will tell us that this legislation reduces the flexibility of our industrial relations system-it does not enhance it. How many businesses in Australia are going to put together an enterprise agreement-talking about those which have no union membership at all-lug this enterprise agreement off to the Industrial Relations Commission, then run the gauntlet in the Industrial Relations Commission of time consuming debate, presumably with trade union officials who are able to challenge these enterprise agreements? If there is one trade unionist in the enterprise, the union is brought in and the so-called enterprise agreement becomes a deal which has to receive the rubber stamp of the trade union movement. Mr Knott-Quite right.",121
199,Mr DOWNER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"That is exactly the point I am making. It is an outrageous 'confection for government members to maintain that this legislation is going to improve the flexibility of the labour market. Those people need to talk to the business community to find out whether the business community agrees. It does not matter whom one talks to in small businesses or big businesses-people in the business community think this legislation is a dud. Their expectations were lifted in April and, bang, they have been dropped. And they have been dropped because, in the end, Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson would not accept a deregulated labour market. And why not? Because they care about the protection of workers? The Labor government has put a million workers out of work and real wages have declined by 5.3 per cent since 1984-85. Yesterday the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) boasted that the government has reduced real wages. Is this something to be proud of? A benchmark of success is to improve people's living standards and make them feel a bit happier, not reduce their wages. That is the record of the Labor Party, which says it is concerned about working Australians. I find it almost unbelievable that the Minister has the gall to come into this parliament and argue the rhetoric that he has been arguing for so long. The simple fact is that the victims of this legislation are the victims of the accord. They are the same people-they are the unemployed. They are the people who, because the government refused toliberalise the labour market, are going to remain out of work. The government will never reduce unemployment to acceptable levels if it does not move towards genuine enterprise bargaining and greater flexibility. Ted Evans, the Secretary to the Treasury, says in speeches that this legislation is not doing enough. Bernie Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, says the same thing. Most academic commentators say the same thing. It does not matter where one goes in the economic bureaucracy in Canberra, they think this legislation is a dud. They think this is the one area of reform from which the Labor Party has run away. The government's own bureaucrats are saying that-probably not in the departments run by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Industrial Relations, but in the serious economic departments that is precisely what they are saying. The legislation is indeed a dud. (TIme expired)",122
200,Mr TUCKEY,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"It has been an interesting day, because a large portion of the government's dorothy dix questions during question time invited various ministers, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to tell us about this wonderful success we have had. In fact, I did grin a bit about the GATT claims. Apparently, only the EC, America and Australia were involved in it. That is what we heard today. I am very pleased that the GATT decisions have been concluded. I was just a little amazed at the amount of credit this government took upon itself. I thought that was a little bit of a joke. The government having lectured us on this matter, we have had another conversion on the road to Damascus. We are now told that tariff reduction is back in. My recollection was that the government was very pro-tariff reduction and was getting it past the parliament because the opposition supported it. That is a situation I would not anticipate occurring when the roles are reversed. It then became an election issue and the government became anti-tariff reduction and branded us as radicals because our policy for tariff reductions by the year 2000 was. five per cent different from the government's. Now, of course, with the conclusion of GATT, the government has had another conversion on the road to Damascus. We have supported the government on that, but where are we now? We are debating the final stages of more regulation of the labour market. Is that not amazing? The government is going to deregulate the tariff system and increase and entrench regulation of the labour market. In the most simple terms that is a recipe for exports-exports of Australians' jobs. The government is going to be shipping them out of this country at a rate it has never known. One cannot deregulate one side of industry and fail to deregulate the other. It can put itself in any position it chooses, but it cannot do what it is doing. In time, Senator Richardson will discover he cannot have it both ways in regard to health issues, either. Here we are, debating this legislation again, and, as I said, after all the rhetoric of question time, we are being told that this regulation is necessary; that, in fact, this government stands for deregulation in the international trading environment and thai it has got the secret recipe to make both policies work. I stand here today as the only person in this chamber specifically identified by a political party as representing small business. The bill was sent off by the government to that house of 'unrepresentative swill' when in fact one would think it should be in this chamber, considering this is the people's house, and small business is run by the people. The elected representatives, lobby groups and individuals involved with small business ring me up constantly. I am quite surprised at the number of phone calls coming into my office from people expressing grave concern as to how they will maintain their competitive effort if all this is dumped on top of them, to say nothing of their confusion. These individuals running small businesses with relatively small work forces want to know how they will manage. They certainly will not have the time to go through the complex processes that this legislation provides. Let us get to the issue .of complexity. The reason this' legislation is so complex and we need 42 amendments is that this is the only way the government can subvert the constitution. This legislation-the Mabo legislation has another 74 government amendments-is designed to achieve a level of complexity to get over the fundamental fact that the constitution does not allow the government to do these things. Anyone who has read the constitutional debates-I can say with confidence that the two members of the Labor Party who are in the chamber at the moment, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), have not, and I doubt whether the Leader of the Government (Mr Beazley) has read all of them, although his father might have read him a few as bedtime stories-will know that the founding fathers did not want to give the federal parliament any industrial relations powers and in the end gave what was a very restrictive power. They would be turning in their graves to see this device being used. I make the point that by making this legislation so complex the government is creating a minefield. Small business people, who the government hopes. will go on employing people-they normally would simply because they choose workers instead of new machinery, mainly for financial reasons-will not try out the government's system as it is too complex and too problematical. Early in the piece we had a couple of interjections from the honourable member for Throsby and the honourable member for Gilmore. I am aware of the geographic location of their electorates and I have some idea where their voters work. I would remind the government that it is doing the same thing to workers' jobs with its Mabo legislation.",123
201,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"Mr Snow)Order! The honourable member should return at least to the legislation, and preferably to the amendments.",124
202,Mr TUCKEY,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"I think that is quite right. The point I am making about these amendments, and their effect on jobs, is that when the government makes legislation very complex-and it has to in order to get around this situation-it has long-term effects. In Western Australia a pipeline will be built which I believe will be made out of steel. It would be manufactured south of Sydney, and would create a lot of jobs. It might not happen Mabo legislation in this parliament might prevent that job going ahead. But I respect your view, Mr Deputy Chairman, so I will not go into the details. These people are voting against about 500 miles of steel pipe being made in proximity to their electorates, probably by people who live in their electorates. These are the silly sorts of things this parliament does. This legislation is the same. A few minutes ago the minister got up here and said that this legislation, and the amendments that we are dealing with-I understand we are not dealing with them one by one but as a whole-will give us flexibility in the labour market. It certainly will not give small business any flexibility. Big business might be able to get through the complexities of it over time with its personal industrial relations departments, or human resource departments, as we must now politically correctly call them. Big business might make it. The little guys who will generate the jobs that the government and Australia so desperately need will not give it a try. The fact that the government is adding another 42 typewritten pages to the legislation will not improve the situation; it will make it worse. Of all the very sensible opposition amendments, only one made it-the one giving people some simple rights not to be coerced in their choice of whether to be in or out of a trade union. Yet the concept of a secret ballot put forward by the opposition was rejected. The government would not let people exercise the fundamental democratic right to cast a vote in secret. We cannot have that. The honourable member for Gilmore would not have got his endorsement if there had been a secret ballot. I am surprised that he could even get it with them putting their hands up with the heavies standing round the room. Mr Knott-you didn't think I'd win the seat.",124
203,Mr TUCKEY,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,I am now convinced that everybody in your electorate must be stupid.,124
204,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,Order! The honourable member might return to the as the legislation. The honourable member for Gilmore should give the honourable member for O'Connor precious minutes.,124

NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Friday, 17 December 1993, at 10 a.m. Suspension of Standing and Sessional",124
206,Mr BEAZLEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"I move: That: (1) so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the business for consideration on Friday, 17 Decembyr 1993, unless otherwise ordered, being as follows: (a) Ministerial statements. (b) Messages from the Senate returning or transmitting legislation. (c) Notices and orders of the day, government business. (d) Committee and delegation reports, order of the day for resumption of debate on the motion to take note of the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure on reforming the House of Representatives. (e) Presentation of papers. (f) Any motions for a special adjournment of the House or for leave of absence to all Members; and (2) standing order lOlA (interruption for question time) be suspended for any sitting on Friday, 17 December 1993. There is nothing particularly unusual about this. This is common practice at this stage of the parliamentary year when the House is rapidly running out of the business that would nonnally occupy it. Instead, we are awaiting messages from the Senate. There are 11 bills to be dealt with in the Senate. Some, such as the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, have already been returned and dealt with by this House. A number of others will be returned and dealt with tonight. We expect some to be returned and dealt with tomorrow. Tomorrow there is the possibility of a ministerial statement. There will also be an opportunity for honourable members to pay their respects to whomsoever they wish in the fonn of valedictories. Honourable members will also have an opportunity 'to debate the Blewett committee report on changes to the procedures of the House. Those of us with a direct interest in the fonnulation 'of standing orders will be most interested in what honourable members have to say on that. BUSINESS I cannot say when proceedings will cease tomorrow. If. it becomes obvious that the Native Title Bill will not get back to this Orders place at a reasonable hour during the day, we will probably adjourn in the mid to late afternoon tomortow. Mr Costello-Till when?",126
207,Mr BEAZLEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,Until the next day. Mr Tim Fischer-At 11 a.m.?,126
208,Mr BEAZLEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"The time we have to - tart on Saturday, again, to some degree will be dictated by what happens with the Native Title Bill. But I anticipate at this stage that we would probably sit from about 11 a.m., with a view to concluding proceedings by lunchtime. I would again move tomorrow a similar set of standing orders for the program of the day, and the same considerations would apply. I hope of course that it will not be necessary to sit on Saturday. But at the moment I think-from all I hear from the Senate and from what our people tell us; the Liberal whips and organisers are probably telling those opposite the same-that it looks most unlikely that we will get the Native Title Bill any time tomorrow, and therefore a Saturday sitting looks almost certain.",126
209,Mr HOWARD,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"I want to make only two points about this motion. The first is that the opposition will vote against the motion of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) because it contains no provision at all for question time. We take the view that, whenever parliament sits, question time ought to be available. I do not want to labour the point, but question time is an integral part of the daily sitting program of the parliament. The other point that I would like to make is simply this: we are headed for a Saturday sitting-that, of itself, causes me no particular personal concern; I hope it does not cause too many people on my side of the House concern, although I am aware of the consternation of one of my longer serving colleagues about the impact of a Saturday sitting, but I notice there are a few on the other side who may be a little concerned. On a more serious note, I think we are in this chaotic, rather uncertain end of year situation because the government has chosen to. force through parliament a huge, cumbersome, unworkable piece of legislation on native title. The goverrunent would really do the Australian public a great favour by putting that legislation off until February. I suppose I will be in receipt of a spray from my friend the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), who will get up and say that he never thought he would hear somebody in this parliament say that the Mabo legislation ought to be postponed. I think the reason the government will not postpone the legislation and the reason that we will sit on Saturday-we will sit on Sunday, or.all of next week, if necessary-is that the government is frightened of putting off the legislation until February of next year because the fragile, insubstantial coalition it has put together in order to get the legislation through may come apart. That is the reason why the government will have parliament sit on Saturday. We do not mind sitting on Saturday, Sunday, Monday or whatever is necessary, but the Australian public would be better served if that cumbersome, unworkable and increasingly ramshackle piece of legislation were deferred until February next year. But those opposite will not have the guts to do that because they know dam well that the support that they were able to garner in the community will disappear, and they want to get the legislation through before Christmas before that support starts to fall apart. We are opposed to this motion and will be voting against it.",126
210,Mr TUCKEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"I wish to support the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) because it has been made very clear why these arrangements' have to be made. There is quite a lot of legislation on the Notice Paper. Some of it has been debated in recent days. It is legislation that acceptable in the community, and it will not be passed at this session. We will not be requested to discuss that legislation or vote further upon it on Saturday or Sunday because the government is not frightened about it. The government is not concerned that the public might rise up and demand that it be changed. Burnt on the memory of those opposite is a thing called the ID card. They took too long to get it through the parliament. In the end people started marching in the streets. To quote one of the government's then ministers, 'We were eventually saved from ourselves'. Government members know that, if there is a delay, they will not' get their stupid, complex legislation on Mabo through. I pointed out minutes ago that this legislation will take work from the steelworks of Australia. I note that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) is waving his hands in the air when in fact he should be deeply concerned. The first state to profit from approximately 600 kilometres of steel pipe that will be used in a gas project in Western Australia but which will be constructed in the steel industries of New South Wales isMr Allan Morris-What?",127
211,Mr TUCKEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"I can tell the honourable member what it is. We are held up here by this motion. This motion is to make time in this parliament so that we can wait around until the Mabo legislation comes back. The Mabo legislation will delay the order of that steel pipe for months or years, and the honourable member's constituents will be the losers. Western Australia, which is fighting to the death against this legislation, is not the first winner from that pipeline-it is the steelworks of New South Wales. The honourable member for Newcastle, firstly, did not know it was happening and, secondly, does not care because he is tied to a party philosophy, and the people in his electorate who want the jobs that that project will create do not matter to him. Mrs Crosio interjecting",127
212,Mr TUCKEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"Do not tell me about that it was copper cable. I never back away from that, and I thank the honourable member for raising it in this place. Everybody knows is me. as Iron Bar Tuckey and I get a lot of political gain from that. It is only fools like the honourable member who raise that point. All the government's more educated people never raise that point now. Let me repeat what is happening to the economy of New South Wales. The government is asking this parliament to sit around to pass a piece of legislation that will prevent the steelworkers of Port Kembla and probably Newcastle from getting the extra work of putting together a gas pipeline. Those opposite are doing this. They have voted against their people getting work because that work will be delayed. By the very nature of the government's legislation, those job opportunities will be delayed. If the Aussie dollar goes up-as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) predicted today-by the time that pipeline is built, the steel pipe will probably be bought from Korea and those in the electorates affected will never get the work. Those opposite are on the run now because the dollar is down. But they are not worried about that. Their electors should be the first beneficiaries of that pipeline. The economics qf it have always been a bit marginal. When the deal is done, 100 separate applications under the government's Mabo legislation have to be dealt :with to give an easement for that pipeline. Under the Richard Court legislation, separate deals are done. Western Australia can place the order for the pipeline and can get on with the job. That would give the constituents of those opposite work. But of course the government will deal with compensation separately. The government's legislation that we are waiting for is so complex that it will be in the courts for years. Nobody can go ahead with those projects, and the constituents of government members will be the first losers. In fact, the great economic beneficiary of that pipeline is, in the first instance, New South Wales. It will be years before Western Australia, which is fighting for the constituents of those opposite while they neglect themMr Leo MCLeay interjecting",127
213,Mr TUCKEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"It will be a long time before we get to that point. Most of that steelwork would probably not rub off where the honourable member for Watson is. But the fact of life is that that sort of money tends run around in a state, and those opposite are saying that New South Wales should have no worries about their legislation. But there is a massive infrastructure project requiring steel from New South Wales. ' Mrs Crosio""':"""" You have said that.",128
214,Mr TUCKEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"Yes, but you do not seem to understand, and somebody has got to represent your constituents. Somebody has got to put the argument for the people of Port Kembla and the people of Newcastle. The honourable member will not do it--.only somebody from Western Australia will get up here and argue for, them. There is someone standing there saying, 'Don't tell me. I don't want to know'. He comes from Newcastle-a steel town. One just would not believe it. That is what we are waiting fot: a decision to delay a project that will mean jobs and good work for people in New South Wales, people who vote Labor. That will get out. The people will understand when it all happens. That is what ,we are talking about here. The Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), having been' challenged by the honourable member for Bennelong, is still not going to allow a question time. We know why we are not going to have question time-those opposite are scared stiff that even more could come out about sports rorts. Those opposite are the people who condoned that; they stood up to talk about it today. I just wonder how the father of the honourable member for Swan felt when his son had to get up here and defend the minister for sports rorts .. One just would not imagine it. Let us talk for a moment about the running of this place and the gOyernmfmt's denial of our further investigating that maUer. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) told us that she has not got any more documentation. How many pages did it take to work out those electoral deciSions and how to allocate the money? How many pages of calculations of who could win and who could lose did it take to decide to dump Ron Edwards, the former member for Stirling, and Carolyn Jakobsen, the former member for Cowan? How much money were to they given? The government sent some out my end to try to justify it. Why did the government take the money from Ron Edwards and Carolyn Jakobsen? One bloke over there got $500,000 and the other blokes got $80,000 between them.  point of order. I do suggest that the honourable member for O'Connor should show a bit of respect and courtesy to the chair. In what way are the remarks of the honourable member for O'Connor relevant to the motion moved by the Leader of the House? I am being invited to quote standing order 145.",128
215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"Mr Andrew)I have been listening to what the honourable member for O'Connor has had to say. I would have thought that of all debates in the parlialy ment the debate on this motion was as wide ranging as is possible. I accept that the honourable member's remarks seem to have very little relevance to what the minister was saying, but I do not find him out of order given that there is no specific instruction him to address specifically the motion before the House in any more precise terms. Now that I have the attention of the House, while I appreciate the fact that the honourable member for O'Connor has been somewhat, provocative in his remarksMr Leo MCLeay-'Nonsensical' might be better.",129
216,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,I would also make the point that honourable members on my right-and the honourable member for Watson would know better than any-have added to the provocation across the chamber. I think the chamber would be a somewhat better debating place if the honourable member for O'Connor were at least granted his entitlement to be heard.,129
217,Mr TUCKEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"Thank you for that ruling; it made the point quite clear. I remind the  that in future it would be a good idea if he studied his standing orders and discovered what sorts of rules apply to various debates and, more particularly, as our Speaker said today, made his points of order relevant. The simple fact is that we are debating a motion setting speaking times and setting the times that we will have to be in this parliament-which are not normal times and which are times when others have made particular arrangements as part of their normal programs. We are being warned that the sitting might even go into Saturday, and we are well aware of the inconvenience that will create for all sortsbf people in terms of their other commitments. But why are we doing this? This is the point that the government seems to object to. I am giving the reasons why we are doing it. We are doing it because we have a government that is terrified to let everyone go home, talk to their own constituents and find out how those people are starting to get dreadfulconcerned about the government's Mabo legislation. It seems amazing that I had to point out to members representing steel constituencies in New South Wales that this legislation represents a risk to the jobs of their own constitufor ents. If anybody wants to stand up after me and say that that is not the case, I suggest they do so. But I think, over time, they will be proved wrong. Every week that that decision is delayed is a week in which their unemployed constituents do not get work and a week in which the prosperity of the great steel industry is diminished. Why should we be sitting around here waiting for legislation to come back from the Senate which guarantees delays to that project? It guarantees them by its format and its requirements. In fact, it just might put that industry at risk. That is a question those opposite have got to answer in the context of their own electorates if they have a commitment-as I have in this parliament-to putting their people first. That is why we are debating this point, and I am entitled to put to those opposite the reasons why this debate is on. It is about that piece of legislation and it is about the fact that there will be no question time tomorrow. In that regard, I am entitled to raise the reason why question time is getting cut off. We know how vulnerable the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories is and of course that is why we will get no question time tomorrow. We have a minister who says in that regard that there is no more paperwork, when in fact people sat down in her office and went through a process of working out which seats were winnable and which seats were not. They got to the point where they apparently decided it was better to save the honourable member for Swan, better to save the new honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and better to save the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear). The government gave them grants of half a million each; but it only gave the sitting members for Stirling",129
218,Mr BEAZLEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"Sports grants didn't save me, Wilson, you did!",130
219,Mr TUCKEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,You have continued to perpetuate that rubbish. Try it again.,130
220,Mr BEAZLEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,It was you.,130
221,Mr TUCKEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"The point was you got half a million and Ronnie Edwards got $30,000. The honourable member for Canning got half a million and Carolyn Jakobsen got $50,000. That is what those opposite did to their own people. How many of them are going to get it next time? But do not tell me that did not take some paperwork. There was plenty of paperwork required to do that. In fact, the minister must have shredded it all. This is the fact; there was plenty of paperwork. Mr Beazley interjecting Mr Leo MCLeay-Hey, hey, don't you worry about that.",130
222,Mr TUCKEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"Yes, do not worry about that. As I have told the honourable member, the people who were there did not vote in his electorate. The simple fact is that he is making claims that they were people there in his own electorate. They were not. They were bookmakers of people who do not live in the honourable member's electorate. Mr Leo MCLeay-They all heard about it.",130
223,Mr TUCKEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF MEETING,"No, they did not. You can carry on with that farce. There is something funny about the Leader of the House. As time goes by, he relies more and more on creating stories and rewriting history. It is not to your Gibson, G. D. credit, Kim Beazley, because your father was a different sort of man. Day after day you are defending yourself by building myths which never come true. You have done it three or four times recently and it does nothing for your credibility and makes you the sort of overweight flea that you will probably always be.

Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Defence) (5.59 p.m.) That the bill be now read a second time. It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the House the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1993. This is a historic occasion. Introduction of these seven bills brings to fruition efforts stretching back over 25 years NOES to develop a truly national approach to the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. It was only in July 1991 that the Commonwealth, states and territories governments agreed to establish a national registration scheme to replace the eight state and territory schemes. Since then, there has been considerable progress in implementing the scheme. From 1 July 1992, the Commonwealth has taken over from the states and territories all the evaluation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. In July 1993 we saw the establishment of the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. From my perspective, we have come a long way in a short time, but there is further to go. These seven bills will provide the NRA with its full range of functions and powers and they represent the final stage in the development of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Consistent with the government's commitment to a more open and transparent process for the assessment and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, the government released this and the other registration bills as PAIRS exposure drafts for public comment. Also, briefing sessions were held with the main stakeholders, that is, the states and territories, the agricultural and veterinary chemical industry, the rural sector, and consumer, public interest and environmental groups. In response to the invitation to comment on the exposure drafts, 33 submissions were received from a wide cross-section of the community. A considerable number of the suggestions have been incorporated into these bills. The registration bills are fully supported by the agvet chemical industry, the National Farmers Federation, the Commonwealth agencies involved in the scheme and the state and territory agricultural agencies. The consumer, public interest and environmental groups will welcome those provisions of the bills which will ensure improved public participation, greater availability of information for the public and the public's right to seek an injunction and empower the NRA to hold public and private hearings. I should emphasise, however, that the agvet code is being introduced without the formal agreement of the states or the Northern Territory. . The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) proposes to seek the necessary agreement before the agvet code is debated during the 1994 autumn sittings. In this regard, the minister wishes to acknowledge the generous assistance provided by the states and territories in developing the scheme and the draft legislation. I now wish to specifically address the provisions of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill. The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the agvet code to have effect in the Australian Capital Territory. The code contains provisions for the evaluation, registration and control of chemical products. Furthermore, the code is to be adopted by the legislatures of the states and the Northern Territory as a law of those jurisdictions. This bill also provides that the whole legislative package will commence on a date agreed to with the states and Northern Territory. In view of the need for the states and Northern Territory to enact complementary state law, provision has been made for the act to commence 12 months after royal assent or earlier by proclamation. The bill, through the federalisation mechanism, applies the Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act 1901 for the purpose of uniformly interpreting the agvet codes as applied in each jurisdiction. Also, the Commonwealth administrative law package will apply to the agvet code in each jurisdiction. In order to reduce the complexity of the bill, offences will continue to be offences against the laws of the states or territories, although the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will. be empowered to prosecute for offences. This bill repeals the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988, which is replaced by this legislative package. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gallus) adjourned. NA CHEMICALS CODE BILL 1993 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Defence) (6.04 p.m.) - I move: That the bill be now read a second time. It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the House the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Bill 1993. This bill is to be enacted in the Australian Capital Territory. It has been drafted in complementary adoptive form so that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code-the agvet code-scheduled to the bill can be adopted by each state and the Northern Territory. Through this mechanism, evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and. veterinary chemical products and related matters will be administered uniformly across Australia by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. The control measures apply up to the point of retail sale with the states and territories remaining responsible for control of use matters. I now turn to the provisions of the bill. The agvet code focuses on the registration of chemical products, approval of active constituents, and approval of labels. The overriding criteria to be addressed by the NRA are public health, occupational health and safety, the environment, product performance, and trade .and commerce. The public will be invited to comment in respe-t of each chemical product containing a new activeconstituent prior to determination of an application. The NRA will also be able to reconsider an existing registered chemical product to ensure it continues to meet contemporary safety and performance standards. The public will' be invited to nominate chemical products to be considered for inclusion in this formal and systemic review program. In addition, the NRA will be able to review a chemical product at its own initiative. If appropriate, the NRA may suspend or cancel the registration of a registered chemical product. Recognising the cost of additional scientific data when required to support continued chemical registration, compensation provisions have been introduced which will apply in certain circumstances. The intention is to recognise research and development costs associated with updating data packages when such data may also support other manufacturers' products. The provisions will apply to data specifically requested by the NRA and where that data does not have patent protection. A considerable number of safeguards have been built into the agvet code to prevent the commercial abuse of data while ensuring that both the provider of the call-up data and a secondary applicant are treated equitably. The NRA will be able to control the ppssession of chemical products. It will be an offence to supply unregistered chemical products or to supply products in contravention of the conditions of their registration. Where a chemical product has been supplied in contravention of the agvet code, the NRA may issue recall notices requiring persons to stop supplying the product and to take action to deal with unsold stock as directed by the NRA. A system has also been set up under which a person who wishes to do something in respect of a chemical product that would otherwise be an offence may obtain a permit authorising the action to be done. For example, a person may want to conduct a trial or experiment in relation to an unregistered product in order to decide whether to make an application for approval or registration. To ensure chemical products available to the public comply with the specifications determined by the NRA, this bill provides for the licensing of manufacturers of registered chemical products. The introduction of manufacturing principles is to be phased in over a period so as to allow the manufacturing industry time to adjust. The NRA will have adequate enforcement powers in respect of the agvet code. Authorised inspectors will monitor compliance with the. agvet code and, if contraventions are suspected to have occurred, to obtain search warrants. In various circumstances inspectors will be empowered, or may be given powers, to enter and search commercial premises and seize things. An inspector may also require the giving of information or the production of documents. The code also provides that any person may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with the code. To facilitate the NRA being able to seek a wide spectrum of professional advice in respect of its evaluation of chemical products and active constituents,the NRA will be able to release confidential commercial information. However, I emphasise that precautions will be taken to ensure that trade secrets and certain other information subject to possible commercial exploitation are safeguarded. Each person in receipt of confidential commercial information will pe bound by the confidentiality provisions of the agvet code. n is important to note that there are extensive provisions whereby an applicant can have a decision of the NRA· reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, including, for example, refusing to grant registration of a chemical product. Before applying to the AAT for a review of decision, an applicant may, if he or she wishes, request the NRA to reconsider the decision at no significant cost to the applicant. If the matter is not resolved, it can be referred to the AAT. These two appeal mechanisms will, I believe, provide a balance between· the powers of the NRA and the concerns of applicants. Transitional provisions have been provided which will ensure a smooth transition of existing arrangeprinciples ments to the new agvet code. This bill, I believe, provides for the efficient and timely registration of agricultural and veterinary chemical products. At the same time it will enhance safety standards and consumer confidence by involving the public in the evaluation process which will be accountable, open and transparent. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gallus) adjourned. NA CHEMICALS (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1993 First Reading  Crean, and read a first time. ' Second Reading,  tary to the Minister for Defence) (6.11 p.m.) - I move: That the bill be now ,read a second time. It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the House the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1993. This bill amends the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 and the Copyright Act 1968. The amendments are a consequence of the introduction of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1993, the Agricultural and VeterinaryChemicals Code Bill 1993, and the repealing of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988. This legislative package extends the functions of the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary ChemicalsNRA-to include the registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products. The new functions have been developed in consultation with the states and territories to ensure a consistent approach to the assessment and control of chemical products. Furthermore, the NRA is to have regard to the government's policy in relation to the of ecologically sustainable development. Also the NRA will be required to comply with the policies of Commonwealth, state and territory governments that are determined under an agreement to be entered into between those governments for the purpose of this proposed act and the agvet codes. Other major amendments to the Administration Act concern the importation, manufacture and exportation of chemical products. It will be an offence to import a chemical product that is unregistered, not exempted, or for which a permit has not been obtained from the NRA. Australia's international obligations in respect of agricultural and veterinary chemicals are also addressed. This will ensure that Australia can enforce its international obligations under prior informed consent arrangements. The enforcement provisions are very similar to those contained in the agvet code of which details were provided in the second reading speech. The NRA will be able to hold public and private hearings to assist it in the exercise of its functions. The holding of hearings is a strong step towards the NRA's operations being open and transparent, and seen to be such. , The bill also makes some consequential amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 so that the reproduction of the writing on a label for a chemical product is not an infringement of any copyright. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on' motion by Mrs Gallus) adjourned. NA NA (COLLECTION OF LEVY) BILL 1993 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Defence) (6.14 p.m.) - I move: That the bill be now read a second time. It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the House the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Bill 1993. Honourable members· will be aware that, in deciding to participate in the national registration scheme, the government decided that the full cost of the scheme would be recovered from industry, phased in over a four-year period ..The National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals will manage the cost recovery program associated with this bill. The levy will be a significant component of the scheme's cost recovery program. Other funds will be collected through application fees and annual registration renewal fees. In 1994-95, 83 per cent of the scheme's costs will be recovered from the agvet chemical industry. In 1995-96, the scheme will be fully cost recovered. I wish to emphasise that the agvet chemical industry has been extensively consulted on these cost recovery arrangements. I now tum to the provisions of the bill. This bill will provide the NRA with the mechanism by which a levy on agricultural and veterinary chemical products can be collected. The bill identifies how liability for payment of a levy charge will be determined and the amount of levy that will be imposed. Generally speaking, liability for the levy will be based on the sale or disposal of chemical products in Australia. In addition, the bill allows for the authority to make an assessment as to whether a levy payment is required and the amount of the levy-if any-that is due. It also makes provision for a review process for persons dissatisfied with a levy assessment. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.

228,Mr LEE,CHEMICAL PRODUCTS LEVY,"Dobell-Minister for Resources and Minister for Tourism) (6.19 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill and the associated bills replace the existing Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 and amend its associated acts. At this stage I would like the House to note that whenever I mention the word 'states' in the rest of this speech I am also including the Northern Territory. The existing act, which is a consequence of the offshore constitutional settlement, provides the legal framework for. the exploration for, and the production of, minerals other than petroleum on Australia's continental shelf that is under Commonwealth jurisdiction. The offshore constitutional settlement divided the jurisdiction over the mineral resources of Australia's continental shelf between the Commonwealth and the states. The states have jurisdiction within coastal watersadjacent to them, while the Commonwealth has jurisdiction from the outer limit of coastal waters to the edge of the continental shelf. Under the offshore constitutional settlement to it was agreed that there would be a common offshore mining code that would apply to the whole of Australia's continental shelf beyond the territorial sea baseline proclaimed by the bills, Commonwealth in 1983. This common offshore mining code will be governed by a package of complementary Commonwealth and state offshore minerals legislation. The revision of the act is a result of. the states' dissatisfaction with it and an unwillingness by some states to enact complementary offshore minerals legislation so long as it remained in its present form. They considered that the existing act was not suited to the needs of the offshore minerals industry. The Commonwealth agreed to a compr-hen­ sive joint review of the act with the states. Following this review a large number of amendments was agreed to by the ministers of the Australian and New Zealand Minerals and Energy Council in 1990. The government also took the opportunity to have the legislation rewritten in the plain English style, recently adopted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, to improve its readability so that it could be understood more easily by those who will use it. The end result is that this bill contains many new features in relation to its overall organisation as well as in relation to individual provisions. In the preparation of the bill the Commonwealth closely consulted with the states and in doing so drew on their extensive experience in minerals administration, which has been greatly appreciated. The states at the same time confirmed their commitment to a common offshore minerals code. The bill, when enacted, will provide a model for state complementary offshore minerals legislation which will provide a common mining code to operate in areas under their respective jurisdictions. While the bill extensively modifies the mining code, it preserves those principles in the present act which flow from the offshore constitutional settlement arrangements. Those principles are: all offshore mineral activity in the Commonwealth area adjacent to a particular state is governed by a joint authority, con. sisting of the relevant Commonwealth minister and state minister;, the joint authorities are responsible for major decisions relating to titles, such as grants, refusals and the like and, in the event of a disagreement, the views of the Commonwealth minister prevail; the day-today administration of the Commonwealth legislation is carried out by the relevant state and they are the primary point of contact between industry and governments. As this bill deals with rights associated minerals exploration and exploitation, it ensures that this legislation is consistent with the government's policy in relation to native title. The provisions for the. granting of licences are non-discriminatory and administrative procedures, which are already in place, will ensure that Aboriginal interests are consulted when considering applications for any. of the licences which may be issued under this act. Operators will be required to respect Aboriginal rights and interests. The bill also retains the provision that offshore mineral royalties will be shared 60:40 in favour of the states. This sharing arrangement will apply to all minerals recovered under the authority of the common offshore minerals code. The states retain, and will continue to retain, all fees received from titleholders and applicants for titles. This is a recompense to the states for the expenses incurred in administering the Commonwealth legislation. The bill is divided into chapters. Chapter 1 covers the usual formalities, the constitutional and political background, the basic principles and concepts flowing from the offshore constitutional settlement, including the establishment of the joint authorities. Chapter 2 is the actual mining code itself, which is written to reflect modern mining administration practice and, because of this, it differs substantially from the cumbersome mining code in the existing act. The bill clarifies how applications for exploration licences are to be received and treated. As a general rule the applications will be allocated on a first come, first considered basis. The exception to this rule will be where applications for substantially the same area are received at the same time. On such occasions ballots will be used to determine the priority as to which application is to be considered first. The bill streamlines the existing provisions so that the manner in which an exploration licence is granted is simplified. It also alters the term of exploration licence renewals whereby the initial period will be for four years plus an option of three renewals of two years each. The maximum total term of a with licence remains unchanged at 10 years. The only major change in the provisions concerning the mining licence is the reduction in the maximum number of blocks from 50 to 20 for each licence. The bill provides for the introduction of a new title called a retention licence. This will be an intermediate form of tenure, between an exploration licence and a mining licence. Its primary purpose will be to allow the holder of an exploration licence to retain, for a strictly limited time, title to an area on which a significant deposit has been delineated and evaluated, but which is not a commercially viable proposition in the short term although there is a reasonable prospect for development in the longer term. Under this title the holder will not be able just to sit on the area but be required to undertake further work according to the conditions laid down by the joint authority. . The bill introduces a provision which will require applicants for a title to lodge securities as a condition of title. These securities, which may be varied up or down during the life of a title, will be used to ensure compliance with the legislation, regulations and conditions of the title. The securities may also be used to pay for rectification of any environmental damage as a result of operations, rehabilitation of the title area's environment and the settlement of any outstanding financial obligations. The bill provides for the creation of an instrument to be called a special purpose consent to undertake scientific investigations and reconnaissance surveys, and to collect small quantities of minerals. The consent will be a non-exclusive authority and it will not give any right or priority should an exploration licence or any other title be applied for later. The remaining chapters of the bill provide for the normal requirements assqciated with mining administration. Chapter 3 of the bill provides for the keeping of a register and the details that are to be entered into it and so on. lt also provides for dealings in licences and authorities and the details of the procedures that are to be followed. Chapter 4 provides the administrative details of the offshore minerals code such as information management, monitoring and enforcement, review of decisions, administrative procedures and finance. Chapter 5 provides for the application of state laws to the offshore area under Commonwealth jurisdiction and miscellaneous matters. The provisions in the five associated bills deal with money matters and are contained in separate bills. The Offshore Minerals (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1993 amends the associated fees acts. The Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence Fees) Bill 1993 deals with fees payable for retention licences. The Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Amendrnent Bill 1993 amends the royalty act. The Offshore Minerals (Exploration Licence User will Charge) Bill 1993 and the Offshore Mirierals (Retention Licence User Charge) Bill 1993 impose user charges on exploration and retention licences as announced in the 199394 budget. Discussions are still under way with the states for the establishment of a common offshore minerals royalty system and further amendments to the associated royalty act will be forthcoming at a later date. These bills provide a modem legal and administrative framework for the offshore mining industry, which will help it grow as the years go by. They are a further demonstration of the government's micro-economic reform program to ensure, in co-operation with the states, that the barriers to the development of Australia's offshore minerals industry are minimised so that it can compete in the tough world trading environment. It is intended that once this legislation package is enacted, the states will introduce complementary offshore minerals legislation to apply within their jurisdiction. This will give effect to the agreement for a common offshore minerals code to apply right round Australia. I commend the bill to the honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.

229,Mr LEE,OFFSHORE MINERALS,"Dobell-Minister for Resources and Minister for Tourism) (6.28 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time.. This bill is part of the package of' offshore minerals bills. It repeals the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 and amends the associated money acts; that is the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Exploration Permit Fees) Act 1981; the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Production Licence Fees) Act 1981, the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act 1981 and the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Works Authority Fees) Act 1981. The bill amends the names of the acts and makes other changes to the terminology to fit in with the language of the Offshore Minerals Bill 1993. The new names of the acts will be the Offshore Minerals (Exploration Licence Fees) Act 1981, the Offshore Minerals (Mining Licence Fees) Act 1981, the Offshore Minerals (Registration Fees) Act 1981 and the Offshore Minerals (Works Authority Fees) Act 1981. The main substantive amendment to the acts is the provision for the levels of fees to be by regulations. This will enable more convenient amendment of the levels of fees when such an amendment is required to reflect the costs of administration of the legislation. The levels of fees have not been amended since 1981 and it is intended that new fees to be set by regulations would d<,mble the existing amounts. The intended annual fees are $20 per block for exploration licences, $200 per block for mining licences and $20 per hectare for works licences .. The registration fee for the transfer or dealing of an interest in a licence will not be raised and will remain at 1.5 per cent of the value of the dealing. The bill sets a ceiling on the amounts that may be prescribed by regulations. The ceiling is not intended to reflect any intended rises in fees but merely provides an upper limit for fees well into the future. The bill also provides that multiple holders of licenses are jointly and severally liable for the payment of any fees. It should be noted that, in accordance with the offshore constitutional settlement, administration of the offshore minerals legislation is carried out by the states (;m behalf of the Commonwealth. The fees collected are paid to the states in recompense for their administrative effort. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.

230,Mr LEE,OFFSHORE MINERALS,"Dobell-Minister for Resources and Minister for Tourism) (6.30 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of the package of offshore minerals bills. . The Offshore Minerals Bill 1993 introduces a new form of title called a retention licence which would allow a company to retain a proved mineral deposit set without working it, if it could demonstrate a good reason for delaying production. This bill imposes an annual fee to cover administrative costs. This is consistent with the other licences under the legislation where an annual fee is payable for each licence. The actual amount of the fee will be set by regulations but the bill imposes a ceiling on the amount that may be set. It is intended that the fee will be set for the present at· $200 per block. The maximum area of a licence being 20 blocks, this could mean a maximum other annual fee of $4,000. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gallus) adjourned. MINERALS (SUBMERGED LANDS) (ROYALTy) AMENDMENT BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Lee, and read a first time. Second Reading",139
231,Mr LEE,OFFSHORE MINERALS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of the package of offshore minerals bills. The bill amends the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Act 1981 to fit it into the language of the new offshore minerals legislation and renames it the Offshore Minerals (Royalty) Act 1981. This is a purely technical amendment. The new offshore mineral legislation changes the name of production licence to mining licence and, technically, this is a new title. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the holder of a mining licence is liable to pay royalty, and the bill does that. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gallus) adjourned. NA (EXPLORATION LICENCE USER CHARGE) BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Lee, and read a first time. Second Reading",139
232,Mr LEE,OFFSHORE MINERALS,"Dobell-Minister for Resources and Minister for Tourism) (6.33 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of the package of offshore minerals bills. The government announced in the budget that a user charge will be imposed on all Commonwealth offshore petroleum and minerals exploration and retention licences. The purpose of the charge is to raise from the industry approximately half of the cost of the geophysical work undertaken by t-e Australian Geological Survey Organisation in its continental margins program. The bill imposes an annual user charge on all offshore minerals exploration licence holders. The level of the charge will be set by regulations but the bill imposes a ceiling on the level that may be prescribed. The charge will be payable to the Commonwealth. The work done in the continental margins program is aimed at offshore petroleum and little, if any, benefit flows from minerals companies. It is therefore intended that at present the level of the charge for offshore minerals licences will be zero. However, the bill provides a mechanism for the setting of charges for holders of offshore minerals licences if and when the program is reoriented towards offshore minerals. The user charges will be reviewed at the time of the major review of the continental margins program in 1996-97. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gallus) adjourned. OFFSHORE MINERALS (RETENTION LICENCE USER CHARGE) BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Lee, and read a first time. Second Reading",140

This bill is part of t\:le package of offshore minerals bills and is identical to the Offshore Minerals (Exploration Licence User Charge) Bill 1993. The bill imposes an annual user charge on all offshore minerals retention licence holders. As with the exploration licences, and for the same reasons, it is intended that at present the level of the charge will be zero but will be set at an appropriate amount when the continental margins program is reoriented towards offshore minerals.

239,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I am pleased to present two reports of the commit;. tee: Report No. 328-Report of activities, 1992-93; and Report No. 329-Finance Minutes. Ordered that the reports be printed. Mr LES S.COTT-by leave-The first of these reports is the committee's annual report of activities for the financial year 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1993. The report continues the practice established by the committee in 1976 of informing the parliament of the committee's activities in the preceding financial year. The period 1992-93 was a productive one for the committee. It presented seven reports to the parliament. The reports covered a wide range of subjects, including: human resource management in the Australian Public Service; support for private sector research and development activities; and administration and management in a number of Commonwealth organisationsincluding the Australian Customs Service. The committee has experienced generally good relations with the public sector organisations it dealt with in the year under review. In particular, the Department of Finance and the Australian National Audit Office have continued to assist the committee in its work. Their support has been of great assistance to ,the committeeThe second of the reports I am tabling tonight is a compilation of the Department of Finance minutes received by the committee in the 1993 calendar year. As many honourable members will be aware, the Finance minute process is the mechanism by which the government responds to many of the recommendations contained in committee reports. The only recommendations which are not responded toby a Finance minute are those which address policy matters. Recommendations of this nature are responded to separately by the government. Report No. 329 contains copies of the seven Finance minutes received by the committee during 1993. They were Finance minutes dealing with the committee's. reports on: the social responsibilities of Commonwealth statutory authorities and government business enterprises; the Department of Defence's supply systems redevelopment project; public sector research and.development; the independent auditor; six .performance audits; and the Midford Paramount case and related matters. Each of these Finance minutes has already been tabled separately but they are reproduced now in an annual consolidation for ease of future reference. All of these Finance minutes, with one exception, were originally tabled in the parliament without comment by the committee. The exception was the Finance minute on the Midford Paramount case. The Finance minute on the Midford Paramount case was tabled on 28 November 1993, together with extensive comments by the committee. The committee's comments addressed, in particular, the views expressed by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in an appendix to the Finance minute. Mr Speaker, as we near the end of the year I would like to extend Christmas wishes to all the staff of the parliament who contribute to the work of the committee: the committee secretariat, Hansard, the Sound and Vision Office, parliamentary attendants, the library, and staff in the duplicating, travel and finance sections of the Department of the House of Representatives. In conclusion, I would also like to record my thanks to Senator John Watson, the former Vice-Chairman of the committee, to Senator Warwick Parer, the current ViceChairman, and to all my colleagues on the committee, for their efforts in furthering the reputation of the 'powerful and influential public accounts committee'. (Quorum/ormed) NA Delegation to 90th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union",141
240,Mr LEO MCLEAY,DELEGATION REPORTS,by leave-I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 90th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Canberra from 13 to 18 September 1993. I seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.,142
241,Mr LEO MCLEAY,DELEGATION REPORTS,"UsuaIly, I am willing to thank the Chairman of the JointCommittee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), for being less loquacious, but tonight is one of the few occasions on which I wish he had talked for longer. Having said that, I apologise to the House for being late for the presentation of this report. I would like to make a few remarks about the conference that was held here in Canberra. Mr Speaker, first, I would like to congratulate all the officers of the parliament and, in particular, Ann Hazelton, the coordinator of the conference, for the work they did in putting this conference together earlier this year. I think it was a singular honour for Australia to host the IPU conference. It has been a very good thing for this parliament in the eyes of parliaments around the world. Indeed, last week I attended a meeting of the IPU executive in Geneva where there was unanimous commentary that the conference we held here was one of the best in recent years. The view was that our colleagues in France who will host the conference in March next year will have a lot to keep up with if their conference is to be as good as the conference that was held here. A number of important issues were canvassed at the conference. A number of friendships were made by people in Australia with delegates from around the world. I kn-w that the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) will also have some things to say about the conference. From the point of view of the delegation, Mr Speaker, the work that you did as chairman of the conference is to be commended. I think this conference showed the world a lot of interesting and different things about Australia. The fact that we had Lois O'Donoghue, the Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, address the opening showed the world what a different perspective Australia had. Th- fact that we were able to accommodate all the delegates in this parliament and the fact that a whole range of members were willing to entertain, talk to and have various bilateral meetings with people I think ensured that Australia came out of that conference in a very good light. I would like to thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) for the funds provided for the Australian delegation, of which I was the leader, to entertain our colleagues from the Asia-Pacific region at a dinner during the conference. I think that attracted some considerable credit for Australia. It was an excellent evening that all those delegates and the Australian contingent enjoyed. It built up a level of camaraderie which I think was good for all of us. The issues canvassed at the conference allowed politicians from Australia and around the world to get a view of where parliaments stand and where we as individuals see our position. There is no doubt that some people in the press in Australia attacked the conference as being a bit of a talkfest, which I think is a rather stupid, insular approach to take. By attacking it as a talkfest they missed the One of the important things about these types of conferences Is that it is the friendships people make which allow people from other parliaments, when they go back to their home parliaments, to remember us in Australia, and it allows us as Australian members of parliament to get a personal perspective on where people from other parts of the world come from. I think that the IPU, which has about 130 parliaments as its affiliates, is probably the best forum for members of parliament to work out what they feel about their colleagues. Earlier I talked about the organisation of conference and the work that Ann Hazelton did. I think over the two or three years of the planning for the conference Ann started out in some sort of panic that she might not have been able to do it. As you and others have said, Mr Speaker, she represented this parliament very well. . The fact that the honourable member for Moncrieffwas the Chairperson of the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians was also a credit to Australia. As I said, I recently went to an executive meeting in Geneva. The three women members of the executive were unanimous in their praise for the way that that meeting was organised here in Australia. Like the Australian Labor Party, and no doubt the coalition, the IPU is working towards having parity between male and female' members. The IPU has a special committee on parity with the goal of trying to ensure that there are far more women represented at IPU meetings. I suppose in some ways I am a bit sad in that there is obviously a larger representation of women at jpu meetings than there is in this House of Representatives but, hopefully, in the short term, both sides of parliament here mightaccommodate that. The interesting thing is that while the IPU has a parity committee on membership, without being too difficult with the Clerk, the parity has not worked with the officials as the IPU still has all male officials-as does the SES, with one exception in the Department of the House of Representatives. That one exception has at least broken the ice a little. point. I know that Mr Barlin is committed to the fact that we should be promoting people on that ability rather than anything else.' The conference here in Australia was a good one for Australia; it was a good one for the IPU and, ill my' view, the Australian delegation acquitted itself very well. In particular, the people who work for the parliament here, from Mr Barlin, Mr Templeton and Mr Evans down, showed that the professionalism that we have in this place is better-it is not as good as, it is better than anywhere else in the world. The last conference was a credit to those people, and we as the the delegates and you as the Speaker can all bask in the glory that they caused to be reflected upon'us. I commend the delegation's report I know that my colleague the deputy leader, the honourable member for Moncrieff, will have some things to say. She keeps looking at the clock thinking I have eaten into her time, but we both now realise that even though we have a notional 10 minutes the clock is .not working, so she can talk for 15 or 20 minutes. I had better sit down because I have probably already spoken for 10 minutes. I thank the House and the members of the delegation for the support that they gave. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for the way in which you conducted the conference. I particularly thank the staff of the parliament right across all the parliamentary departments for the credit that they reflected upon us by the job that they did.",142
242,Mr SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Before I call the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), given that we are debating such a significant report, it is probably worth reporting to the House that the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) recently, in fact last week, was made the Vice-President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Can I extend the congratulations of the House to the honourable member for Watson on such an important appointment Honourable members-Hear, hear!",144
243,Mrs SULLIVAN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I am grateful to you, Mr Speaker, for pointing out that important point As the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) mentioned, there was a notional limit of 10 minutes on this debate which is about to expire in about 10 seconds. However, we did have an agreement we would have five minutes each, so I hope, Mr Speaker, you will give me a little more than 10 seconds. On an earlier occasion, immediately after the conference, some statements were made in this House with respect to the conference. I made some comments about the staff, the support that we received and how the conference went I hope that those interested in my views on that will look at that speech. There are some things I want to say in relation to the IPU and this report, with a little help my front-bench, this evening. This was the last conference that I shall attend as the representative of Australia. Over the last three years I have attended conferences as the opposition so-caIled permanent delegate; that is, together with one government representative I have been the person who attended all conferences in the life of one parliament It is my obligation now to retire, somewhat sadly I might say. Nevertheless, it has been a wonderful experience. There are a couple of things I want to point out to the Australian parliament and put on record. I think Australia has a unique and very important role to play at IPU conferences, not least because we operate within the Asia-Pacific group. There are actually only three Pacific countries which attend the IPUAustralia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Australia and New Zealand are the only countries which attend every conference of the IPU. I in particular was aware of that fact in attending conferences. I felt that there was a particular obligation on Australia-New Zealand of course picked up this obligation too-to make sure' that the interests of the Pacific were properly represented. We operate within the Asia-Pacific group, as well as the so-caIled Twelve Plus Group, which is the western European democracies. Australia and New Zealand are the only two western European style democracies which are members of the Asia-Pacific group and, as I said, together with Papua New Guinea are the only Pacific countries to attend. The Asian countries are enormously significant Geographically they range from Iran through to Japan, and include giants such. as India and China as well as the other Asian countries that one would expect. It is therefore incumbent on Australia to make sure that the Pacific's interests are reflected at the IPU conferences, and we did that through the Asia-Pacific meetings and through our participation on drafting committees. Australia is very active on the committees that draft the resolutions voted on at the end of a conference. A couple of the drafting subjects had very particular relevance to the Pacific. At the first conference I attended, from which was in Uruguay, I was on a drafting committee concerned with the subject of colonialism. On another we were involved with the subject of the environment, which had very particular significance to the Pacific because of concerns about long-line fishennen in Japan. Obviously, at times there are inherent conflicts within the Asia-Pacific group. I am pleased to say that, on behalf of Australia, I was successful in raising AIDS as a supplementary item for discussion at a conference in Cameroon. The subject of AIDS is one of great significance to a number of Asian countries, but while China, Thailand and India were very strong in their support for making AIDS an item for discussion Japan was very strong in its opposition to it. a subject for another day. Nevertheless, Australia has been very active in promoting issues of significance to the region. The conference held at Canberra in September was an opportunity for the promotion of Australia. I pay tribute to the honourable member for Watson for the efforts he made to bring the conference to Australia. I might add that there was not any opposition to its coming to Australia. In fact, I can remember conferences where we were approached by people asking, 'Could you have it there sooner?'. Whilst hosting a conference is expensive, it provides a great opportunity for promotion of the host country. It promotes goodwill amongst all the visiting countries, and it promotes a sense of parliamentary process. I am sure that the fact that the conference was held here meant that a number of countries who possibly need to sharpen up their democratic instincts went away with a better idea of how a parliamentary system works within a democratic context. I also wish to refer to the pre-conference meeting of women members of parliament. The colour photograph on the cover of the IPU report shows a meeting of the women MPs. Nobody has mentioned this, but the woman in red, sitting at the head table-just to the left of where the clerk is sitting at the moment-is me. I am very grateful for being accorded the opportunity to chair that meeting. It was of great assistance to the meeting that day that there was a woman in the chair who had actually attended previous IPU conferences. Traditionally, the pre-conference meeting is chaired by the most senior woman MP from the host country. In my experience, that had always been a woman who had not previously attended an IPU conference and consequently did not know what was required on the day. It was of very great help to me and to the meeting that I had been to previous conferences, and I hope it is a practice that future IPU conferences will follow. I was, of course, the first woman MP to be appointed a penn anent member of Australia's delegation to the IPU. I had hoped that the government would follow suit in time. There That is are women from the government side who have attended IPU conferences in the time that I have been a delegate, and I particulady mention Senator Reynolds and the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio)-it was great to have them along-and Senator Reid, who was a member of our delegation last time. I hope that both government and opposition-particularly the government-take the opportunity to include women amongst their delegations in this forthcoming parliament. The opposition probably feels that it has at least done its duty in that respect for the last parliament. As for the future, it is a matter of who nominates for the position. I would like to convey my thanks to some members of staff whom I have not mentioned on previous occasions. John Dyer was a great support to the delegation in the time that I have been connected with it. While he is no longer the secretary to the delegation, he was on the last occasion that it met. Then there is Pam Macdonald, the new Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade support person, and Bill Neilson, who preceded her in that position. The foreign affairs people have been a great support. They get all sorts of curly things thrown at them at these conferences without any warning or preparation time, yet they always measure up in a very professional way. Mr Speaker, havirig extended my time by a minute or two, as part of my swan song I thank you for your role in the conference. It was much admired. You certainly rose to the occasion, even though you were there on short notice. It was an excellent conference all round. I extend my very best wishes to all future Australian parliamentary delegates to IPU conferences. They are a very important fora for Australia. There is a proud tradition associated with them, which I did my very best to uphold and which I am sure future delegates will work equally hard to uphold.

245,Mr LES SCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave- Mr Speaker, I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Five Pacific Island Nations, 4 to 22 July 1993. I seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",146
246,Mr LES SCOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Mr Speaker, the main purpose of the delegation was to strengthen relations between the Australian parliament and parliaments in the countries visited and to advance the knowledge of these countries by our delegation members. I am pleased to report that in achieving these objectives the delegation was a great success. In every country visited our host was the Speaker of the national parliament, who offered us generous hospitality and every opportunity to appreciate all aspects of parliaAustralia mentary activities. This personal interest by the Speaker ensured that everything went smoothly and emphasised the common interests of parliamentarians elsewhere. It was obvious from our contacts with the different Speakers and members that the Australian parliament, as an institution, is well regarded in the Pacific islands and that delegations such as our own foster this regard. In all countries we also had discussions with ministers and senior officials, and in countries we visited the head of government. This enabled delegation members to increase their knowledge and appreciation of the achievements of each country and of the challenges facing them. The delegation did not, however, confine its activities to talks with leaders. In every country, we visited Australian aid projects and commercial developments outside of the capital and had the opportunity to talk with local workers and villagers. The delegation spent its longest time in Papua New Guinea. This was appropriate, because PNG is the largest Pacific island country and is also the one with which Australia has the closest historical and traditional links. In PNG our host was the Speaker, Bill Skate, who personally welcomed us and ensured that we saw as much as possible of parliamentary operations and of their most impressive parliament house. In PNG, however, at our own request we spent most of our time in regional centres rather than in the capital, Port Moresby. During this time we were accompanied by the Deputy Speaker, Ben Okoro, whose reputation and presence resulted in this part of our visit being what I personally regard as a highlight of my time as a member of parliament. In these regional centres of PNG we were also fortunate to be the guests of provincial parliaments and administrations. Links between the Australian and PNG people are particularly strong and affectionate. To an older generation of Australians there are memories largely based on the Second World War and the tenderness and compassion of the famous fuzzy wuzzy angels, which will always be part of Australia's heritage. continues to be indebted to the PNG people for this assistance. The delegation visited the two largest Australian war cemeteries in PNG, which are a moving testimony to these links. However, with generational change and personal memories fading, it is essential that these links be confirmed and maintained. On the parliamentary level, this could best be achieved by continuing and up-grading parliamentary delegations such as our own. In particular, four Australia's relationship with PNG is sufficiently important for delegations that visit only that country. Also, because of what we believe is the special relationship between Australia and PNG, the delegation suggests that the committee exchange program which at present operates between the Australian and New Zealand parliaments should be extended to the PNG parliament. This would be an appropriate recognition of that special relationship. Apart from parliamentary matters, Australian aid was probably the most discussed topic in our talks in PNG. At present, there is considerable debate in Australia and elsewhere about the merits of budgetary aid as opposed to aid for individual projects. In PNG, following discussions with both PNG nationals and Australian expatriates and observations of a number of aid projects, we concluded that project aid was effective and efficient. However, the delegation recognises that the eventual mix of aid is a matter for Australian and PNG governments. The committee is also aware of some debate in Australia about the situation in Bougainville. While we did not visit that island, our discussions led us to believe that the Australian position on the Bougainville issue was accepted and appreciated by PNG. Here again, this is a matter for our respective governments rather than parliaments. The final matter which the delegation wishes to raise in respect of PNG is the position of Australian business. In all parts PNG which we visited, New Zealand business houses were strongly competing for the market. The delegation wishes to point out the opportunities for Australian business in PNG, where participation results in our mutual advantage. After PNG the delegation visited the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. In both of these countries we were honoured to be the first Australian parliamentary delegation. This was a considerable privilege for the delegation. In the FSM, we were the guests of Speaker Jack Fritz and in the Marshall Islands of Speaker Kessai Note, both of whom showed the delegation marvellous hospitality. The warmth of our reception in these two countries was particularly gratifying, not only because we were the first Australian parliamentary delegation but also because neither the FSM nor the RMI have the same traditional links with Australia as the other countries visited. Nevertheless, on the parliamentary level, the visits were very satisfactory. The FSM was the only country we visited with a federal constitutional system, so there was much to see and to compar-. In the RMI we visited the new parliament complex, known as the Nitijela, which was just being completed. The delegation is pleased to report that, as a result of its initiative, Australia was able to provide a speaker's chair for the new chamber. We thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), for your assistance in delivering that chair to the new parliament of the Marshall Islands. The delegation believes that it is important that the Australian parliament builds on the goodwill towards Australia the evident in the FSM and RMI by instituting regular parliamentary exchanges and by other contacts, both regional and bilateral, which emphasise the role of parliament. This is already being maintained with the delegation led by the President of the Marshall Islands visiting Australia last week. Apart from parliamentary matters, while in the FSM and RMI the delegation mainly discussed development and the environment. Both these countries consist of a number of scattered island groups, which presents parof ticular problems for economic development. Both countries, however, are meeting this challenge in appropriate ways. The environment also presents challenges, particularly for the RMI. Whereas the FSM consists of island groups which are largely volcanic, with steep mountains and fertile soil, the RMI consists of coral atolls scarcely one metre above sea level. Thus, any continuance of global warming and a consequent rise in the sea level would have the most serious consequences for the RMI. The committee visited an Australian aid project which monitored this process and suggests that this type of project is a most appropriate use of Australian aid resources. Finally, the delegation visited Western Samoa and Tonga, both of which have ties to Australia resulting from relative geographic proximity, membership of regional organisations and, increasingly, the island communities resident in Australia. A number of Australian parliamentary delegations have previously visited these two countries and it was a privilege and a pleasure to continue and expand these contacts. In Western Samoa we were the guest of Speaker Afamasaga Fatu Vaili, who showed us great personal kindness, particularly in enabling us to experience traditional village culture. In Tonga our host was Speaker Fusitu'a. I am pleased to acknowledge that the Tongan Speaker is in Australia at the moment. He was in the parliament earlier today. I, with other members of parliament, was pleased to enjoy a meal with the delegation this evening. I acknowledge the presence of our Tongan parliamentary friends in the gallery this evening. The hospitality extended by the Speaker and our friends in Tonga was similarly generous. In Tonga we also witnessed the great strengths of traditional values. In addition, one of my local friends, Joel Mafi, a Tongan, was able to visit Tonga while I was there and so I had the opportunity to visit some of his friends and relatives in Tonga to give me a much closer first-hand knowledge of life there. In both these countries, there was considerable discussion of the vibrant Western Samoan and Tongan communities which contribute much to Australian life. I acknowledge that I have a large Western Samoan community in my electorate. Another major highlight in both Western Samoa and Tonga was a visit to the headquarters of an important regional organisation. Western Samoa this was the South Pacific Regional Environment Program, an autonomous intergovernmental organisation. Its function is to encourage sustainable development in its Pacific island members. In Tonga it was the South Pacific Alliance for Family Health, which is a non-governmental organisation addressing women's health issues in the Pacific. Australia makes a substantial contriand bution to both organisations, which do effective work. Australia should further assist the operations of such regional bodies. In particular, the South Pacific Alliance for Family Health was doing a tremendous job right throughout the South Pacific. In light of an earlier paper today by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), I think it is very important to highlight where our aid is assisting in that area. I congratulate everyone associated with that organisation in Tonga because of the good work that it is doing in family health. In all the countries visited, our talks with ministers and other leaders covered a wide variety of topics. As indicated earlier, aid, development and the environment were important everywhere. Health, education and training were also areas of crucial importance to the Pacific island nations. There were, however, other major issues which often were relevant to contemporary debate in Australia. For instance, the delegation discussed constitutional change and development, the processes of which varied considerably when compared to both Australia and the countries in the region. The national heritage of our respective countries was also an important topic. In this context, the delegation noted the strength of traditional island cultures and the central importance of native land-holdings in this continuing tradition. Given the current debate in Australia on the native title legislation, this was of particular interest to members of the delegation. Three of the countries visited-PNG, Western Samoa and Tonga-are already, with Australia, members of a number of regional organisations. Due to geographical and historical factors, the FSM and the RMI are less In familiar members of regional bodies to which Australia also belongs. The delegation believes that regional bodies in the Pacific islands seem a particularly appropriate and effective means to meet common challenges, such as environmental change. On another aspect of Australia's regional and aid programs, national leaders in all the countries visited expressed their satisfaction appreciation of the appointment of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). I think that we were the first parliamentary delegation to visit Pacific island states since this appointment and I can report the considerable interest and gratification shown in those countries at what was seen as an important new focus for Australia. The minister had already had extensive talks and discussions in many of the areas visited and the delegation can report directly to parliament that this appointment wi11 be of great benefit to Australia's regional objectives. The delegation was greatly assisted by Australia's representatives in the countries which we visited. These representatives include high commissioners Bill Farmer in Papua New Guinea, David Ritchie in Western Samoa and Jennifer Rawson in Tonga, and Ambassador Peter Stanford in the FSM and the RMJ. The delegation considers that the quality of our representation is high and that Australian resources in these areas should be maintained at least at their present levels. Finally, I would like to thank the other members of the delegation: the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who is in the chamber tonight and was the deputy leader of the delegation; Senator John Coulter, senator for South Australia; and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), who is also in the chamber this evening. I would also like to thank Mrs Kaye Charles, the wife of the honourable member for La Trobe, who accompanied the delegation in Western Samoa and Tonga. She was of great assistance at a number of our official functions and I offer our thanks to Kaye for this helpful assistance and friendship. David Creed was the hard working secretary to the delegation and I thank him for· his assistance on. the delegation and on the drafting of this report. It is certainly my pleasure to table this report this evening and commend it to members of parliament for their reading.",146
247,Mr CHARLES,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I would like to take this opportunity to thank the parliament of Australia for giving me the opportunity to participate in this delegation. For me it was a truly eye-opening experience. I told a number of our guests at several functions during our tour of five Pacific island nations that it seemed to me that Australia had always viewed itself as a piece of Europe transposed somehow magically into the South Pacific and operating in a European environment in the location in which we find ourselves. For me, it was an opportunity to view the globe-or, if you wi11, the atlas-from a different perspective: the real perspective of meeting real people in the real community in which we live and in whi-h we must operate. It does seem to me that, increasingly, Australia is demonstrating to the people of the region, not only in Asia and South-East Asia but also to the many small island nations in the Pacific, that we belong here, we live here and we consider that we really are part of this region and so are they. I thank the parliament for giving me the opportunity of putting the two-dimensional layout that one sees on a map into perspective as a three-dimensional reality of people and places. My mind now locates Australia so very much more accurately than it did before we left. I also take the opportunity to thank the parliaments, the parliamentarians, the leaders and the people of Papua New Guinea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Western Samoa and, last but certainly not least, Tonga. They opened their hearts to us. They showed us the way that they live. They showed us the way that their very different parliaments and democratic systems operate. They were willing to share with us their needs and the kinds of things that Australia could do to help them. They were willing to share with us their homes, their food and their hospitality. We all thank them. It was a great learning experience. It was a hard working delegation. From time .to time, we hear in the electorates that the politicians have gone off on another junket. The people in the gallery and the people listening to this broadcast might be interested to know that it actually is hard work. From the best of my recollection, I think we had half a day off in four weeks. There was one stretch when I think we got up at 5.30 in the morning in Lae, on the north coast of Papua New Guinea, flew to Moresby, had a series of meetings there and then had a lunch where we met and talked with some members of parliament as well as business leaders and some of the bureaucracy of Papua New Guinea. We then got on a plane and flew to Brisbane. We sat on the ground in Brisbane for 5 1/2 hours. We then got on a plane and flew to Guam where we sat on the ground for 3 1/2 hours. We then got on a plane and flew to Truk and from Truk to Pohnpei in Micronesia. At Pohnpei we were met with a brass band, dancing girls, the delegation and the mayorthe lot. We immediately took our bags to our accommodation and went to a series of meetings with ministers and heads of various state departments. That evening, immediately after we finished the last meeting, we went to a state dinner hosted by the President. By the time we got to bed, we had been up for 47 hours straight. So those listening who believe that these junkets are not worth. while to Australia or believe that parliamentarians do not work while they are away might take heed. We received magnificent hospitality. I took the liberty of bringing what some might have viewed as an offensive weapon, but which is in fact a lovely ceremonial sword which was presented to me by the citizens and the local regional government of Wewak on the north coast of Papua New Guinea.",149
248,Mr COBB,DELEGATION REPORTS,A magnificent specimen.,150
249,Mr CHARLES,DELEGATION REPORTS,"It is absolutely magnificent. That demonstrates very clearly to me the friendship displayed to us as Australians by our hosts in every country that we visited. It was particularly interesting for me, with my sometimes twangy accent, in Papua New Guinea. The Papua New Guineans thought it was reaIly quite remarkable that one who had been born in the United States was in fact a member of the House of Representatives of Australia. But they accepted me as an Australian, as they accepted all of us, and reaIly were tremendous hosts. We learned a great deal about our region. \ It would be remiss of me to not advise the House and those who are listening that during our visit to Western Samoa the leader' of our delegation, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), had the great honour bestowed on him of being made a chief-Chief Tuia-Anafuaoletauola, Chief Scott. It was a tremendous ceremony. We learned a great deal about local customs. It was a great honour bestowed on our delegation and on Australia. I have photographs of the honourable member, for anyone who is interested. I can say that they are absolutely remarkable. I believe that, as the honourable member was led out to change clothes for the ceremony, he was heard to say, 'Oh, Bob Charles is going to love this'. The honourable member was something to behold. During the ceremony the honourable member for Oxley sat in his chair, sort of naked from the waist up with a pink flower behind one ear, and there was the pig on the concrete in front of him with a flower behind its ear. Some of us wondered which was the pig and which was the honourable member. They both had flowers. It was very nice, and a great honour to the delegation. AIl of our hosts were terrific hosts. All of the nations that we visited were particularly complimentary about Australia's aid program and Australia's approach to them. I thought that was fantastic. For instance, in the Federated States of Micronesia, even though their economy is dominated by American aid, they nonetheless seemed to appreciate more the small amount of help that Australia was able to give because of the manner in which it was given and the directions in which it was applied. Our patrol boats are particularly well received throughout the South Pacific. Micronesia was also interesting in that regard. Its parliament told us that it had some concerns about the patrol boats when they were first offered because they had thought, 'We may not be able to afford to meet the cost of running them and maintaining them'. But in fact within several months the Micronesians caught a Japanese fishing boat, I believe, fishing illegally and by the time they had finished with the Japanese in court they had $750,000 in' the federal coffers. Several months later, they captured an illegal Indonesian fishing boat. That one cost the Indonesians $1.3 million. At the time of our visit they thought patrol boats were the best thing since sliced bread. They were absolutely delighted with the patrol boats. It is interestTongan ing that we seem to have shifted the illegal fishermen from the south of the Pacific to the north. They have moved north as the patrol boats, in conjunction with Orions, have really taken over servicing the region. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues on the delegation. The honourable member for Oxley was an excellent leader. I enjoyed the company of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) and Senator Coulter as well. I thank the honourable member for Oxley for his kind words to my wife and I will pass his message along to her. My thanks go to all of our ambassadors and trade commissioners in the various countries that we visited for their assistance, their advice and their hospitality. I thank our hosts and I particularly thank the delegation secretary, Mr David Creed. I thank the House.",150
250,Mr QUICK,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-As a newcomer to parliament, I was indeed privileged in my first year to be given the opportunity to participate in a parliamentary ation which visited Papua New Guinea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Western Samoa, and Tonga. It is vitally important for Australia. to continue to strengthen the strong cultural, economic, educational and political bonds that we have built up with these countries and not diminish them in any way in order to cater for the obviously more high powered Asian countries. Touring these Pacific countries I could not help but be very impressed by the roles played by our ambassador and high commissioners and their dedicated staff members. In all cases they are vitally involved in all aspects of the country's development. As we toured the many regions throughout the countries that we visited, their expert knowledge and guidance proved to be invaluable. Similarly, our hosts in all countries also went out of their way-as the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) mentioned-to ensure that we were able to participate in the political, economic, educational, health, cultural and culinary experiences of these wonderful countries. It was very pleasing indeed tonight to renew friendships made on that trip when I met members of the delegation here in Parliament House. Our tour of Papua New Guinea was highlighted by visits to Port Moresby, Weewak, Madang and Lae. Each area was different in its cultural, geographic and economic aspects. Talks with provincial ministers enabled us to understand the enormous problems associated with providing remote areas of that country with adequate health, education and community services. Our visits to several Australian war cemeteries-beautifully maintained by local people-helped us to realise the enormous sacrifices made by Australian servicemen and women in this part of the world. One of the highlights of our visit was the Marshall Islands. Here we spent some time in the island of Majuro, an atoll some 40 kilometres long, with an average width of less than 30 metres and a height of less than two metres above sea level. We had first-hand experience of the potential problems associated with global warming when the sea rose several times a.bove the reef to cut off the deleg- only road on the island. Throughout our three-week tour we came across numerous examples of Australian involvement in this region: Australians from the Australian Volunteers Abroad scheme working in schools, hospitals and government administration; Rotary members in their time off building cyclone shelters; police officers, through an AIDAB funded scheme, working alongside their native colleagues; Australian businessmen establishing new trade links; Australian scientists working on the vitally important task of monitoring this area's fragile ecosystem; and Australian servicemen training crews on the patrol boats given to the countries by Australia. These people have done much to build upon the reputation Australia has in this region. Finally, I would like to thank my fellow parliamentarians: our leader, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the honourable member for La Trobe and his lovely wife Kaye and Senator John Coulter for their support on this trip. I would also like to thank David Creed, our secretary, for his invaluable assistance to us while we were overseas. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 October, on motion by Dr Theophanous: That the bill be now read a second time.",151
251,Mrs SULLIVAN,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Moncrieft) (8.53 p.m.)The Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment BiII is about correcting drafting mistakes found in earlier legislation. It is a terrible shame that honourable members' time is being wasted unnecessarily, when so many biIls are being pushed through the House at a rate of knots, and that honourable members are now merely correcting drafting mistakes which the government could have got right in the first place. Parts 2 and 6 of this bill make relatively minor changes to legislation governing the aged care program. These changes-which commence on the date of royal assent-will have no financial impact. Part 2 would make it an offence to make false or misleading statements, knowingly or recklessly, in support of various applications or submissions made under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act. This particular part of the principal act relates to Commonwealth subsidies for hostels and community aged care packages. Applications that are included in the proposed section include applications for financial assistance, for an approval for a service, for an approval to transfer a service, or for an approval as an approved operator. The offence also extends to documents given to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe), unless it is indicated that the document contains false or misleading information and reasonable steps are taken to provide the correct information to the minister. The maximum penalty laid down in the legislation is five years imprisonment. It would· be an offence, with a similar penalty, if false or misleading statements were made in relation to a submission seeking to contest a ministerial decision to revoke an approval. The coalition supports the proposed sections which would introduce an important safeguard into the parent act. Until now there has been a need to rely on general offences under the Crimes Act. Part 6 of the bill provides that nursing home records which are required for the verification of claims for Commonwealth benefits under the National Health Act shall be retained for seven financial years. This seven-year requirement would also apply to any other records that the secretary requires a proprietor to keep as a result of serving a notice in writing. The seven-year financial period will commence on 1 July after the financial year to which the records relate. It applies to records held at the date of royal assent, and finishes on 30 June seven years later. The penalty for not keeping such records for seven financial years is 200 so-called penalty units. This issue of penalty units is unusual-a new concept in this country. Australians are used to having to pay fines defined in currency. I understand that the move towards the use of penalty. points in Australian laws commenced in Victoria in 1981, and that Queensland and New South Wales have introduced similar systems. Amendments made last year to sections 4AA and 4BB of the Crimes Act introduced a penalty unit with a monetary value of $100. The base unit is specified in sections 4AA and 4AB of the Crimes Act 1914. Relating penalties to a central reference point in the Crimes Act means that the government does not continually have to update the value of penalties in a large number of relevant Commonwealth acts. I might point out that this is not much consolation to a nursing home proprietor who has no idea of the definition or monetary value of a penalty unit. What would be useful to assist these busy people would be information on where to find the relevant information. In the Senate the coalition successfully moved an amendment to section 18A regarding those penalty units. The amendment secured in the biII states that: Where a section of the Principal Act refers to a penalty in terms of penalty units, a note is to be added at the end of each such section in the following terms: 'For the definition and value of a penalty unit, section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914' The maximum penalty of 200 units is double the maximum penalty for a breach of the general retention provisions for nursing homes under section 61 of the National Health Act. In the Senate debate on this bill the coalition questioned why the maximum penalties in relation to the retention of records increased from $1,000 in 1991 to the equivalent of $20,000 in 1993. One has to query what criteria were used to decide the appropriate penalty. That is a huge jump in anyone's view-from $1,000 in 1991 to $20,000 in 1993. Following the Senate debate, a letter to the shadow minister for senior citizens and aged care, Senator Patterson, from the minister advised only that the 200 penalty units specified in subsection 61(4A) were set on the advice of officers of the AttomeyGeneral's Department. Nevertheless, the coalition concurs with the government on the matter of retaining records for seven years, which is normal bookkeeping practice for businesses for tax claims. Whilst the coalition will not be opposing the bill as a whole, we are nevertheless concerned about the long and protracted delays in validating nursing and personal care funding to nursing homes since the inception of the new funding system in 1987. Major concerns have also been expressed by representatives of both community based and private sector nursing homes about the government's conduct of nursing home validations: As a result, the matter was referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. When the preliminary report was presented to the Senate, Senator Patterson stated: However, every nursing home proprietor must have an undeniable right to a timely validation that is prospectively applied in accordance with a consistently defined and interpreted set of guidelines by validation teams acting in a professional manner . .. In its preliminary report, the Committee concludes that the validation process is a crucial part of the restructuring of nursing home funding and that it is not prepared to recommend its interruption while investigations are being carried out. see The main concerns are therefore those of timeliness, and the prospective application of funding criteria. Part 3 of the bill corrects two drafting errors in the National Health Act 1952 caused by the passage of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment (No.2) Act 1992. The changes are relatively minor. The most substantial of them relates to the secrecy provisions in the Health Insurance Act. As honourable members would be well aware, departmental officers often receive requests for information about public and private hospitals. The information sought includes names and addresses of hospitals, bed capacity, kinds of services provided, teaching status and whether the hospitals are public or private. Under current legislation this information is readily available in the public domain. Clause 16 allows an authorised officer to release certain specified information about hospitals. Given that the information is available in the public domain, the coalition will not oppose this clause.",152
252,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (9.00 p.m.)-in reply-I thank the opposition for supporting the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill. It is not controversial legislation; it is legislation which tidies up a few problems. The most important problem has been this question of the records kept in nursing homes. I agree with the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) that we have learned some things over the last few years. We keep tightening up this process. Hopefully these amendments will be all that is required in the future. I appreciate the opposition's support of the seven-year period. I think that is important. It is important that we constantly keep an eye on what is happening in the operation of nursing homes and hostels. I want to say in regard to that that some of the issues of administration and some of the questions involved with this will be raised again in the context of the Law Refonn Commission's report on aged care, for which I have executive responsibility. I give the assurance to the opposition that when we get the draft of that report we will make it available for public discussion and for discussion with the opposition so that we can ensure that we get right all the measures that are required for aged care services in this country, particupooling larly in nursing homes and hostels. I do not think there is much more that I need to say about this bill. I want to thank the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services for the hard work it has done this year in a range of areas in reform of legislation, in the massive job of putting in place big reforms, and in trying to get administration running more smoothly. The officers of the department, which is very large and complex, deserve recognition from the parliament and from the people of Australia for the hard work they do in the area of social justice for this country. Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, as this will probably be the last time that I speak in this House before the Christmas break, I want to wish you and all our colleagues a merry Christmas. I hope you will permit me to say a farewell to Mr John May, from the transport section of this parliament, who has been a great stalwart of this parliament for more than 20 years. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr Theophanous) read a third time. NA (""POINTS"" SYSTEM) BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 November, on motion by Ms MCHugh: That the bill be now read a second time.",153
253,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Berowra) (9.04 p.m.)Now that we are an hour ahead of the guillotine, we might be able to facilitate matters by dispensing with this matter quickly before the other two speakers arrive! We are discussing the Migration Amendment (""Points"" System) Bill 1993. What I am going to say might excite the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) to stay on. The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that this bill: simplifies the operation of the points system and mechanism provided for in ... the Migration Act 1958. The points system and pooling mechanism are essentially program control measures designed to enable efficient management of changes in total migration program numbers in the independent and concessional family categories. Of course, those categories are those which are most clearly able to test people's skills and abilities for entry to Australia and, for that reason, are particularly important because the only other category in which there may be some element of skilling required is that in relation to the entry under nomination by employers and the like. This bill is designed to replace the three-mark system currently in operation with a two-mark system consisting of a pass mark and a pool mark. I imagine that at this point we would be losing anybody who is unfamiliar with the operations of our immigration scheme. It is important to recognise that, in relation to the system in which we have been operating where people are required to obtain a pass mark to be accepted for migrant entry, it is a pass mark which is assessed on the basis of a person's skill, age and education. If the person is nominated by a family member, it includes whether or not those family members have been employed. It also relates to whether those family members are citizens of Australia. In other words, we are looking at a range of factors which enable us to make an assessment of the large numbers of people who would like to migrate to Australia in the independent and concessional family categories and to choose those who are more likely to settle well in Australia over time and those who have the personal characteristics which it is judged will facilitate that. Under these new arrangements, a qualifying score will be set by the government of the day. It will do so by regulations which will have to be met by applicants. Following an assessment of the prescribed qualifications of an applicant in one of the relevant classes of visa that people have to satisfy, an applicant's score will be compared with the pass mark and the pool mark which have been notified before. There can be one of three outcomes, we are told, if we read carefully the explanatory memorandum. It states: (a) An applicant who achieves a score that is more than, or equal to, the notified pass mark ... is taken to have received the qualifying score and is entitled to move on to the next stage of processing. Of course, that usually relates to character and health checking. The explanatory memorandum continues: (b) An applicant whose assessed score is less than the notified pool mark is taken not to have received the qualifying score with the consequence that the application must be rejected ... The third outcome reads: (c) If an applicant's assessed score is more than, or equal to, the notified pool mark but less than the notified pass mark, the application is taken to have been put into a pool. The explanatory memorandum continues: The Bill contains detailed arrangements regarding the manner in which applications in the pool are to be dealt with. Specifically, the Minister is required to compare the applicant's assessed score with any variations in the pass mark or in the pool mark, during the 12 month period following the assessment of the applicant's assessed score. The Bill makes it clear, however, that the Minister is not to re-assess the applicant's assessed score every time a variation is published and a comparison with the new mark is made. Depending on the outcome of any comparison of an applicant's assessed score against a varied mark the application will, in a manner similar to that outlined above in respect of the initial application of the points system, either be entitled to move on to the next stage for processing, be rejected, or remain in the pool. Once an application has remained in the pool for a period of 12 months following the assessment of the applicant's score, the applicant is taken not to have received the qualifying score and the application must be rejected. This process streamlines the management of applications which have been pooled by replacing the current arrangements of three pass mark reconsiderations and by incorporating a clear statement which sets out the circumstances and the time-frame within which applications are removed from the pool. The bill also makes some technical amendments mainly because of the introduction of the Migration Reform Act and some changes that are made there. These are technical amendments to bring the new bill into line. I remind honourable members that the points system for independent and concessional entry for migration was introduced in 1989. It followed the extensive reforms implemented after what is known as the FitzGerald report. The system was introduced to enable effective control of the numbers approved for entry into Australia. Essentially, it was to enable the government of the day to determine a total program in advance and then to try to bring in the specified numbers. In these two categories, that is, the independent and concessional family categories, there was some capacity to make variations whereas each of the other categoriesemployer nomination, very often in relation to the business migration program as it was, and the preferential family stream-was what was called demand driven. When dealing with preferential family we had to eventually accept all of the spouses, for instance, that qualified for entry under the test that had been specified. If more spouses applied in that year, there was no flexibility to reduce the rest of the program unless there was something similar to this floating pass mark in place. When this system was introduced it was well understood that it was an important control mechanism. I notice a particularly interesting comment in the second reading speech by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh). In the scheme as it was operating before-the three-tier system, as I have identified-where the number of successful applicants was inconsistent with the program planning levels, it was possible to lower the priority pass mark to allow more applicants to move to the next stage of processing. If there were a shortfall in the number of places to be filled, the pass mark could be lowered and a large number of people could be brought in very easily. That is fairly clear. . It was found that, when the numbers had to be reduced, the program was not so successful. That is essentially what the minister was saying to us. To lower the numbers of people in the pool was not possible because of the timelags and the requirement that people who had already been entered into the pool were there. They were difficulties associated with the management of the pool operation. It seems to me that it is appropriate to ensure that the system is able to be better managed. However, I wonder, as I do with most of these things, even though I might come somewhat innocently to these issues, whether there are some underlying reasons for the changes. I am merely speculating when I raise these matters, but it is interesting that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has foreshadowed recently that the numbers in the immigration program may have to rise. Given the suggestion that the numbers in the program accepted for entry may rise at a time when the government has significantly reduced the migration program over time, one could be forgiven for wondering whether the minister for immigration is better able to predict what might happen to the Australian economy than some of his economic ministers. Maybe he is suggesting that the economy will grow and unemployment will fall so significantly that one would want to increase the migration program. He may have in mind that there are skills that we require in Australia that we cannot obtain without increasing the numbers in the migration program, but it sits a bit uncomfortcame ably with some of the other matters that we have been considering of late such as the government's statement on unemployment in Australia at this time. A very interesting library paper has recorded that unemployment in Australia is at record levels. It is at its highest level in percentage terms since the Great Depression. One could be forgiven for wondering why the numbers in the immigration program need to increase at this time when we look at the circumstances that led to the reduction that the government undertook and the largely unchanged situation in employment. I wonder what some of the other factors are that might be influencing the government to look at a more flexible way of managing the pool. Mrs Crosio interjecting",154
254,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I did not hear what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Arts and Administrative Services said. It may have something to do with the fact that the government has in mind to make some changes to the humanitarian stream. That will have some significant consequences over time in relation to each of the other categories. That may be the reason that we need to be able to . make some changes. At the time the government managed to get an election out of the way, it managed to leave the humanitarian issues, those people making claims for humanitarian consideration, largely in abeyance. That was the situation. While the government agonised over whether they were substantial claims, those people were left hanging out there, for base political reasons. The government got the election out of the way and then it was able to make the decision comfortably to allow the approximately 20,000 students from the People's Republic of China permanent entry. The fact is that their relatives, in some 7,000 to 9,000 cases, are already here. The government then made a decision to allow, albeit under some tested provisions, all of the other people to stay in Australia. On the face of it, they are fairly questionable provisions because they will force all of the Chinese PhD students who have been in Australia to leave while all of those who under the ELICOS schemes, without a substantial education before they arrived in the majority of cases, will be allowed to stay permanently if they satisfy the criteria. That is a pretty poor choice in the way in which the government has tried to deal with the matter. That scheme will allow perhaps another 14,000 or 15,000 people-large numbers of them from the People's Republic of China, some from Sri Lanka, some from the fohner republic of Yugoslavia and maybe some others who have made claims for refugee status-to stay permanently, unlike the situation before where they might have been granted only a four-year temporary entry permit. To understand the linkage, every one of those people will become a permanent resident of Australia. What happens when those people have obtained permanent residency is that they the have a capacity to sponsor other family members under the preferential family stream or under the concessional arrangements which are the subject of the points testing arrangements. These changes that are being made to policy have the potential to increase significantly the numbers of people who can apply under both of those categories that I have spoken about-the preferential stream and the concessional family stream. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary will explain whether or not the linkages that are there are in part the reason for requiring a capacity to reduce-that is what the government is seeking-the numbers of people who will be admitted through the pool. If the parliamentary secretary reads again the minister's second reading speech, she will find that it is quite clear that the problem with the scheme as it operated was that the numbers could be increased quite easily but the numbers could not be decreased. So what we are being asked to approveand we do; we are not opposing the bill, I make that clear-is a situation· which will give that Oexibility. At the end of the day the government makes the decisions in relation to these matters. I know and understand that principle. But it is important that, in relation to this issue, ·the people of Australia understand why decisions are being taken and understand that, when important decisions are taken in relation to the humanitarian regime that is in place, they have before them the matters that the government had in mind when it took decisions. If those decisions are being taken, as I think they have been, for base political reasons, when one considers the timing it is important that people have an understanding that those factors were involved as well. While I am on this matter of humanitarian factors that are taken into account, I notice that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. in another place has referred to me by name from time to time. I have found in Hansard that he takes some of the support that I gave to the previous minister on aspects of the handling of refugee matters as a basis for extending that support in a way which is totally unreasonable-given my public utterances about the government's performance and about the total handling of those issues by the government. I notice that, on page 19 of the Hansard of Senate Estimates Committee F which dealt with the estimates of the department of immigration, the minister said in relation to the boat people: There were two aspects to that. I think it is generally accepted by Mr Ruddock, who was the previous spokesperson, and also by Human Rights mechanisms,whatever they arethat the treatment of the detainees and the level of service and support provided by the department was fairly good. There has been no criticism of that aspect of the department's service delivery. He then went on at the end of the page to say: ... I think it was accepted by Mr Ruddock and Senator Teague that, despite those hiccups in the processing that had been there, the delay in processing was not purely the province of the department. It related to other matters as well. Phillip Ruddockthere is a degree of familiarity thereaccepted that the process that we put in place on detention was still appropriate in these circumstances. The point I am trying to make is that the department is following the dictates of its political masters, both in terms of the government and the opposition. That has probably led it to be unfairly criticised at the moment. Mrs Crosio interjecting",156
255,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I want to make it very clear that, in relation to those matters, the minister was drawing a long bow. I thank the parliamentary secretary for her observations because, quite frankly, in relation to the humanitarian stream there is not an area in which I have been stronger in my condemnation of the government and its policies. Sure, I have accepted that it is appropriate under the circumstances in which people first came to Australia by boat that they enter into detention as part of a total framework of decision making in relation to people's entry into Australia. That in no way means that I condone the fact that people have been held in detention for four years because the government was incapable of administering a program or providing the resources to ensure that those matters were dealt with expeditiously and that people who had no claim were removed from Australia and that those people who had a claim were entitled to enter and remain. That condemnation is one of the shames that this government will bear because it provided resources that were inadequate to the task and it certainly was not in a position to administer a scheme fairly. I must say I do not think there has been a government that has been more roundly condemned than this one was in the judgment of Mr Justice Wilcox when he pointed out the double standards that this government had applied in relation to dealing with Chinese students and Khmer. Consider the fact that all those from one group were categorised as having a need for protection and all those from the other were categorised as having no need for protection. For the then Prime Minister of this country and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), who ought to have some experience in these matters, to have put at risk the decision making process-which they clearly did by their public statements-shows the ineptness of the people who are dealing with these matters. It is a fact. It cannot be denied. Mr Justice Wilcox is on the record. The decisions of the court are there for all to see. The public statements were known to us all. I have to say that, in relation to the handling of these matters, one of the aspects of it that I continue to regret is the extent to which we are moving in the special assistance category to a point where we now have criteria which are satisfied not by objecti-e standards but by the country of origin of a person-not by an objective standard as to whether or not the individuals have been persecuted or subjected to conduct in a way related to individuals in particular but merely the fact that they come from a particular country. This is the basis upon which their claims will be considered more advantageously than the claims of others. There may come a time when we will very much regret that, in relation to these special categories, we have allowed those sorts of factors to intrude into the decision making process. I do not know the extent to which the bill we are dealing with will facilitate the government as it tries to weave a path in relation to these particular matters I have addressed. It may well be that we are facilitating the way in which it will have to respond to these changes that have occurred because of the political considerations. That may well be the case. If it is, so be it because I think it is appropriate that the government of the day have the power to be able to either raise or lower the number of people within each of the categories which are meant to be flexible. In other words, this legislation is merely giving effect to the scheme the FitzGerald report originally advanced. It is for that reason that it is being accepted. In terms of the trends that we are seeing now, which have given rise to my colleague in another place Senator Short saying that we need to more thoroughly investigate a lot of these matters, the fact that we have left open our comments in relation to the further steps that might be taken in terms of the humanitarian issues that are at present under scrutiny, should not be seen as a basis in this legislation for endorsement by us. In other words, our support for this legislation is related to the principle of the way decisions ought to be made. It is not an endorsement of the decisions the government is taking. That needs to be clearly understood. As time goes on and we see more clearly the consequences of these decisions-a situation which is quite fluidwe might well have a lot more to say about it. It is very important that it be understood that the minister and the government are on wood in relation to these questions. Nevertheless, this bill will not be opposed by the opposition.",157
256,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary, to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services) (9.31 p.m.)-I view with surprise the fact that the honourable member for Berowra (MrRuddock), when he began the debate, started at great length to explain to us what the Migration Amendment (""Points"" System) Bill was all about, as if we could not read it in the explanatory memorandum. I thought, 'Fair enough, we will put it into Hansard. We will not go into a second diatribe from him about how we should or should not change'. Then, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be well aware-:-you were listening as well as I-he came up with how it would be supported. But this was not good enough. We always have the idea somewhere along the line that there will be deceit and under the table things because the government is not really trying to simplify the act, accordimmigration. ing to him. .But it is the intention of our Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and this government to simplify the present points system, a points system that has had a number of anomalies since it came into existence in 1989-and which has always been there to be amended. Before I go into the bill, which I support, I would like to correct some of the anomalies expressed by the honourable member for Berowra in his address on this bill. First we must have some honesty. There was a great diatribe about how all we did, as far as the timing of a decision on our Chinese students was concerned, was to get the election out of the way. How deceitful it is to say that. The commitment had always been given that those people would be given a temporary entry permit while consideration was given to the changing situations both in their country and here. At that time it was very clearly laid out that there would be a reinvestigation into what was happening. When people make a comparison, as the honourable member for Berowra does continually, between the Chinese students .and the Cambodians, Laotians, boat people-or whatever we call those people who came here by boat-the fact is that one group came to this country legally and one landed on our shores illegally. There is a great difference in those two points. Also, no matter what steps we took, I would have liked to hear the honourable member for Berowra, as loudly as he· has spoken in the House tonight, condemning all those lawyers and well-wishers who took on board the cases which they thought they would win very handsomely-but their representation and presentation proved very futile. At all times, the government went overboard in trying to be very fair in administering the law clearly and distinctly. Instead of condemning the actions taken in a very difficult situation, credit at least should be given where it is due. I do not mind the opposition being negative. I am used to the honourable member for Berowra being negative on any action or step this government has taken in the past or is taking at present on But surely, somewhere along the line, we will finally hear from the honourable member a little appreciation of where we are going in amending, the immigration legislation. Another point I would like to correct for the record is the 'deceitful' way we seem to be bringing in conditions of entry for all these terrible people who happen to be here in this country-his words not mine. One thing he is right on is that there probably are in the vicinity of 16,000 or 17,000 students. Probably about 9,000 are already here under other conditions of entry as spouses or direct family members of those students. But we have to be honest and say that the conditions of entry which they must meet in their application certainly are very stringent. They include having to be under 45; being able to take other degrees that are acceptable in this country-or are in the process of studying for those degrees; having a business running and people employed other than their family; and having a knowledge of English. The other thing that should be acknowledged about those people since they have been here while all the questionable decisions have been taken-questionable in relation to what the honourable member was saying-is that at no time have surveys shown that those people have been a drain on the economy. If there have been one or two, that problem has been very minor. We have to be very realistic. Whether mistakes were made in the past could be debated across the table in this parliament for a long time; but steps have been taken positively to amend that situation. At the same time, humanely, steps have been taken to say to those people who arrived in this country illegally, 'You cannot come in under this process'. I know that when the people from Cambodia fled their country, the country was unsettled. Since then there has been a government election and our people have been over there helping to restore peace. The country is at least trying to adapt to a democratic system. We are saying to those people that they have a country to return to and we will assist them in that. If they wish to return in 12 months, and the people who wish to support them with all their good intentions can show that they wish to continue to do that in 12 months time, they can show a relationship to the country and can apply to come back. But those well-wishers and do-gooders will also have to provide some sort of financial assistance for those people's passage back to this country and assist them either with a job or other support when they arrive. The message has been'spelt out clearly to people around the world that we are a humane country in our immigration process that has been put into place and amended over many years. But we are also saying that enough is enough. Even though we have wide shores we will not open them to everyone who chooses to build a boat or get on one. Those steps have to be taken and spelt out very succinctly and clearly. I hope that continues to be spelt out by our government. Mr Deputy Speaker, you gave me a long bow, as you did for the honourable member for Berowra, but I will now refer back to the bill before us. I repeat that the amendments seek to simplify the process of the points test used to assess our migrant applications, as indicated. under the independent concessional or extended family categories. It will now provide - ery clear and predictable rules but, most importantly, it will provide them with certainty. This has relevance to all Australians, irrespective of their background. This bill recognises the need to make the elements in the process of migration which has been so vital throughout Australia's development that much simpler. My electorate of Prospect, as has been stated many times in this parliament, is the largest multicultural area in Australia. population consists of something like 105 nationalities. We have a diverse range of people. One thing I· am very proud of is that in the last statistics it was shown that some languages were spoken in the homes, other than English. I am also aware that there is a wide array of issues in the migration debate. Those complexities do abound and will continue to do so; but they are going to be solved only with practical application and reassessment of the rules and laws we have in place. The honourable member for Berowra mentioned refugees and what we might do for them in a humanitarian way. I would also like to state that I am a little concerned about some of the objections expressed by our adult migrant education teachers who feel that 510 hours with our newly arrived migrants is not enough for them to learn English. The continual barrage we. seem to be getting in our electorate offices is rather disturbing because we certainly welcome these· people. We provide facilities for them to come to this country and for them to learn English. We understand that without a knowledge of English they will make very little contribution to the country-nor will they find jobs readily. Mr Ruddock-Five hundred hours is not enough. Mrs CROSIOI believe 510 hours is more than enough. It is equivalent to five months of schooling for our kids who go to school, if we were to take the example of a Monday to Friday school week. I believe that with solid application that is certainly giving those people a large incentive to learn the language. I will not refer to the' days of the 1920s and 1930s-perhaps even when my father-in-law came out here and had to pick up a comic book to teach himself English. That assistance was not available in the 1920s. I say, thank God that has now changed. But let us not then try to say, - Well , we have some people who need more, some people who need less; 510 hours is not enough, we want 900 hours'. I continue to refute that. I believe the facilities must be provided for the Our teaching of English. The facilities that are provided must be adequate and they certainly must be provided for our new arrivals. For those who need assistance and help to settle 98 in, we must have a time factor so that they can come back. Some mothers have indicated that they need to establish their families first and then have the opportunity of learning English. I believe that is all in place and it will continue to be in place. Personally, I think that 510 hours is more than enough. When we are creating easier paths to enable people from overseas to settle here, we should create easier paths that are logical and simpler. That is why we have the amendments in this bill that is before the parliament tonight. We see that the benefits flowing from our migrants to this country are very much a twoway affair. Historically, Australia's migration policies ,have focused on two major aspects. One has encompassed the need for people, economic development and security, while humanitarian factors represent another. The points system for independent and concessional family migration has operated well since 1989, but it needs to be changed. It needs to be understood that points are now to be given for different categories and those points are to be allowed to be assessed in a pool area. With regard to the adjustments, some people have complained that they could not understand what happened to their application when they did not quite make the mark. That is now going to be overcome. Very clearly, what is going to happen with the pool system is that the number of applicants in the pool will be able to be increased by the lowering of the pool entrance mark. I think the existence of what is presently in place-those three different mark systemshas certainly only operated to confuse all of our applicants overseas. I have had it continually expressed to me in my electorate office by people who have asked, 'What has happened? Why aren't we being accepted?'. It has had to be explained to them, 'You have a right to have your assessments reassessed but it requires gazettal and it requires time'. In some cases it has gone on for well in excess of 12 months. That has not allowed people, who have made applications, to plan their lives. It will now be very clearly defined. If people do not reach the pool mark, their application will be refused. If they reach the pool mark, they are then pooled and they know a decision must be made within 12 months. People who have got the pass mark will go immediately on to the further checks that are required with regard to health, security or whatever. It is now a very clear distinction rather than being left in never-never land, hoping somewhere along the line those people may get it or may not. I think we have to be very honest with our applicants. Certainly, we have to be honest with regard to this amendment. I believe that is why it is before the parliament tonight. It will replace that three mark system with a very simplified two mark approach which enables, as has been stated, the adjustment of the pool and the pass marks. The current requirement of three gazettals, I believe,has been too extreme. Under the present system those three gazettals of changed pass marks could occur over a period well in excess of those 12 months that I have indicated. That is why I am pleased that the conditions that are contained within these amendments will eliminate that uncertainty. This bill does not change the essence of the operation of the points and pooling system; rather, it refines the administration. That is what I thought the honourable member for Berowra might have touched on at least once during the 30 minutes in which he was on his feet. Our government will certainly have greater control over the numbers in the pool at anyone time. It will certainly be able to target tQe migration planning levels. Of course, the benefits are very obvious. I would like to refer to some that I see that this amendment bill will bring to this country. The people who are waiting in the pool will know that the maximum period of time before they meet or fail to meet the pass mark is 12 months. They can therefore plan their futures with certainty. It will be easier for people from non-English speaking backgrounds whose knowledge of English may be limited to understand the mechanisms of the Migration Act and regulations. The amendments will make the legislation less legalistic and certainly less complex than has been the case until now. I support the bill for various reasons, including that it allows the migration process to work more efficiently. Surely, we in government should be about having efficient legislation. Australia's migrant population has contributed significantly in many ways to Australia through sheer hard work and through the diversity of cultures that those many migrants have brought to our shores. Migrants have positive records in many arenas, such as in our sporting fields, in research and academic fields. They are well represented in all tiers of government and industry. To list the achievements of Australia's migrant population would be stating the obvious. Australia has reaped many benefits from its overseas born citizens. With the assistance of migrants we have created a modem, tolerant, prosperous and democratic society. Changes like the ones proposed in this Migration Amendment (""Points"" System) Bill are critical elements of the eral government's reform process of enhancing and continuing worthwhile migrant programs. Before I commend the bill to the House I, too, would like to take the opportunity, as the parliamentary secretary has already done tonight, to congratulate John May on his retirement. I believe that his retirement marks a point in the history of this parliament. I wish him and his family well. As I believe I will not have another opportunity to speak in these sittings, I also take the opportunity to congratulate all the staffour clerks, Hansard, all our attendants and workers in the parliament - and wish them and their families a healthy, happy Christmas. May we come back in 1994 full of tranquillity and appreciate what Australia's assets are. When we see what is happening around the world-the upsets, the trauma and the warslet us now, for once, appreciate what a great country Australia is. It is because of this parliamentary process; it is because of bills such as the one that is before the parliament at the moment. That is why I commend this bill to the House.",158
257,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (9.47 p.m.)-I would like to make a few comments on behalf of the government. Mr Ruddock-I thought you had spoken for the last time.",162
258,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I thought I had spoken for the last time, too. The honourable member for Berowra, who just interjected, has raised a number of matters. My colleague the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) made a number of very important points about this Migration Amendment (""Points"" System) Bill. One of the things she mentioned was the constant harping by the honourable member for Berowra when he was the shadow minister. Now that he is representing the shadow minister in this chamber, he comes into the House and says, 'We don't disagree with this bill. We agree with the general policy of this bill'. He then starts to get into fed- the government on the administration of immigration or on some other matter in relation to immigration that is unrelated to the bill. Mr Ruddock-A manifest failure.",162
259,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"That is a very interesting phrase because I attended the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia conference last weekend. One thing that was remarked upon was that the shadow minister, Senator Short, for the first time by anyone from the conservative side in a major speech admitted that the opposition in the last few elections, and in particular in the 1993 election,had comprehensively lost the ethnic vote. The honourable member for Berowra thinks this is amusing, but it is not amusing because he used to be the shadow minister. During the time that he was the shadow minister we raised on a number of occasions the fact that he represented a number of important issues in such a way that ethnic communities perceived the Liberal Party as being against their interests. That was the perception that they were given. When the honourable member for Berowra was first in this shadow portfolio after the election in 1990, we were led to believe that moderate positions would be adopted by the opposition. Instead, very tough positions were adopted by the opposition on a range of immigration and ethnic issues. As a consequence, the final humiliation for the opposition was in July 1992 when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) attacked multiculturalism in a very big way. That created a crisisMr Ruddock-You know that's untrue.",162
260,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"That is not untrue and I have read out the quotes. Mr Ruddock-Yes, and I have replied each time.",163
261,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"You have replied, have you? Mr Ruddock 'interjecting",163
262,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT, Order! The honourable member for Berowra will cease interjecting. Mr Ruddock-Don't misrepresent the position. .,163
263,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I am not misrepresenting him at all. If honourable members look at what all the academic commentators on this topic have said, they will see exactly what I am saying. The Leader of the Opposition dug himself into a hole with his comments on multiculturalism and then busily tried to get out of it. He spent the next six months trying to get out of it because the response from ethnic communities was furious. He said things such as, 'Yes; we have a multicultural society but we can't have multiculturalism'. He called multiculturalism a divisive policy. The Leader of the Opposition has at least recognised that mistakes made. Mr Ruddock-Clearly, what he was opposed to was your gross politicisation of these matters. He made it clear.",163
264,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Unfortunately the honourable member for Berowra has not recognised these points. The Leader of the Opposition tried to make an effort following the election-we do not know where he is at the moment-to at least recognise that something had gone wrong in the area of ethnic communities and multiculturalism. The same applies with respect to the criticisms of the immigration program. There were unfair and tough criticisms made of the immigration program by the honourable member for Berowra when he knew that an attempt had been made through the parliamentary committee that I chaired-the honourable member for Prospect was a member, and the honourable member for Berowra was the Deputy Chairman-to resolve each and every one of the major policy issues, including the question relating to the points system, which was also raised by the honourable member for Berowra. This referred to the impact on those people coming through the points system categories on the marriage issue. What did we do with the marriage issue? Did we run away from it? Of course we did not. We presented a parliamentary report, and we changed the rules on the marriage issue. The honourable member should go around this country and talk to people about the situation that used to exist. People used to get married for three or four weeks, get their permanent residence processed within the next two months and then have the marriage break up and that was the end of the matter. Mr Ruddock-You haven't dealt with it comprehensively at all.",163
265,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Berowra says that we have not dealt with it comprehensively. I can tell the honourable member-the honourable member for Prospect is an expert on these matters and can tell the House, too-that a lot of people are now saying to us that the two-year rule were has certainly cleaned out the place. How many people are prepared to undergo a relationship for two years in order to· get permanent residence? It is very hard to sustain. Mr Ruddock-Does that apply offshore too?",163
266,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT," Order! The honourable member for Berowra is not at liberty to debate this matter across the table. He has had his say. If he continues, I will deal with him. D"" THEOPHANOUS-When the honourable member was speaking and getting into the government, we said nothing. Now he is trying to interrupt every half a minute. The fact is that the honourable member does not like what we are saying. As I said, following the report we changed the rules so that we had a much cleaner and better regime on the marriage issue. There was a change of status on the basis of marriage so that people now have to wait for two years. Some people are not aware of this and try to get around the system. They are suddenly s.tunned to find that there is a two-year period. We have to make it perfectly clear that it will not be tolerated if people think they can get around the immigration system through false or nongenuine marriages. The honourable member for Berowra asked about overseas applicants. Our embassies are there to test overseas applicants who apply the basis of marriage. If somebody turns up at an embassy and says, 'This is my new wife', and then says, 'I am applying to come to Australia on the basis of marriage', we .have to ask questions. That is the job of the embassy. One of the most important questions asked is, 'How long have you known this person?'. They are also asked, 'What situation has led to this process?', and 'Have you only known this person for a few weeks or for several years? They are asked to produce evidence that there is indeed a genuine marriage. In most situations the evidence is clear. The honourable member for Berowra talks about imposing a two-year rule for overseas applicants. They have to display and demonstrate that they have been together for a period and that they have a proper marriage in the proper cultural context. Those people ought to be treated, in respect of their marriage, according to basic human rights under the international covenant. The honourable member for Berowra talks about the operation of the points system not being good enough. We do not get complaints about the operation of the points system. As the honourable member for Prospect said, we are now fixing that up. It will be a two-stage process, a much more simplified process. Mr Ruddock-You don't get complaints but you are fixing it up.",163
267,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"No, we have not had complaints about that aspect. As the honourable member knows very well, the matter about which people complain is the actual points they have been given for individual items under the points system. That is the issue that has been raised. That is not changing at the moment. I believe that the government has been very sensitive to input on this matter, especially the current Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). He is a very sensitive man on all these issues, and he has been very sensitive to the way in which this points system will operate in the future. If the honourable member for Berowra has any complaints about this he should forward them, on along with concrete suggestions, to the minister. There have been two stages in the modem points. system. It was introduced in 1979 by Minister Macphee-I am not entirely sure, but it was one of the conservative ministers. Mr Ruddock-It was Macphee.",164
268,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"It was Minister Macphee, who was one of the great ministers for immigration. The principle, together with the floating mark, was adopted in 1989 in order to deal with the control that was required in each of the two categories. One of the important things introduced in our response to the FitzGerald report referred to precisely what people were given points for in the two categories. While there are some similarities there are also significant differences because of the sponsorship involved in the family reunion category. What have we had from the opposition about the family reunion category? There has never been a time that I can remember when the opposition has not attacked it, when it has not wanted to get rid of it. Mr Ruddock-That is not so.",164
269,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"It is so. When we first introduced the two categories the opposition objected because FitzGerald had recommended one category. The honourable member has forgotten that. The fact of the matter is that we rejected the FitzGerald recommendation and went for the two categories precisely because we wanted to have a distinct family reunion category. For many years, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has been making attacks on the family reunion category, but without it the humanitarian edge of our immigration program would disappear. For that reason I believe that we should sustain the points system-the two separate points systems for the two categories-and welcome the changes that will simplify and improve the system. I look forward to a situation where the government is responding in a sensitive way to the concerns expressed by people applying for migration, while at the same time ensuring that shonky applications, or people who try to get around the system, are dealt with severely. I wish to refer to one other matter that was raised by both the honourable member for Berowra and Senator Short at the FECCA conference, and that is the very important matter of the special assistance category. The opposition has raised concerns about the application of the special assistance category, and I understand that it will be looking at the implementation of that category. I urge the honourable member for Berowra and Senator Short to maintain bipartisan support for the special assistance category. Some people claim that the special assistance category has the appearance of being discriminatory because it applies to certain groups of people who are severely disadvantaged or who come from regions that are severely disadvantaged at a particular time. The fact is that the special assistance category has a very important humanitarian function. Obviously, the government is happy to hear from the opposition its recommendations for additions and amendments, but I hope that it does not throw out the baby with the bath water in trying to get rid of this special assistance category. We need support for the special assistance category because of what it is able to do in drastic situations-in Cambodia, in the former Yugoslavia and in a number of other places. It has served a very important humanitarian function for those people who cannot technically meet the definition of 'refugee' under the criteria of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees but who nevertheless have a very important humanitarian claim and who can demonstrate family or other links with Australia. The minister should be commended for the way in which he has expanded the special assistance category to help the many people who have found themselves caught between the cracks,so to speak, in making applications as refugees, as well as helping many people already here in Australia. At the very least we should maintain a bipartisanship approach to humanitarian issues in the area of immigration. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

NA (SHIPPING LEVY) AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 September, on motion by Mr O'Keefe: That the bill be now read a second time.",164
270,Mr SHARP,PROTECTION OF THE SEA,"The Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 1993 deals with an area of considerable interest to a number of members of this House-an area that has raised some very interesting concerns over the last couple of years. I am pleased to say that people are now paying a great deal more attention to matters relating to the potential pollution of the sea, particularly in areas of economic importance, such as our fishing and tourism industries, which in particular parts of Australia depends on the maintenance of a sound and safe maritime environment. By embracing other protocols, the bill ensures that Australia extends its area of interest in the maritime environment so that we have greater control over the types of goods and products that can be disposed of in the sea. For example, a certain organophosphate-I cannot recall its exact namehas been specifically included amongst the items banned from being dumped in our maritime environment, which extends to arellS of the Southern and India- oceans. This is an issue of great importance because we are looking for ways of ensuring that the maritime environment is not polluted by commercial shipping or any other form of activity that goes on at sea. Commercial shipping is not the only cause of pollution. Pollution can be caused by things such as oil wells and drilling rigs that operate at sea. As these matters have arisen over the last few years-certainly since I have been representing the opposition on maritime mattersthe opposition has been prepared to strongly support all reasonable measures to protect Australia's interests in the maritime area, particularly as they relate to our environment. This bill goes in that direction. It is for reason that I am pleased to be able to say that the opposition will be supporting the legislation. I simply note at this point that the shadow minister for the environment, the hono-rable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), will be speaking on this matter a little later, if time permits, so we will hear from her some of the views that she has about this issue. Over the past few years, there has been growing evidence of PQlIution in our maritime environment. I was in Tasmania only a few days ago and was speaking to people on. this subject. If my memory serves me correctly, Tasmania is the only state in Australia that has specific legislation in this area to deal with what is happening in their own waters. The Tasmanian government has also agreed to introduce complementary legislation into its parliament to ensure that it is in line with legislation that this House is debating tonight. We must ensure that Australia does not allow our maritime environment to bepolluted by ballast water being disposed of within our close m-ritime environment. In Tasmania, I spoke to someone with a particular interest in the dumping of ballast water, and that person drew to my attention how potentially dangerous and how potentially damaging the disposal of ballast water by foreign ships can be. This person went into some detail to explain the sort of damage that has already occurred in Tasmanian waters as a result of the disposal of ballast water by foreign ships in close proximity to the coast. The damage done by ballast waters to oceans can be quite extraordinary. We are not talking about a little murky water being pumped out into the ocean; we are talking about all types of marine life that can be brought from one part of the world to Australia that can do immense harm to our maritime environment, to our commercial fishing industries and to other aspects of commercial life in Australia. These can run into hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, worth of damage if we are not careful. The example that was given to me was, I think, in Canada in the Great Lakes. A particular organism was transported to the Great that Lakes in ballast waters of ships from some part of the world. As a result of that, some type of growth is. now entering into, I think, the dams and pipelines of the hydro-electric schemes in and around that part of world, and it is costing hundreds of millions of dollars to try to stop these orgl,lnisms from growing and affecting the operations of those schemes. That is just one example of the. problems that a particular country is facing as a result of the disposal of ballast waters, bringing foreign organisms into our own environment. Here in Australia' we have examples of that sort of situation occurring, doing damage to our maritime environment. Indeed, the stories that this gentleman was telling me are really quite alarming. What I would hope we could do over the next year or two, and I am sure that honourable members would agree with me, is to draw to the public's attention the the tremendous damage that can be done by inappropriate ballast water disposal-in the same way as over the last couple of years, by efforts from members on both sides of this House, we have been able to'draw to the attention of the Australian public the potential damage that can occur to the Great Barrier Reef as a result of pollution from shipping. I think we have seen over the years a number of changes occur through legislation passed in this parliament, or through complementary legislation passed in other state parliaments, to ensure that our Great Barrier Reef-one of the great treasures of Australia's tourism industry; one of the great wonders of the world-is further protected from possible damage to its environment by a ship sinking, running onto the reef, turning over or doing something that would cause pollution to emanate from it when in trouble. We have gone to compulsory pilotage through the reef. We have just seen-I hope I am getting the company right-Caltex provide $80,000 worth of sponsorship to look at alternative routes outside the Great Barrier Reef for commercial shipping to use as, of course, has been the history of commercial shipping along the east coast of Australia. Commercial shipping has preferred, in the main, .to travel within the area of the Great Barrier Reef rather than to go outside it. There are many good reasons for doing that. The sponsorship from Caltex has enabled some research to be undertaken to see whether there are better routes outside the Great Barrier Reef that would minimise any potential damage to it by a ship sinking or getting into some sort of difficulty. So I think over the last few years we have been successful in highlighting potential damage from pollution at sea in the Great Barrier Reef region. As a result, I think some very sensible actions have been taken by government to try to do the very best to minimise that potential damage. In the same way, it is my hope that we could draw to the attention of the Australian parliament and to the people of this country the very real need to do everything that we can to try to minimise the potential damage from the disposal of ballast water in our own Australian waters. I am convinced, after speaking to a number of people, that the commercial and environmental damage that can be done by rell!asing ballast water into our waters in the future could be quite catastrophic for this country. So I take the opportunity that this debate affords us to make that point. This bill, I am very pleased to say,' is widely supported by the Australian shipping industry. The Australian shipping industry has been very cooperative and, indeed, I think it has been very forwatd thinking in the way in which it has cooperated with government to do the best that it can to be a good corporate citizen in Australia. We have seen some tremendous advances made over the last couple of years; indeed, dating back over many years, starting with Ralph Hunt's tenure as the minister for transport in the FraserAnthony government in shipping reform. Much of that shipping reform has, of course, been driven by the industry itself and, to be fair, by the Seamen's Union, which I am pleased-and some would say surprised-has taken the issue of reform within its own industry, grasped it by the nettle and decided to drive it rather than being pushed into reform. That is unlike the Waterside Workers Federation, which has beenMr Hollis-Come on, you've been generous.",165
271,Mr SHARP,PROTECTION OF THE SEA,"My colleague the honourable member for Throsby, who I know has close associations with the Waterside Workers Federation, Mr Hollis-And the seamen.",167
272,Mr SHARP,PROTECTION OF THE SEA,"as he does with the Seamen's Union; he speaks here on every one of these billsMr Costello-We don't have to listen to him, do we? . Mr SHARP-I am afraid that we will have to listen to him. I have to, unfortunately, assure my colleague that he can well and truly get stuck into his reading material. I know the honourable member for Throsby would agree with me that the Waterside Workers Federation has been dragged screaming to the table of reform, whereas the Seamen's Union has really got into the issue of reform and done a lot of it off its own initiative because the union wanted to be in charge of the reform process rather than be told what to do. So we have seen, as is evidenced again by the bill that we are debating in the House tonight, that shipowners in the Australian shipping industry have been very good corporate citizens. They have supported the sort of legislation that we are debating tonight; as, indeed, they have the health and safety legislation for the maritime industry which would have been debated earlier this evening had not the House been full of a lot of windbags and not under the auspices of a guillotine so that we were not able to debate it. But, like that legislation, the industry has taken a responsible stand and highlighted some deficiencies in the legislation, which I was pleased to see were corrected-things such as masters not having full authority over their vessels in certain circumstances, The government amended the legislation to ensure that that was the case. I guess a valid point that the industry makes, which I would have commented on had we been given the opportunity to debate the legislation earlier today, is that the occupational health and safety legislation should have also come in a package with the compensation legislation that we debated, if my memory serves me rightly, in about June last year. Those bills shl(>uld have come together rather than coming more than 12 months apart. I notice that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator CoIlins) said that we could not possibly have. had the two bills come together as a package because the election split them up. That is the reason for the gap between the compensation and rehabilitation legislation that we debated last year, and the health and safety legislation that we should have debated earlier this evening. Those points are worth making. I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the House would recognise that it is worth making the point that the issue of pollution at sea has, over the last few years, been a bipartisan issue-one supported by both sides of the House. I must admit though that there are some issues in the maritime area which are not bipartisan. One of the things that this side of the House violently opposed, and will continue to oppose, was the extraordinary increase in the excise on fuel, which was brought down in the budget in August of this year. It was a more savage blow for the shipping industry than for any other industry in Australia because shipping uses bunker oil, which had, prior to the budget, an excise of 5.5c a litre. The government's decision to increase that excise by 5c a litre meant that a 92 per cent increase would result in the excise from the budget decision. That boiled down to something in the order of-again, if memory serves me rightly-$22 million worth of excise being paid by the Australian shipping industry; an average cost of around $360,000 for each Australian vessel, when the Australian shipping industry had been· undertaking reform. The latest round in that reform had delivered savings in the order of $270,000 for each Australian flag vessel. Yet having just achieved that reform and that sort of saving, the government, in the same week, was going to load an extra $360,000 in costs onto the average Australian ship through increased oil fuel excise. At the end of the day, after a lot of toing-and-froing and a backdown by Senator Harradine, rather than being knocked off in the Senate, the excise was reduced to 3c a litre from 5c. That still adds $217,000 to the operating costs of the average Australian flagged vessel. That does away with a lot of the advantage that Australian ships and the shipping industry have received as a result of shipping reform. I wonder how happy Seamen's Union representatives would be. Seamen have seen a great deal of reform-many making sacrifices in the process of that reform-in order to sustain the viability of the Australian shipping industry and to ensure that their colleagues will be able to obtain useful employment in that industry in the future, only to see that sacrifice thrown out the window by the government's decision to jack up the fuel excise, taking away most of the benefit that has been achieved from shipping reform. It is that type of hypocrisy and lunacy that we on this side of the House have the legitimate right to oppose. But we will continue to make those sorts of comments and take up that form of opposition whenever we see the government doing things to harm the Australian shipping industry. We think viability is crucial to the Australian shipping industryand any Australian government interested in a good future for that shipping industry will take note of that. We cannot have proper pollution at sea measures put in place and proper safety measures undertaken on board vessels if the owners of those vessels are not operating profitably. Whilst many people on the other side of the House have a philosophical objection to people making a profit in business, one of the critical things I have learnt-and I am sure that even the honourable member for Throsby would agree with me-is that whenever the world's shipping industry is operating at a loss, safety levels are decreased. Maintenance is not kept up and lifeboats are not properly maintained. We then get some ludicrous situations. We saw such a situation in Gladstone only this week when a vessel, which was caught out only six or eight months ago by AMSA, was pulled up because the propeller on the lifeboat would not tum around. That sort of poor safety and poor maintenance occurs because the people who own those ships are not making enough money to afford to keep their ships in proper order. Of course, there are other extenuating circumstances. The best we could say about some of the registration societies is that they are crooked, and the worse we could say is that they ought to be chased off the face of the earth. But I think there is a direct link between viability and safety. If a company that owns a ship is operating profitably, it enhances its ability to keep up proper maintenance on the ship and, therefore, proper safety procedures. So there is a link between industry viability amI safety measures on board vessels, and indeed our ability to ensure that the Australian shipping industry complies to the sorts of pollution at sea requirements that this government-and indeed the Australian society-would expect of it. This is once again an occasion for the opposition to support a bill of this nature because we do recognise the importance of protecting our environment. I know that my colleague the shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Oallus), agrees with me wholeheartedly. We will continue to do so whenever such bills are of a reasonable nature. At the same time, whilst taking a bipartisan position, our very best to highlight the cargo cult mentality of this government in relation to transport-whether it is shipping, rail, road anything else related to transport. Over the last few years, this government has done nothing but tax our Australian transport industry. It is at the point now where I am convinced that the only way we can do anything to help the Australian transport industries is to do away with some of those taxes, as the opposit,ion intended to do in its Fightback package. Had the Fightback package been implemented, there would have been around an $800,000 difference in operating costs per ship, per annum compared to what the Australian shipping industry has ended up with under the Labor government's policies. I think that example alone proves the point that if this government wants to do something for shipping and transport the one thing it can stop doing is taxing those industries to death. The opposition will support this legislation, as we will on future occasions in relation to reasonable legislation which goes to protecting the maritime environment from pollution.",167
273,Mr HOLLIS,PROTECTION OF THE SEA,"It would not be a shipping debate if J did not follow the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) in speaking in this chamber. At the outset, I will make a couple of points about his speech. As usual, he was gracious in his comments about the Seamen's Union and niggardly in his comments about the Waterside Workers Federation. He knows, as I do, that the two are now amalgamated into the Maritime Union of Australia. Nevertheless, I suggest that before the honourable member gives a serve to the waterside workers he should have a look at their history of refonn. As I have said many times before in this chamber, a whole range of issues were involved on the waterfront. It is not good enough to hint that if we had got rid of what was the Waterside Workers Federation all would have been sweetness and light. That is not true. The Waterside Workers Federation refonn package and the reforms that it carried out were as great, or almost as great, as the exercise in reform by the we will do Seamen's Union. I agree with what the honourable member said about ballast water. Some of the water or that has been released in Twofold Bay-an area that he is familiar with-from ships coming in has been a worry. There is also a debate going on as to whether ships should go inside or outside the Great Barrier Reef. I welcome the investigation being conducted in that regard. My information is that it is actually safer to go inside the reef because there are definite channels. Ships are protectenhancing ed from the elements and it is also quickerso, in the old capitalist phrase, 'it saves money'. Nevertheless, if Caltex is generous enough to put up $80,000 for that study, we would all welcome it. Maybe some of the questions raised in debate in this chamber and elsewhere about whether ships should travel inside or outside the reef will be answered. The purpose of the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill is to amend the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Act 1981 to raise the maximum rate of oil pollution ,levy which can be applied to commercial shipping using Australian ports. The bill is fairly narrow in its terms. I suspect that the honourable member for Hume may well have been discussing legislation that is scheduled for debate in this chamber tomorrow. Having said that, he has nevertheless exercised his right to engage in wide ranging debate on this bill. I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you will extend to me the same generosity for a wide ranging debate as you extended to the honourable member for Hume. There will then be no bitterness about the issue. The levy that was introduced in 1973 provides funds towards the costs associated with the operation of Australia's national to combat pollution of the sea by oil. The national plan brings together Commonwealth, state, territory and industry expertise and combat capacity under one national contingency plan. Since 1 January 1991, it has been administered by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority-AMSA. The levy funds the administration of the national plan, including equipment acquisition, maintenance and training. It also provides a contingency fund to cover costs incurred in responding to marine pollution incidents. The act currently provides that the rate of levy per quarter is such rate not exceeding 4c per tonne of the tonnage of the ship, as is prescribed. The rate of levy was previously prescribed by regulation at 2.2c per tonne. However, this rate was raised to 4c per tonne from 1 October 1993. This increase enabled AMSA to implement the recent decisions of Commonwealth and state transport ministers aimed at the effectiveness of the plan. These decisions flowed from consideration of a high level review of the national plan by a Commonwealth-state industry working party. Additional funds are required to purchase additional response equipment to enhance response capability in the event of major spills and put in place contractual arrangements to enhance fixed wing dispersant delivery capability. The increase· in the prescribed rate of levy to meet these additional funding demands will, however, remove the leeway that has previously existed between the rate of levy prescribed by regulation and the limit on the levy set by the act. This leeway is essential to allow AMSA to react speedily to a large funding requirement that might arise in the case of a major incident. While in almost all cases costs of responding to oil pollution incidents are recovered from the polluter; there is an immediate call on funds, and it may be some time before these can be restored. In such cases, the ability to increase the levy by regulation will allow AMSA to borrow funds at short notice by giving it the financial capacity to. service and repay such a loan from the levy. The increase to 6c per tonne in the maxiplan mum rate of levy that can be prescribed, as proposed in this legislation, maintains the current relationship between the rate of levy prescribed by regulation and the maximum rate capable of being prescribed. Naturally, everyone hopes that there will never be a need to raise the rate of levy to pay for a clean up of a major oil spill. Yet, increasingly, we are being faced with the possibility of a major environmental catastrophe along the Australian coastline as ships, best described as 'rust buckets' ply to and from Australia and along the Australian coastline. It is not necessarily oil tankers that are presenting major threats because, with the notable exception of the Kirki, most oil companies are strict in their inspections and requirements for tankers. In my view, the biggest environmental threat is from bilge oil from coal carrying ships sailing up and down the Australian coast inside the Great Barrier Reef. It has always seemed to me to be a case of not if, but when, we will be faced with an environmental disaster. The Ships of shame report, released at this time last year, highlighted the conditions of many of these ships. AMSA has stepped up inspections of ships and, indeed, a month ago there were six foreign ships being detained in Australian ports. Contrary to some media reports that claimed that this was an indication that the recommendations contained in the Ships of shame report were not being implemented, it illustrates that the inspection services have been considerably tightened up. Indeed, there are currently several ships being detained in Australian ports-one in Brisbane and one in Port Hedland-which is further proof that the inspection services have been improved. I am pleased that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) has given the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure a further reference to continue this work because there are still too many incidents of unsafe shipping off the Australian coastline which pose a threat to the marine environment. One area requiring considerable tightening up is the issue of single voyage permits. Single voyage permits are issued by the Department of Transport and Communications when there is not an Australian ship available for the cargo. I believe that before such permits are issued the ship should be inspected to ensure that it complies with all Ian health and safety requirements. Such, currently, is not the practice and it is far too easy for single voyage permits to be issued. Some unknown bureaucrat in the transport department, in the Daily Commercial News of 3 December, referred to my remarks regarding single voyage permits as 'bull' with a few exclamation marks after it; I do not know what that bureaucrat means. I challenge this gutless wonder to put his or her name to the comments made. I do not mind being challenged on what I say, but I do object when bureaucrats use a departmental source to launch an unfounded attack on me because of comments that I make. These people say that they follow the system and that it is a difficult system to administer. The point is made here that people in the department are constantly talking to the industry and the unions about the issue of special voyage permits. That is simply not true. The unions often get 20 or 24 hours notice, but they are not constantly talking to them about it. If the department's record is so good, why are so many ships with single voyage permits being detainedsuch as the APJ Anand in Gladstone recently. That· ship was issued with a single voyage permit from Albany, and in Gladstone it was found to have 140 defects. People in the Department of Tr-nsport and Communications say that I should talk to them. I do not mind if they want to talk to me before they go criticising me in documents. I will be replying to this with great vigour. Before people start criticising me and my comments on single voyage permits, they should have the guts to put their names to what they say. Members of parliament cannot get away with that sort of disguise when we make statements either inside this chamber or outside. We are always identified, and I have no difficulty with that. I do not think I have ever given anonymous stories to anyone. It is rankling when people want to beat up some story about me and what I said about single voyage permits. The interesting thing is that the bureaucrat was totally wrong in the article. The writer justified everything that I had said, and that was admitted in the .article: Nevertheless, I think people should put their Austral- names to articles of this type. When our premier tourist resort, the Great Barrier Reef, is awash with oil, it will be too late to call for a tightening up of regulations. These regulations should be tightened up now and, although I welcome this legislation, there must be a considerable tightening up of the regulations concerning ships coming to Australia-especially on the issue of single voyage permits. We are talking about shipping in this debate. There was another bill passed in this House earlier today that is related to this legislation, but because of time constraints I did not have an opportunity to comment. I refer to the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Bill. This bill will make the maritime industry a healthier and safer industry to work in. In the Australian shipping industry alone, over the past five years there has been an average of 1,000 injuries a year reported to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. I suggest that many of these injuries could have been avoided. The main point that I should like to make about the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Bill is that it completes a comprehensive safety net for Australian seafarers-all achieved in the last few years via union, industry and government consultation and cooperation. Seafaring is a dangerous occupation and injury rates have been unacceptably high. With the passage of this legislation there will now be a system to minimise injuries and maximise rehabilitation. Many vessels in the seagoing sector already have on board health and safety experts, and the act will simply clarify the role and function of these people. Ships without occupational health and safety committees will need to establish them. All vessels covered by the Commonwealth Navigation Act will now need to comply with the new Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act. Health and safety representatives will have their rights and responsibilities outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act. ALMA surveyors will become occupational health and safety inspectors for the industry. The Seacare authority will oversee the administration of the act, together with the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Most importantly, health and safety representatives, inspectors and, indeed, all seafarers will receive training about the new occupational health and safety act and all that it entails. I welcome the legislation that has been put to this House which concerns wide maritime issues. To put the mind of the honourable member for Hume at rest, let me assure him that I share many of the concerns that he has outlined tonight about the increase in the excise on fuel. I must say, in all honesty, that I felt it was a very regrettable decision, for many of the reasons that he has outlined. The shipping industry, through management, unions and others, has made tremendous strides in the last few years to make the industry profitable. I hope that even at this late stage the government might have another look at that. The simple act of increasing the fuel excise has wiped out many of the gains that had been achieved. It was a most regrettable step. Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for your indulgence in allowing me to range far and wide on this hill. It is legislation that has bipartisan support-as so much in the shipping industry does. I welcome the legislation before the House this evening.",169
274,Mrs GALLUS,PROTECTION OF THE SEA,"Hindmarsh) (10.40 p.m.)As the night is getting late, and with the vision of us all sitting here until Saturday, I shall try to make my remarks brief. I want to approach this, as the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) foreshadowed earlier, to make one or two environmental comments about the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill which, as other members have said, is a way of increasing the levy in case there is a chance of an oil spill. The present levy is 4c and the bill allows that to be increased by an extra 2c to take care of any spill. The levy funds the national plan to combat the pollution of the sea by oil, including more equipment to deal with any spill. Having mentioned that, there are some concerns that I would like to raise. Oil spills are one of the biggest threats that we have to our coastline. That fact has been confirmed in the recently published RAC report. I suspect that the threat that we have from ballast water, which the honourable member for Hume also mentioned, is one of those threats that we have to now consider, considering what has come from Tasmania. Undoubtedly, the threat of another Exxon Valdez, or another Kirki of a large size, is something that worries all Australians. This government has to look more seriously at what can happen in cases of oil spills and what must be done to prevent them. I do not think we can ever reach a point where we can have 100 per cent prevention and say that we will not have oil spills. But, as part of our coastal policy, we should have more. action to prevent them from happening. This bill starts to look at what happens after we have had the spill, but that is not good enough. I ask the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to bring down her coastal policy a little quicker than she has. We have only a draft coastal policy now, but perhaps we could speed that up and look towards getting a full coastal policy with more action in this regard. In 1992, there were 175 marine oil spills around the coast of Australia. Of those, 33 per cent were within ports and 17 of those had to be dealt with by AMSA and the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil, which this bill refers to. The RAC report also comments that this plan, as good as it may seem on the surface, has its problems. Indeed, it has $13 million worth of specialised equipment, which seems a positive thing to have until we look at the Commonwealth Auditor-General's report of 1993. It found that some of this plant was inoperable and that other parts of the plant simply could not be located, certainly not in a hurry, which does not give us much confidence in what is going to happen if there is an oil spill and we need to get that equipment out there to deal with the oil spill. I would say to the minister if she were here, or to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon) if he were here-I suspect there is not much sense in saying it to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh)Ms MCHugh-But it is what I know about.",172
275,Mrs GALLUS,PROTECTION OF THE SEA,"Well if it is what she knows about, then I definitely say to the Minister for Consumer Affairs that perhaps this has to be looked at. Ms MCHugh-We have worked on problems like this together.",173
276,Mrs GALLUS,PROTECTION OF THE SEA,"We indeed have worked on problems like this together. My private thought is that the minister at the table would do a very good job in the environment portfolio. We need to look at how that equipment is stored and how available it is. It is not good enough to say we have $13 million worth of equipment in case we have a spill. For one thing, I do not think it is enough; but, for another, if a lot of that equipment were inoperable and could not be readily located, what would the consequences be if there were an oil spill? Would we have people on the phone saying, 'Where do we find it? Where was it last seen? Who had it last? Does it work? Did somebody remember to oil it? Is it rusty?' and then have people try to face the problem of cleaning up the spill. That is. a problem that I would like to raise at this time. I reconfirm the coalition's enormous concern about the danger to Australia's coastline from an oil spill, and commend this 'bill inasmuch as it provides the opportunity to give more funds to the plan to provide the equipment. But we would like to see that equipment better looked after and more readily used.",173
277,Mr KNOTT,PROTECTION OF THE SEA," Mr Deputy Speaker, I would also like your indulgence, as you have given previous speakers, to cover a number of issues. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the purpose of the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill is to amend the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Act 1981 to raise the maximum rate of oil pollution levy which can be applied to commercial shipping using Australian ports. I would like to quote from a number of journalists. Having previously been a librarian, I do not wish to do what is oft done and paraphrase articles by other people and not acknowledge the source. I will acknowledge the source so that the copyright provisions of those people and their intellectual property can be respected. I would like to quote from an article by Mr John Enders, of the Associated Press. He filed this in San Francisco under the heading 'Much of the world's oil moved by obsolete ships: US tanks and safety'. The article is dated 27 March 1993 and reads: Four years after' the Exxon Valdez dramatised the gooey horrors of an oil spill, the world still on hundreds of rusting, ageing, unregulated tankers with ill-trained crews to transport its most critical fuel. Although US safety has improved, vast stretches of Sea and coast elsewhere remain vulnerable to what tanker safety critics catl a fleet floating catastrophes waiting to happen. In the past six months alone four big tanker spills have fouled the waters of the South Pacific to the North Atlantic. Some of the biggest tanker safety critics are the oil companies themselves which are confronting enormous liability costs and tougher regulations in the United States, the single biggest market for imported oil. Their primary targets are the smaller independent charter shippers who historically have been able to ferrY enormous cargoes at far cheaper rates because they take big risks, ranging from shoddy maintenanceas mentioned by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp)to sailing in dangerous waters to save money as mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby'It is an industry that if you don't have a high dedication to quality, some day you are going to pay the price', said David Powell, fleet manager of Chevron Shipping Company, a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation and a vocal critic of the smaller rogue shippers. Some big oil companies are relying increasingly on their own ships instead of chartering them. Some are building their own new double-hull tankers which, theoreticatly, are safer. Some, such as the San Francisco based Chevron, have created their own tanker tracking systems to know which independent shippers have the most hazardous histories. Chevron Shipping constantly updates a database showing locations, owners and operators of 10,000 tankers worldwide, including 3,250 ocean going vessels. P.R. Grant, Chevron Shipping head tanker tracker, says many should be scrapped. Grant and other industry officials decline to discuss specific ships. 'But up to 20 per cent of the world's tankers are potentially disastrous', said Grant's boss, Doug Wilcott, Chevron Shipping president. Shell International Petroleum Company Pty Ltd, another big oil shipper, issued a similar estimate in February. Much of the oil industry's sensitivity to safety stems from the March 24 1989 disaster at Alaska's Prince William Sound, which changed the way people viewed environmental damage. The grounded Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons, or 4l.6 million litres, of crude oil and devastated large sections of pristine line. Exxon Corporation has spent $US5 billion and $A7.1l billion to clean up the mess. In· 1990, Congress passed a law raising relies liability limits and requiring double-hulled tankers in US waters by 2015. Europe is moving in the same direction. The US changes apparently are working domestically of where only a few minor spills have happened since the Exxon Valdez calamity. But industry and environmental groups say that not nearly enough has been done elsewhere. Shipping insurance statistics show that 65 per cent of big the world tanker tonnage is at least 15 years old, considering a complete lifespan for big tankers. Roger Cone, a spokesman for the International Maritime Organisation, a London based agency that monitors world shipping, has said that that is about the time when people are beginning to scrap their ships. Experts say that the key problem is obsolete tankers plying trade routes worldwide. No agency has authority to order them out of service. Regulations governing tanker operation, maintenance and crew hiring vary widely. IMO standards depend on voluntary enforcement. Only 20 per cent of signatories even report violations. Periodic tanker inspections by major oil companies are common, but smaller owners and independent operators frequently rely on self-policing that often overlooks serious maintenance shortcomings. Tanker charter rates are so low that few companies have incentives to build more expensive ships which encourage operators of shoddy, older tankers to keep them ,afloat. Crew members sometimes are little more than common labourers hired at dockside. They do not necessarily speak the same language as the officers. The larger supertankers weigh 400,000 tonnes, are four football fields long and carry nearly 120 million gallons or 454 million litres of crude. On 5 January, the Liberian registered Braer, owned and operated by the Band H Group of Stamford, Connecticut, grounded off Scotland's Shetland Islands in bad weather. Abandoned, the ship eventually broke up and spilled its 24.6 million gallons or 93.1 million litre cargo. That is more than'double the load dumped by the Exxon Valdez. The crew coast- included a Greek captain, a Filipino and Polish sailors. The company said that language was not a problem and blamed the weather. Also in January, the Danish ship Maersk Navigator, with nearly 78 million gallons or 295 million Iitres of crude, collided with an empty tanker, Sanko Honour, in the crowded shipping lanes off north Indonesia. Eight million gallons or 30 million Iitres were spilled. On 2 December, the Aegean Sea broke in two and burned near the Spanish coast spilling 24 million gallons or 91 million Iitres. Its captain had attempted to bring the ship into port without a pilot. Some shipping experts say that the biggest reason for accidents is not not,? the ships but the operators. Richard ,Gulob, the publisher of Gulob's Oil Pollution Bulletin-a journal in Cambridge, Massachusettshas said that the vast majority of tanker accidents are caused by human error. While American owned ships must adhere to new standards under the Oil Pollution Act 1990, owners and operators of foreign flag tankers do not. Many tankers fly so-called flags of convenience from Panam-, Libya, Greece, South Korea, St Vincent and the Grenadines to, avoid such requirements. Environmental critics say that independent tanker owners have historically operated with impunity. Behr Henneman, a spokesman for the Centre for Marine Conservation in San Francisco, has said that it has been very much a laissez faire industry policed operation for a long time. He also said-hf\t, if we were as upset about tanker acciqents as we are about airline accidents, tanker accidents would be few and far between. Safety critics question whether stronger hull construction is a signifilost cant improvement. Some contend the possibility of capsizing is greater with double hulls; others note that the Aegean Sea's reinforced bottom did not help. Even with safe ships and trained crews, the tanker business remains vulnerable to one of the problems as old as seafaring itself. Pirates plying the narrow strait of Malacca between Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, for example, have been attacking ships so frequently that the regional shipping association issues alerts to captains. A Mr Brad Russell has said that more controls are needed to stop spill disasters. On 21 July 1991, Australia appeared on the verge of an oil pollution disaster. The bow section of the Kirki, a Greek registered oil tanker, broke away in heavy seas about 90 kilometres off the Western Australian coast at Cervantes. The Kirki was carrying nearly 83,000 tonnes of light crude oil from the Arabian Gulf to Western Australia. Fortunately, the ship did not sink, the cr(fw was rescued and a substantial amount of oil was salvaged. The Kirki incident ev<;>ked outrage from the Western Australian public, the marine institute and the state and federal governments. Why should'it The comments that I have quoted show the perilous state of our international waters. I would, at this point, liKe to_pay tribute to the unsung heroes of the Australian economy and join with the honourable member for Hume in complimenting the Australian seamen and their union, the Maritime Union of Australia. This union has been at the forefront of Australia's political and social reform. Through its forebears, the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Waterside Workers Federation, it has a glorious record in supporting the progressive ,development of Australian society. This bill is all about response time. It is all about the time taken to put actions into operations which will enable spills and the negative effects to our environment to be controlled and make sure that loss of life is rriinimalised. The industrial relations record of the shipping industry over the past decade has been second to none with only 58 ship days across the whole of the Australian trading fleet in 1991-92. That is, one day lost per 1,000. This is a magnificent record and a credit to the leadership of the union and the magnificent workers privileged to be workers of that great union. The Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime' Industry) Consequential Amendments Bill, which we were unable to debate earlier, covers Australian owned and operated com,mercial ships and offshore industry mobile units crewed by Australians. The bill creates an inspectorate, the, Australian Maritime Safety Authority. which will ensure compliance with the requirements of that new legislation. There will be two main elements in its functions ensuring that industry parties are complying with the legislation requirements to establish appropriate arrangements to protect the health and safety of employees at work, conducting spot checks, responding to requestsJor investigations, conducting investigations into significant accidents and dangerous situations and taking such· action as required to ensure deficiencies are rectified. The first element will be achieved primarily through safety audits on ships and units. These audits will monitor compliance with the provision in the bill relating to workplace arrangements and requirements for the operator to provide relevant information and training. The intention is that safety audits would generally be conducted in association with one of the surveys required under the Navigation Act 1912. There are approximately 70 ports around Australia which could be expected to be visited by Australian operated trading ships and offshore industry vessels covered by the OHS scheme. There are AMSA surveyors based in all major Australian ports. These surveyors also cover the smaller ports as required. This legislation, and the previous legislation, isa vital extension to the improvements of the AOstralian trading position as it is in the context of the international shipping industry that the Australian shipping industry requires a solid base to expand. Currently, Australian shipping industry contributes only four per cent to international cargoes and leaving Australian ports. Further, the cabotage provisions-the carriage of domestic cargoes by domestic shipping-is being eroded by the outrageous levels of special voyage permits currently being granted, as mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby. Let me make it clear that Australia is not alone in cabotage provisions. With few exceptions, nations ensure their domestic economic security by cabotage. Those ,on thother side would leave Australia at the mercy of international shipping companies and thus put in jeopardy Australia's ability to ensure economic integrity if they attacked the cabotage. The willy-nilly. granting of special voyage permits allows foreign vessels to carry cargo at rates which are non-competitive in that they just need to cover· fuel costs to ensure higher profits on what would otherwise be dead legs in full voyage patterns. To a service sector, this is a version of dumping so rightly condemned on both sides of the House. Who has paid the cost for this? The Australian rail network. We may then ask: what is wrong if the foreign option is cheaper? In the world context, the shipping industry is in crisis and headed for major collapse. The average age of international ships is 18 years. The flag of convenience ships have safety standards based on very dodgy surveys, as pointed out by the honourable member for Hume. The insurance underwriters are increasingly faced with risks that will inevitably drive up premiums to a point where shipping costs will dramatically increase. For a maritime trading nation such as Australia, this will impact on our competitive ability on world markets and our balance of payments. I am pleased to see that those on the other side-particularly the honourable member for Hume, who is representing the National Party-understand this. If we do not have an Australian shipping industry, I hope that honourable members opposite will join us in protecting the interests of Australian farmers when world shipping corporations the make Australian primary products uncompetitive. The cabotage provisions enable us to entering have that shipping industry. This bill strengthens our shipping industry so that when the crunch comes-and it is not far away-the high standard of Australian ships and their cost structures will enable us to expand this industry as long as this government continues to meet the challenges. This bill strengthens the Australian shipping industry, as does the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Bill, because the underwriters will be forced to be more discerning in the application of their businesses. The unfortunate scenario is, however, that the world shipping industry would need an injection of $400 billion in capital investment to improve the world fleet-to eradicate the ships of shame depicted in the inquiry into ship safety by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the  Morris). This is a world-class report and it is a credit to all those who served on the committee and brought down its findings. The bill continues the government's recognition that the high standard in safe shipping in modern fleets is not only good for seafarers, but is also good sense economically and good for Australia's long-term trade interests. Let me say at this point that I will be pressing this government to retain and expand the Australian National Line so that it can increase its share of international shipping-cargoes emanating from Australian ports and destined for Australian ports. I will do this to ensure a fair deal for Australian exporters and importers and, ultimately, Australian workers and consumers. ANL has already turned its business around from a negative net worth of $300 million in 1983 to being worth between $200 million and $250 million today as a going concern. ANL continues to be a major participant in the SIRA process, which effectively began in 1988. The prospect for success was significantly enhanced with the line's participation. ANL, with its shipping and stevedoring interests, employs thousands of Australian seafarers, stevedores, clerical workers and various trade persons-not to mention the office staff and their management and agency sectors. As a major maritime operator, the ANL indirectly supports ancillary services, which are utilised regularly, securing ongoing work for other workers-namely ship repair, technical support providers, road and rail transport, utilisation of port facilities, towage and related services. ANL is the only countervailing force to P&O's dominance in international trade and the waterfront. The demise of ANL would mean that maritime skills and international container shipping would be lost to Australia-in addition to seafarers, port management, stevedoring, piloting, average adjustors, marketing administrators and bureaucrats. These are all important job skills that could be lost to foreign nationals, which has been the case in Norway, the UK and other countries. ANL, the only international sea carrier that is based in Australia, centralises its containers and fleet in Australia, and is able to represent Australian exporter interests at meetings of international ship operators. ANL is a net earner of foreign exchange, and employs Australian seafarers who, along with the line, pay Australian taxes which benefit the economy and the community. The line has substantially invested in establishing the integrated services of shipping, stevedoring, freight forwarding and other operations which have been of value to exporter and importer interests. The thousands of Australian seafarers employed by the line reside in Australia and, in addition to paying federal and state taxes, expend their annual income in the Australian community, unlike foreign seafarers. The asset sales task force has consistently argued that the international interest provisions are not relevant to ANL and that the Australian maritime industry is neither a priority nor a policy objective. I refute that assertion and continue to argue that this bill, in improving the safety and conditions which will result, is in the best interests of this nation and is integral to our strategic economic interests of this nation. Thus the retention of ANL and investment to expand its role in international trade is a positive method of improving the national interest provisions. I would like to talk briefly about the long term aspects that have been uncovered in terms of what has taken place with oil spills. It should be noted that, in terms of the Shetland incident with the Braer, the fishing other industry around there has found traces of hydrocarbons in the flesh of its produce. The spill has had a deleterious effect on the fish, which has been looked upon in the world commodity market as one of the highest ranking and cleanest of foods. This record is marred only by Tasmania, which has been shown to have cleaner fish. In the area of the Exxon Valdez disaster, hydrocarbons have also been found in fish living in deeper waters. This is something that was not foreseen. People thought that the spill would only affect animals living along the shore and surface fish, but they have found that it has a deleterious effect on the flesh of fish which live in waters up to 100 metres deep. This bill is all about protecting Australia; it is all about protecting our ability to be able to have a quick response. This bill suggests that the authorities need to have access to funds so that they can quickly respond and protect our industries. I commend this bill to the House. (TIme expired)",173
278,Mr CHYNOWETH,PROTECTION OF THE SEA,"I rise to speak on the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill. I was not quite certain, after hearing the speech of the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume(Mr Sharp), whether this was the correct bill. I hope to speak on the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill tomorrow. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) said in the second reading speech: The increase in the maximum rate of levy that can be prescribed to 6c per tonne as proposed in this legislation maintains the current relationship between the rate of levy prescribed by regulation and the maximum rate capable of being prescribed. The government hopes of course that we will never need to raise the rate of levy to pay for the clean-up of a major spill. I would like to say that the 6c levy is not enough; it should be more. My liking for oil companies is well known. When I was first elected in 1983, I think one of the first speeches r made was against certain oil companies in Westernport Bay-one company was BP. I will come back to that later. I would like to talk about one of the first reports that was ever produced in this parliament in relation to oil spills. It was the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment and Conservation in September 1978. I believe that some of the findings produced by this report are still relevant today. Recommendation No. 1 stated: With the increasing importation of oil and refined products to Australia, there is a serious threat of larger and more frequent oil spills. Honourable members should remember this was written in 1978. It went on to state: The likelihood of an oil spill disaster depends largely on the performance of the. people involved in the industry, both on land and sea, and the standard and maintenance of equipment. The ability to cope adequately with an oil spill disaster depends largely on the location of the spill. I will get back to the issue of Westernport Bay soon and refer to the problems that could occur if there were an oil spill in that most beautiful part of Australia. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is the body charged with cleaning up these oil spills. It is also the body that will receive this money collected from the oil companies. In its annual report of 1992-93, there was about 11/2 pages devoted to oil spills. One paragraph in this report stated: Of the 234 sighting reports of marine oil pollution, 109 were known to be ship-sourced. I believe that it is talking about 1992-93. So there are 234 sightings of marine oil pollution. It continues: Over 54 per cent of the incidents occurred within port limits where clean-up action was taken by the port authority or relevant oil terminal. The remainder of the incidents occurred offshore and did not pose a threat to the coastline and consequently required little or no further clean-up action other than an initial threat assessment. Under the national plan the response to one major oil spill, that of the Ira in 1992, was successful. Due to the prevailing conditions, containment booms were not able to be used. Dispersants were applied to the spill and, in accordance with current dispersant policy, oil in mangrove areas was left to degrade naturally. Considering the conditions, the response was regarded as the most effective for this incident. It was said about this incident that 'due to the prevailing condition containment booms were unable to be used'. I will refer to that again in a moment in relation to Westernport Bay. Recently, the environment committee had before it the executives of AMSA. We were questioning them about various oil spills and threats of oil spills, not only to Westernport Bay but to the Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia and to the Great Barrier Reef. I asked them whether the ships that had been chartered by Australian companies were sound and up to maritime standards. The reply was that these ships were sound and seaworthy and had been chartered by very reputable companies such as BP, Mobil, Shell and Ampol. I reminded them that the Kirki happened to have been chartered by BP and the front had broken off it. It was certainly a bodgy ship. BP is a reputable company, but it did not pick up the fact that its ship definitely was not seaworthy. It spilt thousands of tonnes of oil into the Indian Ocean. Luckily it did not blow onto the shore. It blew off into the Indian Ocean and probably evaporated-or whatever happens to oil when it spreads out over the sea. I do not believe we can trust these so-called reputable companies to charter ships that are safe and have had all their checks. In the past-we have only to look at the Kirki-we know they have not done it. The ships should be looked at very closely. I know AMSA does these sorts of routine inspections. More money should be spent and more people employed to check over these ships to make sure they are sound. One of the greatest attractions for tourists in Victoria is the penguin parade at Phillip Island, the gateway to Westernport Bay. I would like to read to honourable members about a little incident that happened in Victoria in 1990. In the Age newspaper of 26 May 1990 it is stated: Conservations officials believe several hundred penguins have probably been killed by the oil slick that has washed up on beaches from Warrnambool to Skenes Creek. At least 104 fairy penguins are confirmed to died after being caught in the slick. It goes on to say that it was not known which ship had discharged the oil but officials were looking for it. An article in the Age in June 1993 says: When the coast around Apollo Bay was contaminated with oil two years ago, 160 penguins were retrieved; half of these were saved at a cost of $60,000 a bird-the real cost was masked by the input of volunteer labor. That amount was $60,000 per bird. This is why I believe that we should not have just 6c a tonne levied on the oil companies; it should be double that amount. A report from 30 June 1993 says: A subsidiary company of petroleum giant Caltex was yesterday fined $60,000 for causing an oil slick off the Victorian coast three years ago. A County Court judge imposed the fine on CaItex Tanker Company (Aust) Pty Ltd after finding it had been mlgligent in failing to provide regular maintenance of ... the ship ... The court heard 273 fairy penguins died after more than 18 tonnes of oil poured into the sea on May 21, 1990. So the Caltex company was fined $60,000. That was the cost of reviving and saving one penguin. An advertisement in the newspaper recently said, 'Phillip Island-the Anchor Seaside Retreat, 1 The Esplanade, Cowes. Turn my popularity into your profits'. There is a photograph of penguins. It goes on, 'Here is your opportunity to profit from the 500,000 tourists who visit Phillip Island each year'. Just imagine if that penguin parade had been wiped out by one of these tankers that regularly ply Westernport Bay: 500,000 tourists a year would be gone. That would certainly make a bit of a dint in the budget of the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee). There has been a lot of activity in Westernport Bay. Many groups there have been involved in stopping a development which would have increased the amount of tanker traffic. The groups range from community groups, scientists, environmentalists and even federal politicians. Recently we had a bit of a shock. We had been fighting this matter for over 12 months and believed that Shell-Mobil was about to start work on the old BP site there. However, Shell-Mobil will delay plans to develop an oil storage plant at Crib Point have for 12 months, amid calls from environmental and fishing groups for the federal government to intervene. Shell-Mobil's Crib Point terminal project manager, Mr Jim MACKinnon, said that work due to start next month had been post posed for at least a year to release money for other projects. He said this on 1 December 1993. We have effectively delayed the construction of this plant and, therefore, the transport of ships up and down the bay. That has not come about because the residents of Phillip Island or around Westernport Bay have been sitting on their hands. They have been very active. There has been a lot of very vocal opposition to this proposal. One of the people  from Shoreham. He has written to me, discussing some of the problems that could occur if these shtps go up Westernport Bay. I would like to mention some of them. He heads his letter: Marine Organisms in Ballast Water-Translocation of toxic· ... (algae) from Port Phillip Bay to Westernport Bay. Some honourable members may be aware of the red tide we have had in Port Phillip Bay over the last few years. That is toxic algaewhich is not in Westernport Bay. However, if these ships going to the Crib Point Terminal went from Westernport to Port Phillip Baywhich they were going to do-this toxic algae would get around. The letter states: Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service ... is responsible for vessels entering Australian ports from overseas. Ballast water is part of the vessels practique, though most may not be signatories to the voluntary guidelines of the International Marine Organisation. There appear to be no guidelines or controls by state agencies to minimise the potential impact of translocating marine organisms, particularly toxicalgaeand possibly cholera pathogens (not detected here yet). In my opinion that is, Mr Carroll's opinion(and other scientific opinion) there is a real tial for translocation of toxic marine organisms from Port Phillip Bay to Westernport Bay, in tanker ballast water, by the Shell/Mobil proposed activity of transferring oil from ... (Crib Point Terminal project) to Altona and Geelong. The risk is in the probable need to deballast in WB prior to reloading oil for the transfer to PPB. It is essential that appropriate controls and regulations exist before activity occurs. He goes on with other suggestions. He has asked me a series of questions in relation to the Shell-Mobil project and whether the project is really in the national interest. He has asked me: What monies are remitted back to the parent companies overseas? What return on investment is expected from this new activity of crude oil importation, and export of refined product? How many new jobs (short and long term) will be created by the activity? . Will they receive a tax rebate, or any other benefit from the public purse, for the export of refined product? What taxes and other charges do they contribute now? What taxes and other charges (rates, rents etc) are expected to accrue from the new activity? I will endeavour to find out the answers to those questions. But I think it is important that people are aware that we do not have to have overseas tankers bringing in toxic algae in their ballasts; we can actually transfer· it from Port Phillip Bay back to Westernport Bay. Westernport Bay, of course, is a different bay from Port Phillip Bay with regard to the amount of tidal activity, the height of the tides and the speed of the water leaving the bay, because of the narrowness of the exits there. I mentioned before that the AMSA report stated that container booms were not able to be used because of the weather conditions. The tide in Westernport Bay is about 10 to 12 knots. Those booms would not work there, either. So the oil would float out to who knows where in Westernport Bay. Of course, it would destroy the penguin parade in that area. As we know, 18 tonnes of oil killed hundreds of penguins in the Lome area, where there is open water. Just imagine what potenit would do at Nobbies Entrance at Western· port Bay. This Bill, as I said before, only charges the oil companies six cents per tonne. I think it should be at least double that amount. We should build up a huge amount of money. One has only to look at the oil spills overseas the and the huge cost of fixing them up. Therefore, we should have a trust fund which would allow AMSA to buy the latest equipment. The equipment should not just be based at Geelong and flown out to other areas if there is an oil spill; it should be based all over Australia in critical areas like the Ningaloo Reef on the Great Barrier Reef, and also at Westernport Bay. I believe this delay by Shell-Mobil in the refurbishment of the tanks at Crib Point should enable the federal government to step in and ask the companies to do an environmental impact study. Mr Mackinnon who, as I said before, is the spokesman for ShellMobil, attended a meeting recently and, in relation to a study, is reported in a newspaper article as saying: . . . Mr Jim Mackinnon told the meeting his company would not call for either a study or an assessment. ""It has always been our view that such a study is not necessary"", Mr Mackinnon said. ""However, if the commonwealth or state authorities should require CPT to carry out such an assessment, we would willingly participate"". Crib Point tenninalshas said it would willingly participate in a study. I think this is an open invitation to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to ask these companies to carry out an environmental impact study. There is no real urgency now. They have got 12 months before they will even start work. I believe this is the correct time to do it. I do not know why they have not gone ahead with it. Maybe it was because of the pressure brought to bear by the environmental movement and the residents in this area. If so, I congratulate them. However, one never knows with oil companies. As I said, I have been suspicious since 1983 when I first became a member of this House as to the motives of oil companies. I recall that in 1984 I made a speech in relation to Westernport Bay and oil tankers which anchored in Westernport Bay. They have huge anchors weighing 50 tonnes, 100 tonneswho knows how much-and they drop them straight down onto the bed of Westernport Bay. This creates a huge amount of turbulence and ml1ddies the water. The seagrass in Westernport Bay has died off-not completely, .but huge amounts have died off since I used to swim there when I was a teenager. Even at the pier from which I used to fish, where there used to be a huge area of seagrass, it has now all gone. Who knows whether it is because of turbulence caused by these oil tanker anchors. What I can say is that once Crib Point opened, a few years later the seagrass of Westernport Bay died very rapidly. This is an important piece of legislation. I am glad it has the agreement of those on both sides of the House. However, the only thing that should be done is that the levy shOUld be increased. I call on the Minister to require Crib Point tenninals to do an environmental impact study with regard to development at the old BP site at Hastings. Question resolved in the affinnative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Johns) read a third time. NA Motion (by Mr Johns) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Munt, Mr E. W. and Mr C.W.",178
279,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Fisher) (11.26 p.m.)Tonight I would like to place on record the service to the community of some wellrespected, long-time residents of Cooyar in the Fisher electorate. Forty-five year old Errol Walter Munt, a personal friend of many years, died as a result of a horrific car accident on the evening of Wednesday, 8 December. His only son, 21 year old Cameron Walter Munt, died instantly in the same car accident. The horror smash occurred on a notoriously treacherous piece of road on the Bruce Highway. It was the second fatal accident on that stretch of road in just six weeks. Errol and his son were driving from Gympie, where they had attended a Cattlemen's Union beef breeders conference, to Mooloolaba on the Sunshine Coast, when the three vehicle accident occurred. His wife Lyn and only daughter Tanya were waiting for them at Mooloolaba so that they could start their Christmas holidays together. Errol Munt's life ended at the age of only 45 and Cameron was only 21. But the respect they earned from residents throughout rural Queensland was evidenced by the attendance of more than 1,000 people at their funeral service. Errol Munt was always a community minded person, a man who was willing to stand up for what he believed in. He was born in 1948 at Crows Nest and educated at the Thornville Primary School, after which he returned to the family property He became involved in local sporting and community events at an early age. He was well known for his riding talents, competing regularly in rural shows throughout the region. He was a keen sportsman and also became involved with the Junior Farmers. In 1970 Errol Munt married Lyn Kanowski. They had two children. Errol was a devoted husband and father and had a very close knit family unit. His service to the Cooyar community in adult life was exceptional. He was a member of the Cooyar Show Society and its treasurer for many years. He was also the deputy chairman of the National Party's Crows Nest electorate council. He was a foundation member of the Upper Yarraman Cooyar branch of the Cattlemen's Union, holding various positions, including south-east region secretary. Errol was also the Cattlemen's Union representative on the Rural Fires Council for five years. During his children's education, he was an active member of the school P and C association. Errol Munt was a justice of the peace, an associate member of the Poll Hereford Society and served on the Cooyar hall committee. He was also a church elder, congregation chairman and lay reader with the Lutheran Church. He was a Rosalie shire councillor for a total of nine years, serving as deputy chairman for the last two years. Cameron Munt displayed the potential his father had achieved. Born in 1972, he attended school in Cooyar, Yarra man and at Concordia Lutheran College, Toowoomba, where the funeral was held. He was a school prefect and played the organ for church services. After leaving school he commenced a real estate and valuation course at Gatton University, while working as a clerk in the accounting section of the Heritage Building Society in Toowoomba. Heritage nominated him for a Rotary Youth Leadership Association camp, which taught him leadership and teamwork. In June this year he purchased a house. He was always a house-proud person and loved gardening. He was well liked and had a special rapport with elderly people. He was a member. of the Wilson ton Lutheran congregation and helped organise some youth to raise cattle. gatherings. Both Errol and his son will be sadly missed by their family, friends and the community. They were remarkable people who achieved so much in such short periods of time. They earned and retained the respect of all those who knew them well. Wangetti Education Centre",181
280,Mr DODD,ADJOURNMENT,"On 30 November I had the pleasure of representing the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) at the official opening of the new facilities at the Wangetti Education Centre in my electorate. The Wangetti Education Centre is a school for years 11 and 12 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and is located approximately halfway between· Cairns and Port Douglas. On the same night the school held its annual award presentation nigh-. Wangetti school takes students from remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in my electorate and the electorates of Kennedy and the Northern Territory. Students attend Wangetti from Torres Strait Island communities, in particular Badu Island and Mabuiag Island, as well as the Northern Territory, Mount Isa and Cairns. I would like to thank the principal of the school, Mr Les Hegerty, his dedicated staff and the students of the Wangetti Education Centre for the hospitality shown to me on the night. I had the pleasure of representing the minister in opening the new facilities, which included classrooms, an administration area and a new library. These were built with a Commonwealth grant of $290,000. I was most impressed with the quality of the traditional indigenous entertainment on the night: dancing from Torres Strait Islanders, as well as traditional dancing from the Northern Territory. Academic achievements were also demonstrated at the award presentation. Also highlighted were the sporting achievements of the school. I was advised that two of the Wangetti students last year gained admission to a tertiary institution. This year another student has already gained a similar admission. That may not seem very remarkable to honourable members, but it must be noted that English is often a second or even a third language to the students at the Wangetti school. They all come from remote communities and suffer from all the disadvantages, which are well documented, suffered by Australia's indigenous people. Many of the students, parents, guardians and families attended the night's ceremonies. This is both remarkable and commendable, given the huge distances some people had to travel. I again take the opportunity to congratulate the courage, determination and, importantly, the fantastic optimism that was shown to me on the night by the students of Wangetti. I wish them well in their adult life. In the short time that I have left, I wish Mr John May of the House of Representatives transport office well in his retirement. I thank all the parliamentary staff and the Com car drivers for the assistance and courtesy they have shown to me as a new member in this House. I would like to wish you, Mr Speaker, and all those who work in this building a merry Christmas and a happy new year. Essendon Airport",182
281,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I received a letter from Mr John Moore of Cook Green and Moore, advertising and marketing consultants in Bendigo. He wrote to me regarding the retention of Essendon airport. Honourable members might wonder why an advertising and marketing firm in Bendigo would write to me about the retention of Essendon airport. Mr Moore made some excellent points in his letter about retaining it. He said: However, itthe airportis also used by people around regional Victoria, such as ourselves, in the course of business. We now employ a considerable number of people in Bendigo and yet most of our work comes from out of this region. Without the capacity to move by light aircraft we would not be able to sustain our current level of activity. He went on to say that many other country clients of Cook Green and Moore, including Patties Bakery at Bairnsdale, use light aircraft for their businesses which are distributed over the whole of Victoria. Like Cook Green and Moore, they use Essendon because there really is no alternative. The letter continues: We can't use Tullamarine and it is nonsense to suggest that it could, take additional traffic from Essendon. MoOrabbin is appropriate for destinations on the south eastern side of the metropolitan area but it is not a substitute for Essendon. ' Victoria ought to be extremely grateful that it has managed to retain an aviation facility that is close to the CBD. In many overseas cities airports have been pushed progressively further out to a point where they barely fulfill their original function. In some cities efforts are now being made to re-stablish general aviation/commuter airports in Inner urban areas. London is a good example. Of course, it is much harder to bring them back than to get rid of them. There is no justification for the closure of Essendon on safety grounds. Figures clearly show that its record is no worse than other airports around Australia. Essendon City Council has had its eyes on the revenue potential of the land for a long time and local residents stand to make considerable financial gains. Mr John Moore went on to say: The Port Phillip Airport Study looked at all the issues and recommended strongly that Essendon airport should be retained. I urge you to maintain the policies dictated by acceptance of that report and not to be swayed by the emotion generated in the heat of the moment. That is following the accident which occurred. Katoomba TAFE",183
282,Ms DEAHM,ADJOURNMENT,"At this time of the year we are all invited to a great number of end of year events. I am sure we have all attended many of them over the last few weeks, though certainly not in the last week. Last week I attended just such a function which was rather special. It was the annual Christmas event . for . Katoomba TAFE. Honourable members might say, 'What is so special about a TAFE end of year function?'. Katoomba TAFE is a very special TAFE, not just because it is in my electorate around or because I attended it for a while, but because of the courses it conducts, the people who are involved and the wonderful graduations that it presents. Last week's function was in the style of an 1893 Christmas, so all the waiters and those attending us were suitably dressed in period costumes. We. were entertained by TAFE training. teachers and students, all in costume. Every course of the dinner was paraded around room and suitably sung in so that we knew what we were getting. We were able to see and join in the spirit of it. It was a very special night. There were not a lot of boring speeches, but the speeches that were given were sincere and relatively short. I was used to the functions Katoomba TAFE puts on as it runs a number of hospiWales, tality courses. Tourism is the main industry that area. Students in the hospitality course are there for about 12 weeks. Many of these students are unemployed young people who do not have very much confidence. Their graduation at the end of their course is either a lunch or a dinner prepared by the students, served by the students and, what is more, their guests are entertained by the students. At the first graduation I went to we were presented with a combination of Phantom of the Opera and the Rocky Horror Show. We munity. were served by young men in fishnet stockings and garters. The young women were also suitably attired. Between courses they entertained us with songs and pieces from these shows. These people knew nothing about singing or acting but put on a splendid perreturn formance. I am very proud of my TAFE; it a special one. I asked the director, 'When they sign up, do they have to state whether they can sing or. dance before they can take the hospitality course?', but they did not. Katoomba TAFE also runs welfare courses. Many students in that course are women who have been out of the work force for some time and have very little confidence. At end they come out with a lot of confidence themselves, and it is not just personal develimprove opment. In the hospitality course I have observed a lot of young people later working at our biggest resort as trainees or going jobs at smaller guesthouses or into full-time courses. Unlike universities, schools and other training institutions, the TAFE provides a rounded education. It deals with that personal development aspect as well as job and skills The Katoomba TAFE will be moving to a the new building at Wentworth Falls, a little further down the mountains, because it is in it antiquated buildings. In recognition of the quality of service provided to the community, it will be moving into a new building. At the dinner, one of the people from the Sydney head office of TAFE gave a short speech and told us that TAFE in New South particularly in the Sydney area, would in have the job of training most of the people who will be working at the Sydney Olympic Games venues. That will all be provided by corporate sponsorship, so it is not at the expense of the taxpayer. TAFE will be training the guides, waiters and waitresses, people working at the olympic village, and people required for any of the, other services. Being in my electorate, I think I dm be personally proud of the Katoomba TAFE, but we can all be proud of TAFE as an institution and for the services it provides to our comCompany Takeover",183
283,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I spoke on Tuesday night about the proposed takeover of Tate and Lyle, and I to the subject this evening because it is is of such great importance not only to North Queensland but. to the economy of Australia. I am talking here of potentially some $400 million a year in production going to a forI was assured that eign company. The South Johnstone mill has spent $30 million in capital expenditure over the last 14 years, and increased its crushing rate from approximately 380 tonnes per hour to a the capability which will allow 500 tonnes per in hour. This capital expenditure was used to milling capacity, sugar quality and recovery aspects, and also reduce lost crushing time to the extent where in 1993 South into Johnstone mill achieved lost time excluding weather of 3.3 percent and only 1.3 percent of this time was due to mechanical failuresurely an excellent performance in anyone's books. Should this company be taken over by Tate and Lyle, performance will deteriorate to the detriment of cane farmers. A similar performance was recorded by the Tully mill. The performance of Tate and Lyle mills in Australia demonstrates that the management philosophy in that organisation is deficient some way. I emphasise that these mills were working quite well until the takeover by Tate and Lyle and were the equal of any other mills-both management and workers were doing an excellent job-but they are now operating under the sort of expenditure restraints which have caused this takeover situation to arise. Surely Tate and Lyle not be allowed to extend its clear lack of ability to efficiently manage raw sugar mills. It is of far more importance to the nation to allow these mills to continue under the current directorate or leadership, and indeed Tate & Lyle should be encouraged to exit the Queensland industry so that the existing industry can be utilised in a much more efficient manner. How can it be possible for an organisation such as Tate and Lyle to take over other mills when, in a presentation to South Johnstone mill, Me Mitchell of Bundaberg Sugar indicated that he knew nothing about an expansion into the tableland area by South Johnstone mill and had not considered the future of this expansion in the lead-up to the presentation of the Part A Statement. Indeed, Mr Mitchell is a member of the board of the Queensland Sugar Corporation and should have been well aware of the intentions of South Johnstone mill in this particular field. Me Mitchell also pleaded ignorance of the fact that the 1992-93 financial statements of South Johnstone Mill showed a cash reserve of $12.3 million. It seems inconceivable that Me Mitchell's advisers did not understand that we had $12.3 million in cash reserves as at 30 June 1993. With this takeover, of course, the company will be able to help itself to those cash reserves. With these exhibited misunderstandings of the true situation at South Johnstone, how could this organisation effectively run two other sugar mills in North Queensland in a successful manner. If the takeover bid is successful it would be 'really fantastic for Tate and Lyle', but certainly not for South Johnstone shareholders and the farmers, with the shareholders being paid cash which their company has accumulated to the tune of some $20 million when profits and cash flow from in the 1993 crushing season estimated at $7.5 million is included. This is indeed a ridiculous takeover bid. Tate and Lyle clearly wish to achieve something for nothing. Our financial advice indicates that if the bid is successful, Tate and Lyle would have a return on investment of 25 to 26 per cent and a pay back in cash from its should own resources within a twoto three-year period. The takeover offer is clearly absurd and must reflect the absurdity of the so mentioned company. Should the takeover bid be successful, Tate and Lyle would have the strategic advantage in the region of four sugar mills, and this strategic advantage is not being allowed for in the amount offered for the shares in South Johnstone Mill Ltd. Nor does it allow for the expansion of these mills. An additi'onal strategic advantage would be the exclusive use of the Mourilyan Harbour facilitieswhich have been paid for in most part by taxpayers-for the dispatch of raw sugar. Should the industry be deregulated after review of the Sugar Industry Act in 1996, and the takeover bid is successful, Tate and Lyle will have exclusive use of Mourilyan Bulk Terminal facilities to dispatch sugar produced from their mills to whatever market they have arranged and be in a position to not share this price with the growers supplying the cane. With virtually unlimited expansion now available in the industry in this area, Tully not only has available Bankers Trust 'King Ranch' holdings land but also the forestry department's pine forest, which has now matured for harvesting-this plus adjacent undeveloped land would open up as much as 20,000 hectares of land for cane productiona significant increase in the entire crop for Australia. It is important to point out to the House this evening that, in its submission to the FIRB, Sugar North noted: The balance sheets of all member mills of Sugar North are very healthy. There is no net benefit to Australia flowing fromthis takeover. However, examination of the Tate & Lyle balance sheet shows relatively high gearing (89% at 26 September 1992). I must say, in fairness, that I have seen other reports that say it is 60 per cent. But whether we accept the figure of 60 or 89 per cent, we are talking about an extremely high . and precarious gearing level. This submission continues: . .. this gearing would rise considerably and increase their net borrowings position from £641.9 million equivalent to A$1.46 Bn. Acquisition would also provide the buyer with access to a substantial amount of cash which the mills have accumulated for reinvestment in their own activities. Sugar North is of the view that the national interest would be adversely affected if the proposed takeover were to proceed. (Time expired) Mr GRIFFlN (Corinella) (11.45 p.m.)- Mr Speaker, I rise tonight to inform the House of recent developments in the political situation in EI Salvador, and of the recent activities of the death squads, which are stilI very active in that country. Firstly, I would like to read from a media release which describes the latest atrocity: Today, December 9, 1993, the political leader MARIO LOPEZ was assassinated in San Salvador, only 24 hours after a commission was formed to investigate the activities of death squads and illegally armed groups in EI Salvador. Lopez was a well known member and high ranking leader of the FMLNthe Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberationfounder of the PRTC (Central American Workers' Revolutionary Party) and of the National Association of Salvadorean Teachers ... acting as its General Secretary in 1965. At the time of his death, Lopez was a member of the political commission of the FMLN and the PRTC, responsible for the Educational Commission of the FMLN, and also worked as a planner in the Faculty of Science and Humanities of the University of EI Salvador. The killing occurred at 10:30 AM, and was carried out by two men in civilian clothes, who used short range weapons, wounding Lopez in the pelvis and legs. Lopez's security guard LUCIO HERRERA was also wounded in the attack. Lopez died in an Intensive Care Unit as a consequence of a heart failure caused by severe haemorrhage. This is the third ex-FMLN commander killed during the last two months at the hands of clandestine death squads, bringing to 29 the total number of members of this organisation who have been killed since the signing of the peace agreements in February 1992. Human rights and popular organisations in El Salvador have expressed their concern at the worsening of this situation. These organisations wish to bring the matter to the attention of the international community and kindly request vigilance and support at these difficult times. Mario Lopez was a political leader, an academic and a trade unionist-activities that many honourable members have undertaken in the course of their working lives. But in our country, and many other countries of the world, we are not facing the situation faced in Central and South America. In countries such EI Salvador as ours we are generally free to engage in such activities. In EI Salvador, those sorts of activities can lead to a bullet in the back of the head. The United Nations Commission on the Violation of Human Rights looked at the question of the bitter war in EI Salvador, the causes of it and the activities of all concerned with it. Although it conceded that nearly all participants had been involved in various crimes, it was clear that the armed forces, and the death squads associated with the· armed other forces, were predominantly to blame for the atrocities that have occurred. The commission made a number of recommendations, which included: the removal from public office of those guilty of human rights abuses; civilian control of the military; the enactment of a law allowing soldiers in the first military to refuse to obey unlawful orders; the severing of ties between the military and private armed groups; human rights education at military academies; further detailed investigation of the activities of death squads; dismissal of certain highly politicised judges in the supreme court; the general depoliticisation of the administration of justice' to ensure that there is a truly independent and unbiased judicial system; the introduction of a range of human rights-which, in a country like Australia, we take for granted-relating to detention without trial, the right to legal representation, the right to habeas corpus, and the like; ratification of the various international human rights treaties; and compensation to the vic, tims on all sides of human rights violations. Such recommendations ,are basic to a long and enduring peace in EI Salvador. Many are recommendations which, in this country, we would see as being the sorts of basic human rights that we all hold dear. Australia has a role within in the international community of pushing to ensure these recommendations are implemented - nd supporting those in EI Salvador who believe in peace and democracy. We have to ensure that political and economic pressure is put upon those within that country and those outside who would support the death squads to ensure that those activities cease and that the chance for peace comes to EI Salvador. We should all take that international responsibility seriously. We should join the United Nations and the European Economic Community in condemning those actions. We should all be working to ensure that the sad tragedy in EI Salvador ends as soon as possible. Director of Public Prosecutions",184
284,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,I rise to express my concern at recent developments in Victoria with respect to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I will not go over the ground that was traversed by my colleague the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) this morning in the grievance debate.,187
285,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"No, because he was breaching the sub judice rule and he ought not to have been.",187
286,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"I am not sure whether that is correct. I will not traverse the same ground because the position was very adequately expressed. However, I would like to ,express my concern about the apparent fact that, over the last couple of days, the Victoria Police have visited the offices of the Sunday Age and also the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Neil Cole, seeking information with respect to the alleged leaking of documents regarding the proposed changes to the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions. As yet, the details of these reports remain unconfirmed and so I have not been able to get full details of what has occurred. If this has, in fact, happened, I suggest to the House that it is something of considerable seriousness which we should all take serious stock of-'-particularly the police interviewing the shadow minister concerned and, presumably, asking him how he came to have access to certain information which obviously he acquired and made use of in the performance of his parliamentary duties as a member of the opposition. The situation with respect to journalists performing their roles in bringing matters to the public attention is obviously a fairly touchy one. I am aware of instances in the past where the Federal police have gone to the Age offices seeking leaked documents. To the best of my knowledge, in those instances those documents related to criminal investigations. So it is, I suspect, arguable that there may be greater justification there than in the case where the documents relate simply to a cllange in public administration in the normal course of government. I am extremely concerned about what has occurred-the fact that the offices of the Age have been visited and people interviewed with respect to these documents. If the reports are accurate about the shadow Attorney-General being visited and questioned-or sought to be questioned-with respect to these matters, I find that quite disturbing. If this sort of approach is to continue, one could well, question where parliamentary democracy in the state of Victoria will end up. If parliamentarians in the opposition are going to be faced with visits from the police as part of their",187
287,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Gippsland got a visit.,187
288,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,I am unaware of that. Mr Katter-We get it all the time in Queensland.,187
289,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"Probably before 1989, I would suspect. Mr KaUer-Except we didn't do anything wrong.",188
290,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"I think some of them are in gaol, are they not? What should be of concern to all of us is that here we have a situation where a person has simply been performing his duties as a shadow minister and that has attracted the interests of the Victoria Police. Geelong: People United MrO'CONNOR (Corio) (11.54 p.m.)-In 1992 the Kennett Liberal government was elected to power iri Victoria and proceeded with one of the most vicious assaults on the living standards of ordinary working people that my state has ever seen. No more deeply was that assault felt than in the Geelong region and my electorate of Corio in particular, which has a high concentration of low income earners and pensioners. Four housewives, in their anger and frustration at this assault on their families' living standards, walked off the street to seek advice from those who understood the political process on ways ordinary working men and women might oppose these inequitable policies. Their discussions with family and neighbours unearthed real fear for their future under this mindless, heartless and uncaring state government. They decided to hold a public meeting of concerned women in Geelong. At that meeting, attended by over 100 women in Geelong, an organisation was born called Housewives United. It was the first tentative step into the public arena by those four woman who had never entered that zone before. They had little experience of organising or chairing public meetings, or the resources to sustain any further activity. All they had was a burning desire to protect their families from the rather rotten policies of this conservative state government. Housewives United grew rapidly in Geelong and, as other communities in regional and urban Victoria reeled from the jackboot assault by Kennett on their liberty and living standards, they turned to Housewives United and those four women for support and, indeed, hope. The organisation grew in other communities and today has a membership of over 3,000 people. It has now become, with a new name, People United. It is an extraordinary tale of courage, commitment and dedication by working people to one another. But, for the four women concerned, it has been a personally liberating experience. They have learnt that politics is not what it seems to be from the outside; they have learnt new skills; they have met other inspiring working women and men; and they have refused to cower or be intimidated by this repressive government. They have grown personally stronger in their own lives with the passage of the days. I tell this story in the House tonight as we move towards that rather spiritually inspiring time of the year so that the story of People United will give heart and hope to all working people in my electorate and throughout the state of Victoria. There will be no stone left unturned, no sacrifice too great, no skill left unexploited and no resource left unused in the quyst by working people in Geelong and in Victoria to rid the state of this political cancer that is consuming the heart of this great statenamely, the Victorian conservative government. The prosperity of Victoria will return to the state, despite Jeff Kennett and the policies of his government. The work of concerned organisations such as People United will continue until we have a government again in Spring Street that can demonstrate some compassion for working families in the state of Victoria. Company Takeover",188
291,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to conclude my remarks on an issue which is of such vital importance to the sugar industry, to the Australian economy and to our area. The difficulty with the sugar industry that arises if Tate and Lyle takes this-it is with deep regret in this House that all three parties have a policy of deregulation of the sugar industry-is that we will have a monopoly pricing 'mechanism between the farmers and between the mills. I do not think people in this House, when they advocate deregulation, even remotely understand that most of our primary producers have only one buyer-whether it is the local dairy cooperative or dairy company, the sugar mill or'the meat works, the area usually has only one. Sugar producers do not have the ability to move the product up the road to the next mill, so they either take the price' that they are given or they go into some other commodity, which is virtually impossible for people in super wet belt-the area which I am talking about. Unfortunately, many of them have gone back into growing bananas and that has imposed itself upon the banana industry of New South Wales and gone a long way to destroying that very viable industry that once existed there. These people do not want to get out of the sugar industry, but if deregulation-and that is the policy of every party in this House, I deeply regret to say-is on its way, they are also on their way out of cane and into bananas. That will cause a net loss to the Australian economy because we cannot export bananas. We can, and we did, export the sugar that was produced in these areas previously. I must emphasise to the House the real, ,basic, underlying reason why we are trenchantly opposed to the takeover by Tate and Lyle; if deregulation is on its way, if farmers own the mills, they do not have to worry about deregulation in this area. It is most unfortunate for Ingham and Ayr and those areas which are under corporate ownership now, but at least we would be relatively safe in the super wet belt. But even here we will not be safe if Tate and Lyle takes over these mills. The influence of GATT means that there is no reduction in the subsidies in Europe or the United States---: Europe is the big player in the sugar industry. There has been no agreement under GAIT for the reduction of these subsidies. This means we will be competing against the slave labour wage levels of the big rate farmers in Central America. Even if the workers do not like these wage levels, the farmers seem to have a lot of influence with the government and the people are kept at the tiller for nothing. Those slave labour wage levels will be imported into Australia via GATT, which has opened the door. Alternatively, these industries will cease to exist completely. As far as I can see, in these areas we have a choice of either having no sugar industry or having people working for nothing, as they are in Central America. Many people in the sugar-growing areas are in a very serious financilil situation because the of the demise of agriculture in Australia via the excessive interest rates that have been imposed upon every agricultural industry. I plead with those people who have to sell to do so to other farmers in the area so that Tate and Lyle does not get their shares. There are people waiting to buy those shares at a similar price. I also plead with those people who have to sell to at least attempt to hold out for a reasonable price from Tate and Lyle if they must in fact sell to that company. But there are other buyers out there; there is no necessity to sell to Tate and Lyle. We urge them not to tum our country back to where it was at, the end of the last century, with what were then called the 'imperialist' companies controlling the industry in all of these areas while we cut cane in the mud amongst the Taipan snakes, crocodiles and floods for virtually nothing. And that is really what it was like. Burning was introduced to rid the canefields of the snakes, but that came later. It was not initially a practice on the canefields. These people worked in the fields and they worked for nothing. That is what we will return to if we have a situation of deregulation coupled with the takeover of these mills by foreigners. If there were ever a case where the FIRB should intervene, it is this one. I would like to pay very great tribute to the battlers up there who are fighting tooth and nail to see that we do not return to the Stone Age. They are people such as George Despot, George Taifalos, Fred Lizzio, Reno Cargnello, corpo- Dennis Stevenson, Graham Patch, Delmo Tarditi, Scott Grimley and Don Watson. They are enormously capable people and people whom I am quite confident will win in the long run. But they have to get some assistance from this place. Friday, 17 December 1993 Director of Public Prosecutions",188
292,Mr DUNCAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Makin-Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (12.03 a.m.)I want to pursue this morning the important and perplexing issue which was raised yesterday in this parliament by the honourable member fo- MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), and more recently by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), concerning the quite extraordinary events in Victoria arising from the activities of the Victorian Attorney-General in relation to the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria, Mr Bernard Bongiorno. The circumstances of this matter, which are of grave concern, were adequately dealt with in the contribution by the honourable member for MCEwen. The aspect which I wish to deal with, however, raises equally important but distinct issues. In recent days, following the leaking to the Sunday Age of a copy of the Victorian government's DPP amendment bill; the Attorney-General has required the Victorian police to investigate the sources of the alleged leak. Aside from Attorney-General Wade's quite extraordinary actions in this matter, a much more serious aspect has now emerged to which I want to refer this evening. I am told that yesterday at about 2.30 p.m. the Victorian police sought to interrogate the shadow Attorney-General, the state member for Melbourne, Mr Neil Cole. In that interview, the police apparently indicated that their interest in Mr Cole had sprung from questions he had asked in the Victorian House of Assembly and they sought to question him on the source of the information in those questions. It is hard to imagine a more gross breach of privilege. Any student of parliamentary history and powers would know well that police interfering or intimidating MPs is about as grave a breach as is possible to imagine. Sadly, such abuse of power is becoming par for the course in Victoria, where Attorney General Wade has time and again now shown herself incapable of carrying out her office in the proper quasi-judicial and impartial way that an Attorney-General should act. I have raised this matter tonight in the hope that lawyers and others across the nation will be repulsed to hear of these happenings and will join in ringing condemnation of the Victorian government's actions in seeking to interrogate an MP over his parliamentary duties and its interference with the independence of the judiciary and of the DPP. I sincerely hope that· this will not be the last that we hear of these matters and that they will be taken up properly in the appropriate place at the appropriate time-which is, of course, in the Victorian parliament-and be treated most seriously. Every student of parliamentary history would know perfectly well that the idea that members in any way should have their activities interfered with by police is the most serious type of breach that one can imagine. I say to all people in this nation who are concerned with proper rights and freedoms that this is a terrible breach, if the circumstances are as have been reported to me. I hope that all citizens of goodwill, and all people who are able to have their voices heard in this matter, will raise their voices in justified concern about what apparently has happened. It not only appears to be a breach of privilege by the police but also a breach of privilege by the Victorian Attorney-General who apparently authorised this particular action by the police. I simply say to members of the House that each and every one of us should be gravely concerned to hear of this matter. I hope that the matter is properly investigated over the next few days and weeks and appropriate action is taken to ensure that anybody who believes that this action is appropriate is brought to book, and the sooner the better.

The following answers to questions were circulated: East Timor (Question No. 334) Mr Charles asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 1 September 1993: (1) Is the Minister able to say whether Xanana Gusmao has been moved from Dili, East Timor; if so, is the Minister further able to advise on his whereabouts. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether the International Red Cross is able to gain access to East Timor. (3) Is the Minister able to comment on the whereabouts of Ma'Huno, the Fretilin leader. (4) Is the Minister able to say what (a) is the condition and (b) are the whereabouts of two students taken into custody after a recent demonstration outside a cathedral when the Papal Nuncio visited East Timor. (5) Is the Minister able to say why th- UN, Australian Government and international media are unable to gain free access to East Timor. (6) Is it a fact that the Australian Government has not promoted talks under UN auspices between Indonesia and a chosen representative of the East Timorese people; if so, why. (7) Does the Australian Government maintain a close association with Indonesia; if so, what evidence is there that the association has had a positive effect on reducing connict in East Timor. (8) What forms of military co-operation exist between Australia and Indonesia. (9) Is Australia providing training in tactical interrogation to the Indonesians. (10) Is Australia sponsoring a development assistance program to provide water to areas in Timor; if so, (a) what kind of water supply is being provided and (b) who has Australia sent to monitor the effectiveness of the program. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The Government was advised that Xanana was moved from Dili to a prison in Semarang, Central Java on 13 August. He was moved from NA Semarang to Cipinang prison in Jakarta on 30 September. (2) The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) resumed its program of visits to East Timorese detainees in early August 1993, having suspended that program first in May and then in June this year. The JCRC has a local office in East Timor. (3) Xanana's purported successor, Mauhunu, has reportedly been released from· detention in East Timor. The Government understands Mauhudu, Xanana's former deputy, is not in detention but under house arrest. The Australian Embassy in Jakarta has been following up these cases, and continues to make representations about all East Timorese who are in detention. (4) The Government has been informed by the Indonesian authorities that of around 40 East Timorese who demonstrated outside a cathedral during the visit of the Papal Nuncio to East Timor in July this year, about 12 were detained and that they have since been released. , (5) The Government continues to urge the Indonesian Government to grant access to East Timor by, for example, parliamentarians, the media, and human rights organisations. The Government welcomes the access to East Timor given to the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy to East Timor, Amos Wako. A UN observer, local and international human rights organisations, and local and foreign media were all given access to East Timor to attend Xanana's trial. Officers of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta also attended the trial. Embassy officers make regular visits to East Timor. US Congressional aides have recently visited the province. (6) The Government supports the efforts of the East UN Secretary General (UNSG) to help Indonesia and Portugal reconcile their differences over East Timor, through the Indonesia-Portugal talks on East Timor under UNSG auspices. The Government believes that the question of parties to these talks is one to be agreed between Indonesia, Portugal, and the UN Secretary General. The Government welcomes the outcome of the most recent round of the Indonesia-Portugal talks, in particular, the consideration of possible confidence-building measures and the affirmation of the need to facilitate access to East Timor by UN, human rights, and humanitarian organisations. (7) The development of broader and more diverse links between Australia and Indonesia in recent years has enabled the Government to conduct a frank and productive dialogue with the Indonesian authorities, including at the highest levels of Government, on human rights issues and including the situation in East Timor. The Government's ability to raise issues concerning East Timor in a persistent manner at the highest levels of the Indonesian Government, and to receive prompt responses, results from this broadly based approach to the relationship. (8) Current co-operative defence activities with Indonesia include ship and aircraft visits, combined naval exercises, Indonesian observers at Australian land exercises and exercise planning conferences, training and some consultancy assistance by the ADF, reciprocal study visits, and personnel exchanges in shared areas of military interest, survey and logistics operation. (9) No. (10) Yes. As part of its development cooperation program with Indonesia, Australia is assisting the Government of Indonesia with the provision of an affordable water supply and sanitation services to approximately 100,000 people living in and around Dili and the town of Suai on the southern coast of the province. This assistance is being delivered through the five year Indonesia/Australia East Timor Water Supply and Sanitation Project, which began in October 1992. The total project cost is estimated at $18 million, of which Australia's contribution is $1l.95 million. Project implementation is being managed on behalf of AIDAB by a joint venture of Scott and Furphy Pty Ltd and Coffey MPW Ltd. (b) Project performance is being monitored closely through regular field visits to the project AIDAB officers from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and through six-monthly project progress assessments conducted by the Project Coordination Board (PCB). The Board consists of Embassy-based AIDAB officers and national and provincial officials of the Indonesian Government. Aboriginal Land Claims (Question No. 372) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 7 September 1993: (1) What advice did he receive from (a) department officers, (b) Cabinet colleagues including the Prime Minister and (c) the departmental regional office in Perth concerning the decision not to grant a declaration on the old Swan Brewery site in Perth. (2) How many (a) letters, (b) faxes and (c) telephone calls did he receive requesting him to use his powers to protect the Swan Brewery site. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I received the application on 18 August 1992 from Mr Bropho, seeking the protection under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 of areas said to be under threat of injury or desecration from the decision taken by the Western Australian government to allow development to commence in the area of the Old Swan Brewery site in Perth. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's Central Office, in conjunction with the State Office in Perth, provided me with considerable advice on this matter. I received a number of briefings from the Chief Executive Officer and other senior officers of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission on the matter· of protecting the Aboriginal areas at the old Swan Brewery site. These briefings were, as a matter of course, discussed with my Ministerial advisers. It would not be appropriate to disclose the advice referred to because it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose material in this matter that has been prepared for the purposes of the deliberative processes involved in ministerial functions. To obtain a detailed Iisting and description of the information sought would involve the Commission in considerable research, and I am not prepared to direct the Commission to devote the time and resources entailed in collecting this information. The matter of my decision on 11 November to decline the application has been the subject of a Federal Court hearing in Perth by Mr Justice Wilcox in February 1993, and was also before the by Full Bench of the Federal Court in April, and it is therefore on public record the advice which I took into account in making my decision. It would be inappropriate for me to disclose the advice if any, given to me by my Cabinet colleagues and the Prime Minister. (2) I received (a) 31 letters and (b) 19 faxes from the time of the publicly announced actions of the Western Australian Government, in August 1992, to commence redeveloping the area of the old Swan Brewery site in Perth, until I January 1993. Each of these representations requested me to use my powers under Commonwealth legislation to protect Aboriginal areas at the old Swan Brewery site. No complete record waS made of the number of other and separate telephone representations to my Office on this same matter. Since 1 January 1993 I have received a large number of letters and submissions on this matter. On 27 July 1993 I appointed Mr J G Menham to prepare a report on the matters set out in the Act. Mr Menham reported to me on 10 November and his report includes copies of 58 written submissions on the Old Swan Brewery site from a wide cross section of the community. I am prepared to provide a copy of this report, containing these submissions, following my decision on the application. Defence Manual (Question No. 469)",190
293,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 October 1993: Is the Minister's Department responsible for the preparation of a manual entitled The threat, if so: (a) is the manual classified; if so, why, (b) does the manual include advice on how (i) to establish concentration camps; (ii) to put down industrial, civil or political protests, (iii) and when to fire on unarmed crowds, (iv) to lie to the media, (v) to gather information on dissidents, (vi) best to deal with dissident sympathisers and (vii) to search and deal with targets such as women and children, (c) has the manual been issued to Army units throughout Australia; if so, why, and (d) will the Minister make the manual available to Members of Parliament.",194
294,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) There is no manual produced by the Department entitled 'The Threat'. The manual to which the honourable member refers is the Australian Army Manual of Land Warfare Part I, Volume 3, Pamphlet No 2, Aid to the Civil Power. It was issued in 1983 as a restricted training pamphlet on the same basis as all other restricted training pamphlets and is used by Australian Army officers and non-commissioned officers engaged in training. The Manual of Land Warfare is a generic title which covers the whole range of operations that the land forces might be called upon to conduct. All volumes in the Manual of Land Warfare are subject to review on a periodic basis. Other volumes, such as the one on Peacekeeping, are being written and re-written and attract a much higher priority than this particular training manual-noting there is a current directive which prohibits training aimed at controlling Australian citizens. The manual is still applicable to some training. Parts of it deal with the legal considerations involving procedures for call-out, requisitions and requests which can be applicable to a counterterrorist situation if a state government asks for assistance. (a) The manual is classified Restricted in accordance with normal Defence practice to protect Defence information. (b) (i) No. (ii) & (iii) Yes. Description of basic tactical formations used to effect dispersal of riotous crowds, conditions requiring use of force, and when to consider the use of force is contained in this manual. (iv) No. (v) Yes. General considerations concerning intelligence are described. (vi) No. (vii) Yes. General points concerning the handling of women and children are covered, including such aspects as separation from men, keeping young children with wou{en, and adequate facilities such as latrines. (c) Yes. As part of routine distribution of Army manuals. (d) No. Material classified as Restricted is not issued to the public. I see no reason to make the manual available to Members of Parliament as the Defence Force does not carry out training which is aimed at controlling Australian citizens. I reiterate that there is a specific directive which prohibits this type of training. The policy for crowd control in this country is quite clear and there is absolutely no confusion in the military. It is a task for the various state and Federal police forces, and the military neither trains for or has any plans to be involved in this type of activity. Video Productions (Question No. 497)",194
295,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 20 October 1993: (1) Does the Minister's Department or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility have in-house video production facilities; if so: (a) what is the cost of the facilities, (b) how many persons are employed (i) full time or (ii) part time with the units operating the facilities and what are their salaries, (c) how many videos have been produced since 1990, (d) how many videos were for (i) training and (ii) other purposes, (e) what was the (i) title and (ii) cost of each video, (f) were any videos entered into competitions, and (g) does the Department assess the quality of the videos produced; if so, how. (2) Has the Minister's Department contracted private sector firms to produce videos since 1990; if so, (a) how many videos and (b) what was the cost of each.",194
296,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Employment, Education and Training has two small video facilities. One is located in its Queensland State Office. The other is in the Australian Capital Territory office of the Training Strategies Australia Section. (a) One is valued at $16,830 and the other at $17,000. (b) (i) Nil.
