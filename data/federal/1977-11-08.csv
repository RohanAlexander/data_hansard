Private Nursing Homes: Pensioner Patients To To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as inmates of private nursing homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as laid down.

Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient contribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to many pensioners, but because of the cost of installation of phone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to live on and are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel tralian Government as a matter of urgency to1. Make sure that subsidies paid to private nursing homes are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Health Benefit Card will pay the private nursing home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribuion, which will allow six dollars per week to be retained for their personal use. 2.

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the delays between announcements of each quarterly movement in the Consumer Price Index and their apphcation as a percentage increase in age and invalid pensions is excessive, unnecessary, discriminatory omic distress to pensioners. That proposals to amend the Consumer Price Index by eUminaung particular items from the Index could adversely affect the value of future increases in age and invalid pensions and thus be a cause of additional economic hardship to pensioners.

The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation of personal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and and State Governments had the power to vary income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would(a) be faced with complicated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages advertised as being the same; and Pensions (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State.

That the present situation has resulted in the resignation of a large number of volunteerfiremenbecause of the effects of taxauon, leaving a number offirebrigades under strength and a reluctance of potential recruits to pay excessive taxation. That this growing problem could be effectively dealt with by granting taxation concessions to volunteerfiremenin the State of New South Wales similar to those being received by members of the Citizens Military Forces. Education Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will urge the Government to review the Taxauon Act to exempt the earnings of volunteerfiremenin the State of New South Wales from income tax, or give consideration to separate assessment of earnings and so protect the future of the volunteerfireservice in New South Wales. will severely hinder the progress And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Ian Robinson. the shelving of many building and Petition received.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because television and radio: (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at all times, and Taxation (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both respectfully national ABC, and commercial sectors.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Simon. Petition received. Commonwealth Grants to New South Wales To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned electors of the Commonwealth respectfuUy showeth: 1. That over the past 10 Commonwealth to the State of New South Wales have been consistently less than the payments made to most other States. 2. That the arrangements made by the Commonwealth in regard to off-shore oU have been inequitable to the people of New South Wales. 3. That New South Wales no longer possesses such predominance in natural advantages as would enable it to bear without complaint the consequences of such adverse discrimination. Your petitioners therefore pray your Honourable House to consider ways in which these inequities can be corrected, and to initiate action for this purpose. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Wentworth. Petition received. Pensions: Means Test To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned electors of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: 1. That in his PoUcy Speech prior Rt Hon. the Prime Minister said, 'We stand by our commitment to aboUsh the means test on pensions'. 2. That at thetimeit was generally considered that this statement of the Prime Minister's was something more than an empty form of words. 3. That since the last election, there has been no action the Government towards the aboUtion of the means test. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House, prior to its dissolution, will ask the Prime Minister to make a definite statement as to what action he proposes to take, and when he proposes to take it, towards the abolition of the means test And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Wentworth. Petition received. Non-State Tertiary Institutions citizens of Australia respectfully To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens (students, parents, teachers) of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision by the Government to withdraw all forms of financial assistance to students of Non-state Tertiary Institutions is in total conflict with stated Government education policy. The decision will result in a shortage of places for training secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State Government education systems. At a time of severe economic disruption, this action must lead to a serious worsening of the cunent employment situation, particularly school leavers. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Federal Government will act immediately to reverse its decision. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Antony Whitlam. Petition received. Unemployment Benefits years the payments made by the The Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth. The Department of Social Security current means test allows those over 21 years of age to earn $6.00 per week, in addition to unemployment benefits, and those under 21, $3.00 per week. Amounts earned in excess of these levels result in a loss in benefit of $ 1.00 for every additional doUar earned. This policy discourages the unemployed from engaging in parttimeor casual work. Also this may mean that existing or potential opportunities for part-time work will not be taken up at atimewhen unemployment is a major social problem. We believe that this poUcy is having a particularly unfortunate effect on young school leavers who are being denied valuable work experience and training so important for their entry into the work force. Your petitioners humbly pray that this House request the Honourable Minister of Social Security to give effect to the recommendation of the recent Myers report on unemployment benefits and allow those receiving unemployment benefits to earn up to $20.00 per week, before their unemployment benefit is reduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound wiU ever pray, to the last elections the by Mr Yates. Petition received. PENSIONS: MEANS TEST",17

PUBLIC SERVANTS: STATEMENT BY NA I Mr SCHOLES (Corio)-I give notice that at the next sitting I shall move: That this House disagrees with the statement by the Prime Minister made during a television interview that under some circumstances it is in order for public servants to ments and pass them on to other persons. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Minister for Health a question concerning his statement night that on the advice of the Federal Governtainly ment the Royal Australian College of OphthalembroUed mologists will tomorrow cease its field work in Queensland under the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program on the ground that some employees of the field teams are unacceptable Queensland authorities. I ask the Minister Who were the Queensland authorities? On what grounds did they find the employees unacceptThe able? When were their views conveyed to the Federal Government? At what level was the Federal decision made? Is it a fact, as reported the Press, that it was the Premier of Queensland himself who requested the Minister and the lege Prime Minister to stop the program because two Aboriginal liaison officers with the field teams had encouraged Aboriginals to enrol for the State election? If so, why could not the program continue uninterrupted since the rolls for the State election closed several days ago?",21
23,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL TRACHOMA PROGRAM,"For the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition I would like to make it clear that the national trachoma program has not been concluded. That is thefirstpoint that make. Only thefieldeye screening team the program has been deferred in that area-it Treasurer provide the House with the WUl has been deferred, not ceased-for a period one month. Mr E. G. Whitlam-And only in Queensland?",22
24,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL TRACHOMA PROGRAM,"The ongoing aspects of the protion gram will continue in Queensland as they are continuing elsewhere. Mass treatment for traby choma is being arranged for some 9,000 persons in the Pilbara and the Kimberley region of Westof ern Australia. Surgery is continuing in rate Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and in the Northern Territory. For the informa1976-77. tion of honourable members, over 60,000 peoplefarm have been screened. The Queensland screening program has been temporarily deferred because of complaints from Queensland authorities. Who are the authorities? I have had a number of complaints, telegrams and telephone calls from individuals and also from the Premier and Premier's Office and also some concern expresPrime sed through his office and indirectly to me from the Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Adof vancement and Fisheries. I have also been able steal docu- informed that some Queensland Aboriginal communities have objected to some of the people engaged on the program. It has been a matter of great concern to the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmogists, to the Commonwealth Government and to me as the Minister because the only real role that we have in the program is that we provide funds under health last program grants to the Royal CoUege and certhe College does not wish to become in any poltiical controversy. Since there were alleged political overtones associated with, the screening program, the CoUege decided, after discussion with me to defer any further to screening for at least one month unless other more satisfactory arrangements could be made. President of the College went to north Queensland and to the Torres Strait Islands and discussed the matter with Professor Hollows, inwho was very reluctant to dismiss the people concerned; in fact, he refused to do so. The Colfelt that it had little alternative at present but to defer that aspect of the program. I am continuing my discussions with the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists in the hope that a more satisfactory alternative solution can be found to ensure that the screening program can go ahead as planned. In the meantine, all other aspects of the program are going ahead. NA I want to recent assessments that 1978the",22
25,Mr DRUMMOND,ECONOMIC GROWTH,Has will Treasurer noted reflect stronger part of growth in the economy than 1977? the Governof ment's assessment of Australia's growth prospects?,22
26,Mr LYNCH,ECONOMIC GROWTH,"I welcome very much the quesposed by the honourable gentleman. Recent history shows that non-farm product increased only 0.3 per cent in 1975, the last year of office of the Labor Government. In 1976, thefirstyear office of the present Government, the average of growth was 4.2 per cent. On present estimates non-farm product grew by 3.5 per cent in In the June quarter of this year nonproduct was 4.9 per cent higher than in the December quarter of 1975. As the Budget Papers indicate, non-farm product is expected to increase in real terms by 2 per cent in 1977-78 as a whole, which represents an increase of more than 4 per cent over the course of the year. The increase in non-farm product in 1978, as the Minister emphasised yesterday, is expected to be some 5 per cent. Moderate growth this order is certainly consistent with sustainrecovery, and thefiguresclearly indicate the very encouraging signs that 1978 will be the year of economic performance out of the past five years. NA",22
27,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,TRADE UNION BALLOT,"I preface my quesunderstood tion to the Minister for Employment and Indusare trial Relauons by reminding him and the House that among the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which take great care to ensure that members of unions are able to ticipate effectively in the affairs of their unions are three sections: Section 133, which gives to financial members of the union the right to vote; section 152, which requires that union secretaries keep a correct account of union ticket butts; section 170A, which requires union secretaries to supply to the Commonwealth Electoral Office full particulars of all butts which they have in their possession. Having regard to those conhis ditions or requirements of the Act, I refer to a very serious example of union balloting malpracthey tice which is occurring right now in relation to Australian Workers Union. At Mt Isa in Queensland more than 1,000financialmembers immediately. of the union have been refused therightto vote. Does the Minister know that when complaints were made to the electoral officer the electoral officer told the members that he cannot get from the union secretary concerned a list of the memNational bers who are entitled to vote and that the union secretary is in breach of the Act and nothing being done about it? Does the Minister know that the union secretary, on the other hand, complaints are levelled against him accuses the electoral officer or not sending out the ballot papers? I want to know from the gentleman now what action he proposes to take to ensure that all members of the Australian Workers Union who want to vote for or against the present office holders shall be given the to vote, providing they are financial.",23
28,Mr STREET,TRADE UNION BALLOT,"The ballot for the Australian Workers Union election in the State of pleased Queensland is currently proceeding, as the honourable gentleman has said, and I am informed that it will close in early December. am further informed that as at 31 July of this year the audited membership of the northern disgas trict of the AWU, which is the district of the union that is concerning the honourable mema ber, was 10,313 members. I have made inquiries of the electoral officer responsible for the in Queensland and those inquiries indicate that at this stage 6,419 ballot papers have been cent best posted to members. I am advised that on previous experience this discrepancy is not an unusual proportion. But inquiries have revealed that there were no butts of membershipticketsat the State AWU office for collection by the electoral office as at 7 November. However, it is that an additional number of butts being posted from the Townsville office of the union and should reach Brisbane today. I have confirmed that the electoral officer, in accordance with section 1 70A of the ConcUiation parand Arbitration Act mentioned by the honourable member, has required that aU butts be made all avaUable to him. The electoral office in fact has received no complaints at this stage from AWU members about the non-receipt of ballot papers. and But anyfinancialmember of the AWU who feels that he is entitled to receive a ballot paper should immediately contact the electoral office in Brisbane. There is stUl time for him to do that and for membership to be checked and papers issued before the closing of the baUot. If people feel that have an enutlement to vote and have not yet the received the opportunity to do so I advise them to contact the Brisbane electoral office NA NA",23
29,Mr CHAPMAN,AUTHORITY,Does the Minister for Resources recall that it was one of the Government's 1975 pre-election policy underis takings that the Petroleum and Minerals Authority estabUshed by the previous Labor Governwhen ment should be abolished and that assets acquired by it should be divested? Can the Minister advise on the position reached in respect of honourable these undertakings?,23
30,Mr ANTHONY,AUTHORITY,"I recaU very well the High Court proceedings which made invalid and null right the Petroleum and Minerals Authority created under the Whitlam Labor Government. That organisation was intruding into mineral activities which could well have been carried out by private enterprise or under State authorities. I am to be able to say that in the case of the Wambo Mimng Corporation $3m was repaid to the Commonwealth on 29 June 1977. In relation I to Mareeba Mining N.L., its loan will be repaid by 1980. In the case of the Cooper Basin natural project which also has interests in petroleum exploration licence areas in South Australia, over period of discussion with the South Australian Government we have been able to make arballot rangements to divest the Commonwealth's interest in this. We have been holding an 18 per interest in it. Whilst these negotiations have been, somewhat protracted we have now reached a satisfactory conclusion. I hope to agreement signed by South Australia today and to be in a position later today to put out a statement giving the details. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask another question of the Minister for Health. He has identified the complaint about employees of the field teams under the trachoma survey in Queensland as having come from the Premier, the Premier's Department and the State Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement. I ask: Was their complaint, as reported, that the field workers had encouraged Aboriginals to enrol for the State election? If not, what was the complaint? I also ask the Minister whether he has noted the remarks of Professor Hollows, quoted in today's Age, to the effect that 'they two field workers we have ever had'; that they 'have been too busy working their arses off to help save sight to have time to get into politics' and 'that the team could not function efficiently without the two men'. I ask finally whether the Minister has discussed the issue with Professor Hollows to whom, on earlier occasions, he has very properly paid the highest tributes?",23
31,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL TRACHOMA PROGRAM,I have not received any specific complaints. The complaint to which the honourable gentleman referred was seen by me for the first tune in the Press this morning. The broad complaint that has come to my notice is that the people involved with the program are unacceptable to Queensland authorities because they are poltiical activists and are unacceptable when an election campaign is being conducted. The Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists does not wish to become embroiled in a political situation. The complaint is a general one and I have not had the opportunity of discussing the matter with Professor Hollows. I would Uke to discuss it with him ultimately.

Whitlam-The one you issued night?,24
32,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL TRACHOMA PROGRAM,Yes. I seek leave to have that statement incorporated in Hansard.,24
33,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL TRACHOMA PROGRAM,"Is leave granted? There being have the no objection, leave is granted. The statement read asfollowsNA FOR HEALTH, MR RALPH HUNT, AND THE NA NA National Trachoma and Eye Health Program The Minister for Health, Mr Ralph Hunt, has advised the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists that some employees of the field teams of the Nauonai Trachoma and Eye Health Program (at present working in Queensland) are unacceptable to Queensland authorities. Because of the importance of this medical program obtaining complete co-operauon from both Commonwealth and State Governments the College has accepted the advice of the Federal Government that the screening and diagnosis program be deferred. Accordingly, the field team workers are to cease work from Wednesday, 9 November. The field Director, Professor Fred Hollows, is to discuss the timing of resumption of the Program with the Executive are the best Committee of the College. Last week the College President, Dr James Rogers of Hoban, went to Thursday Island to explore alternatives to deferring the Program with Professor Hollows. However, Professor Hollows considered that the field teams could not function efficiently with other than the present arrangements. The trachoma program is conducted by the Royal Australian College or Ophthalmologists and is funded by the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Government has responsibility for obtaining the co-operation of the State authonties. So far, there have been excellent results from the Program and the Government is most grateful to the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists for their efforts and for the very good work done by Professor Hollows. The Minister and the College consider that this important Program, which to the present has examined more than 60,000 persons, must not be jeopardised in this way and that a delay of one month in compleuon of the Program will allay any concern. Meantime, the on-going aspects of the Program will continue: mass treatment for trachoma is being arranged for some 9,000 persons in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia, and surgery is continuing in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Nonhern Territory. Canberra, 7 November 1977. NA",24
34,Mr MCLEAN,BALTIC STATES,"I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the Government any intention of according de jure recognition to the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Union of Soviet SociaUst RepubUcs? Is the Minister aware of concern being expressed by members of the Baltic communities in Australia that the Labor Party has not changed its attitude last in regard to de jure recognition?  many members of the Baltic community about the attitude of the Labor Party on this matter. I have to say that there is in writing considerable justification for that concern. I think that one the most profligate purveyors of policy the Party has ever had is Mr David Combe. In a ter dated 22 August of this year he wrote to prominent member of the Baltic community in manner which shows that the Labor Party has learnt nothing from its irresponsible action recognising incorporation in 1974. Indeed, Combe's letter, in offensive and even abusive terms, casts a slur on the people of the Baltic States. In the letter he describes as 'a stupid ception' the attitude that Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are not legally part of the Soviet Union. In 1974 his leader-the present Leader the Opposition-describe d it as a cruel deception. What was a cruel deception in 1974 becomes a December. stupid deception in the words of Mr Combe. The particular interest of this letter is that Mr Combe seeks to excuse his leader and lay the blame for the grievous error at the door of a senior public servant, Sir James Plimsoll. In his letter Combe states: It was of course Sir James, not Mr Whitlam, the proposal to recognise reality. That tactic, frankly, is contemptible. Members the Baltic community know who was responsible for the decision of the then Government. Leader of the Opposition knows who was sponsible. Indeed the Foreign Minister in previous Government, Senator Willesee, knows who was responsible and knew at the time. Senasince tor Willesee was, at best, only a reluctant fender of the Prime Minister, as he had reason be, as the decision was taken during his absence overseas. It was only by dint of continued and consistent effort by members of the then sition, the present Liberal-National Country Party Government, that the facts were dragged out of the then Prime Minister. The decision to recognise the incorporation the Baltic states became public knowledge only position. when a Press report out of Moscow-no t an official Government statement to the Parliament, petence not a Government Press release-disclose d the fact one month after the decision by the Minister in Canbena and nearly three weeks after the Australian Embassy in Moscow had been informed. The Australian people had no reason to suspect that such a decision would be taken. The members of the Baltic community in Australia were treated rudely and with utter tempt. Mr Combe's letter shows that nothing changed. I turn now to thefirstpart of the question which seeks in a comparitive form the action the present Government took. On 17 December 1975, just four days after the present Governof ment was elected to office, it instructed the AusLabor tralian Ambassador in Moscow that he and letmembers of his staff should not in future make a official visits to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. a Mr MCComas, the Honorary Consul for Latvia in Australia prior to the Labor Government's dein cision, was informed that he could resume his Mr functions as Honorary Consul. We executed our duty to move away from de jure recognition. That was done within a matter of days of election deto government. In short, the Government said very quickly and very effectively that it did not accept the legality of the Soviet annexation of the of Baltic states. This remains the situation. The Government's policy will not change after 10 NA",24
35,Mr UREN,OVERSEAS BORROWINGS,"I direct a question to the Treasurer. I refer him to a statement which he Mr made yesterday regarding borrowings of $200m in New York. Are these borrowings in addition who initiated to the $ 1,700m announced by the Acting Treasurer on 27 September, since they were not of specifically referred to in that announcement? If so, were the borrowings prompted by the further The run down of $7m to $8m in the level of re Australia's reserves in the week ending 2 the November? Why has the Treasurer found it necessary to devalue the dollar by 1.2 per cent the Acting Treasurer announced the borderowing of $ 1,700m on 27 September? Does this to mean that the Government is following a policy of devaluing the Australian dollar as well as, in the words of the Prime Minister last year, a polOppoicy 'of putting Australia into hock*?",25
36,Mr LYNCH,OVERSEAS BORROWINGS,"The honourable gentleman is again, as is his characteristic custom in this House, seeking to play a destructive game in of relation to Australia's balance of payments",25
37,Mr HAYDEN,OVERSEAS BORROWINGS,"It would not be your incomcontributing in any way, would it? Prime Mr LYNCH-The shrill parrot interjects again. He has a lot to answer for to the Australian people. I wish he would not get so nervous during Question Time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has sought certain information. The statement in relation to our negotiations in conthe New York market was part of the original hasborrowing program announced by the Acting Treasurer during my absence overseas. I say to the honourable gentleman in general that terms about the balance of payments position that since the devaluation in 1976 the balance of payments position has, of course, strengthened. Export revenue in seasonally adjusted terms for the recent September quarter was 12 per cent higher than for the December quarter 1976. The value of imports has fallen by 7 per cent between the March and September quarters. The volume of imports is now almost certainly below the immediate pre-devaluation level. The honourable gentleman knows that the current account deficit fell appreciably in the September quarter. The Government's expanded overseas borrowing program has reinforced the capital account and now is encouraging a more favourableflowof private capital. The honourable gentleman would know that as at the end of October the reservesfigurestood at the comfortable level of about $3 billion-slightl y higher than a year ago. The external position is sound. I just ask the honourable gentleman to have a modicum of responsibiUty and to cease his persistent and destructive attacks on the exchange rate. NA",25
38,Mr BEAZLEY,NATIONAL TRACHOMA CAMPAIGN,"I ask the Minister for Health a question concerning the Commonwealth's national campaign against trachoma and eye disease as applied in Queensland. Has the Government of Queensland threatened at any time to deny government hospital services to this campaign or to suspend such services? Would any poltiical action by any employee be aUowed by the Commonwealth to impede a vital health program for whites, as it apparently has aUowed a program for Aborigines to be impeded? Is it because blacks in Queensland",26

Were the employees objected to Aborigines employed as interpreters, and was one a master offiveAboriginal languages?",26
41,Mr HUNT,NATIONAL TRACHOMA CAMPAIGN,"The answer to thefirstquestion, which is the key question, is: Not to my knowledge. I am not aware of any threat by the Queensland Government to withhold any of its facUities. The central issue is whether the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, which is conducting the program, wishes to become involved or embroUed in the poltiical cUmate over the next three or four weeks. As I said earlier, discussions are still going on with the College to see whether an alternative method can be found to ensure that the screening goes on. The rest of the program is going on. The surgery and the other follow-up requirements are being met by the Queensland authorities. There is no problem whatsoever in that area. There is some difficulty with the two field officers who presently are assisting Professor Hollows. I do not know their names. I do not know whether they are full blood Aborigines or half blood Aborigines, but they are regarded by some Queensland people as being political activists in north Queensland. NA",26
42,Mr KING,TELECOM AUSTRALIA,"As this is the last opportunity that an honourable member for Wimmera wiU have to ask a question, because of the disappearance of the seat of Wimmera which has been in existence since 1901,1 should Uke to direct a question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Has the Minister noticed an advertisement in the daUy newspapers indicating the achievements of Telecom Australia? Is the Minister in a position to indicate whether the information in the advertisement is correct? If so, does this mean that the actual trading surplus-in terpreted as profit in some areas-wU l assist in the development of improved telephone services, particularly in country areas where the present service is anything but average?",26
43,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,TELECOM AUSTRALIA,"The advertisements do demonstrate the contribution that the Australian Telecommunications Commission is making to communications generally throughout Australia. What has not been recognised by members of this House and indeed by the community at large is the substantial number of initiatives which Telecom Australia is taking to improve services throughout the country. When loose comments are made as to the so-called profit or surplus of Telecom, people lose sight of the fact that under an Act of this Parliament there is a need for the Commission tofindat least 50 per cent of capital works, long service leave and depreciation allowances out of revenue. That is a decision of this Parliament. The capital requirement for Telecom Australia this year alone is over $900m. If we talk of the capital involvement in Telecom we are talking of the order of $6,000m. So the surplus has to be seen in relation to that. Generally speaking, I think that the Parliament and certamly the Government are very pleased with the relationship with the Telecommunications Commission. I know from my discussions with the Commission that it is seeking and will continue to seek ways and means of improving communications, particularly in the rural areas of Australia. We have a vast island continent. Regrettably in some parts of it the population is shrinking and it is terribly difficult to maintain the services that Telecom would wish. I believe that a greater acknowledgment by members of this Parliament and by the community as a whole of the immense contribution Telecom makes would be helpful. After all, all surplus is ploughed back for the benefit of the system. The Australian community owns Telecom and any surplus that is made is of course used for the benefit of increased communications. In this growth market members of the Opposition would do well to seek to use whatever influence they have to get people in the trade union movement to co-operate in the use of the technology that is available. Regrettably at the moment some members of the trade union movement want to set their face against technology. If we are to have the best possible communications in Australia we have to use technology and we have to pursue development. I hope that each and every one of us will make a contribution in that way.

44,Mr UREN,REMARKS BY QUEENSLAND PREMIER,"Has the attention of the Deputy Prime Minister been drawn to threats in the last week by the Queensland Premier, first to the residents of Mount Isa and later repeated to the electors and residents of Mackay and Rockhampton, that their areas would be deprived of State funds if they did not vote for the National Party next Saturday? Can the Deputy Prime Minister assure those people that he will not allow Federal funding to Queensland to be interfered with by a Premier who intends to carry out those threats?",27
45,Mr ANTHONY,REMARKS BY QUEENSLAND PREMIER,"My attention has not been drawn to these so-called threats by the Premier of Queensland; but I can well imagine the threats there would be to the people of these outlying areas if there were a change of government in Queensland, just as there would be if there were a change of government in the National Parliament. The whole performance of the Australian Labor Party over the years has been to concentrate expenditure in the public sector, and very much against the rural sector. One classic example was water resources. Under Labor Party policy we saw the tapering off of water resources programs over a number of years. Money for local government was contained to a very low level. When we came to office we ensured that more money would be made available for local government, and more money is being provided for local government. We ensured that there would be a return of many of the incentives and benefits to the rural community, and they have been returned. Under the Labor Administration they were taken away. The interpretation which the Labor Party is putting on the things which the Premier of Queensland has been saying is prompted by its own conscience.",27

48,Mr HASLEM,ELECTION ADVERTISMENT,"I direct my question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Is the Minister aware of an advertisement which appeared in the Canberra Times last Saturday seeking support for the Australian Labor Party candidate for the seat of Canberra, Dr Lawrence? I ask the Minister whether he is aware that that advertisement states: Canberra's unemployment is seven times greater than it was before Fraser. What is the true position with respect to the increase in unemployment in Canberra, and is that advertisement a ue?",27
49,Mr STREET,ELECTION ADVERTISMENT,"Yes, I am aware of the recent misleading advertisement to which the honourable gentleman refers. I consider it a most serious matter that the Labor Party should so mislead the people of the Australian Capital Territory. The facts are that in the period from December 1972 to December 1975-the years of the Labor Administration-the level of unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory and Queanbeyan rose by approximately 224 per cent. Since December 1975 the level of unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory has nsen by a further 83 per cent. Thesefiguresare publicly available and they give the lie to the claim made in the advertisement of the Labor Party candidate. I think it is not good enough that the Labor Party should mislead the people of the Australian Capital Territory in this way. I am pleased to take the opportunity to set the record straight. In addition let me say that unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory is still well below the national average. NA",27

If the honourable gentleman doubts that let me quote but one of the many authoritative in the economic area throughout the for Australian community. I quote from a section of the Syntec review from which the Prime Minister a candiquoted yesterday. Syntec said this: We expect the medium to long term bond rate structure to gradually towards 8 per cent through 1978. We expect rate of inflation to move sustainably below 8 per cent on a year-on-year basis from mid-1978 onwards. it Having said that, Syntec went on to express two quaUfications to those forecasts. I think the people would be interested in the quaUfications. Senate vacancies Syntec said: Only two things would upset this prospect: (i) defeat of the Government; or (ii)reversionto pump priming fiscal I am sure there is no chance whatsoever of this being defeated in the polls that Ue preahead.

In 1976 under this Government the average rate of growth was 4.2 per cent. If we look forward to 1978, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, the increase in non-farm product is expected to be 5 per cent.

61,Mr STREET,COMMITTEE,"On 1 June 1977 I tabled in Parliament a statement concerning a proposed inquiry into the case of Mr W. F. Toomer, an officer of the Department of Health in Western Australia. The statement indicated that two senior officers of the Public Service, Mr R. J. Perriman and Mr G. P. Temme, would, as delegates of the Public Service Board, undertake a full inquiry into Mr Toomer's case and report thereon to the Board. Messrs Perriman and Temme have now reported to the Board and, for the informadon of honourable members, I table a copy of that report. The Public Service Board has indicated that it is currently urgently examining the report and, on the resumption of Parliament after the election, I will table a further statement giving details of action taken.",29
62,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEE,"At the request of the Opposition, I move: That the House take note of the paper.",29
63,Mr SCHOLES,COMMITTEE," I briefly want to make some remarks about the report. Unfortunately we have not had time to read the contents of the report, but my understanding is that the recommendation of the committee of inquiry is that Mr Toomer be transferred to Tullamarine as a quarantine officer. This in effect would mean that he has been demoted from a senior quarantine officer to a quarantine officer. It also, I think, means that the bureaucracy of the Department of Health has been upheld in its earlier decision to demote him and place him at Port Hedland. I do not want to enter into the merits of the case further because it is very difficult to comment on the findings contained in a report which has just been tabled and which at this stage I have not seen. The case itself, I think, is one which is of historic importance and one of which the Parliament ought to take note. Firstly, the inquiry was set up- I should say that it spans a period of two governments, not only the period of the present Government; I want that clearly understoodonly after a royal commission into the Public Service recommended that a judicial inquiry should be held and it was found that because of some deficiencies in the law such an mquiry should not be held. Therefore an internal Public Service inquiry was held. My concern about this whole episode is that basically it commenced over disagreements between public servants with little or no experience in quarantine matters and a quarantine officer who I believe was conscientiously seeking to cany out his duties, whether or not over conscientiously, and I find it difficult to say that any quarantine officer could ever overreact in the area of quarantine because of the substantial importance of quarantine within Australia. I tliink it is unfortunate that the judicial inquiry could not have been held because of the circumstances, some of which have been the subject of questions, and one question to which I received a reply yesterday, about the inspection in Sydney of M.V"". Vishna Kaiyan, in which a member of the first inquiry into this area, the Director of the Department of Health in New South Wales, was in fact present. Whilst it may be that only inquiries were taking place on the methods of quarantine operations, there are other circumtypes stances surrounding that inspection, which is still the subject of questions on the Notice Paper, regarding the captain being given a clearance by a non-quarantine officer, which have to lay as matters which could have enced the course of the inquiry. I imagine- I think the experience of us all would suggest this-that where a member of a former comvery mittee which has in fact brought in a decision fully upholding the decisions of the Western Australian branch of the Department of Health, and an associated director of the Department Health in another State is present at the time such inquiry, he would be seeking to place best possible interpretation on the decisions which were taken by the committee of which himself was a member. I hope, irrespective ofthefindingsof this mittee of inquiry, that it does not close inquiries into the total quarantine service. I do not believetrial that the quarantine service should be judged on the sins, omissions or successes of one quarantinefollow officer or the disputes which he may have had on personahty or other grounds with omcers of his department. I make that point quite clearly. I be-published. lieve that there are very substantial pounds some degree of inquiry mto whether the quaran-but tine service should be an independent service operating similar to the Bureau of Customs, not in association with it, so that it is not to any departmental direction even though departmental umbrella structures may support it. I think it is important that inquiries m that area should take place and continue. The service is too important for any hint of interference, other than for purely quarantine or administrative reasons. The situation in Western Australia may or essential may not have improved. Certainly, from the early history of the Toomer case, it was less thantine satisfactory. I think that the persons who carried get out the original inquiry did not get the full facts. I am certain that personality clashes in Western Australia acted to the detriment of the service and most likely created a far greater problem the Toomer case than would have existed other-Kaiyan wise. I took this opportunity to speak without having studied the report. I will study the reportmember with some interest. This is the last occasion on which we will be able to comment on it in this Parliament. This matter will be rather old news by the start of the next Parliament. I hope that this report will not preclude further inquines the structure and operations of Australia's antine service, which will become increasingly I important as the number of persons and the Temme of transport coming into and going out of one of Australia increase.",29
64,Mr BUNGEY,COMMITTEE,"I , too, want to speak very briefly on the report. I have taken a keen interest in the Toomer case. I speak as the influhonourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) spoke, in that I am not fully aware of the contents of, or the recommendations in, the report. It is clear that lessons can be learned from this case in a number of areas. Firstly, the honourable member for Corio referred to deficiencies in quarantine. I am sure that the airing of this case of to a large degree has allowed a number ofthose ofdeficiencies in quarantine to be plugged or at the least reviewed. I note that the Government, through the Department of the Prime Minister heand Cabinet has made a review of the whole administrative arrangements of the quarantine sercomvice. I think that this is a very good start. I ask the Minister for Employment and IndusRelations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters (Mr Street) to the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration that its case study of the Toomer case be I note that the Minister has tabled the for report of the mquiry by Temme and Perriman, in no way has any effort been made to summarise the very substantial case study-it if occupies more than 100 pages-whic h was made subjectby Mr Munro who was a member of that Royal Commission. I ask the Government to look at the possibility of following that recommendation. I think this whole case has indicated a degree of secrecy which is quite undesirable. I think frankness breeds confidence. One cannot have confidence in a quarantine service or a department of health which is very keen on hiding things. This whole case has been very secretive. It is that we have confidence in the quaranservice. That is the only way in which we will full support from the pubhc to ensure that there is proper quarantine enforcement. I am worried also about several aspects of the  inOne of them has been referred to as the Vishna episode. The episode has not been explained by the Department. The honourable for Corio and I have questions on notice on this matter directed to the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt). I think it is desirable that they be answered. I note that a reply was received to quesuon No. 1461 which deals with this matter. intoThe Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in quarPublic Service Matters stated: am satisfied that the conduct of Messrs Perriman and while visiting the MV Vishna Kaiyan was quite proper, and has not in any way compromised the independence of the inquiry. Without receiving a full report and answers from the Minister for Health, I have not quite the fidence that the Minister displayed in answering that question. I welcome the fact that a further important report will be made to the Parliament on what Senator Bonner has happened in this case. It is very clear there has been a number of areas of administratminority ive immorality. I hope that if these areas have been revealed in the report methods will be adopted to change the Public Service Act and Regulations to ensure that similar administrative immorality and personal vendettas cannot exercised through the Public Service Act under the guise of the Public Service Act.

68,Mr SCHOLES,CONFERENCE,"by leave-In the absence of the leader of the Australian Branch Delegation, the Honourable Bert Kelly, I make a brief report on the Delegation to the Commonwealth Parliaments mentary Conference held in Ottawa in October this year. One matter which received considerable publicity in Australia related to one of the Australian delegates, Senator Bonner, and to alleged criticisms by him of the Canadian hosts. I conthink that in fairness to Senator Bonner it is that I report to the House on what I see as the circumstances surrounding that. was asked by a sensational that newspaper whether he had seen any indigenous groups on his tours of Canada prior to the conference. He informed the journalist, who rang him late at night, that he had not. Subsequently the journalist said: 'Isn't that a pity'. Senator Bonner said: 'I suppose it is a shame'. A be headline which appeared the next day in the or newspaper which would be akin to some of our more sensational rags, intimated that Senator Bonner had said: 'Shame on the Canadian Government for not allowing visits to minority groups'. The Speaker of the Parliament, who was the Conference of the Conference, indicated at the that the Canadians had done everycould to meet the requests of was a quite proper stateand everyone else agreed with it. Mr Kelly indicated that the Australian Delegation was happy with the treatment it had received. There were some surrounding this case. I think were unfortunate. I think it is important that the House be informed that Senator Bonner, in my opinion, was the victim of a beat-up story by a journalist. I think most honourable members in this House will understand what that is all about. The Conference adopted a new constitution for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association which changes the arrangements with regard to the Executive General Council and matters. These are set out in the report. I shall not go into them here. The one matter of that I think I ought to report on arising A from the Conference was the organised manner in which delegates from the Malaysian area carout a concerted attack on Australia relating trade and other matters. All their speeches, I were prepared in advance before being delivered at the Conference. The honourable member for Indi, Mr Holten, who was a member of the committee concerned, replied on behalf of Australia. But in the face of such an attack I think it will be necessary at future conferences for at least some members of delegations to international conferences from the parliamentary area to be provided with briefs from departsetting out exactly what the Australian Government s posiuon has been, even if this information is provided only to the leader delegation. This Conference was used for the purpose of pursuing a line to the disadvantage of Australia. The information which was available to delegates was generally on the public record and I suggest, not sufficient to rebut the type of attack which was obviously derived from government departments, the delegation being Adermann, A. E. led by a Minister. I think all delegates to the say that it was very successful and one at which Bourchier, J.W. discussions were on a far more intense and real Bradfield, J.M. level than some conferences one attends where Bungey, M.

80,The Clerk,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Notic e has been received from the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) that at the next sitting he will move: That this House is of the opinion that the Government should implement the recommendations of the Joint mentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence fence industry. TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL are Debate resumed from 4 November, on motion by Mr Fife: That the Bill be now read a second time.",34
81,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"This amendment to the Trade Practices Act virtually covers three segments of that Act. Thefirstpart relates to the definition of price, and uses more exact terms. The second part equately relates to the question of the Minister having ability to declare safety standards. The third part relates to the limitation of liability in respect appliances or goods that have been sold. At outset let me make it clear that the Opposition this time will not be opposing the Bill but in will be opposing in principle clause 5 which relates to the ability of a supplier ility for damages by having the opportunity, as a result of this clause, to exclude liability in tract. The Opposition is saying that subject to that proviso we are not opposing the Bill but have a very serious reservation about that clause.put I tliink that on election to government we would restore that clause, in the interests of consumers. The first clause to which I wish to refer clause 3 which defines the question of what would be deemed to be the price. The House will recall a previous amendment to the Trade tices Act by which section 4B gave a definition of a certain higher standard of warranty on supplied which cost less than $15,000. This method, which is contained in the earlier parts the definition, is redefined to give a definition prices. There is no objection to that. Clause 4 is an interesting clause. The reason given for its insertion is that it is a much efficient and expedient way for the Minister notify standards than to have to do so by proclabecause mation. One wants at all times to praise expediture ency and efficiency, particularly where one dealing with business and consumer affairs. However, one must look at the matter from the point of view of what would be called parliamentary procedures. The normal method would be Notice of Motion for regulations to be prescribed. They, of course, can be subject to the review of Parliament. Parliament does not exercise its review role simply because of some peculiar quirk of any member of the Government or the Opposition. It is usually as a result of representations made by people in Parliathe commercial and business life, or even in the on deordinary consumer life, who are anxious to say that the standards which have been proclaimed wrong. So we get that surveillance. (No. 2) 1977 I think the Minister for Business and ConSecond Reading sumer Affairs (Mr Fife) is now saying that the Government wants to do that by notice in the Gazette. The only qualification he has relates to the standards spedned. The clause refers to standards prepared by the Standards Association of Australia or by a prescribed association or body. Minister is recognising the fact that there ought to be some other independent advice. The one qualification that the Opposition has in that respect is that consumers are not represented ador at all on the Standards Association or the similar bodies. Consumersfindit very difficult, because of a lack of funds, to participate in all of discussions of bodies of this nature. They have no the independent means of support. They have some at limited government means of support which in fact no way enables them to be present or even members of various associations. So there is a weakto mitigate liabness there. a conIfthe Minister wants to satisfy public opinion in this area he would need to guarantee that the we appropriate representations of consumers or, to it m another fashion, the recognised organisations of consumers, are represented on all associations at all times in respect of all products. Then there would be some guarantee that the is standard set was in accordance with a determination properly and fairly made at which the consumers were fairly represented. I understand Practhat this is not the position at present. goods We have some rather unhappy remarks to make about standards. I understand that there is of a lot of discrepancy and disparity about stanof dards which should have been applied in Australia and which are not being applied at f iresent. I understand, for example, we have ailed to apply a national standard for children's more clothing, particularlyflammableclothing which to could result in youngsters being burnt to death of certain material used in the manufacof their garments. I understand that such is garments cannot be sold in New South Wales because, quite properly, the vigilant Government and Ministers in that State have taken action to see that those garments are not sold in New South Wales. They could be sold elsewhere in Australia. I understand that we have failed to a safety standard in relation to safety helmets motor cyclists. So people are suffering injury are losing their lives, perhaps because of the of interest at the national level. Certain electronic slimming equipment is apparently a health hazpurpose ard. There has been no proper national standard.have These things should have been done. The have Government cannot let things run along on the has bought basis that it cannot interfere with somebody's follow the normal profit motive or on the basis whether interference would affect a person's that business. The issue is the safety of the and the welfare of the community. Not the least,goods and probably the most serious, aspect is the amount of eye injuries caused by certain toys. Some States have taken adequate action to proment tect the consumer. At the national level we have an weakened rather badly in this area. I would like the Minister to look at that matter, even in the dying stages of this Parliament. He could authorout ise his Department to see why something has not the been done to protect the consumers in those fields. I turn to the most important aspect of the Bill,cerns in the legal sense. It is clause S which states there will be a limitation of liability in respect ofinserted goods supplied. We are really saying that the ser-ably to have known. vices relaung to personal, domestic or household also is to be inserted in use will not be affected, but if there is any other use the question of damage or consequential damage which a person may suffer will have toAct be borne by that person. The clause flows no coming doubt from strong and violent representations by the multi-national computer company, IBM Australia Limited. It is not good enough for this country to have legislation that might suit some overseas combine which, having interpreted new legislation, feels that it represents an openwould ended commitment for it because it removes pro-to visions which allow a consumer who buys one its computers for less than $15,000 to recover substantial amount of damages. Let us look at the legal principles involved. It isIn quite clear that, under the Act as it is, the conI had sumer would have to show that he indicated thatsupplying he intended to use the appliance for a specified was determined purpose. In other words, he would have to showAustralia. It said that that he did not just buy the computer off the shelfand that the legislation without saying anything about what he intended way to use it for. If he had done that and then usedsaid that without such legislation the appliance wrongly, he would not be able to might be able to sustain a case against recover damages. He would have to provide evidence that at thetimeof purchase he specified the purpose for which he wanted the appliance.consumer Plenty of English decisions made under the Supply of Goods Act clearly show that suppliers are setnot expected to know the idiosyncrasies of the forpeople who buy from them. A person who buys andan appliance and misuses it or does not use it lackproperly may not recover damages as a matter of course. Far from it. Evidence as to the specified has to be considered. The purpose could been specified by the supplier and it would ages had to be specified by the consumer. Damare not given automatically to someone who an appliance. The purchaser has to procedures of law and show of some doubt about he has suffered damage because of a breach consumerwarranty-relatin g to the warranty of warranty-a n implied or a specific purpose for which the may be used. IBM has ignored all that. The British Governweakened its stand on what it thought was appropriate Supply of Goods Act and eventually amended its legislation in 1973 to exclude liability in these cases. The British legislation set the reasons for exclusion. Thefirstreferred to strength of the bargaining position. An exact quotation from that provision is now proposed to be inserted in our legislation. The second conwhether the buyer received an inducement. thatAgain an exact quotation is proposed to be in our legislation. The third consideration is whether the buyer knew or ought reasonAn exact quotation of that our legislation. What has happened is that, because an international combine has asked the Government to use the British as a model to protect it, the British Act is be the Australian law. We were pioneering the law on trade practices. Our legislation protected the consumer by providing that appliances costing less than $15,000 the ought to have an implied warranty that they meet the test of a specified purpose. This is be thrown overboard because the Minister has ofsuccumbed to the pressures of an international a group. I do not think manufacturers in Australia were very worried about the existing provision, but IBM engaged in a strong campaign against it. fact, it wrote to me about a speech I had made. said that IBM had gone on strike against the normal consumer in Australia. It to stand over consumers in it was going to have its way should be framed in the the British had framed their legislation. It a consumer it. Let us put the criteria in the right place. No can recover anything unless he suffers damage. The result of the action of the Minister and the Government is that the consumer suffer damage. He will have to bear the cost, that is the end of the story. Is that fair and reasonable? All that the law normally asks is that a product which is bought should meet the pose for which it is specified. That is the meaning of this division of the Trade Practices Act. It does not say that there is a complete absolute liability in any sense of the word. It relates to the evidence about the nature of the He said: transaction. Section 71 states: Where a corporation supplies . . . and the consumer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the corporation . . . any particular purpose there is an implied condiuon that the goods are reasonably fit for that purpose . . . Section 74 states: Where a corporation supplies . . . sumer, expressly or by implication, makes known to poration any particular purpose . . . That is the overriding test. We just cannot say should that IBM is responsible for all its appliances if consumer misuses them. It is not. The natural result of this amendment is that, if a consumer buys an appliance which he says he wants for a specified purpose and it fails to do the job and suffers consequential damages, he may not be able to recover because conditions presently required by the Act may be excluded from contract. There was a stampede by a particular group indicate to the Australian legislators that they had better not continue with what they had done. Because the Act was amended earlier this year protect consumers, IBM decided to wage a campurpose paign to get it altered. Unfortunately, wrongly in my view, the Government has sucactual damages. cumbed. Mr Moyes of IBM is no slouch at lobbying. He wrote to me about what he felt were in The unfair remarks I had made. I stand by those Australian remarks. He wrote to me on 8 did not receive the letter until about 11 October. I for consumers andIt was do not know what happened to it. The backthe definition of 'consumer' ground is that I understand that there was correbroadened to protect a number ofbusiness spondence in the newspapers, particularly the Age in which Mr Moyes said that he really not certain what the Government was going to affected do. I very much doubt that. It appeared very clearly from the word go that IBM was deterbuys mined that the Government had better do something. It should be noticed that this amendment like is before us on the last day of the Parliament. We want the Government to look at the law this point. When I replied to Mr Moyes I pointedto out that the legislation did not mean that autoproblem matically IBM was responsible. The test of stand whether there had been a specified purpose had will to be satisfied. It was known that the and idosyncrasies of a consumer would be taken into account. There was much difficulty with the law concerning whether clauses of contracts were expurcludable. When the Suisse Atlantique case was implied discussed in the House of Lords, Lord Reid talked about this very problem. He said that we and had to look at what was fair and reasonable and that we could not really expect the courts to do it. . . . in the recent cases that the courts are to consider whether the exemption is fair in all the circumstances or is harsh and unconscionable or whether it was freely agreed by the customer. And it does not seem to me to be satisfactory that the decision must always go one way if, e.g., defects in a car or other goods are just sufficient to make the breach of contract a fundamental breach, but must always go the other way if the defects fall just short of that. and the conThis is the particular point: the corThis is a complex problem which intimately affects millions of people and it appears to me that its solution be left to Parliament. If your Lordships reject this new rule there will certainly be a need for urgent legislative a action but that is not beyond reasonable expectation. The British ran away from taking appropriate legislative action. The Australian Government he has succumbed to international pressure to do just what the British have done. The point I am making is that damage will be sustained by the people who purchase goods under a contract with a clause that states they will not be able to recover damages because such contracts are to excluded from the Trade Practices Act by this Bill. Under the existing Act it is appropriate for a person to say that he bought the goods for a to specified purpose, that the supplier knew the and that therefore he is entitled to and recover damages-no t penalty damages but this Swanson Committee was very interested matter. It was a committee to which the Labor Party did not give much praise September, but I in every respect. recommended this protection strongly of the view that ought to be transactions, in particular those involving the small was businessman. He is the man who will be most by this negation of liability. Is it not fair and reasonable that any small businessman who one of these appliances from IBM or the should be entitled to recover damages, if he suffers damages, and should not have to face the issue, particularly in a monopolyfieldwhere, on perhaps he needs this sort of hardware and has buy it under a contract which says: 'If there is a in the sense that that machine does not up to what you will tliink it will do, it will not be our responsibility. You can take no action against us'.? He legally meets the defence that had to sign a document which provided that he could not take action. The parties are not on equal terms-fa r from We have a massive international group with a within the monopoly on appliances selling those appliances putting pressure to a customer who has nothing ness and who is not able to say: 'Well, I am on than that proposed ahere. equal terms'. It is a take it or leave it proposition. 'You cannot exclude the provisions I notice this same international group was encouraging people in the elevator business to do tomer indicated the specified purpose'.the the same sort of thing. They were working a littlehave this weakness now that if there is to bewea club amongst themselves to indicate clearly to the poor unfortunate customer 'Well, you are not always going to recover damages because we have a sort of monopoly on appliances that you must have. We will now persuade this GovernParliament'. ment to alter the Act so that you will not recover damages in certain circumstances'. a It is not good enough just to talk about uestion of replacing the machine or repairing te goods. What about the damage the person clause 5. suffers as a consequence of the failure chine or the failure to maintain the warranty? consequential damage is involved. That person Smith could go broke because of this sort of liability. certainly We do not see that happening in the interpredictable. national sphere. These people are unlikely to go no substantiation. broke. They have a multi-million dollar asset ments to the Trade backing. I do not know of any outrageous claims on a number of occasions having been made against them in recent monthsment. It is all directly related because of the amendments we passed. We do not see small businessmen running off to court, given. issuing writs on the basis that recover damages. In every case they have to sub-do. That is exactly stantiate the claim. It is quite wrong that the small business comtraverse munity in Australia has been so deprived of mal protection. The Swanson Committee was anxious to give them that protection. It was beaction. cause of the Swanson Committee that this particular amendment was introduced. Now it is to disappoinment be removed. Why? It is because of IBM and a this matter a few few others who say that they do not like it; that they do not want Australia to be a pioneer in this clearly field, that they had better sink back to where proach they are in Britain and other places. So the big when he said that man is always protected and the little man an international combine, always suffers. We would have no objection if this were equal footing proposition, but this is in no way equal footing proposition. We are concerned think that the Government has caved in, particuthat larly in the dying minutes of a parliament, passing a law that will affect a number of people.places For that reason we oppose clause S. It is too late he to talk about a redefinition of it. I have clearly outlined to the Minister the concern of the smail business community. I am not at all impressed it. waywith the representations made by IBM or the which it made them. Nor am I impressed other people IBM tried to inveigle into on this Government. The law but a small busican certainly stand much better amendment It could clearly say: in the conalso tracts where it is clearly spelt out that cusYet contest about it, perhaps a court can deterrnine what is fair and reasonable. As was said by Lord Reid in the Suisse Atlantique case: 'There can be no such thing. It cannot be done. It is a matter for What about the Government looking at that situation? It is for those reasons that whilst we do not oppose the Bill in the overall the context, for the reasons I have mentioned, we certainly object strongly to the provisions of of the ma Mr IAN ROBINSON (Cowper) (11.53)-The A attack by the honourable member for Kingsford(Mr Lionel Bowen) on the amendments is something that could be regarded as His case falls to the ground and has It will berecalledthat amendPractices Act have occurred in the life of this Parliato an undenaking That was that imperfections, serious they are going to anomalies, action taken would be reviewed and appropriate when it was found reasonable so to why these cunent amendments have been introduced. I do not propose to them all because they are clearly undernorstood by those who want to apply themselves on a basis of fair judgment of the Government's Unfortunately the Opposition feels some because its extreme approach in years ago was designed quite as a socialist approach. It was an apthe which was summed up in the words of honourable member for Kingsford-Smith there had been pressure from as he described it. He refened to multinationals and the like but failed an to recognise the importance of balance between an this and thefieldof commercial operation in this to country. This was particularly so when he said we should be taking action that differs from and is that taken in the United Kingdom and other where greater experience has occurred and where, of course, there is a greater apprecimeasure, ation of the involvements. He suggested that we should be the pacesetters in some of these ters. How ridiculous! It astounds me to think that we could approach matters of this kind on the basis that the more limited business scope in country is sufficient upon which to basement. But still that is the proposition that has been put. Quite clearly there is a lack of understanding, particularly of the import of clause 5. The difficulties that arose as a consequence of the provisions of clause 5 are very clear. What proposed is to bring about a fairer situation, just for large companies-the honourable memof ber named IBM-but for the whole spectrum of Bill. those commercial operations that supply equipable ment up to a certain value. The assertion that it should be fair that damage should be enterbefore tained in the matter of losses that might occur very one-sided view. I say to the House that if that is the view in this matter, what about trial disruption? What about damage that occurs then to the success of a commercial operation? It is a very different argument when that kind thing is raised in thisforumor in any other place by the Opposition. Therefore I repeat that the pressions by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith in this matter are predictable. Obviously a pohtical judgment rather than tual one has been made by the Opposition in contract. looking at this particular issue. I said that I did not propose to traverse all details. That is for the reason that there is a limitation and also that it is not really necessary. What we want to be clear on is that the Governvices ment is honouring an undertaking to amend where there is justification so to do, when proper cases have been put as to the effect of the legisgoods lation in its original form. No doubt there will be further instances where there is a need to take action of this kind. It is very clear that the Government is seeking to free Australian comtween merce from unnecessary straitjackets imposed the legislation and where there is unnecessary restrictiveness. Small business will be assisted a very great extent by the amendments. In fact the interpretations that have sometimes been placed on the present legislation have been shown to be quite wrong. That is dent in the attitude that was displayed by people commenting in nnancial columns and the like to the effect of the amendments. This caused some real worry and concern for retailers when they were not going to be involved at all in way that was described. It is a pity, when we want to have an effective trade practices that there is distortion and that that distortion is so often strongly expressed on wrong matpremises. For that reason I commend the amendments contained in the Bill. Very clearly, they are aimed at assisting the consumer, and the thissuppUer-indee d the whole spectrum of straight judgforward business in this country.",34
82,Mr FIFE,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"in reply-The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson) has answered very clearly, very well and in a complete way the concern that has been is expressed by the honourable member for not Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), on behalf the Opposition, in regard to clause 5 of the I think I am right in saying that the honourmember for Kingsford-Smith has indicated general support for the rest of the measure that is the House. However, because it is several is a days since I made my second reading speech on this subject, I think I should rernind nonourabie indusmembers on both sides of the House that the Government, in arriving at its decision as expressed in clause 5 of this Bill, concluded that in of the context of commercial dealings in commercial goods or services it is reasonable to aUow, exand I emphasise the word 'aUow'-no t to forceparties to a contract to negotiate their own anangements regarding Lability for consequena factial damages flowing from a breach of the Let me make it clear that the Trade Practices the Act will continue to maintain a basic philosophy time ihat suppUers of goods or services should stand behind the quaUty and title ofthose goods or serin their dealings with business as well as with the pubhc. Accordingly, the Bill does not allow UabiUty for repair or replacement of faulty or services of for a breach of the undertakings in section 69 relating to title to be excluded. Further, the Bill does not allow relevant UabUity to be Umited with total disregard to equity be the parties. The Government beUeves that by the recent amendments to the law in the United Kingdom in this regard are appropriate to the to Australian situation. Because of this a Umitation of liability in a contract governed by the Trade Practices Act may be chaUenged on the ground that the limitation was not fair and reasonable particularly evibetween the parties. The only other point that I wish to make is in as regard to the fact that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith singled out IBM Australia Ltd for criticism for the representations it made the to the Government and, indeed, to the Opposition. I want to make it perfectly clear that representations were received from a large number of business organisations-no t only from IBM-in regard to this matter and concern expressed. It was because of this concern that Government reviewed the definition of 'conthe sumer' in the Trade Practices Act. Some time. I made a public statement indicting that confor sideration was being given to amending the legislation in this regard. A large number missions were received not only from industry groups and commercial organisations but also from consumer groups. I am bound to say that, apart from the criticism levelled here today, not aware of any substantial criticism having been contained in the submissions I have received. In fact, I took the opportunity of cussing the matter with the Government's ory group and, again, on that occasion there general acceptance of the proposal that is now before the House.

He said that the Government will be dealing with that matter upon its return to office. Let me say that my party will be dealing with because it expects to be in office. One wonders why the matter of manufacturers' warranties could not have been dealt with, with the same expertise and speed. That is not the case. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson) made a rather strong attack on me on the basis that I had some peculiar problem dealing with overseas international combines. I have no such problem. I would like the honour I regret able member for Cowper to understand his own Government's position. It was that Governmentwas - no t the Labor Government of which I was a the member-that introduced the amendments to Act which this Bill seeks to delete. Let me ago refresh the memory of the honourable member Cowper. The amendments to the Trade Practices Act were foreshadowed a long time before of subthey were introduced. Plenty of submissions could have been made-the y were not made at that time-by IBM. I am aware that the Committee to review the Trade Practices Act, the I am Swanson Committee, stated that one of the amendments should be in relation to the definition of 'consumer' which adopted the basic disnotion of goods or services 'ordinarily acquired advisfor private use or consumption' and then was excluded certain transactions of a commercial nature. The Committee considered that the best approach to the definition would be by reference to the price paid by the consumer for the goods or services. The Committee recommended that the appropriate test should be a limit of $15,000 on the value of the goods or services. The honourable member for Cowper has forgotten it was the Swanson Committee that in this recommendation which forms of the Government's recommendations. the Swanson Committee do that? It was of the view that the definition of a 'consufficiently broad to provide range of business transactions, small businesses.

These inequahties are not Umited to 'traditional' consumers or involving what might be termed in a narrow sense. The Comabout the possibUity of an a wrong chair, or warsometliing of that nature. it, Again, the honourable member for Cowper seemed to overlook the fact that some Government Ministers were concerned that IBM was becoming upset. Itfirstappeared in the Australian Financial Review, which at that time seemed to be the appropriate mouthpiece for IBM, that the industry was grinding to a halt because the comniter group was upset. The managing director of { in BM informed aU its clients by telex: to have to infonn you Uiat until further nouce we will be unable to accept new contracts . . . They were the only people mentioned in the Press. There was no suggestion by the OppoDeputy sition that the Government had done the wrong thing. In fact, the Opposition was applauding the Government in this area. I am astounded by the ignorance of the honourable member for apoly. Cowper in this area.

Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Fife)-by leave-rea d a CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 November, on motion subThat the Bill be now tead a second time. in this Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) on (12.15)-The Opposition does not oppose this is Bill. The Bill contains a number of clauses but the consequential clause relates to the adoption the Brussels definition of commercial value and the Opposition accepts that proposition. The problem in respect of the Brussels definition always has been to indicate that the value see ought to be the value placed on the goods or appUances or whatever it may be in the country of origin. There have been some circumventions into the past with a country of origin moving goods into another country with discount, that then affecting the question of the documentation price Amendments are proposed also to give greater flexibUity to regulations governing the granting, operation and transfer of Ucences. Clause 7 provides a restructuring of provisions setting out the general requirements in relation exports to provide a basis for elimkating the need for export Ucences under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations by upgrading the export entry as a sole control document The other important matters deal with drug traffickare ing offences and the maximum penalties which can be provided. At the moment the issue of drug addiction the most important issue in Australia. It is ably true, as the Senate Standing Committee Social Welfare said recently, that it is not limited to narcotics and amphetamines. It also includes alcohol and tobacco. We must put them in the right context. Nevertheless, the results quite serious, no matter what drug we look They affect the health of people, particularly young people. WhUst we cannot pass laws to prowe tect people from themselves, it is important to to protect people from others. The purpose of solution. this Bill is to impose very heavy penalties. The Opposition will not say any more about that aspect because the Government feels that that the position. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has indicated that the national ParUathe ment is interested, as it should be, in the question of drugs and their effect on Australia. Heroin, course, is imported and therefore one would the think that the Parliament, as a federal organispublic ation, could prevent its importation. Of course, that is extremely difficult. In fact we are not preventing it because there are so many points entry. It is well known, for example, that the of heroin is prevented in Japan because the penoffence. alties are so great and the treatment is so harsh that people do not use it. They use other drugs, which is of great concern to the Japanese ting authorities. It foUows, I suppose, that because the cessation of the hostilities in Vietnam, certainly because Japan has prevented the case importation of heroin, Australia has become the soft market, the easy market to penetrate. happening accordingly. The Opposition was anxious, when the Prime affected Minister set out the terms of reference of the Royal Commission into drugs, to see those terms that way. extended to include criminal conduct arising from the use of narcotics and amphetaminesthat would include people peddling those and making enormous amounts of money-and , cushioned most particularly, the treatment of offenders. Opposition suggested at the time that those matthis ters be considered because in many cases the uncovered fortunate offender also is a peddler. He lives off the proceeds of peddUng and keeps up the money supply for the person, in many cases an international criminal, who can provide the to drugs and guarantee their penetration. WhUst we cannot get to aU these people, the world is concerned because so many young people are affected. In this nation at the present time we have a false sense of security, beUeving that we doing aU we can to make penalties severe. We are punishing people with gaol sentences and big monetary penalties. Up to a point this appUes to people who are not really affected or is addicted but who are just interested in the probmoney. They are the people who are preying on on the system. They are the ones whom we would just not mind going to gaol and being dealt with rather severely but for the unfortunate addict it is no solution; that is the other point. This has to be are looked at as a problem in society in the same way at. as alcohoUsm and other problems are regarded. There has to be some understanding of how best can help these people. They need support and try they need treatment. Incarceration is not the I am not going to delay the House, but every is member who has a penitentiary in his electorate knows that imprisonment does not solve many of problems of mankind. It does have some value in the sense perhaps of being a deterrent of but in the mam it does not do anything Uke what pubhc thinks it can do. It does not protect the against crime. It does not rehabilitate offenders. I am referring to offenders guUty of what one could call serious crime such as bodUy of injury, threatened violence and matters of that use nature. Drug offences are a different type of It is more a self-inflicted wound type of offence. We have to look at the minds of the people to ascertain the problems that are upsetthem, how best they can enjoy their Ufe and of what are the worries and pressures that have and caused them to become so addicted. In every it will be found that there is a reason. It is probably due to some personality problem, the It is home environment or some other reason. The drug problem affects young people particularly. It is interesting to note that most people who are are under 23 years of age, so there is this identifiable factor of immaturity, if I can put it The experience of Uving is a great thing and drugs perhaps the older we get the more we are against the things that can destroy us. The It is important now that we have legislation of type not just to say: 'Look, we have got it because the penalties are pretty substantial'. This legislation provides penalties of up to $100,000 or imprisonment up to 25 years or both. Those are really tremendous penalties, but will they solve anything? The answer is: 'Not really'. It might be a great thing to catch some pedlar who has caused so much damage, but supporting this Bill I would like the Mmister Busmess and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) to use his good offices with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in these dying moments of the vital Parliament, and the Government, to say that the Government wiU alter the terms of reference the royal commission to guarantee that we do not get a really intelligent appraisal of the situation. think the Senate Committee report was a very good one. It looked at the problem probably with some medical expertise as well. We have to treat the patient. We have to get a solution can be done but it does need involvement with the community. This means that people will to take an interest in each other. There is much isolation in Australia today. Australians are too divided. They are isolated against each other. We have to encourage a better atmosing phere. Perhaps we should start in the schools where the teachers and chUdren are so involved and so interested in the future. The high pressfor ures of society, the difficulties of unemployment and aU these sorts of matters go towards causing this problem and it cannot be solved merely with the sort of penalties that are set out in this lation. We support the Bill.",40
87,Mr IAN ROBINSON,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"This Bill is of tremendous importance to the nation. I commend the Government for out introducing it. It is a consequence of deUberstarted ations between Ministers from the respective States and the Federal Mmister. It has been a matter of grave concern to aU thinking Ausclear traUans that the involvement of people in this country in high-powered trafficking in drugs drawn us into the net of a world wide problem, and we of course regard this as a very imposition particularly on young people. It is essential that the penalties that appUed in 1971 be updated. The difference between $4,000 $100,000 and the increase in the comparatively Ught maximum imprisonment deterrent to 25 possible years were designed following careful considerdrug ation by State and Federal Ministers to bring about the required deterrent against the pusher. It is essential that this be done and I am sure that the action of the Government wiU by the vast majority of the Australian people. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) did say that he doubted whether it would solve anything and he said that it would not reaUy stop the problem. I remind him that this has not been the countries and I am sure that it wiU not be the experience here. Certainly the ramifications of the in problem of drugs are very wide and whatever for can be done by research, inquiries, royal commissions and the Uke should be done, but notwithstanding that we need to be vigUant. It is that this legislation in the dying hours of this Parliament should get on to the statute book. It is of important that the Government should give a lead in the matter of deterrent penalties and punI ishment. There is no alternative if we are to toughen up on the people who are the exploiters in thisfield.I strongly support the measure. and it Mr FIFE (Farrer-Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs) (12.25)-in reply- I thank the have honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr too Lionel Bowen) and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson) for the support they have given to this measure. Indeed, it is heartento see a measure of this nature supported so strongly from both sides of the House. In relation to the question raised by the honourable member Kingsford-Smith concerning the terms of reference of the National Royal Commission into Drugs, let me rernind him and the House of the undertaking given by the Prime Minister (Mr legisMalcolm Fraser) at the time the terms of reference were announced. It was, as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith had indicated, mentioned at the time that perhaps the of reference ought to be widened in one way or another, and the Prime Minister pointed that in the interests of getting the commission as quickly as possible he felt the best course was for the commission to proceed with the terms of reference as laid down and he gave a undertaking that if the royal commissioner felt inhibited in any way in relation to the terms has of reference then the Government would very quickly and sympathetically consider any serious request from the royal commissioner. I want to make it abundantly clear to this and House and to the nation as a whole that the Government is determined to do everything in thisfieldto reduce the menace of the problem in Australia and particularly to bring to justice those people who are trading off the health of other people, those people who are trafficking in drugs and as a result destroying the be endorsed Uves of many Australians.

The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Auspomt scoring? traUan Shipping Commission Act so as the Austrahan National Line to provide intrastate service to pons along the Queensland Shortland. coast- a much needed service-and to make certain other amendments to the Act that would bring the style of operations of accounts of the ANL more in keeping with current commercial practice. I will have more to say about that at a later stage. I just want to dwell for a moment on years that have passed in which the people nonh Queensland have sought to have a service introduction provided for their ports by the ANL. It is only the current State election campaign in the Queensland-and I suspect in the Federal tion campaign that has now developed herethat there has been urgency finally to make cision in response to the wishes of the people north Queensland. In the cunent election camthe paign in Queensland a concerted effort has been mounted by candidates in the northern sections of Queensland to press the Queensland ParUwhich ament to legislate so that the ANL can operate into those Queensland ports on an intrastate basis.

At the time, and in subsequent periods right up until a few weeks ago, the Queensland Government maintained that the provision of an intrastate Second Reading Queensland shipping service by the ANL would disadvantage existing surface transport employees and certainly would mean a reduction in the potential income of the Queensland raUways and the laying off of large numbers of raUway employees.

Although it is bein lated and overdue, at least now we can set about business of not only improving the efficiency elecof the ANL operations but also, and more importantly, giving to the people of north a deQueensland a better, more frequent and more of economical freight service than they have had in past. The attitude of the Queensland Government has been hi Une with that of the present Government, as evidenced by a letter a copy of I have here. It was dated February 1976 and was addressed to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). A proposal was put that the share Government should dispose of the four ANL he bulk carriers. One determines from the letter that, when it was found that the loss that would be suffered would be greater than any capital were given by the found that itthat mvestment might be saved, the Government of option and purchasetoofproceed had the four with the construcbulk carriers from allow the ANL to Sweden and Germany. I cannot understand why those on the other of the House, in this Parliament and outside make such consistent attacks upon the operofthe people's own transport enterprises. we see from those opposite and from their party organisations at State and Federal levels attacks on the operations of Transof Australia Airlines, the Australian National Railleast ways, our shipping line or Qantas Airways Ltd. More recently the attacks have been on Qantasthe and TAA. I would have thought that, since these are publicly owned enterprises and are making profits for the Australian people, those who opposite-who , after aU, are supposed to constilation, tute the Government and who are responsible inAuthorization thefirstplace for the operations of the statutory authorities-woul d be welcoming the results and trying to induce from those statutory a better quaUty of service and a better perforAuthorization mance still. Instead of that, we see consistently hereby the opposite. We hear that TAA ought to be dis-and banded and amalgamated with Qantas. a fair risk that there wiU be a substantial change to the two-airUne agreement after the election is over, if this Government unfortunately is returned. Obviously changes are iii mind. I will come back to that later in my comments, in rela- (2) goods tion to the MCNeill Committee. We are told that, under the guise of creating a regime of equal opportunity, several amendments have been made to the principal Act to place the ANL on a simUar footing to private shipping companies. I do not understand what regime of equal opportunity is. Maybe the MinisBUl ter's speech writer one day will define it. I think means aU things to aU men. I think it is true to say that the ANL has operated in the past in a gener-to aUy competitive atmosphere in the market place. It has done its job well. It has a very good reputation both nationaUy and internationaUy. A minor amendment is being made to the principal Act to that, enable the General Manager of the Commission to also be a commissioner. I think that simply tidies up an arrangement for Mr Reg Robin whoAct, is presently in that position. Clause 7 is a key clause which provides intrastate operations. I think it is important that mention a couple of the provisions in that clause.company Proposed new section 16A provides: . . . powers relating to the provision of(a) shipping services for the carriage of goods between places in that State; or (b) shipping services of the kind mentioned in paragraph (a) and services for the carriage of goods the extent that such carnage is incident to the of goods by sea in pursuance of shipping services that kind. (2) The regulations may provide that sub-section does not extend to all or any of the functions powers expressed to be conferred on the Commissionon by a State Act I mentioned at the outset that complementary legislation went through the Queensland ParUaa ment. As I said, it was brought on by the pressureproviding the Queensland elections. This Parliament at has had a few days to look at this Bill. The complementary legislation was introduced into Queensland Parliament and passed through all stages in the one afternoon, on the second last day of the Ufe of that Parliament. The relevant sit clause of the Queensland complementary legisthe Australian Shipping Commission Bill, is clause 5.1 think that clause also ought to be mentioned because of the relationship it has to clause 7 of the Bill we are now authoritiesdebating. The clause provides: of Commission. (1) The Commission is authorized, subject to this Aa, to establish, maintain operate or to provide for the establishment, maintenThere is ance and operation of(a) shipping services for the caniage of goods between places in the State; and (b) services for the carriage of goods by land to the extent that such carriage is incident to the caniage of by sea pursuant to this section. The authority conferred on the Commission by subsection (1) shall continue until a datefixedpursuant to section 6 as the date on which this Act shall cease to be in force. Naturally, section 6 relates to the termination of the agreement between the national Government and the State Government. Clause 8 of the before the House is an important clause also. itIt provides that where a service is to be provided in the pubUc interest an urgent pubUc inquiry is be conducted into the nature of the alternative shipping services or other modes of transport, including those which could be provided by private transport operators. In effect this means where it is felt that a shipping service ought to be provided and the Government wants to take a decision under section 17 of the principal the Minister will be required to urgently order an inquiry into whether that service ought to be provided. If such a service ought to be profor vided, mquiries wiU be made into whether some I other mode of transport, such as air, or whether a other than the ANL or any other suppUer of transport services could provide the service. I think, from the Minister's second reading speech and from the explanatory notes, that an opportunity is given for the private sector to come into the market and to participate in proby land toviding a subsidised service where the Minister caniagehas deemed that a service ought to be provided. I of think it is possible that in the long term that may (1) operate to the advantage of the ANL, but an and assessment of that would depend upon the return the funds invested or the capital invested in providing that service and the kind of return that the Government would seefitto pay. It is simply reimbursement of losses incurred by the Line in that service; there is no profit content for the Line and capital will be invested without any return. Even though it seems to me that in the short term that amendment is intended open up access to those services to the private sector, I think it is possible that in the long term will have the opposite result for ANL in that it will enable ANL to be more selective in those areas ofoperation that it decides are prontable. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for the Minister set the dividend target. This power in respect of Trans-Australia Airlines. There is nothing untoward about that other than that one could possibly see that as a device which the Minister in setting the dividend target could set it unreasonably high. That would require the Commission to set rates to try to achieve that dividend target. If there were one or two other operators in that service that would enable those operators to bring their prices up to those levels. So indirectly it could interpreted as a freight rate maintenance financial scheme. It remains to be seen whether that will work out. In the same clause provision has been made for the supply of estimates at least half yearly, and possibly more frequently. I think that is a good move. I understand that they used to suppUed in the past in normal accounting stand methods. Clause 10 provides for separate accounts for coastal operations and overseas operations. This again is a reversion to past practice. Again Opposition thinks this wdl be of use in determinlegislation, ing the operations and success of the Comand mission and in helping the Parliament to fine respect. down the areas of improvement that should looked at by the Parhament or by the Minister. Clause 11 deals with the implementation of new freight rates. It provides the Minister with power to disapprove proposed rates within 60 days of notice. It also provides that if he does disapprove of them the rates apply automatitransport caUy, as I understand that clause. The purpose of that, it seems, will be to remove some of the pohtical opprobrium from the Minister or the Government as being seen to be directly responsible for increasing freight rates. Because freight rates to Tasmania had not been increased in even and frequent steps prior to the election in 1972 there was a build up of pressure for a price increase to try to recover losses being incurred. As a result of that the Whitlam Government had to increase the 1972-75 period by 40 per cent. I think clause 11 will prevent that happening in the future. Clause 12 is only a machinery clause covering superannuation. Clause 13 ensures that funds intended as capital will be so identified by Parliament. I think again that this is to the advanto tage of ANL. It wiU clarify its position. In moneys transmitted from the Parliament to the it Commission where capital is properly identified the Commission will be in a position to relate its accounts more accurately in the performance of its operations and to remove some of the doubt that has been spread from time to time by to opponents of publicly owned transport is in line with his enterprises. Clause 14 deals with the power of the Minister by to determine the dividend to be paid to the Commonwealth. Clause 15 puts ANL borrowings on the same basis as those of the private sector and provides that approvals for loans to be raised be only required only from the Treasurer and not from the Minister for Transport as at present. Clause 17 gives the Minister power to determine be disposal of the balance of ANL profits for the year. Clause 18 deals with taxation UabUity. It puts the Commission in the same position as private shipping companies. I do not think there is much difference at all in actual practice in the tax rates that are paid by the Commission or beother charges that are appUcable. As I underit, if statutory authorities are not required to pay a local rate or charge they usuaUy make an ex gratia payment in respect of the cost anyway. But this provision puts the matter in a clear way. No doubt as a result of intrastate operations the in Queensland following the passage of this State charges will become involved that clause will clarify the position in that be In the total multi-modal Australian transport system shipping has a major role to play in the future as in the past and the stronger emphasis a on long distance bulk freight which has been developing recently is Ukely to continue. As sea not transport is the most efficient of aU forms of in energy terms, the rapid increase in energy costs means its importance will grow. The industry has seen rapid acceleration of technical change in the post-war years. New developments in ship designs have revolutionised the means of transporting cargoes by sea. Cargo trade has seen the arrival of bulk carriers and capital intensive unit cargo ships designed to carry general cargo in vehicular, container and barge loads. In addition, there have been roU-on roll-off ships, utilisation of cargo pallets, pre-slung loads, rates in LASH ships and hybrid vessels. These developments have meant that ships are no longer designed for one particular carriage function and consequently are no longer tied to its relative trading success. To meet these changes in shipping and cargo handling changes have to be made to modernise on-shore cargo handling. The planning of port development and re-development must increasingly respond these changes in technology in shipping taking into account the movement of goods to other that transport functions for movement on land. Whilst there have been rapid improvements in sea transport technology and rapid increases the tonnage carried, improvements still need be made in relation to the amounts carried Australian ships. The next Labor Government will expand operations of the Australian Shipping Comcompanies. mission to ensure that an equitable snare trade is carried in Australian-owned and manned vessels. To achieve this objective Commission will be enabled to build, purchase or charter sumcient vessels to carry out that It will also seek to ensure that all coastal will be carried in Australian-owned and manned vessels. Much has been said in recent times, particuincrease larly in relation to Utah, about the carriage our bulk ores from Australia to their markets. mentioned earUer the problems in delay of this legislation because of the Queensland Governfrom ment. I shall come back to that. I want to pointcently out the kind of ngures that we are deahng with when we are talking about bulk trades Australia. In 1975-76 we shipped 62 million tonnes of ore to Japan and 6.5 miUion tonnes vessels, elsewhere. We shipped 25.5 million tonnes of Utah coal to Japan and 5.7 milhon tonnes In total 87.5 mUUon tonnes of ore and coal to Japan and 12.2 milhon tonnes went elsewhere.Queensland. A total of 99.7 rruUion tonnes of ore and coal went from Australia. That was a decrease of 20.7this miUion tonnes on the previous year, 1974-75, due no doubt to the downturn in world steel production. Currently the ANL vessels Australian Pioneer and Australian Prospector are engaged in bulk ore trade to Japan. Jointly they have a capacity to transport 5 per cent of the 1975-76 ore trade or 2.85 per cent of total bulk trade in 1975-76. We know that ANL has two other carriers on order and that they are due for deUvery later dur-Country ing this nnancial year and that negotiations the Japanese steel mills for the utilisation of those vessels wiU commence in early 1978. Ausmdustry, traUanflagvessels have 26 per cent of the north-It bound general cargo trade to Japan and 24 permay cent of southbound cargoes. Under an agree to ment between members of the Australia-Japan Shipping Conference 30 per cent of cargo each way is expected to be carried in Austrahan flagcountry vessels by 1979. Article X of the recent basic treaty of friendly relations between Japan and Australia which was signed in August of this year to deals with shipping arrangements between Japan and Australia but unfortunately it seems the Government to date has done little to fill out the guideUnes and the detaUed objectives of that article. I base that comment on an answer to in a question on notice on this subject. I received to from the Minister recently. Australia is a sigin nificant trading nation and it is important to establish its ownflagcarriers so that it is not the wholly dependent on foreign shipping of our I refer to what is happening in the United States of America at the moment. As I said the earUer, a dispute has occurred in Queensland with Utah. Naturally seamen are looking to the task.contracting employment opportunities in trade Australia which have been projected from all arts of the economic spectrum and the possiility that employment will reduce rather than in the coming years. It is perfectly natuof ral to expect people employed in an industry to I look for job security and for an increasing opportunity for employment in the future. That is apart any other aspects that are involved. As reas a few days ago I received a letter which pointed out to me a statement which had been from credited to Utah. The statement reads: Utah will not employ Australian crews on their overseas but are prepared to charter the two Australian National Line bulk carriers in the trade. But unfortunately if go ahead with this proposal, the Premier will increase elsewhere. the tax levy on the coal. wentThe Premier referred to is the Premier of I do not think there is any doubt about the veracity of the statement. In May of year the Premier of Queensland told Utahthis is on record in a number of national journals-that if Utah negotiated with the Seamen's Union of Australia on the utilisation of Australian seamen in the bulk ore traffic out of Australia, royalties on the company's coal production will be increased. That is a direct poltiical threat. It is another example of what I have refened to on many occasions, both inside and outside this House-of attacks, by the National Party more particularly than by the Libwitheral Party, on the trade union movement, and particularly the unions involved in the transport as a substitute for a poltiical argument. is the old story of bashing the unions. There be some substance in some of the problems which attention is drawn but that is not the way in which to go about it Bashing the transport unions costs the consumers of this money; it costs the workers their wages, it costs companies a loss of profits, and it ages our trading reputation. There is no doubt in my mind, having had disThe cussions earlier in the year, that when this matterpreference was raised originally the Seamen's Union would have been quite happy to open negotiations. Negotiations could have proceeded on the ulticontext. mate involvement of Austrahan traffic. But, all, is it not reasonable and natural that tralians would want a greater share in the wealthcontroUed which is derived from Australian resources? Are we not Australians? Or are some of the people who sit opposite temporary dwellers from maritime another country who are more interested in out disposing of the wealth of this country as quickly and as cheaply as possible, and in taking their profits and getting out as quickly as they possiblycal can? I turn now to the American situation. I underought stand that President Carter has a Bill before thegoods overseas and Congress or the Senate- I think it is before the Senate-at the moment requiring that 9.5 per cent of oil imported into America be transported in American tankers. There are two reasons for that and they are set out in an article which appeared in Newsweek of 17 October. One tifying reason being advanced by the Assistant Sec-' retary of the United States Commerce Departwhich ment, Robert J. BlackweU, is this: US-flag tankers manned by US citizens are Ukely more reliable (in nauonai emergencies) than foreign-flag tankers. America is not an island, as is Australia. This brings us back to the importance and relevance of the Australian shipbudding industry, as was recognised in the report of on Foreign Affairs and Defence on that industry. We are an island continent. I think it would be completely irresponsible for any government, any poltiical party, to plan the future transport poUcy for this country on the basis of placing transportation of our export products and the transportation of our imports completely in the hands of foreign-owned vessels. That would into mean that we would have no control over who makes shipping avaUable and who will not it avaUable. At the present time we are enjoying a luxury period. There is a surplus of world shipping. World shipping rates have dropped and spot do shipping rates out of Australia are very cheap. That situation will not continue because ultimawhich tely the world economy will experience an upturn. When that occurs the whole shipping scene will change and once again Australia will be at the mercy of overseas shipping companies. The United States has recognised that fact. damsecond reason advanced by the Assistant Secretary, Robert J. BlackweU, is this: fundamental justification for a limited level of cargo is to provide assured employment . . . He then went on to mention US-flag tankers. Again that situation is relevant to the Australian We have record unemployment. If a way after can be found in which to provide greater job Ausopportunities for Australians on AustraUanvessels, we ought to be following that Une. Instead of that, the Premier of Queensland is using the Seamen's Union and the other five unions to try to create a poltiical issue of this matter for the State election. The community is divided. Instead of reasonable and factual arguments being advanced, we have poUtiunion bashing and poltiical bluster. The result is that we are disadvantaged. Australia to be ensuring that in the long term we have adequate transport capacity to ship our to bring in our imports. What I am saymg is that we should be looking at this time at those areas of shipping activity that can be identified as being a potential market. We should be identifying those areas, identhe kinds of vessels that could be used, and then going on to detennine the manner in those vessels could be purchased and the method by which they could be manned. Manto be ning scales is the argument that is put up over and over again by the Minister for Transport-h e is not present at the table but he ought to be present-and his party. I am quite satisfied that the matter of manning scales is negotiable. I am satisfied also that there is a downward trend in the Joint Committee that regard. In speaking of crewing costs, I want to refer to the latest report of the Australian Shipping Commission which runs the Australian National Line. It is the 1977 report. First of aU, I congratulate the the Commission on achieving in most difficult times a profit of $3.9m after exchange movements have been taken into account. I will not go the detaU of the report, but I wish to mention that much of that profit was derived from overmake seas trading by Australian-owned and Australian-manned vessels. We hear much criticism about the use of Australian crews on bulk ore carriers, but the people who make that criticism not say anything about the cartels, the conference Unes, which operate. In those cartels in the ANL operates- I mentioned earUer the Australia-Japan conference Une-the rates charged are standard rates and the Australian ships do very well, thank you very much. I refer to page 19 of the Commission's report which The points out that crewing costs of the Line are down to 16 per cent. Those costs have decreased from about 21 per cent in 1974-75,18.5 per cent in 1975-76, and 16 per cent in 1976-77. shows that the reduction in crewing costs been a continuing trend. There is no nice, way in which we can compare vessels. I have here a report prepared by the Parliamentary brary on stevedoring costs and shipping costs. states: There is a remarkable lack of published information on ship operating costs. It goes on to mention pubhc mquiries which have had difficulty in obtaining information, including the Rochdale Committee of Inquiry into shipnot ping conducted in England in 1970. It noted follows: In contrast to the extensive data on labour costs publicly available for many other industries, little able for shipping.",43

He said also that the matter had been handled recendy in the Queensland Parliament. He did not give any credit to anyone in this Government for being sympathetic towards people who Uve in faraway places. We saw examples of this lack of thought during the term of office of the Labor Government. Since the shadow Minister for Transport took it upon bashing. himself to stress that this is a poltiical measure, I tliink I would be quite entitled to speak simUarly on the subject. If it is a poltiical measure, people who should receive the credit are the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr ThomPrime son) and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett) for the work that they have done convincing the Federal Government and, needmercy, less to say, the State Government to put through legislation to assist people in their part of Australia. I noticed that the honourable member for background. Shortland seemed to assume that all members of the Government parties attack government transport instrumentaUties, organisations or opthe erations. I can assure him that people who Uve faraway places get on well with the Australian National Line, Trans-Australia Airlines and the Australian National RaUways. They are the vital links between our part of the country and the businesses in cities further to the south. In that That regard I also mention Qantas Airways Ltd. has There was a time in Darwin when it appeared simplethat TAA would take over the operations of Qantas. That was just after the tragic cyclone in Li1974.1 was very much opposed to that move beIt cause I think Qantas is a very well organised and a very fine operator. I tliink all Australians should be proud of Qantas as our flag carrier. The honourable member for Shortland also said that Labor would do certain things. He is assuming that Labor will win the election. I wiU go into that matter because I know it wiU not. as He said that Labor would provide help here and help there. This Bill provides assistance to north which is Queensland in that it aUows the ANL to operate is availinterstate. We must remember that the Labor Party when it was in office acted against places as north Queensland and the Northern Terby implementing the Coombs report, just to mention one thing. That report did more damthan any other document to enterprise, development, business and faith in the primary of our hinterland. So I feel that he was just poUticking because of the Queensland elecwhich is to be held at the end of this week. He The honourable member for Shortland members on our side of the Parliament of union bashing. He blithely overlooked the militant unionism in recent happenings which cost hundreds of mUlions of doUars and which put hundreds of thousands of people out of work. Because we in government do not take very Ughtly to this sort of behaviour by the rnUitant unions we are accused of union bashing. It really should be called public or private citizen WhUe on the subject of the ANL, I remind the the honourable member that it was a brainchild of the former great leader of this Party and Deputy Minister, Sir John MCEwen. He decided that Australia had to get into the business of in overseas shipping. In those days we were at the to a great extent, of overseas shipping cartels. At that time the Australian Government considered that it shouldfindout, from practical experience, the operations and management of shipping services. That is some of the The main thrust of the Bill is to give the ANL right to carry on interstate services and to enin able it, in the interests of people in north Queensland, up and down the Queensland coast and the far north, to get into operation as soon as possible. Now that the Queensland Government has legislated in this direction the ANL can get in on this trade and can provide a service to people time. who Uve in remote areas, although they are on the coast. In this case, as in others, where the State considers it necessary, there shaU competition. The Bill provides that the ANL will not gain any advantage over the private shipping companies. There will be equal opportunity. Bill seeks to expand section 17 of the Act to by Mr Nixon: entitle the Australian Shipping Commission, if it is directed to operate a certain service for the pubUc and if such a service is run at a loss, to have that loss made good. This privUege is not avaUable to the private shipping services. Minister is obUged to inquire into alternative vices, whether they are other shipping services air services. In many cases they could not be services. The substitute form of service may assistance. In spite of that proviso being written mto Act, I am concerned that this operation couldreservedly say 'could'-be used to push private shipowners out of business. This opinion is hi rect contrast with the opinion of the honourable member for Shortland who argued that the priFederal vate shipowners could, under this Act, by the Minister to raise costs so that ANL would have to foUow the private shipowners and would be hard put to run an economic service. That the way he sees it, and this is the way I see it. a private enterprise supporter, and of course he aU for government ownership or sociaUsm genercent. aUy. I am concerned, and I would Uke someone cation to assure me on that point. No doubt the honourterms able member would Uke an assurance also. I notice that under proposed section 17A Commission will be required to operate in a simithis lar fashion to private snipping services in that will be required to pay dividends, to pay interest on moneys borrowed and to pay taxes. Although the residents of north Queensland will benefit from this ANL service, I have a shadow of a doubt in my mind about whether it wiU operate to the detriment of the part of the world from which I come. The ANL vessel Darwin Trader serves the port of Darwin on a regular basis. trust that the implementation of tms legislation wiU not affect detrimentaUy the operations of that ship and that Line to that part of Australia.

94,Mr MORRIS,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,"The Transport Planning and Research (Financial AsThe sistance) Bill 1977 is to cover the payment of sernnancial assistance to the States for transport or lanning and research. The appropriation of road 8m for disbursement to the States is provided need by Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1977-78. The Bill continues nnancial assistance to the States on a $2 for $ 1 basis for the currentfinancialyear only. the The Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) stated m I his second reading speech that funding would be on a doUar for doUar basis in 1978-79 and di1979-80. No mention is made of this change in the Bill. Once again this represents a reduction in assistance to the States, particularly in be used respect of planning and research. The $8m provided in the 1976-77 Budget for is transport planning and research represented a I am fall in cash terms of $700,000 on the amount prois vided in 1975-76- a faU in real terms of 16 per The Fraser Government's 1977-78 alloof $8m is in effect a 12 per cent faU in real on the 1976-77figure.So one can say that there has been a substantial reduction in real terms in the level of funding by the Federal the Government for the purposes provided for under legislation between 1975-76 and the current it financial year. The Whitlam Government provided the States with $26m over the triennium from 1974-75 to 1976-77 for transport research. The Fraser Government has provided $24m for the next triennium, maybe. I will return to that a Uttle later in my remarks, in the analysis of the level of funds that may be provided in 1978-79 and 1979-80. A comparison of the amounts proI vided iii this triennium with the amount provided by the Whitlam Government in the first three years that the legislation operated shows a faU in real terms of the order of 50 per cent. The Bill essentiaUy continues the arrangements provided in the Transport (Planning and Research) Act 1974. It also is designed to refine certain administrative aspects of the Act to take account of minor alterations which needed to be made following the successfulfirsttriennium of the Act. In introducing the 1974 legislation the Minister for Transport at the time, the honourmonths able member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), said: There is a major need for more sophisticated planning research in Australia in regard to all transport provision of assistance under this Act will be towards developing in the States more comprehensive processes than hitherto existed. The Whitlam Government's Transport (Planning and Research) Act was the first significant forThe move by an Austrahan government towards low prioritylegislation assessing Australia's transport research present Government. One potential, towards coUecting and exchanging Government's legislation was mformation between the authorities undertaking scope of transport research so as research and organisations involved in transport transport mode in relation to other planning, and towards improving the coordination and efficiency of Austraha s transport part research and planning capabilities. Conseoptimum quently, the Act recognised the range of inter-modal transport resources existing in Austraha at both this end, Labor's State and Federal levels in government departensured that urban ments and authorities and in tertiary institutions. It also recognised the need not only to achieve were co-ordination between these sources of informaBUl tion but also to identify the many areas of com-to include mon interest and to establish objectives for transport modes future transport research. The research and planning program allows transport planners to draw on the skills of range of associated disciplines such as sociology economics and environmental science. The Act was aimed at encouraging and ensuring that Austraha's transport is developed to take account of the technical and social changes takResearch ing place in the Austrahan community. The pro-when gram's continued success and effectiveness are pubUc dependent on continued co-operation and coTransport ordination between the States and the Austrahanvide areasAgreement Government. On 24 August 1976 the Minister Minor Traffic for Transport tabled the report on thefirst18 Improvements Program months of the operation of the 1974 Act. The States Grants (Roads) Act report detailed 500 projects covering range of items, including traffic management, emphasis needs to be given to this cycle safety and planning, motor vehicle design, identify and assess the future aUocation transport provisions for handicapped travellers, school bus safety, and pubhc transport noise, freight and management. Under the Whitlam Labor Government's legislation,financialassistance was provided the States for research into road safety. This cation was in recognition of the important role the States had to play in this area. The AustraUandeclining Labor Party Government estabUshed a road safety authority to foster research into this important area, to advance consumer protection in relation to motor vehicles, and to promote road safety issues. By contrast, in thefirstsix of the Fraser Government the authority was aboUshed and the Government undertook to estabUsh an office of road safety. I understand and that to the moment the office of road safety has modes. The not been established because of wrangling directed within the Department and wrangling between the Department and the Government over the manning of the office of road safety. substantial reduction in funds provided in this accorded is a further indication of the to road safety issues by the intention of the Labor to broaden the to consider each modes as a of the entire transport task. To obtain the results we need to achieve an optimum ticularly mix of aU transport modes, and parroads and urban pubUc transport. To transport research legislation pubhc transport projects considered in relation to road projects. The and before the House continues this approach extends the provisions of the legislation so as planning and research mto all land as well as the inter-relationship between land and other transport functions. In addition, the planning and research programs a aUows adequate consideration of options before a proposal requiring major pubUc mvestment is undertaken. It also aUows for reappraisal or modification of a program before its completion. which wiU be funded under this Bill it becomes an Act in areas such as urban transport may produce projects which could be funded under the Urban Public of 1974. It also may prowhich could be funded under the Engineering and Road Safety under a section of the 1977. In assessing a a broad program to be funded under Act, continued projects which of transport resources in Australia and developments in poUcy that impinge on transport planning. This involves the continuing changes that are taking place in Austraha's population, the to changes that are taking place in the way Ausallo-traUans want to Uve and also where they want to Uve, the interdependence of transport modes, the sources of fossU fuels, the increasing need to seek out alternative sources of energy and alternative forms of transport, and the resource requirements oftime,space, loss of Ufe and damage caused by poUution. The research and planning program needs to continue to assist in overcoming the problems associated with harprogram. monising State and Federal transport undertakthe ings to give proper consideration to the ties arising in transport issues and to help to make adequate plans for future transport policyFederal making. As I said, the Bill is in essence a continuation of the original Act, the Transport Research Act 1974, introduced by the Whitlam Government and by the then Minister for Transport, Mr Charles Jones. The amendments to it in terms of simplification of administrative arrangements and expansion to take in research into all land transport modes the Opposition beheves are desirable and it does not oppose Bill. I do, however, want to offer criticism of level of funding provided under the Bill. I to the second reading speech of the Minister Transport. Unless one reads closely the concludthe ing sentence of that speech, one is very apt misunderstand the real meaning It reads: We recognise that continuity of funding is very in a program like this and that for 1978-79 and 1979-80 we are prepared to contribute our share on a dollar for dollar basis of a total programI emphasise the words 'total program 'maintained at the 1977-78 level in real terms. One would think atfirstsight that that meant that since $8m has been provided this year, subsequent vote under this Act, in each of the lowing two years, would be $8m in real terms 1977 prices and expressed in whatever amount that equals in 1978-79 or 1979-80. But that is the case. We need to remember that the Minister stated also that the funding for this year was $2 for $1 basis. So on a two for one basis this year, the Federal Government is providing $8m. The States' share would be $4m. So the total prouse gram of funding for planning and research, State and Federal combined, in the current year is $12m. We recall that the Minister also menpresent tioned in his speech-and it is mentioned in the Bill-that funding for the next two years will on a dollar fbr dollar basis. This means then thatbe since $ 12m is the total program for this year, Federal Government's share of that total program-the maximum limit to it-wil l be $6m m each of the years 1978-79 and 1979-80. take those two years together, the total maximum commitment of $6m for each of those two years is $12m. Adding to that amount the $8m for this year, the total amount is $20m. So the triennium funding expressed in 1977 prices is $20m compared with the sum of $26m provided in the triennium 1974-77 under the Whitlam Quite clearly this is further evidence of phasing out of safety aspects, and more difficulparticularly of research and planning. The Bill is a major step in a phasing out of Government commitment to transport and planning research. In thefirstinstance there is the reduction of funding from a $2 for $1 basis and Planning toa$l for $1 basis.",49
95,Mr SHIPTON,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,Do you really beheve that?,51

97,Mr MORRIS,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,"That is why you are so impresthe sed. Secondly, there has been a Umit of $6m in refer the years 1978-79 and 1979-80. So the Umit of for $ 12m for each of those two successive years and $8m this year, amounting to $20m in total to contrasts with the $26m provided under the of the sentence. Whitlam Government. I should Uke to mention at the same time important another area of activity in the Department of we have already told the States Transport that in a way relates to that, that is, the Bureau of Roads. Here again is an organisation carrying out research activities in many ways into Austraha's road needs and recommending to government the level offinancialassistance that ought to be given to the States for the constructhe tion, upgrading and maintenance of roads. folLinked to that is the Government's decision, at which I mentioned earlier, to abolish the independent authority known as the Road Safety not and Standards Authority. Activities under the Transport and Planning Research Act, the Buon areau of Roads and the Road Safety and Standards Authority are all related in that they deal in the main with roads, the use of roads, and the of associated transport facUities, particularly passenger transport. In each of those three areas there has been a substantial downgrading by the Government in terms of funding and of priority. I take this opportunity to assure the be House that the next Labor Government would acting quite promptly to restore to road safety the and to road transport planning and research the proper financial priority to which safety measures, particularly roads, are entitled.

100,Mr CHAPMAN,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,"Contrary ning to the remarks that we heard a few moments from the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), the Bill before the House-the Transport Planning and Research (Financial Asresolusistance) Bill 1977-is a further clear demonand stration of the Fraser Government's committhat ment to provide an effective transport system for Airthe Austrahan people, and particularly of its as the commitment to overcome the problems of urban transport in developing outer suburbs such as are inadfound in the southern half of the Kingston eleccity airport torate. This commitment to solving urban transport problems has been evident in the last since the two Budgets presented by the Fraser Government. Funds provided for urban public transport in those two Budgets give the Ue to claims by the Australian Labor Party for partisan poltiical purposes hi a pamphlet which it circulated recently in the southern areas of the Kingston electorate. facilities should be upgraded to or Hong This Bill is a further demonstration of the Fraser Government's concern for urban transport. It continues and extends arrangements the for section 96 grants to the States for land transport planning and research and provides $8m for the 1977-78 nnancial year for various is unprojects undertaken by State governments. That only funding is provided on a two for one basis, with $2 being provided by the Commonwealth for having a every $1 provided by the State government inAirport volved hi such a project. The Bill broadens the publicly scope of assistance to cover aU forms of land transport and the relationship of land transport in the to other modes of transport. In accord with the of this Government's commitment to federaUsm, the legislation gives the States greater flexibUity in implementing and managing their planning and research projects. The Commonwealth Government will approve and provide funds for a total State program rather than for each individual project. The States will have the power to aUocate funds between the various individual projects. Hence power and responsibihty are being of Aushanded back to the level of government closest imported into Australia to the people. in The Commonwealth Government wiU conthe tinue to provide co-ordination to ensure the ehmination of dupUcation of research and will Australian artists whose works are estabUsh a forum for discussion and comparison of programs.

Programs of transport planand research have thus far been a successful ago co-operative effort between Commonwealth and State governments. Advantages have accrued to both sides which would not have been possible otherwise. I refer to several South Austraha which indicate the benefits flowing to the community from this allocation Federal Government funds. A project of major significance, which has been given number priority by the South Austrahan Government its apphcations for funds and which draws the major proportion of funds, has been the joint North-east Area Pubhc Transport Review and the Modbury Corridor Technology Evaluation. A primary objective of this study, which began some 18 months ago, is to determine the pubhc transport investment required to form part of total transport system for the north eastern urbs of Adelaide to fulfil their needs in the decade, and also to provide a planning basis the next 20 to 30 years. According to the South Austrahan Department of Transport, when it launched this project in March 1976 it had no preconceived notions the correct answer to pubhc transport investment in the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. State Government promised the highest level pubhc participation in the decision-making cess ever attempted by planners in Australia. cording to this proposal, planners have been seeking active involvement of the people for whom the planning has been undertaken. This regarded as a revolutionary approach to to transport planning. NEAPTR has mvolved a of whole range of detaUed research projects. These include population trends, movement patterns and land use. Pubhc meetings have been held to obtain the views of the pubhc with regard to their own needs, explain alternative proposals and to seek the views of the pubUc on them. Considersion able pubhcity in the media has been engendered throughout the development of this project. Part of the function of the project in determinthe-motorist ing the best way of fulfilling the transport needs of the people of the north-eastern suburbs been to assess and balance the disadvantages caused to one group of residents by the benefits given to another group-for example, the effect of the extra noise in suburbs Uke WaUcervUle St Peters caused by the extra and faster traffic flow needed by residents of the outerlying urbs of Tea Tree Gully or the conflict between residents confronted with a new bus route redirected down their street and residents in next street who benefit from that new service. This study is supposed to have been based on principle that much of the information which relevant to any decision is not held by experts by ordinary people in the community. It is local people who understand local problems, their own specific needs and how theh' own comprojects conducted in munity works. Notwithstanding these claims, significant critiof cism has been made of the NEAPTR project. The State Government owns much of the land one along the possible high speed Modbury Corriin dor, providing a compeUingfinancialreason for thefinaldecision concerning transport for the area to favour that route. The critics beheve that the pubUc outcry which accompanied the original acquisition program for this corridor would be repeated if a different route is chosen. Hence NEAPTR has been condemned as a mere pubhc the relations operations, with the results of the subinquiry a foregone conclusion and private connext sultants having been engaged to present the for inquiry to the community. Apparently pubhc meetings caUed by NEAPTR, supposedly to engender pubUc discussion, have been poorly advertised and cancelled at short notice. Critics of have condemned the State Government and NEAPTR as dishonest in their investigations and The presentation of material. of Personally, I do not have sufficiently detaUed proknowledge of the project to adjudicate these Accriticisms. However, some of the conclusions of the study which have recently received pubhcity may give some substance to them. Certainly it is appears that the Modbury Corridor will be used estabUsh an express busway or tramway. Also concern is the proposal to reserve a traffic lane on the Main North-east Road for buses hi peak hour traffic. Even the State Minister of Transport, Mr Virgo, admits that this may have a detrimental effect on the trafficflowof motor vehicles. Whatever initiatives occur in the expanof pubUc transport facUities, the motor car will remain the preferred means of transport for the great bulk of the community. A squeeze-outcampaign through withdrawing access to traffic lanes will only compound rather has than solve our current transport problems. In view of the fact that two-thirds of the funds for this project-that is, some $356,462 out of a total cost of $534,754-sinc e its inception have and been provided by the Commonwealth Government, I beheve that the Commonwealth Minister subfor Transport (Mr Nixon) should investigate these criticisms to ensure that these significant sums of Commonwealth money are being spent the wisely for the benefit of the community. Despite these criticisms, I beheve that the information the gleaned by the NEAPTR research is of great is value in planning effectively for the transport but needs of the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. This is particularly so with regard to the need for cross-suburban transport routes in Adelaide, an issue which I have raised previously in this House. One criticism which I beheve has some vaUdity been given is that top priority in transport research should therefore have been given to the southern areas within the rejects of nearly Marion and Noarlunga councU areas instead of outh Austraha withoneCommonwealth to the north-eastern suburbs. No doubt the State under the terms of the previous legislation. Labor Government has ignored the transport needs of the people of these areas, and the residents of the Kingston electorate, for pohtical purposes. NegUgence of the southern areas by the State Government is confirmed by the fact that it is conducting this NEAPTR research ect hi preference to research into overcoming transport problems of suburbs such as O'Halloran Hill, Morphett Vale, Reynella, Christies Beach and Port Noarlunga.",52
101,Mr CADMAN,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,This is Mr Virgo?,54
102,Mr CHAPMAN,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,"This is Mr Virgo again. said a moment ago, no doubt there are poltiical motivations behind the decision to conduct research in the north-eastern suburbs rather than in the southern areas. WhUst the north-eastern residents will have the luxury of a fuU transportbeen program estabUshed on the basis of detaUed research, the residents of the south will lamenting with a few cosmetic changes which were hastily introduced before the last State election.",54
103,Mr CADMAN,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,It is a shame.,54
104,Mr CHAPMAN,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,"As the honourable member for Mitchell says, it is a shame. Two other projprojects ects in South Austraha which have been funded under this Commonwealth legislation are research into the viabUity of an electrically ered vehicle and also a steam powered vehicle. In an era of declining energy resources, particuvided larly declining Uquid hydrocarbon fuels, these two projects are of great significance to our future transport requirements. The Commonment wealth has provided $21,642 out of a total cost $32,662 for the electric car project and $12,826 out of a total cost of $19,241 for the steam car project. One thing that concerns me is that further funds for these two projects have been provided this year. The South Australian Government did not see fit to give them of sufficiently high priority in its Ust of projects mitted to the Commonwealth Government for mo-thirds funding to obtain an aUocation of funds them. Of even greater concern is the attempt by hundred. the State Labor Government to blame the Commonwealth Government for the lack of continued funding for these projects. The plain is that the State Government placed these projgenerous ects way down on its Ust of priorities so that with the very generous funds provided by the Commonwealth Government they did not get a guernsey. By contrast, the NEAPTR project has number 1 priority in submissions and funding has continued. These are three hundred conducted in § funds The Bill now before the House will continue that program and that funding. The Commonwealth Government in this way is making a very significant contribution to fulfilling the transport projneeds of South Austrahans but the South Austhe traUan Labor Government and the Minister of Transport, Mr Virgo, stand condemned for one aspect of their use of these funds. Each of the projects which I have mentioned in some detaU has received considerable media pubhcity in South Australia initiated by the State GovernAs I ment. NEAPTR in particular has been pubhcised in special lift-out features in several of Adelaide's newspapers, in particular the two major daUy newspapers in that city, but the only mention of the Commonwealth Government has the misrepresentation about the funding of the electric and steam cars and the criticism of be left the Commonwealth Government associated with that misrepresentation. I note that the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) is nodding his head. Obviously he is aware of that misrepresentation. In not one of the many statements on these which have been used in the great wad of newspaper articles, some of which I have here, has any mention been made of the Commonpowwealth Government and the fact that two-thirds of the money for these projects has been proby the Commonwealth Government. Pubhcity has been used purely for the purpose of selfaggrandisement of the State Labor Governand the State Minister of Transport, Mr ofVirgo. Mr Virgo has been ever ready to misrepresent the Fraser Government. It is about time he gave some credit where it is due. As I mentioned, a moment ago, the plain fact is that the Comnot monwealth Government has provided $356,462 out of $534,754 spent on NEAPTR; $21,642 out $32,662 spent on the electric car and $12,826 sub-out of $19,241 spent on the steam car, as well as of the cost of the many other projects, for which, as I mentioned, number nearly one It is the Commonwealth Government which facthas made these projects possible through its provision of funds, not the Dunstan evenLabor Government on its own, as it would attempt to have us beheve through media hcity. The South Australian people should aware of this in view of the barrage of misreptionaUy, resentations that have been initiated by the Dunstan Government about the Commonwealth Government over the last two years. The transport planning and research program provided a good example of Commonwealthtransport State co-operation. Let that co-operation and major Commonwealth involvement in it be ackAustraUans nowledged at the State level, as it is here. This Bill wiU enable that co-operation ensure the effective use of resources. It is about time that the State Government, and also the Labor Party in this place, recognised the conhas tribution that is being made by the Fraser Government to pubhc transport projects. I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that a leaflet had been distributed recently southern part of the Kingston electorate which misrepresented the situation in regard to Comonly monwealth funding for urban transport.",54
105,Mr CADMAN,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,Not again.,55
106,Mr CHAPMAN,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,"Yes . They do it aU the time. ing This year urban pubUc transport will benefit thatclaims through the provision of $51m, as against $58m Government last year. The pamphlet was designed to condent on pubUc vince the electors of Kingston that there had office been a massive slashing of funds monwealth Government. The pamphlet listed as pubhc transport. This is 40 per cent for an achievement of the Fraser Liberal Govern the previous Labor Government providedthan ment the fact that less money had been providedthree to the States for programs such as pubhc transport programs. The funding which I mentwo tioned a moment ago, $51m, is in fact a minor in reduction of some 12 per cent in the 1977-78 Government Budget over the 1976-77 Budget, not the 21 per how cent which was claimed in the heading on that priority pamphlet which was distributed.",55
107,Mr CADMAN,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,It is a scandal.,55
108,Mr CHAPMAN,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,"The way they misrepresent the Commonwealth Government's funding of projects in that State is a scandal. Given the need to restrain government spending, which stemmed from the previous Labor Governcaused ment's extravagance, this is a commendable effort. As I said, it shows that the Fraser ment stiU gives a high priority to urban pubhc transport needs. The sUght reduction m the Budget this year is in comparison with the Fraser Government's Budget of the year before. The inference in that pamphlet is that the Fraser Government has slashed spending on urban Bill, pubUc transport in comparison with the previous pubLabor Government. The heading of that pambe phlet is therefore grossly misleading. Addthe assertion in the pamphlet that the Fraser Government is providing less money for urban pubhc transport is a downright lie. The $5 8m provided in the 1976-77 Budget was has nearly twice as much money for urban pubhc as that provided in the last Labor the Budget of the year before. Fortunately for aU that will be the last Budget the Labor Party has a chance to bring down in this place for to continue and many years to come. As I have mentioned already, a further $51m been provided for these transport projects in the current Budget. This includes $5m specificaUy committed as the Commonwealth Government's contribution to new projects in 1977-78. It should be noted that this is the first in the aUocation of Commonwealth funds for new works under this scheme since 1974. It is also the money aUocated to new projects of any type over the whole range of government expenditure in the 1977-78 Budget. This initiation of new projects contrasts with the Labor Party's performance in government in 1975 and the misleadabout which I have spoken. It shows the Liberal-National Country Party cares about people who are depentransport. Hence in two years in the Liberal-National Country Party by the ComGovernment has provided $109m urban more in years. This point should be emphasised. The $109m provided by the Fraser Government years is 40 per cent more than the Labor provided in three years. This shows the Fraser Government has given a higher to this area than the previous Labor Government. During a period of necessary restraint on government spending and cutbacks in spending m many areas of spending the Government has increased funding in areas of real need such as urban pubUc transport. It is providing much more money at a time of restraint than Labor sawfitto give in its era of free, easy and has uncontrolled government spending which our economic problems. Whether one looks at the Bill now before the House or at the Governoverall Budget allocation for urban public transport, one sees that the Government is definite in its commitments and has provided the funds for the States to get on with the job. Certainly this piece of legislation, the Transport Planning and Research (Financial Assistance) will continue that funding in a very special area and wiU continue the opportunity for the States to conduct research on a two fbr one basis next year and on a 50/50 funding basis thereeasy after. I commend the Bill to the House and urge its speedy passage.",55
109,Mr MORRIS,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND," Mr Deputy traUsed Speaker, I seek your indulgence. During the course of my remarks earher I said that the pro-of visions for funding on a dollar for dollar basis not contained in the Bill. I have read my notes again. I was in error. I would like to have remarks corrected. That provision is contained the Bill.",56
110,Mr WENTWORTH,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,"This George's Bill is to be supported because that the Austrahan transport system needs bridges over the replanning and research for replanning. There save an immense amount has been a good deal of talk in the think it is unfortunate that so httle practical has emerged from it. I wish to speak on one two things which could and should be done. Let grades but in respect of vertical curves also.and me remind the House,firstly,that Austraha is a country of great distances and where transport used costs are very heavy. Secondly, Australia along running,curves with other countries shortly is going to face a vertical crisis in Uquid fuel. Thirdly, present moment unused resources oflabour and materials which could be used now to provide the economies in fuel for the future. In other words, what we are doing now in faUing to use our resources of men and materials-thes e years of the locust can never be recovered-doe s vent us in the future redressing our balance current account difficulties through the costs importing Uquid fuels and the difficulties of ing oU abroad. Let me comefirstlyto raUways. At the outset we must do something about the Sydneyorder Melbourne Une. Considering the volume of goes traffic that it carries and could carry, that Une is national disgrace. I refer to the section between Junee and Kapooka. Honourable members will utely recall that between Sydney and Junee there double line but at Kapooka this contracts to a road. single Une to Albury- a single line which has to carry not only interstate traffic but also a deal of local traffic for the Wagga-Albury disand trict. That line is made more difficult by the that it has the nasty descent to the Murrumbidcompany-Thoma gee River which the Une crosses at Wagga, and of course the Une has to go up again after cross-I ing the river. So thefirstthing to look at surely that section from Junee to Kapooka-2 0 or 30 railways utiles. This single Une should be duplicated in such a way that the uphill grades are eased. can be done, of course, by using the new line way up and one way down and using the old linethe in the same way. Then there is the section from Kapooka to Albury. This is a relativelyflatand section. I am not certain at this present moment whether it would be better to duphcate that or whether it would be better to put in a centrain control. I am inclined to think that the former is the better, considering the volume traffic which can and should be carried on it. are The next piece of alignment to be considered is in Sydney itself. Honourable members will recaU my how that southern Une snakes out and follows a in winding course to Liverpool. The southern line should go out via East HUls and cross the River twice and rejoin the existing it is quite certain only aboutat main Une about Macquarie Fields. There is five or six miles in it. There are two George's River. This would of trouble and bring past and I quite tremendous economies. resultthe route of that line. It shouldI have also talked about be considered or not only in respect of horizontal curves This not to be important when short trains were but when long trains are ninning the significant and a change in grade are of quite technical importance. That Une needs Australia has at the looking at. That line carries only a smaU proportion of the goods traffic between Sydney and Melbourne. When I was in England recently I was talking to experts on road-raU traffic and when I told them prethat there was 600 miles of Une between Melon bourne and Sydney but stiU well over half of the of goods traffic went by road they could not beheve buyit. It seemed to them utterly incredible because even in England where there is the long haul from London to Glasgow- I think it is of the of 400 miles-the predominant traffic still by raU, not by road although there are the freeways aEngland have and all the advantages that the roads in over the roads here. It is absolincredible that so much of the goods traffic is a between Melbourne and Sydney still goes by It is an indictment on the efficiency of our raUways. good Then one thinks particularly of the terminals the way in which containers and other goods factare handled at these terminals. I know that one s Nationwide Transport Pty Ltd-ha s made some effort to deal with this. It is, think, the only company and its efforts are by is no means commensurate with the need to get the working efficiently. It is not just a question of the physical layout of the terminal; it is Thisalso a question of the handhng of trains and onetrucks at the tenriinal and the co-ordination of two. Again when I was in Europe recently I had a careful look at what was being done there and I can assure the House that the Austrahan practices are years and years out of date. Let me come to the next point about railways-reaUy electrification. When we changed from coal to diesel locomotives we did it for very good reason,lost namely, that diesel was much more economical. At that time we did not know what the Arabs were going to do to us about oil prices and supphes, but still we made the change and it paying off but we should be going back to using indigenous fuel, and that means the electrificaWe tion of main railway lines. Let me speak particularly of New South where thefirstpriority is the line between Sydney and Melbourne. That line is already electrified between Sydney and Campbelltown. Electrification. tion of that line should be extended as far Albury. Of course the Sydney to Brisbane line, which is already electrified as far as Gosford, should go via Maitland to pick up the Newcastle links, and the Newcastle system itself should electrified. Another hne which certainly is overthinking due for electrification is the line from Maitland Werris Creek. I put this to the House because electrification is particularly desirable where a line has either heavy traffic or heavy grades, both, because the electric locomotive running an outside power source is the ideal animal deal with the heavy grades. If that line is elechave trified over the hills into Werris Creek it would deal with the main needs of that area as far efficient rail transport is concerned. Of course have to think of the Hunter Valley and we have to think of the new systems which are going to in by reason of the very great increase in coal development in that area, and this proposal I make will serve them. Let me turn to the line from Lithgow to Parkes. The line is electrified over the Blue Mountains where there are compensating reorganise grades, I think, still of one-m-thirty three-on the heaviest main line grades in the world. Bemake tween Lithgow and Parkes the line gets down to flat country and there are some very bad grades on that line which carries and it is worth electrification. Finally, the Uttle loop from Sutherland to WoUongong and up Moss Vale which still carries heavy steel traffic and heavy suburban traffic is one line where trification obviously is overdue. This is someprobably thing which could be done now. We are wasting resources and wasting the future. We have idle manpower and idle factories that could produce the equipment. We will need these things in the future. The years of the locust can never be recovered. This is the time to take action. To faU to do so now because of some obsession about a deficit is beyond human understanding. We need these things now. We can never recover the time in the periods during which factories are idle. It will be gone. Let us get on with the job and do now the things that we shaU need in order to cut down our dependence upon imported oU in the is near future. In only seven, eight or nine years time Austraha's oU suppUes will start to constrict. mayfindmore oil on the North West Shelf. We have not found it yet. It may well be there. Even if oU is discovered now, it will be many Wales years before it is in economic production. In regard to raUways, we mustfixup the main Melbourne Une and carry out some electrificaWe must concentrate on our mam Unes. In as particular, we must think of the terminals and the way in which traffic is handled. People who know something of the signal system in Sydney know how vastly and unnecessarily complicated be the system is. RaUways are out of date in their very often because they are still bound to to a position where there was no real motor transport. They do not think in new terms. The trouble about a train, of course, is that it runs on or raUs and is hard to shunt. When one starts to on break up a Une of trucks and reform them one to loses a lot oftimeand incurs a lot of cost. We to think in terms of complete rakes of trucks which are never broken up. That is the economic as way of doing things. If we do this we can slash we freight rates. A massive reduction in raU freights for rural areas is long overdue. There has to be go some reassessment of our handhng of hvestock on raU. By comparing our trucks and the way in that which they are marshalled and handled here with what is being done in some countries overseas we see how far out of date the Australian system is and how much we could help our graziers and the whole rural industry if we would our way of handhng hvestock on raU. e of We must get the freight costs down. We should it possible, when the varied seasons give a on drought in one area andrichpastures somewhere else, to move stock about with reasonable facUity heavy traffic and at low cost. to I have spoken of raU and I have spoken of goods. I speak now of passengers. The concept of eleca high speed passenger raU service in Australia has little apphcation because we do not have the population concentrations which make it so economical hi places such as Great Britain and Japan. Let me talk of our suburban raUways. In the cities we have to cut down our use of Uquid fuel. This can be done partly by helping pubhc transport to become efficient I do not mean that this should be done by penalising the motorist making the motorist uncomfortable. I beheve that we should do this by giving a better and cheaper alternative. I wish I had time to speak disgrace. more on this matter. I just indicate to the briefly that the development of the underground rail system in the cities obviously is called for. We have, here again, to get the costs down. I wonder whether we have taken sufficient note of the possibility of using small buses or whether have yet appreciated the full impact of having forthwith. suburban transport on which no fares are collected. The costs of collecting fares are sometime. times more than the fares collected. In inner city operations fare collection shows a net loss. We would get a better service and lose less money if we did not coUect fares. I am sorry that the Labor Government in New Mr ADERMANN South Wales is ditching the inner city freeways. It Northern is a most retrograde decision and one which I the think can be made only in complete ignorance or present with some kind of maUcious idea of slugging the sistancethe motorist. I do not know which we have to think of proper freeways which, in a sense, will save fuel but also will make it possible for the motorist to use his car to real advantage. We have to save fuel. But what about the Uquefied petroleum gas that we waste? Where are the plans for conversion of government vehicles on a major scale from petrol to LPG? Where are the plans to get rid of all excise other charges on LPG and the corresponding difficulties of using LPG? Where are the plans organise new outlets for LPG so that can have the convenience of a bowser? Where are the plans to cut down the registration costs on vehicles which are equipped for LPG and which by using that fuel not only reduce our oU bill but in addition reduce-no t eUminate-the pollution in cities. This, of course, is only a temporary alleviation. We have to think further of electric vehicles for city and commuter use. They are not, at present, as economic as they should be; but are improving. The Government should be spending more money on them and showing much more interest in electric vehicles, particuseeks larly the smaU vehicles and the vehicles which can be mass produced and which can give a special service m cities as commuter vehicles. I am coming to the end of my time not only in this speech but also in speaking in this House. have been able to put before the House some the things which I intend to urge when I take place in the Senate next year. These are some of the things which I beheve are the proper of a House of review which can look at the overor all plans and by so doing hope to improve the efficiency of an Australian transport system which remains, for all our planning, a national House Question resolved in the affirmative.

One of the great lems facing the aviation industry is the selection of aircraft, and the facilities available at airports and the capacities of airports. One of the best documents to which honourable members could refer would be the recent pubUcation of statistics of domestic scheduled airhne performance for the year ended 30 September 1977. I wish draw attention to some of the ngures that are shown in relation to three aspects: Firstly, engers; secondly, freight; and thirdly, mati. the year ending September 1977 Trans-Australia AirUnesflew3.2 per cent more hours but carried 7 per cent more passengers, a 11.6 per cent increase in freight and a 12 per cent increase mail on what was carried in the previous year. SimUarly, Ansett Transport Industries with a 0.3 per cent increase in hoursflowncarried 2.7 cent more passengers, 2.5 per cent more freight and 3.3 per cent more maU. Without going into the detaUs of the other internal airlines shown in the document, such Airlines of New South Wales, East West Airthe lines, MACRobertson-MUler Airline Services, Connair, Qantas and Airlines of South Australia, I want to remark on the totalfiguresfor the craft industry for the year ended September. Looking at the total hoursflownwefindthat there has been a decrease of 1.1 per cent in that year. the number of passengers carried rose by 4.6 per cent. The domestic airUnes carried 9,690 milhon passengers in the year ending September. As said that was a 4.6 per cent increase. There was 5.2 per cent increase in freight and a 5.7 per increase in maU carried. I have mentioned those states: figures to show evidence of increased utilisation Sydney of aircraft. Much is said about lower air fares and increasing airport capacities but there is a basic equation as early I see it to lower air fares; that is, higher tors equal lower air fares. The better utilisation and the more people in aircraft on trips the larger, greater the possibUities of lowering the fare for and that journey. Thosefiguresshow what is imposts happening. At the same time when we come to the figures for our perennial problem of Mascot they show a reduction in hoursflownand an increase in passas engers carried. In the year ended September 1977 at Mascot there were 82,138 aircraft movethink ments, a reduction of 0.5 per cent on the figuresthat for the previous year. But 4.983 gers were moved through Mascot. That is an increase of 5.5 per cent. So there was very httle for reduction in the number of aircraft movements but a substantial increase in the number of passI engers. Probably the use of larger aircraft would be a factor as also would be better load factors proband better utilisation of facUities. Turning to Brisbane, wefindthat Brisbane airport had 34,799 aircraft movements which carried 2.144 miUion passengers. An increase in aircraft movements of 1.4 per cent was more than countered by an increase in passengers of 4.4 per cent. It is the same story. Melbourne is probably to the best example. In that same period Tullamarine airport had 66,662 aircraft movepassments and handled 4.295 million passengers. In There was a reduction in aircraft movements at the airport of 2.2 per cent but an increase in the number of people handled of 5.2 per cent. That brings us back to the basic equation that lower in air fares, in the main, equal higher load factors and better utilisation of the industry's facUities. per Much criticism is made from time totimeby our pohtical opponents about what happened at Mascot or Brisbane or at other airports. But the simple fact is that for 25 out of the past 28 years - almos t for the total period of the development as of major civU aircraft operations in AustraUaconservatives who now sit opposite have been responsible. They have been the administrators. Whatever shortcomings exist in our airindustry the responsibUity Ues at their feet. In its relationship with the government the industry sees a problem of uncertainty as to what But are the Government's intentions and what should be the guidelines for the industry. I can best evidence this by quoting from Aircraft I magazine of October 1977 which reports a statea ment of the chairman of the Austrahan National cent Airlines Commission, Mr Vial. The magazine airport's serious problem of traffic congestion and noise annoyance could reasonably be met only by introduction of wide-bodied jet aircraft on domestic air load facservices, Mr Viall has warned. 'But the airlines cannot be expected to place orders for more efficient, but capital intensive new equipment in a situation characterised by falling or stagnant traffic growth, faced with the prospect of ever-increasing government leading inevitably to still more daunting fare increases,' he said. 'To do so would be an act of financial irresponsibility.' Mr Viall was certainly referring to the conditions they were. In recent times conditions have improved in terms of passenger growth but I his statement points out the uncertainty faces the industry in relation to what are the mUlion passenGovernment's intentions. In relation to Mascot I now refer to the pubUcation put out by the Major Airport Needs of Sydney committee. Again we run into the problem of knowing what the Government wants to do. It does not want to discuss it pubUcly. Friction has developed, as I understand it, between the New South Wales Government and the Federal Government in regard to the activities of the MANS committee. On page 5 of the report it states: Traffic Management Schemes This study looked at ways of more effectively using Kingsford-Smith airport witnout building additional ways. It also considered excluding some types of air-traffic, and reducing some services. Consideration is being given to the implementation some of these measures in the near future. I want to go on from that to deal with the lemma that is facing the operators of commuter aircraft in Australia at the moment, but particuthe larly in New South Wales. Quite a campaign been developing around that problem. The Minplace ister recently, as I recaU his statement as accuexchanges rately as I can, said that there is to be crimination, or no discrimination against commuter aircraft, that there is no move commuter aircraft out of Mascot, but a system priority based on weight has been developed. put it to the Parliament that that, is exactly means of forcing the commuter operators out of Mascot. The effect is the same. The larger the craft, the higher the priority it has. It means commuter aircraft have to circle for longer periods than commercial aircraft. That increases their fuel consumption. It causes a delay in their timetabling and they cannot maintain their serOne vices and connections. So they have either to up with providing that kind of service or to move out. On page 9 of its report the MANS Compriorities mittee states: For example, the governments may decide to introduce certain operational procedures immediately, and to principle the concept of a second airport at a particular However, it may be decided that the initial planning should not commence for a number of years, or until the demand for air travel exceeds a certain number of passengers or aircraft. Then, more significantly, on page 11, it continues right to say in relation to commuter aircraft: Over the years, measures have been proposed which lead to more efficient use of existing facilities Smith. These have included: Excluding certain classes ation, commuter services and some nights within New Wales. At present 25 per cent of all aircraft movements Kingsford-Smith are general aviation (mostly small aircraft). A later suggestion is the placing of a surcharge on aircraft movements at Kingsiord-Smith. That surcharge would be passed on as higher air fares which may reduce the demand for air travel. In effect, those charges would be punitive. Their purpose would be to discourage aircraft from using the airport. That brings us back to the claim that is being made by the commuter operators. I know that the commuter operators, in their discussions and in their concern about what the Government has in mind, have displayed deep concern about a discussion which took place between themselves and some officers associated with a review of the operation of runKingsford-Smith. In that discussion the Federal officers are reported to have put a very strong line for the exclusion of commuter aircraft from of Kingsford-Smith Airport. I know that the Minister has said that the commuter aircraft industry is diover-reacting. I put it to the Parliament once again that there is very good evidence to support view that the commuter operators are talcing, has and that is the verbal exchanges which took in relation to commuter aircraft. Those are not on record, as I understand it, no disbut certainly a discussion took place. to shift The Australian Financial Review of 26 of October reports a decision made by the Aircraft I Owners and PUots Association. That Association a queried the separation times at Mascot for lighter aircraft. Again this is a matter that needs airto be taken into account. As was mentioned at that the Association's meeting- I raised this point earlier-the separation standards and the associated delays caused unnecessary loss of time and waste of fuel without enhancing safety. of the inter-city air services, Aero-Pehcan put Inter City Commuter Air Services Pty Ltd on which I often travel, said that if graded landing were introduced to Mascot it would be the end of smaU commuter air services. Mr HUder, the manager, was commenting on the accept in proposal of the Department of Transport to site. place the small commuter services at the bottom stages of the landing priority scale. He went on to say: If we are given a 'D' priority, they are actually telling us that the people of New South Wales do not have as much do. to usetiieirown airpon as the people of another State could So there are good and genuine grounds for the at Kingsfordfears of the commuter operators about their of traffic, such as general avifuture and their access to the airport. The reSouth sponsibUity Ues with the Minister and with the at Department. In matters such as this more good is achieved by the people responsible coming out into the open and putting the facts on the table in front of the people concerned than by leaving them to be dealt with by departmental memos, exchanges between governments, secret documents and secret reports. I now turn to the relationship between the avi-Ltd. ation industry and the Minister. From reports have received from within the industry and the unions, I doubt whether the relationship beThe tween the Department of Transport industry has ever been at a lower level than at present. The industry's disenchantment with committeegovernment stems from the failure of the Minis-and ter to implement the promises he made 1975 election campaign. At the time he said he would recreate a separate Department of Air. He In has not done that. Instead, he has confirmed thewUl make role of the expanded Department of Transport whether theadecision which he inherited. He said there would be a haltcannot have the information'. to increased air navigation charges. Instead, he note that on page 8 of the Minister's increased them by 30 per cent within months of coming to office. Hesaid that increases in the industry's costs needed to be stabilised. ChairmanI Yet he endorsed a Budget decision to increase the excise on Avtur, thus bringing about an increase of almost 3 per cent in domestic air farestold and the prospect of further heavy increases in price of Avtur under his Government's energy pricing policy and pohcies which have been ported by him, as a senior Cabinet Minister, the Cabinet room. His attempt to introduce new regulatory charges for services provided to aviation mdustryhave personnel sparked off a protest campaign against himself such as has not been seen in Austraha previously. He has postponed the introduction the new charges, but obviously he hopes introduce them after 10 December if, regretteople ably, this Government should be returned to office. It is no wonder that the disenchanted with his performance. I do not Ueve that any other Minister has taken unto him-Review self the power that this Minister has in the man-Committee agement ofhis Department. Since December 1975 we have seen a plethoranational of secret inquiries into transport, particularly ation. Let me list just a few of them. The Aviationmake Industry Review Committee, chaired by Sir Lennox Hewitt, was appointed in March 1976 tosubmission examine cost recovery in the aviation industry. No report has been presented to Parliament. shall come back to that matter later. I refer alsoand to the scandalous MCNeU Committee of Inquiry mto Australian Government transport undertakpresented ings. That was an inquiry conducted by competi-were tors of, cUents of and suppUers to the Austrahanthe Government transport enterprises. No report has been presented to Parliament, despite repeated requests to the Minister to do so. I refer also the interdepartmental committee which inquired into the provision of Northern Territory aerial services, with particular reference to Connair Ptymore I have asked the Minister to table the report, I but the best answer I have received is that which fromhe gave to question No. 1805, when he said: decisions of the Government, which are based to and the some extent on the reponit isThat is the report of the interdepartmental the recommendations contained therein, are open to in the parliamentary scrutiny and judgment. have other words, the Minister is saymg: 'We will a look at the report; we will get the facts; we decision; you can argue about is right or wrong, but you It is interesting to second thefirst12reading speech he says: myself had a number of quite frank discussions with the of Connair, Mr £.

It needs to thebe told whether there is justification for the action which the Government is taking so uiat sup-the matter can be examined pubUcly. It could m well be- I emphasise this-that Connair is being disadvantaged by the course of action which the Government, and the Minister in particular, is following. We do not know the facts. I do not access to the information. I am sure that the Parliament does not have that access. But if the information was laid on the table where it could of be discussed and assessed in the pubhc view, it to may well be discovered that Connair and the E of the Northern Territory are entitled to a etter level of air services than they are receiving industry is under this Government beI refer now to the Domestic Aviauon PoUcy Committee. Again, the report of tiiat is privy to the Minister. The report brought down following the Review of InterCivU Aviation PoUcy again is privy to avithe Minister. People and organisations could a submission to that Review and if the person or organisation concerned pubhshed that it would be avaUable for scrutiny. But we have the ludicrous situation of two separate I review committees looking at the same subject their terms of inquiry overlapping. That creates waste and extravagance. No report has been to Parhament and no pubhc hearings conducted. All I can say is: More power to Minister, more opportunity for back room deals. That is the only conclusion that one can draw when a government does not want to bring to information related to the aviation industry out into the open. It must have something to hide. The question is: What? The Minister is left with power and is in the position to negotiate, to give out largesse. That may not be the situation, but one cannot blame people for taking that view. We in the Opposition have been saying that The there is a need for a full scale pubhc inquiry intois civil aviation. Until that happens, air travellers in Austraha will continue to be disadvantaged. services Their needs and wants and the industry's requirements answers should be dealt with in As I have said, air travellers will continue to disadvantaged in terms of frequency of services, level of fares and quahty of travel. I come back this basic equation: Lower fares equal higher load factors. How do we achieve that result and how do we at the same time meet the comreport munity's needs in terms of services? Those 3 milhon migrants in Australia who were not born here have a special interest in the lowering of air fares. They are the people who diversionary would like to put a submission to a public capacity. inquiry. But that will not happen under this Government; no way. Such inquiries have to be conducted behind closed doors, and the Minister will feed out what he thinks we are entitled see. But migrants are getting the same kind of second and third class treatment in this area of regions lower air fares as they are getting from the total Government in other areas such as migrant eduvolved cation. At least what the Government is doing in and this area is in hne with its performance in other areas. The aviation industry needs to know what the guidelines are and where it is going, especially because of the high capital investment involved and the long lead-in time required in purchasing suitable aircraft and equipment. With the stolen? present Minister for Transport and this dilatory government, it is no wonder that the industry perplexed. I have not been able to get from the Minister a copy of the report of the mittee but I have here what is probably the conclusions of that report. I will tell the Parhament the reason the Minister will not table report. The Chairman is Sir Lenox Hewitt.",58

The of member of the public had a perfectly good reason for bringing this matter to my attention. reShe rang me as shadow Minister for Transport and she complained, in fact demanded, that I do something about it. I have brought the facts to sethe attention of the Parliament. It is up to the Minister for Transport to make up his mind on was that the what he wants to do. to The other matter on air safety which I want to mention relates to thefireat Mascot a few weeks ago. Thatfirewas the result of a tragic accident in which a petroleum tanker overturned. Flaming spirit poured down the drams outside the airof us port, traveUed underground for some hundreds an of yards and surfaced between No. 5 and No. 6 passenger bays and the aerobridges of TAA, in is the Qantas power house, in a Qantas hanger and in a TAA hanger.

The position at Mascot is that the drains in the nearby streets flow under the airport, under the buUdings, into a pond in the inner part the airport environs, across to Alexandria my Canal and into Cook's River. When I drew attention to the danger, the Minister's response was that it was a unique accident. I again put to the Minister and to the Government that the situation is very serious. It was just ilain good luck that nobody other than the unS to brtunate person in the motor accident was hurt. an air The situation exists and the Government is I aware of it. If anything happens, the Governis responsible. There is one facet which I as have not mentioned previously. During the I period of tension in the course of the delay after this incident occuned, TAA aircraft could not unload. Aircraft were on the tarmac. Flames had surfaced between No. 5 and No. 6 aerobridges and at other places. There were not sumcient nre engines to deal with a Jumbo crash or anything it above a Fokker crash during the major part of this crisis. I wish to inform the House of what happened in one aircraft that was waiting to unload at one aerobridges. This is a perfectly human side asof what happens in these situations. During that period a passenger became very concerned be the aircraft had landed and the passengers were not being unloaded. Apparently, from what I can gather, the passengers did not know was happening. The aircraft were waiting tarmac. As honourable members know, the airmisrepresented? line companies are very happy to serve alcohol on aircraft. I understand that in this case some kind of sedative had probably been imbibed during the course of the journey. The passenger became excited and broke into theflightdeck of the aircraft and demanded to know what was of AustraUagoing on. This is the kind of thing that happens. In tms case the aircraft was stationary and no injury or further damage was caused. The unforhonourable tunate passenger, for his pains, was arrested charged. Who is responsible in a situation such as this? For the Minister to regard hghtly the Mascot incident, the drainage problem lowering of standards offirefightingappUances Johnson is just not good enough. To say that it was a countersunique accident is not good enough. tremely lucky that something far more serious did not occur. An aircraft could have been between No. 5 and No. 6 aerobridges. There not sufficient engines present. There could been an incident in aircraft which were waiting on the tarmac because they could not unload their passengers. The Opposition has a commitCommonwealth ment to restore aircraft safety standards to those that prevaUed prior to the change in government.

The honourable member will resume his seat were Mr JULL (Bowman) (3.57)-The debate on have the Airhne Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill has been very wide ranging. The purpose of the Bill is to seek authority for the Treasurer of the to guarantee a loan raised by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd to purchase its new Boeing 727 200 series aircraft. Both Ansett Trans-Austraha Airlines are moving into the havepurchase of this new equipment TAA has indithat it wiU be financing its aircraft from its own funds. This is just a mechanical Bill, but because the debate has been so wide ranging there some points that should be answered and some observations that should be made about civU aviation in Australia at the moment. It is interesting to see that the airUnes have faith in the future. They have enjoyed a 4 per cent rate in thefirstthree quarters of this year. In fact, some extraordinary growth rate figures have been produced on a month to month oasis. that the airUnes in one month experienced a \9Vi per cent growth rate emphasise the problems they are having in providing the scheduled services. It is good to see that they have conin the future of civU aviation and are preappared to invest in their new Boeing 727 200 realised the series aircraft. CivU aviation in Australia is at a very interesting stage. As the industry moves into the 1980s last the call on new equipment and facUities will become greater and greater. In some respects it is interesting to observe that the airUnes at this stage have moved into the Boeing 727 rather looking at some of the bigger equipment. If one criticism can be leveUed at the two major domestic operators in Australia, perhaps it is that sometimes they have been a httle conservative in their forward estimates of their equipment mands. Airlines in South Africa, Thailand, Iran and some of the smaller nations in Europe have taken the risk and moved into the big Airbus equipment, the 250-seat aircraft. There has been quite a deal of debate suggesting that perhaps the Austrahan domestic carriers should be lookof ing right now at moving into the Airbus or the DC 10, which has been put up as a second option for the wide-bodied aircraft to operate on domestic routes in Austraha. Certainly much of the jet equipment operating in Austraha at the moment is becoming quite When I say that, it is not to say that safety is fares, being impaired at all. When we consider that certainly bothfleetscontain DC9s that have operated for aircraft outside some 24,000flyinghours in the last 10 years or so and when we do a quick mental calculation that would indicate that those DC9s have been ininconsiderable the air non-stop for about the point made by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) about the aircraft in Austraha. Obviously the airUnes be looking very hard atre-equippingtheir fleets,are and indeed they should. In a report released overseas recently it was indicated that a Fokker Friendship aircraft operating in Austraha was the oldest in the world. Obviously the airhne fleets must be kept up to the rigid safety stanlanding dards that operate in Austraha, but obviously the time is conung when some major re-equipment purchases will have to be made by the domestic airlines. I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Shortland regarding the major airport needs of Sydney study at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. What he said is very true. Kingsford-Smith Airport is probably the greatest headache besetting Austraha at the ment. I was interested to hear that he had doubt about the priorities of the commuter operefficiency, ators. The commuter operators play a most part in providing airline services New South Wales which they serve. The whole Kingsford-Smith Airport operation should be looked at in its true perspective. Many members of Parhament do not speak to the men who reaUySmith know the true position. In many cases they wouldcial be the domestic airline pUots. They tell us some rather frightening stones about some of the things that happen. It is an established fact that the early flight that leaves Brisbane at 7 a.m., or 6 a.m. during dayhght saving, for Sydney, is one service that not particularly affected. It is established that first aircraft to leave Brisbane for Sydney probably wiU arrive on time, but the second is invariadebly 20 minute's late because of the bank-up at Kingsford-Smith Airport. Late last Sunday afternoon I was corning to Canbena. The aircraft was delayed 20 minutes, and so was the one behind. Another aircraft was holding to the west of Sydney and another to the south of Sydney. So much this bank-up time is being caused by the smaU aircraft using Kingsford-Smith Airport. We talk about the cost factor involved in the operation of the hght aircraft. Having a Boeing 727 or a DC9 holding outside Sydney for up to 20 minutes is very costly for the domestic carriers. If we are old. looking at how we can bring down the cost of aU these things must be considered. I am not a pilot, but on my rather amateurish estimations I would say that to hold a Boeing 727 Sydney for 20 minutes would cost the price of 400 lb of fuel. That is not an amount of money. On Sunday afternoon, when four Boeing 727 aircraft were three years, we can see holding, the added sum would have been aputilisation of preciable indeed. must A number of other factors concerning Sydney certainly well worth looking at. A number of airline pUots have expressed to me concern at the instrument landing system operating on runway 16, the southern runway. To put it in airhne jargon, the centreline beam on that instrument system has bends in it. In fact the pilots do not have the capacity to line up their aircraft exactly to come in on that main south runway, runway 16. The gUdescope which the pUots use to make their landings on that runway also is causing them some headaches. In fact, according to the Department of Transport, the problem is caused by industrial interference from the facUities surrounding Kingsford-Smith Airport. Sure, the aircraft pUots can overcome those problems moand they do overcome them very well; but, if we some are looking at maximum safety and maximum these are the areas that must come vital under investigation and must be upgraded to those areas of continually. If something can be done about keeping the hght aircraft-no t the commuter aircraft, but the general aviation aircraft-ou t of KingsfordAirport, we can allow the heavy commerequipment which may be carrying up to 400 passengers the right to land on schedule with the required safety separation between aircraft, which they certainly are not enjoying at the moment. Three or four aircraft could be corning in on aflightpath and a light aircraft going at a is very slow speed could be holding up a Boeing the 747 or a DC10 behind it on itsfinalapproach. Apparently the system is that those major airAirbus craft have to slow down their way for the hght one, rather than priority being given to the heavy aircraft to make their landing at Sydney. As I said a httle earlier, the civil aviation industry, going into the 1980s, has a very bright future; but it is a future in which obviously concern of all governments, State and Federal, must be shown. I understand that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) will be speaking a httle later about the Brisbane Airport. We know the situation in regard to the Kingswas ford-Smith Airport and that there is a problem with the length of the runway at the Adelaide Airport. So in years to come the cost to governlooked ment is going to be very considerable indeed. One would hate to think of the amount of expenby diture that will have to be spent on airport ties over the next 10 years, out it must be spent Austraha is to maintain its safety standards. I was interested to read the comments of the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) in his second reading speech and the confidence he put in aviation review. Indeed many people in cision Austraha are interested in seeing the outcome the recommendations that wiUflowfrom that aviation review, not only in the domestic sphere but also in the international sphere. The twomust airline poUcy has served Austraha very well durstances ing the past 20 or 30 years. However, the time must come when a full review is carried out to make sure that the service that is being provided to the people is the most emcient and the least costly. After aU, the whole business of civil ation is people. Even the freight services relate people. The safety ofthose people certainly be taken mto consideration, as must be price. there is a possibUity of reducing domestic airline fares, whether it be through some air navigation charges or fuel tax or the higher utilisation of aircraft, every effort must made to provide the cheapest possible form of traveUing to the Australian pubUc. With the bringing in of wide-bodied aircraft as soon possible, one wonders whether or not some of these objectives can be achieved. In regard to the Airbus or a DC 10, we have, as the honourable member for Shortland mentioned, a situation the moment in which, although in some cases the number of aircraft movements are down and the number of passengers handled is up, perhaps some of the congestion at places hke Sydneyresults Sydney is a problem and will be for some timereviews. can be reUeved. Certamly that has been the cise in South Africa and it has been the exercise in some other cases around the world where has come into service in the last six to 12 approach to make months or so. I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Shortland about the migrant population. I have mentioned three or four times in this House the specific worry of the people in my electorate, those of the Finnish and the Danish communities, who at this stage have no access whatsoever to excursion fares to take them home or indeed to reverse traffic to bring their relatives from places like Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland to Australia to visit them. It one of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism that this aspect of international air travel be at. One would hope that in the civil aviation review we will get a very fair approach to it the Department and that the Department will facUinot be snowed by Qantas. It is interesting to if speak to people who work with the domestic operators, and some of the international carriers too, who claim that Qantas does have too much say over the civU aviation poUcies of Australia. The criticism is made, quite regularly, that when the the Department of Transport has to make a deon some aspect of civil aviation policy, of whether it be landmgrightsor something else, what Qantas says goes. Nobody is denying that we must protect our national carrier and that we provide the best possible operating circumfor that carrier; but I think there have been examples in past years where perhaps the national carrier has had far too much say in the way the aviation poUcy should go. So one hopes that this review will be a fair one, that it will be avian objective one and that we wiU see some very to real recommendations coming from it to help the must people of Australia achieve what I believe If should be the aim of our civU aviation pohcythe cheapest possible fares for the Australian the dropping of traveUing pubhc. be As I say, this has been a wide ranging debate, when we consider that the prime purpose of the Bill is to guarantee the provision of money from as the Commonwealth Government on behalf of Ansett to purchase a new Boeing 727. It is an area which should be of vital concern to aU of us. Never before, I believe, in the history of at Austraha has there been so much interest amongst the general pubhc as to which way civU aviation hi this country is to head over the next 10 years. It wiU be interesting to see just what and recommendations come out of those It is an industry in which Australia has a exervery proud record around the world. It is an industry in which we enjoy a safety record which the is probably comparable to that of no other country. It is interesting to see that the three airlines-Ansett , TAA and Qantas-ar e amongst the top ten airlines of the world in relation to airpoint: safety. I beheve that two of those airlines are in the top three. I think the record speaks for itself. terday This is an industry which must be in our con-restricted sideration at alltimes.It is an industry in which in there will be major changes in coming years. It isairportan industry where technical development is going along at a tremendously rapid industry which must be under constant review. due to The new navigation equipment that is coming ited into so many of the new aircraft, and the Omegamajor navigation system that is going to be used by 8,500 feet. domestic aircraft around the world, must in mind too. Obviously there will ultimately room for big cost savings to be made in what services the Department of Transport itself vides. I do not think it will be too long before domestic carriers and the internationals will complaining about the amount of money they the are being charged for some of these services when sophisticated computerised navigation equipment in modern jet aircraft will be able provide most of the information they need. So look forward to continued expansion in civil aviport. ation in Austraha in the next 10 years. This Bill helping that expansion by bringing a modern Boeing 727 aircraft into Austraha on behalf of Ansett. Another is to come for TAA. I wish the Bill a speedy passage.",64
128,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TAXATION STATISTICS,"A httle should piece of history is always useful when looking the development of airports. There has been a growing concern over the Brisbane Airport. It has manifested itself in this place and it is cersimply tainly manifesting itself in my own State. Brisment bane Airport is the most neglected in Austraha and it is the worse airport in any mainland capitalseaports. city. The anger and the concern that nave were developed are well exemplified by a newspaper and article in the Brisbane Courier-Mail dated a Saturday, 4 November 1967. The article conpon tains a hst of promises in relation to the Brisbaneregion Airport. These promises have now extended well over 10 years. This is merely a record of the lastwhat decade. If one were to reach back into the earlyBrisbane 1960s, one could peruse the promises made then.plain I shall read certain excerpts from this article from the statement of the then Minister for Civilof Aviation to indicate just what has not occurred. The then Minister for Civil Aviation indicated at thattimethat Brisbane was expected to benational come Austraha's No. 2 international airport under Federal plans to develop it. The Sydney Airport was to be brought up to an equal standard. The article said, and this is the important The Civil Aviation Minister, Mr Swartz, in Brisbane yesconfirmed that the Civil Aviation Department had accepted 12,500 feet as the necessary runway length for nonoperations of the Boeing 747. He indicated that Sydney Airpon had two runways of7,900 feet and 5,500 feet length and that Tullamanne, Melbourne's new $45m pace. It is anThat is in 1967 dollarsbecome fully operational in 1969 will carry only limjumbo jet traffic and will not be extended to become a port for them. Tullamarine's main runway will be Jumbos using it will do so with restricted loads bebe keptcause of the runway conditions. be The article then described the Darwin Airport and the Perth Airport. The plain fact is that there prohas been development and extension at every the one of those airports within the past decade. be There has been none at Brisbane, and Brisbane is third airport in Austraha. It is also the third international airport in Austraha. That is why the Courier-Mail, in a magnificent editorial last to Friday, made it perfectly clear that it expected wesomething to be done in relation to Brisbane airI have not seen such a forthright editorial in is that newspaper for a longtime.There is a growing and real concern. Let me make it quite clear that the runway at Brisbane airport, in terms of both domestic and international traffic, is the most inadequate runway at any capital city airport in Austraha. I say that it is not right that that be so and I say that it is not a fair go. So at the members from Queensland are concerned. The second reason why they are concerned is this: If an airport is stunted the developof a region will be stunted. In some ways airports have become the modern equivalent of In the past, nations, regions, and states, built up around their ability to have ocean sea traffic. That still obtains but airports are modern counterpart to that position. If an airis stunted demand and activity through that will be reduced. That is what is happening with respect to Queensland and that is certainly is happening quite precisely with respect to and south east Queensland today. The fact is that the growth of traffic at Bnsbane andairport has been in excess of the original estimate the needs of the airport. I am referring to the totality of the traffic, the larger volumes of traffic mentioned by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). I am referring to intertraffic, commuter traffic, general aviation traffic and domestic mainline traffic. I am taking them all together. Commuters and other services have as muchrightto use capital city ports as to other lines. They fulfil a very necesaryattainable. purpose. From 1969 to 1976, which included three dled. years of recession, the growth of traffic movement at Brisbane airport was over 6 per cent year. The growth this year is well in excess of 6 per cent per year for 1976, and is well in excess of 7 per cent per year. So that airport will its full capacity and queuing will have to occur many years earher than was envisaged in Brisbane Airport Transport Survey made some years ago. The data on which the survey was based is seriously out of hne and seriously out focus. Therefore we have to look at the proposals in respect of Brisbane airport. Again I look at the long history of promises that have been made relation to Brisbane airport, so well exemplified by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron). Recently, one of the memit bers of the board of Qantas Airways Ltd, Sir John Egerton, who also happens to be an inhabierations tant of my electorate, pointed out that there were some plans for the immediate development of Brisbane airport which would cost over $200m. These plans which were made pubhc, were for some runway realignment, terminal developthen ment, et cetera. As Sir John Egerton indicated, that is a very large expenditure to contemplate. suggest that that expenditure is totally unrealistic. As I have pointed out and as Queensland ber have made clear, we do not want the development of that airport to be a miniature Snowy Mountains scheme. We do not want anyreaUstic thing like that. The realistic program for expenation. diture for what is required between now and well into the 1990s, towards the end of this century, one-third of the amount which is being talked about. Some of the programs in respect of runQueensland ways, I suspect- I cannot obtain all the details them-ar e unrealistically elaborate and luxurious ious. They are unrealistic as to what is required for Brisbane airport. I suspect, and I say this quite frankly, that some of these costs have so loaded as to make the program unfeasible, make it quite unrealistic. I suggest that an expenreasons. diture of $60m to $70 would satisfy what has been promised in relation to Brisbane airport the end of this century. What are required are two features in terms of pubhc expenditure: realigned runway, and sufficient fill for replacement of terminals. Most of the other instances. expenditures that are required-othe r expendia tures are required-li e within the private enterprisefield.We do not want a Taj Mahal. We say that a Taj Mahal is being suggested and airworked on in order to make it unrealistic and unIt has the effect of malting the financial barrier so high that it cannot possibly be hurare We are suggesting modest proposals that realistic and capable of being fulfilled. per I want to say this: The people in Queensland the are becoming increasingly concerned about the airport. Pieces of quite serious misinformation reach have been conveyed. For example, the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon), who is a very talented the Minister, has indicated to the Australian National Travel Association in Queensland that in respect of Brisbane airport there are no real of restrictions imposed on international movements at that airport by either the runway or the recently completed international terminal facilities. inThat is an incorrect statement and the Department of Transport, which is responsible for the operation of the airport in Brisbane, knows that is incorrect. It knows that international carriers fully loaded-w e are talking about economic opfully loaded-ar e unable, under the temperatures and the conditions operating, to reach the nearest Asian port. From there planes are required to drop down at Darwin. British Airways planes travel from Brisbane to Sydney and to Singapore. They have the pleasure of watching planes from Tullarmanne airport I flying overhead not only on their way to Singapore but also on their way to Hong Kong, Manila and so on. That position is not suffidently ood. It is not a fair position and it is not one that memwould intend or would be able to defend. These things have to be pointed out. There are programs which can be put into operWe ask only that the people who are responsible for the engineering in this area and the is consultants responsible for drainage and engineering requirements in Brisbane and in other areas be consulted, but that the airof port not be designed at an unreaUsticaUy luxurlevel such as wefindin Melbourne or some other southern capital. Brisbane airport must have something done to it. Above all we say that beenany proposal to extend the runway is unacceptto able. It is unacceptable for a whole host of It has also been declared to be unacceptable by the State Government and by the Lord tillMayor of Brisbane. That proposal has also been declared to be unacceptable by the Liberal Party A of Queensland and by the Federal Council of the the Liberal Party, by a unanimous vote in both What is required at Brisbane airport is reahgned runway andfiUfor the estabhshment of terminals and those other faculties in an appropriate direction. BasicaUy that is aU that is required until the turn of this century. Unless that is done, queuing will begin to occur at that port much earher in the 1980s than was origthis inally foreseen. Most tragically, unless sometliing is done to develop an adequate airport, promises made in 1967 will be shown to have been promcaused ises of straw. But above all, an inadequate airfoUowing port indicates that a region can be kept back an unrealistic manner. Let me make one further comment. omic conditions under which a development leave occurs are also important. There can be attitudes granted. towards capital development programs that will occur as a particular stage ofan economic It has been part of the Government's program to have capital works programs restricted more than they would be otherwise fact, it is nonsense to suggest that over the long period that is required for the development of an (Dawson). airport, similar restrictions grams are going to persist.

So the economic circumstances will enable something to be done. In fact, the economic period circumstances could encourage that a capital Roman works program be initiated during the next hament with respect to Brisbane airport. I suggest that the Courier-Mail editorial has given a magnificent lead to the people of Austraha and the people of Queensland. I beheve that that lead will be taken.

130,Mr UREN,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to replace the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act 1974.

The present Bill extends the purpose of the amended Act to include aU environmental programs. The Bill has very wide ramifications. deals with aU the Government's conservation of the and environmental programs. It is regrettable that environmental matters have been very low on this Government's priorI refer for example to thefirstreport of the in Austrahan Heritage Commission which was tabled in the Parliament today. This is one of few programs in this area which have not been completely scrapped by the Fraser Government. The Austrahan Heritage Commission in fact set up by the previous Government. However there is not much moral or nnancial support given to environmental and conservation grams. An example is the Environmental Protechberties. tion (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, which probably is one of the most important pieces of allows legislation ever introduced into this Parhament. It has wide ramifications. Two studies were undertaken under the terms of the Environlegislation mental Protection (Impact of One was the Fraser Island inquiry and the other,The Governmentinhas or course, was the Ranger inquiry into uranium.not They had wide ramifications and it is very interesting to note that although both reports were brought down during the last two years, proposal has been referred to the Environmentaltion Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act by the Fraser Government. This Government has land, moved back to the old bulldozer mentality. Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) Affairs and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr or the and Sinclair, both Country Party Ministers, have had an enormous influence in this area. The area represented by the Minister for Environment, to Housing and Community Development (Mr 'mining Newman) probably has one of the GovernAct do not ment's lowest priorities. That is regrettable. With regard to the niining of uranium, as said earher, both thefirstand second reports the Ranger inquiry were brought down under the terms of the Environmental Protection marlary (Impact of Proposals) Act. The Minister for of these lands. Environment, Housing and Community Development did not make all the recommendaThis tions; they were made by the Minister for this National Resources. That brings the priorities this Government into question. This Government is superficially concerned with environmental and human justice issues. will deal briefly with the environmental aspects of uranium mining. The AlUgator River region a very delicate area of Australia. It is proposed that in due course-I hope that the area is not ruptured in the meantime-the Kakadu national park will be set up there. Recently I was in area and I saw how beautiful, dehcate, and fragile it is. The feelings and attitudes of the original people also will be an extremely dehcatement, situation to handle. The sad thing is that this Government is so superficial even with regard the environmental proposals put forward by Ranger mquiry. It has accepted the provisions the the Atomic Energy Act to control uranium mining in the AlUgator River area and the Kakadu national park area. This Act will supersede the was Ranger report. The Ranger report argued very strongly against using the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, both for environmental proreasons and reasons associated with civil The operation of the Atomic Energy Act no other consideration. It does not allow environmental considerations to disturb its provisions. This means that environmental impact is irrelevant and has no force on Proposals) Act. uranium mining the Alligator River region. only a moral obligation, a legal obUgation, to recognise the environmental safeguards recommended in the second Ranger report. The Atomic Energy Act also nooverrides the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. Sec41 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act requires, in effect, that m respect of Aboriginal a mining interest shall not be granted unThe less either both the Minister for Aboriginal the Northern Lands Council consent Governor General declares that the national interest requires that the interest be granted. But because authority has been granted Ranger under the Atomic Energy Act the interest' provisions of the Land Rights apply. I stress that point. Therefore the Northern Land Council consent will not be necessary in respect of the Ranger project even if I it becomes Aboriginal land under the land rights of claim. Therefore, Aborignals have norightover the Kakadu, the Mudginberri and the Munpastoral leases and the eventual disposal is of great significance environmentally in area. Members of my staff last week visited of JabUuka and Jabiru areas to see what the situation was. They saw large areas covered with plastic sheeting which had been used for aerial surveys, and now there were rotten pieces blowI ing about the bush. There were grid tracks made by motor trucks all over the bush, cut through the is bush yet this was an ecologicaUy fragile area. These nuning tracks of savage erosion will occur during the wet season. This Government's concern for the environment is subordinate to its the championing of the uranium minersrights.The Aboriginals, the people bestfittedto protect our Ab-unique inheritance in the Arnhem Land escarpalso have had their mterests overridden. The environment is in fact subordinate to this toGovernment's priorities. That is the whole issue. the They are just a few comments on a sad situofation that will occur under this Government on the priorities that do exist. There are other ments to be made on the environmental impact statements. There are comments in the report the Austrahan Heritage Commission, which was tabled today, dealing with the 'Woodchip indusin try but this Government has shown Uttle concern about this aspect. It has been said that arrangecreated ments have been entered into between State governments and overseas concerns in respect the wood chip industry, but we know that Government has certam powers under the CusNational toms Act which enable it to restrict the devastathe tion which is being caused to our forests and tect the natural areas that are being raped Austraha today. The report of the Heritage Comtogether mission tabled today warns all Australians the wood chip situation. It says: Australia is notrichin forested land. Since white ment, the area of forest has been halved, and now occupies less than 6 per cent of the continent. In the earlier timber cutting, the forests were not viewed as a renewable resource. The sad situation of course is that just as people State are raping our natural mineral resources today, problems our forest lands were raped in the past and of Government course this is stUl going on. The report of the port-financia isl muscle-t Heritage Commission gives this warning: Since 1970 the export trade more and more timber. Clear felling has denuded large areas of forest. One has only to go to Eden on the south coast New South Wales to see how badly the region has been raped by the wood chip industry. The Austrahan Government wiU have to exert control if the State governments will not control this deUcate part of our environment. The report the Heritage Commission continues. Many environmentalists do not object to the idea farms' or to the preference for imported species They do object, however, to clear felling in environmentally sensitive lands. There also for woodchip harvesting in the large areas of neglected land which are available for reafforestation. The State Forests have long been seen as 'landscaped national parks' which quietly serve a variety of needs. serve the logging industry, people interested in wildlife, tourists seeking grand scenery solitude. Unless very well managed the woodchip industry can wreck that traditional compromise. I think that is a warning. I hope that the Governvation ment wiU use the powers that it has over export to make sure that the State governments take some heed of this warning. Frankly, I am pleased that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKelllar) in his second reading speech did stress that if we are going to control our environment the only way we can control by a spirit of co-operation. I think that operation has to occur between the Austrahan comGovernment, State governments and local governments and even between governments of and the private sector. We cannot go on as we did particularly between the years 1950 to 1972 which the buUdozer mentaUty existed. In that time many of the beautiful buUdings that were by man were destroyed because of greed and stupidity and of course because of that buUof dozer mentaUty. It was only after the Labor this Government set up the Hope mquiry into the Estate that there was any real change in attitude to preserving some of our national proheritage whether man-made or by nature. I think in that this understanding that we have to work if we want to preserve our national heriabout tage is starting to grow in the community. The sad situation which has occurred is that settlealthough die National Estate program is now years of underway it needs nnancial support, it needs financial muscle. I am not saying that the Federal Government can produce everything from its Pandora's box to solve thefinancialproblems of and local governments, but many of these can be solved only if the Federal prepared to givefinancialsupo back up the planning in wood-chips has called for E roposals. It has been said that whereas the abor Government in its three years in office spent in excess of some $ 15m, less than $ 1 m or at the very most $1.5m might have been spent in of the last two years under the Liberal Government. That is the sad situation that has occurred. The Government, in saying that it has to wait until the national register is prepared, is simply postvery poning the matter. We know from the recomof mendations in the Hope report and from the reports and requests from the respective State of'tree governments that there is ample work avaUable of trees. and so much that can be done and much of the work is labour intensive. I hope that the Federal seem to be special opportunities cleared, Government will do more in the years ahead towards making a real contribution towards protecting our national heritage and protecting our They National Estate, to ensure that the rare species and are protected, whether they be flora or fauna. or satisfying their feeling for The whole basis of my criticism of this Bill is that on the environmental front and the conserfront this Government has such very low priorities. It has faUed. Wherever the interests of growth or wealth appear to be, this Government sides with them just as it sided with the uranium mining interests in that very dehcate area of the AlUgator River in Arnhem Land. Instead of accepting the proposition, as reported, that there it is should be sequential development of uranium comining in the areas and that only the Ranger mine should go aheadfirstto ascertain what problems would be created in this dehcate enorganisations vironmental area-that would have been bad ment. enough-the Government rejected was done? The Government even cancelled the proposition of sequential development of the Ranger mine and the Pancontinental mine. The simultaneous development of those two mines not only will have a grave effect on that dehcatemanipulate. environment but also will have a grave effect the environment of the human beings in that area, that is, the Aboriginal people. That is the extremely sad situation. Therefore, whilst not posing the Bill, the Opposition criticises and some cases condemns the priority given vironmental and conservation matters of protecting our national heritage.",69

In this year's Budget, due to the in efforts of the Minister for Environment, Housmg to enand Commumty Development (Mr Newman) $2.SSm was allocated for the National Estate. I understand that certain grants have been announced for Tasmania. We aU know how hard the Minister works and how very interested he is the National Estate.

One of the projects in which I am particularly is called the Jondaryan woolshed.

The forJondaryan woolshed is a great monument to the of the men of last century to erect a buUdwhich in effect can withstand the exigencies aof time. It was, in its heyday, the largest prowoolshed in Australia. I understand that at f resent it is the oldest woolshed still in operation, was most heartened in the days of the Labor Administration by the keen interest that was displayed in this project by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). He, as an ex-shearer, wanted to join with me and the of the Jondaryan district in preserving the woolshed as a memorial not only to the Australian pastoral mdustry but also to the shearing mdustry. No pohtics were involved. The honoura co-able member came mto this Parhament from the sheds and shared my infectious enthusiasm for having afittingmemorial to the industry catalyst toin aU spheres, from the bottom up.

It is now a mostfittingmemorial able to enjoy to the early pioneers of that district. There even is employed there a man who can recreate the old transport buggies, make wheels and carry out that wonderful old trade of blacksmithing. I hope that when grants are allocated the Jondaryan woolshed is among the recipients. It ably deserves to be among the recipients because it represents the industry. It does not represent one section of the industry; it represents whole industry. I am dehghted that the honourdads; able member for Hindmarsh has come into the chamber.

This Bill seeks to bring out nauonai poUcies in intrusion two ways, not only in the manner of spending have money, about which I have been commenting, problems. but also in the matter of overseeing tion of chemicals. It is both distressing pleasing to note that man has wrought great in metropoUtan Australia tofor damage by the indiscriminate use of chemicals. When I hear of a person being afflicted by unknown disease I often wonder whether this can be traced back to the fact that he has sorbed through the pores of his skin pesticide and weedicide sprays, used by people aimlessly and without any idea of responsibiUty. I know people, that in the irrigation areas of worth thousands of dollars has been destroyed from it all, countryside, because of drift of chemicals from people have been using weedicides in a windy situation sounds and the murmurings of the the and who have not exercised responsibiUty. Therefore it is good to see in the Minister's ond reading speech- I compliment him on fact-that the Government, through the Ausexpired. trahan Environmental Council, will move positively towards comprehensive and co-ordinated regulations for the export and import of environcongratulating mentally hazardous chemicals. I believe that is an excellent initiative. Damage done by chemispeech cals cannot be measured in absolute terms. In final analysis it is the cause of much sickness much loss of income. The National Country Party and all Government supporters fully supthis. port this legislation. We agree with the criticism that has been advanced that it does not go far enough. But viewed against the background of a government moving in therightdirection with greatfinancialrestrictions placed on it on account of the state of the economy, this is a tive proof to the Australian people that we serious about the environment. We are concerned about the problems of air poUution and land poUution.

133,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS," I will not talk for very long. I begin by the honourable member for Darthat Ung Downs (Mr MCVeigh) on the excellent that he just deUvered. It surprised me, the and I am sure it surprised everybody in the ParandUament, to learn that he can speak with such eloquence and common sense on a matter such as What I Uked about his speech was the fact that he did not read a single word of it. It aU came from the heart. My advice to him, which I offer in the kindhest of ways, is that from now on he should continue to speak from the heart-h e has proved himself to have a heart-and not to posiread and rant from papers written to him by the are Austrahan Cattlemen's Union or whoever used to write his speeches. The honourable gentlemen is improving rapidly and I am sure that in the dim, distant future, when his side comes to office again, we will see him in this place as a Minister. I hope that one day he is made a Minister. He is I wish to deal mainly with the point that the honourable member for Darling Downs made about Jondaryan Station. He is entitled to a deal of praise for what he has done to foster wonderful historic relic of Australian history. Not only is it a relic of the pastoral also is a relic- a very important relic-of history and the industrial history of Austraha. remember so well the honourable member comin ing to me, when I was Minister Immigration and in charge of the Regional Employment Development scheme, and asking for hope support for the restoration of that magnificent December old building. I approved his request and gave my the purposeinofgiving support to it. I am sorry that I was from the ministry before I was able to see it resperhaps more importantly, tofrom tored. Of all the projects Labor the RED scheme-man y veryfineprojects were carried out under that scheme-non e was deserving of support than the restoration Jondaryan Station. Jondaryan is the station where the Austrahan was Workers Unionfirstsecured agreement pastorialists of Queensland for an all-union shop. It was agreed with the late Spence and Macdonnell that in the shearing season of the following year all of the workers there would be union members. Spence made the mistake-it turned out to be a mistake later but at that in the short term it was not-of threatening the owners of Jondaryan. He said that if they did not agree to a union shop, as it was called-to work according to agreement rates-the waterside workers would refuse to load the wool onto the party ships. I have studied the history of the AWU I have documentation to prove that Spence was never given authority by the Austrahan Watercame side Workers Federation to make that threat against the owners of Jondaryan. That fact has not been previously recorded in any of the official history books but it will be recorded my history of the AWU. He made that threat bluff, something for which he was notorious. The owners of Jondaryan caved in. When the waterto side workers heard about the situation they umbrage at the fact that their name had been used without consultation in the course of an industrial dispute. However, because Jondaryan eventually agreed to the union demand, the waterside workers were quick to turn around and Australia. claim credit for a threat that was made in their name. History shows that the settlement of the Jondaryan dispute sowed the seeds of the great maritime strike. When the ships officers refused the right by the ship owners to affiliate with the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, the ships officers, in conjunction with the waterside workers, made the same threat which had been great so effective against the owners of Jondaryan. this However, the ships officers and waterside workers lost and one of the biggest strikes ever industry; it recorded came into being labour Jondaryan is an important part of Austrahan I labour history. It has the biggest shed ever built for Labour and It isAustraha fitting and and perhaps anywhere in the world. proper that it should be restored.

Thirdly, there is major concern time, because some of Austraha's rare species of wildlife are so likely to be lost in the next 20 years unless we take very great care. In my view there should be no monopoly-and no particular is entitled to the monopoly-of concern for and conservation. It is the concern of us all. It is sometimes said that those people who first to this country ravaged the country and did a lot of damage. In certain cases that may be so but I do not think we should look upon the whole problem of conservation with a feeling of guilt. in Certainly, we ought not to look upon it with the as a gloom which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) always asks us to adopt. I prefer look upon it with the charm, grace and eltook egance of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). Honourable members should look at the wonderful buildings in Robe. They should look at the history of Robe. They should look at the wonderful areas in I wish to make a few comments about conservation. The next problem we have to face is education in conservation. Are we teaching the children in our schools how to use the equipment were they take with them when they go into the wildlife areas? How many rivers have I found full of spinners because people or children did not know how to use their tackle? What a tragedy it is, whenfishingin the Falls Creek and watching the evening sun go down, to have to stand on glass bottles or cans. Thefirstlesson in conservauon must be taught and understood by all those who go into the countryside. Let take an example of one person in the last century who made a veryfinecontribution towards conof servation. I refer to the work of Carlo Catani. honourable members looked from the Dantain denongs straight down to Westernport they would realise what a wonderful operation it to clear the whole of the area and to make it some of the most ferule and most valuable land in Austraha. The black soil around Kooweerup well known to anybody with an understanding farming. Those who understand must appreciate how difficult it is for people to work out conservation plans when two authorities are involved. Take, for example, the Shire of Cranbourne. There are two authorities involved-the Westernport Regional Council and the Melbourne and MetropoUtan Board of Works. A third authority deals with aU the effluent which goes into Westernport Bay. There must be a genuine coavaUable operation between aU these authorities. I say it would be tragic if we lose the use of Westernprinciple port Bay because development of industry in that area. The development must be done with the greatest possible care. The revision of the boundcentres aries of Holt have given me the wide areas towards the bay. I consider that conservation one of the most important things to which every member of this House should devote his attenthe tion in the next 10 or IS years. Industries developing in this area. They must be developed carefully and with sound sense. I do not want to take up too much time of HouseMr Haslem- I am glad to hear you say that. There is a Bill dealing with returned servicemen. You are delaying it.",74
134,Mr YATES,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"I did not know that. I am an serviceman. If the honourable member had said that there was another important Bill on which he wished to speak, I would have given up my ume. In view of that statement, I will say only one thing: This Bill is designed to assist those who are working voluntarily, both at a national level and at a State level, in the most important area for our nation, that is, the conservation of the beautiful things we possess in our country.",76
135,Mr LES JOHNSON,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS," I cerwere tainly will not take up too muchtime.As has been acknowledged, this Bill is an interesting one. It opens an area of contemplation that is area very important to Australia and the people of this country. I want to summarise the financial aspects of the Government's approach to environmental matters. Although I do not regard us the Bill as a major controversy for the House, I must say that quite consistent with the inability the Mmister for Environment, Housing and If Community Development (Mr Newman) to susexpenditure in other areas for which he is responsible, there has been this heavy dechne in was funding of environmental activities. I refer especially to special grants which have been cut back very significantly indeed. The grants for is conservation organisations in the last three of budgets have been $450,000, $391,500 and $300,000. In three years they have come down from $450,000 to $300,000.I am told that there have been no curtaUments at aU to grants in aid generaUy if they apply to boy scouts, girl guides or surf Ufe saving clubs. The curtaUment in grants to conservauon organisations has been of very serious proportions. I refer now to the grants to the environmental centres. The Labor Government of course made direct grants, not matching grants. In that recenttimesthis Government has introduced the of matching grants- a $2 for $ 1 subsidy arrangement for 1976, and the $1 for $1 subsidy arrangement for 1977. We are told that some will be closing as a result of this arrangement. One can imagine the mining people and is those industrial people with vandahstic tendencies rubbing their hands together with glee when policemen-the people who alert the country are and the governments to environmental destruction-are put out ofbusiness. I think that is a very sad thing to happen. the Let me mention briefly the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. I am told that no mquiry has been conducted under that Act since 1975. Of course there were issues which could have justified inquiries-the Concorde coming to Austraha, the wood chip industry on exthe South Coast of New South Wales, the nuclear powered warship or submarine coming to Australian waters and the Omega base in Victoria. None of these matters has been the subject of any inquiry under that Act. The Environmental impact aUocation for pubUc hearings is down from $694,300 in 1975-76, to $507,268 in 1976-77, to $65,000 in 1977-78. That is a drop of all $629,000 in three years. That is in regard to environmental impact statements. I know that we promised an inquiry in respect of the Concorde aircraft, but the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) apparently took unUateral acuon. He made his own decision. The aircraft came flying in. The Act was totally disregarded. Government promised in its election pohcy on environment and conservation a pubhc inquiry on the wood chip industry. That promise has been dishonoured. The air pollution monitoring program has been cut from $275,000 in 1975-76 to $75,000 1977-78.1 think a matter of concern is that Minister for Environment, Housing and ComWe munity Development has allowed his Departhazards ment to be whittled away. The staff ceilings have affected the environmental area quite consideruntary ably. We hope that the next Minister responsible for these matters willfightand will be more cessful in trying to maintain adequate staff for the purpose. I probably should pack up at that point. I am being very co-operative because of thetimerestraint, as I understand it. I dunk a lot more could be done about marine pollution. I would have liked to have said quite bit about this subject. It is a very serious matter. In New South Wales waters alone there have been more than 40 incidents involving oil lution from ships in the last 12 months. There been no reduction in the number of spillages the last 12 months. It is as plain as a pikestaff greater resources and greater effort must be into this. I am grateful for the opportunity have spoken. I feel tempted to say a little more. am getting the nod from the Government that I have had a fair crack of the whip so prepared to leave it at that and convey my aprecord. E reciation for the attentive audience that I ad. I wish all my parliamentary opponents vigorousfightin the forthcoming election. I can assure them that when the Labor Government is elected we will certainly be giving to environReef mental matters the kind of attention that they would like to see given.",76
136,Mr NEWMAN,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"Bass-Minister for Environful ment, Housing and Community Development) example, (5,23)-in reply- I will not speak for long, but think I must respond to some of the half truths and exaggerations that were trotted out as usual by the two old faithfuls from the Opposition, honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les of Johnson) and the Deputy Leader of the Oppowhich sition, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren). If their concern for the truth half matched their concern for the environment, I think they would be a lot better off. Let me put the facts this matter of the Government's concern for environment and conservation. This Governeither ment's record in these matters is impeccable. We have a record of concern. We have a record action. We have a record which shows a practical The apphcation of a range of programs and pohcies. Let me go through them quickly. We have continued to subscribe in a very vigorous way to and have provided leadership for two councilsthe Austrahan Environmental Council and the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers. We in have continued programs on air quahty. We the have continued programs on soil conservation. have introduced new programs detailing the of chemicals. The honourable member for Hughes, typically, has no concern for the volorganisations that run environmental centres for the conservation groups around the succountryside. The arrangement for sharing, which I think is perfectly reasonable, wfll conunue on the same basis as last year. For every $ 1 that they raise, we will give them $2. We are not reverting to the dollar for dollar basis, as the honourable member for Hughes suggested. It is also wrong to say that we will be going down to $300,000 this ayear. We will maintain the same level of programs as last year-$400,000 . In addition to continuing support for those voluntary organispolations, we have continued under the States has grants legislation to provide money for those in States which wish to acquire land for national 1 that larks and so on. We have amended that legisput ation so that we can help the States with manto agement facilities. We are doing that in TasImania in the wilderness area known as the South Whip West National Park. I am The statutory bodies have a magnificent Again it is a vigorous record. The Great have Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is surging a ahead. I hope that in the near future we will be able to declare thefirstzone in that magnificent area in the southern part of the Great Barrier Marine Park. The Austrahan Heritage Commission has proceeded to put thousands of places on the national list. It has been very helpalso in making recommendations, for about the national conservation volunI tary groups and those who will be funded under the Austrahan Heritage Commission Act. In that respect we have increased thefiguresthis year, the not to the $ 1.5m about which the Deputy Leader the Opposition was talking, but to $2.55m will keep the Australian Heritage Commission Act moving along so that areas and places that need help will continue to receive it. We come to the linchpin of our pohcies, the on Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) the Act. The honourable member for Hughes is ignorant or just being provocative in this place, because the things he said are totally unof true. We began our inquiries with the Fraser Island issue. We acted decisively, with determination and with courage. That come part not only of Austraha's heritage but also of the world heritage. The honourable member for Hughes implied that by not putting money into the Budget allocation we therefore would not be looking at any pubhc inquiries. forthwith. There has not been a need for a public inquiry. am sure the honourable member for Hughes ume. knows that if there were a need money would be provided out of the advance to the Treasurer. is as simple as that. The honourable member for Hughes claimed that there should have been inquiries into other matters. We have acted under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, whether the matter in question was the Concorde aircraft or wood chipping on the south coast of New South Wales. There question about that. Let me educate him a little about the Act, because obviously he does not know it. Under the Act there are two alternaments) tives-eithe r a pubhc inquiry or administrative procedures with an environmental impact stateretirement ment. I chose the environmental impact ment. That was legitimate and it was certainly the correct thing to do in those matters. I willfinishon the question of uranium in the posite Northern Territory. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition tried to pretend that the was going to ignore the environmental promises it had made in regard to the development of introduced uranium mining in the Northern Temtory and interesting the declaration of the Kakadu National Park. He brought in the red herring of the Australian Atomic Energy Act. The Act has absolutely no There bearing on this argument. We have made our on bothhassides position quite clear. I will go through those prothe House to remove cedures again. We will declare National Park as soon as we can. There has a delay because the matter has to be arranged that the Aboriginals may get their landrightsesis widowed after the retirementtheofspouse tablished and lease the land back to us. Already viceman and who remarries, and the spouse the Acting Supervising Scientist is working committee of specialists and the Northern Terriattained tory Administration on establishing the monitorhas always ing requirements that will precede the estabhshitaccepted ment of mines in the area. In summary, let there be no mistake either this House or among the people who may be lishas tening to this broadcast. This Government is conrecall cerned with the environment and conservation issues. We can point to a history of action in last 22 months. It is a record of action that not matched by the Opposition when it was government and had a chance to do some of the things about which Opposition members have been talking in this place this afternoon.

The liberso alisation in this legislation covers who the serwho with a married the pensioner after the pensioner the age of 60 years. It is interesting that as been difficult to have such reforms reasonable social security projects. Ever since I entered this Parliament we have had in discussions of this nature. I do not know why it taken 20 years to liberalise these matters. I 17 or 18 years ago having a discussion with the Commonwealth Actuary, on behalf of a comthe mittee outside of this to which I belonged, in was which I raised the case of the widow of a serin viceman who remarried after the servicemen's retirement. The horror that the Actuary brought to the discussion when it was suggested that we ought to disregard the pecuUarity of her situation and bestow the normal benefit was almost incredible. I hope that the Bill is gratefully received throughout the system. I think the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett) has had us something to do with recent developments in this wUlwho field. A former member for La Trobe, Mr John Jess, and a committee of this Parliament had good deal to do with updating the scheme. If I remember rightly- I would hate to introduce few poUtics at this stage of this Parhament-it was the Labor Government which implemented most of ThereforeItitiscannot that committee's recommendations and started things on their way. So we aU have had a part in it, but we all have been a part also of the UUberal on interpretations of the system. This afternoon 1 remind honourable membersnot and the people responsible for drafting this lation and for the examination of the scheme of the situation of those officers who retired, I prior to 1962.I am open to correction, but from glance at the speech I think we have not brought setter. servicemen up to date with the people who retired post-1962. Mr Bonnett-Post-1972.",78
140,Mr BRYANT,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"That is correct, 1972. I know servicemen of long and distinguished service who were gravely disadvantaged by this faUure to mtroduce what might be called 'catch-up' progreat visions. I know of one soldier who graduated from Duntroon towards the end of the First World War, went overseas, served in the regular Army continuously during the period of peace, was in Europe at the beginning of the Second World War, formed a battalion and carried it through to battlefields and who rose to the rank, I think, of brigadier and ultimately retired heutenant-general. I do not know exactly what his pension is, but I would guess that it is low down in the system. It is probably not much better than the pension of a person who served for 10 or 12 years, who may have seen no active service at all and who retired as a heutenant warrant officer or something of that order. Some years ago when wefirststarted to discuss this matter only 7,000 or 8,000 people were volved. There is an incredible system when we come to discuss matters such as this in relation to pensions, whether they be sions of servicemen or other folk. Such meanness was reflected in the Act governing parUamentary pensions. There were certain restrictions on widow's pension if the member had married after a certain age or within a certain period fore his retirement. I do not think those things are justifiable. I was saying here this afternoon, as I have said on a lot of occasions in this place, that when we are speaking about people who put on the uniform to serve in the armed Services, they accept a totaUy difierent responsibility from that of any of do not do so. It may well be that a person serve for 20 years and will not move far from a headquarters or from barracks. It may well be that a person enlists in the Services and within a months he is in some totaUy unexpected situation forfeited.such as Vietnam and his hfe or his health is a totaUy different quaUty of service. be evaluated in any way in terms of money. So this afternoon I am grateful, behalf of those people in my electorate who will benefit from this legislation, for the fact that something more has happened. I hope that in the too distant future we will be in a position to legistake up aU the anomaUes and iron them out. That ought to apply to other systems too. This is think, one of those cases in which the superannuation a scheme for pubhc servants has been a trendThis afternoon in the last few minutes of this Parliament, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak uninterrupted. I noted that as I rose to speak an increasing number of people, including the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), came into the chamber to Usten. It has been one of my sorrows that the right honourable gentleman, who was elected to this Parliament at the same time as myself and who made his maiden speech on the same night as I did, has refused to benefit from the continual advice I have given him about his pohtical views. However, he is stUl not too old to be corrected. As I make what I suppose is going to be one of the last speeches of this as a Parliament, I remind the House that I made one of thefirstspeeches of the Parhament on the day very we elected the Speaker. Honourable members will be interested to note that, having spoken for what amounted to about a third of a column in Hansard, the present right honourable member or a for New England (Mr Sinclair), who represents that constituency for the time being, had the question put and I was gagged. I hope that this afternoon we will depart from this Parhament in with some sense of responsibUity for the parUameanness in the mentary system. penOne is critical of the shorttimeaUotted for this debate. This is a very lengthly piece of legislation; it has 51 clauses; it is a very complicated E the iece of legislation. But we have notimeto deate it. The sheer arithmetic of this Parliament bemeans that we will not havetimeto debate legislation such as this in the future either. If 80 or 90 pieces of legislation such as this are brought down and we try tofitthem in end to end during the parliamentary year, there is no way in wnicn that can be done. Therefore there has to be a legislative committee system. I hope that we will get round to that so that we can start to feel as though we are in a participating parliamenagainst tary democracy. I shall refrain from speaking during the adjournment debate this afternoon but will press my thoughts now. I do not know what one wishes honourable members opposite on an parts occasion such as this. I will be going out into torates to try to entice the people to see otherwise than do honourable members opposite and encourage them to return people who represent the forces of progress and jusuce as do members on my side of the House. I have no doubt that vigorous campaigns will be conducted by honourable members opposite in the electorate of Wills to try to remove me. At least they will drive through the electorate on occasions, but I suppose they will not stop. On the whole, one can only say, Mr Speaker, that under your benign guidance and the way in which you conducted the affairs of the House-and you have improved through 22 years' association with me-the House has overcome many great difficulties and troubles that come from the tensions that arise it. On the whole, onefindsthat most members tributed are personable, that they are easy to get along with when travelling interstate or overseas parUamentary committees. I hope that the spirit of good sense, good judgment and bonhomie we bring to occasions such as this will eventually extend to the consideration of social legislation such as that now before the House and that, instead of talcing 20 years to drift and trudge through the liberalising of matters, we will get on with it from day one and will do things properly from the very beginning.",79

This is a very important piece E rogress, not only for ex-servicemen in general, ut also for women in particular. The second most important part of the legislation is the nondetriment provisions to protect certain late enmore trant officers transferring to the new scheme any possible diminution of their pension entitlement for which they were contributing at the timeof transfer. The amendment is to be exeffective from the date of commencement of the present scheme, namely, 1 October 1972.

Before we depart, before the House is dissolved, I should hke to pay a tribute to you, Mr Speaker, for the way which you have discharged the duties of your high office. It is your task to maintain the dignity of this place, and you have done so in the traditions of your predecessors, with moderation and with humour. Mr Speaker, if I may say so, you have not always been given the entire assistrecord ance which you should have been given by mem-ters' bers of the House. Assisting you have been the Chairman of Committees, the Clerk and his officers in this place. We are likewise indebted to them for effective operation of the Parhament. You will know, Mr Speaker, that there are many others who work in the House and who contribute in many ways to the comfort and convenience of all honourable members. We are grateful to them all. Among them. I would like to mention the Hansard staff for their unfailing attention to their duties and for their general efforts to improve quahty of our language and the way in which reads for posterity. I can remember an occasion when a former member for Bonython, who had habit of stringing his sentences together, complained about the manner in which Hansard had altered his language and, in part, had altered his meaning. He asked that he be reservices ported precisely and exactly as he spoke. I am referring to an earher member for Bonython, going back some considerable time. On the next occasion on which he made a 30-minute he was reported precisely as he spoke-in one sentence without end. Let that be a warning honourable gentlemen who complain about way in which Hansard sometimes improves their grammar. To be reported exactly as one speaks not always to one's advantage. The staff of the ParUamentary Library are always ready to help honourable members with mquiries and research. I think the manner in which that Department has been established expanded in recenttimeshas added greatly to the capacity for work of honourable members. would like to thank Roger Webb, the Parliamenexpress tary Liaison Officer, who has done so much that there is smooth working in this buUding. thank those who work in the refreshment and who look after us during the long hours we are in this buUding; the attendants for cheerful courtesy to each of us as we come and about our work; those who order cars and velmfauingly hicles to make sure that honourable members here ontimeand that they get to wherever they are staying at night; and lastly those who arrange our travel to and from Canberra at the beginning and end of each week. We are all indebted to them for their efficient service. Without any one in aspect of their activities the Parliament would not function as an efficient and proper place. Mr Speaker, this Government came to office at best atimeof some difficulty for Austraha. On the ministry has faUen a heavy burden of responsibUity. So on this occasion I want to place on my personal appreciation for the Minisdedicated work and for the way in which they have worked as a team. Behind the ministry are the hard working members and their staffs, and also those in Government departments who the work beyond and out of sight but whose labours contribute in a very real way to the successful continuance of executive government. I beheve that Austraha is very well served by the quaUty of its pubUc servants, by their dedication to the service of Australia and by their apohtical approach to the problems that confront them. It is cardinal in our system that the Pubhc Service be the able to support a government of this complexion it or a government of another complexion and do it so that Ministers and Prime Ministers can have a complete and absolute confidence in the quaUty of its advice, in its integrity and in the way in which it goes about its business. The Austrahan Pubhc Service stands high amongst the pubhc of the world. I beheve that this country can be grateful for it. Ministers particularly, and former Ministers, know of the dedication and efficiency of pubUc servants. I am sure that all of speech us mark it with appreciation. It is appropriate in a speech at the end of a to parUamentary session for me to say a special the word about my colleague the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) who has had the difficult is task of making sure that the program of government business is managed smoothly and effectively. I beheve he has done so in a way that has generally found acceptance on aU sides of the House. He has used the gag and the guUlotine a and good deal less than some of his predecessors used it, and there has been proper and useful I time for debate on matters of importance. So I my thanks to him and to the Government to see Whips for their work in malting sure that I honourable members are where they ought to be rooms at the appropriate time. that The Government and this House owe a special their debt to the First ParUamentary Counsel, Mr go Quayle, and to his staff. These officers have given the Parliament BUls of consistget ently high excellence even when thetimehas been short or the urgency pressing. The quahty of their work is not only a tribute to their profession, it is also a tribute to Australia. The quality of the Acts of this Parliament, the laws which we are sent here to make, is testimony to their fine work. I also express my appreciation to my colleagues on this side of the House. They co-operated wholeheartedly with the Governseek ment and have contributed to the debates and the proceedings of this place, and to the formachairs, tion of pohcy to their own and to the GovernSenate. ment's credit. This Parhament has seen some important reforms in the scope of its own operof ations. Chief among them is the introduction the Expenditure Committee. That Committee has been in operation scarcely a year but value of its work is already being seen. I beheve that the very fact of its existence tends to departments more careful of their expenditures. extend the Government's appreciation to the first chairman and to the present chairman of Committee for their important pioneering work. I hope that early in the next Parhament a move can be made for the establishment of legislation committees, in which I know you, Mr Speaker, have a keen interest but which the pressure of buiness unfortunately led to be put aside over the course of this year. FinaUy, some of our coUeagues have already signified their intention not to stand again for election to this House. Others will be seeking their fortunes elsewhere by nominating for another House-by nominating for the Senate. To each of those who are resolved not to return we extend our best wishes for the future. Firstly, there is the present father of the House and indeed father of the Parhament, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley). He was very first elected in 1945 and since then has given and honourable service to this House, to his eleche tors and to this nation. I beheve that he is one those to whom Australia owes a debt for the and dedicated service to his Party and Australia. He was a distinguished Minister Education in the former Government. We wish him health, happiness and good fortune in his retirement. Two more honourable gentlemen who were Ministers of the previous Government will be retiring. I refer to the honourable member Lalor, Dr Cairns, and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Crean. I am sure that every member of this House wishes them both well for the future. The honourable member Melbourne Ports is in the chamber at the present time. He too has been in the Parliament for a very long while, acting out of a sense of dedione cation and a sense ofthose things in which he heves to the service ofhis party and to the service of Austraha. May I say that the Parhament will be a worse place for his departure. I am sure that aU of us wish them well for the future. have Four honourable gentlemen are retiring to election to greener pastures, in the Senate. I suppose that, after considering the colour of the I should have said 'redderpastures' in the I refer to the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth). Perhaps the change colour will not suite him. I refer also to the of honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp), the honourable member for Tangney (Dr the Richardson) and the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Hamer). I wish the honourable memmake ber for Isaacs well. Among the members of the I Government parties may I mention the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett) and the the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King). I join with all their colleagues in extending my best wishes to them for the future. The honourable member for Herbert in particular has given a great deal of attention to the problems of ex-servicemen. I am certain that they recognise that and are grateful for it, as I am and as this Parliament is. The honourable member for Wimmera and I, holding adjoining seats, have been neighbours in politics for a very long while. I believe that even when, at times, there has been Uttle warmth between our organisations, as sometimes occurs in the best of famUies, there has always been the best of relations between Bob King and myself. I could not wish for a better neighbour in a neighbouring electorate than Bob King. I thank him much for his friendship in the years in which longwe have held adjoining electorates. I know that will be Uving not quite in my electorate but in of an electorate just to the north and I am sure he longwUl be around for a long while to come. As to Leader of the Government I thank both the for honourable member for Wimmera and Duke Bonnett for their loyalty and hard work over many years. I would also like to mention the good work of the honourable member for Evans, John Abel. Histimehere has been aU to brief. It was cut short through the decision of the Distrifor bution Commissioners. I am confident that he will return as a member of this House on some future occasion. Unfortunately, Distribution Commissioners happen to be one of the hazards for that members of Parhament have to run. That can be said with feeling by many people in different places fromtimeto time. I believe that of the merits of this Parhament is that it has behad an electoral system which has, by and large, resulted in a fair distribution of seats in the Parliament, much more than in some Parhaments. I tliink it is to the credit of the Commonwealth Parhament that this is so. We are fast coming to the end of this ParhaWorks. ment. Over the last two years we have had before us a heavy program of legislation and other Uamentary business. We have sat for a total 1,400 hours- I did not collect the statisucs hope somebody is right-and more than 360 have been passed. That seems a very great number. Honourable members have placed this more than 4,000 questions on notice. As I have said, there was much to be done and much remains to be done. The Government is going the people confident that it has achieved the firstoccasions. stage of new pohcies and new directions for welfare of Australia. It looks forward to taking up the task again after the elections. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of extraordinarily the Opposition)- Mr Speaker, of aU theritualsof this House the one we are engaged in at present has faUen into the longest disuse. Not since October 1972 have we taken the opportunity to make valedictories of this kind. The Parhaments that. in April 1974 and November 1975 adjourned rather too hurriedly for us to make these remarks. Accordingly, I shall keep my remarks very brief. I realise that many people outside Parhament are unkind enough to think that if say something unpleasant on these occasions are being provocative and if we say something pleasant we are being insincere. May I therefore support the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his tributes to those many hundreds of men and women-up to about 1,000-who work in this buUding. This is one of the most industrious office blocks or factories or plants in the country. Nobody works a 40 week here. It would be impossible for us to do Opposition. our jobs but for the assistance of a very great number of skilled, good humoured and dedicated servants of the Parhament and, through it, of the country. I also support the Prime Minister in the references he has made those of us who have announced that we will not again be standing for Parliament. Three of them have been Ministers of mine. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), the father of the Parhament, entered this House in August 1945. He was only 27 years of age. The honourSerjeant-at-Arms, able member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) entered the Parliament in 1951 but had served two parhaments in Victoria before that. The honourable member for Lalor (Dr JF CAIRNS) has served in the Parliament for 22 years. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Garrick) Speaker, has served here for eight years but before that had given long pubhc service in local government as a mayor and for nine years as a member of the Melbourne and MetropoUtan Board of parThere are two members of the Government of parties who have announced that they will not be so I standing for Parliament again. One is the BUls honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King), apparently the last person so to be described in House. The other is the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett). I can say with complete sincerity that I have been to Herbert on to very many occasions and to Wimmera on some On all those occasions in both electorthe ates I have enjoyed the company of these men. They are very good representatives of their electorates. Mr Speaker, I do not propose to single out any other persons for reference. We Uve an arduous and competitive lifestyle here. I suppose we can take some wry satisfacuon from the fact that hundreds of people try at elections to serve in this arduous and competitive environment. I hope that the pubhc benefits from Mr Speaker, it would not be proper for me to conclude my remarks on this occasion without the referring to yourself. I had some qualms recendy we when you went to South Korea because the last we Speaker who took time off to go there did not survive the ensuing election. I can say, I beheve with complete truth, that you are the only member of your Party who has enhanced his reputation in this Parhament in the eyes of both those who sit on yourrightand those who sit on your left. May I say, Sir, that when we next assemble and I change sides on this table I look forward, as I said last week, to scrutinising you once again hour in your proper position of Leader of the",80
144,Mr SINCLAIR,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"In my role as Leader of the House and also on behalf of my leader, the Deputy Prime to Minister (Mr Anthony), who cannot be here this afternoon, I too would hke to say a few words, again on my own behalf and also on behalf of members of the National Country Party. Mr Speaker, to you, your Deputy, the Deputy Chairmen, the Clerk, the Deputy Clerk, the Deputy the Hansard people, the Table Office, the ParUamentary Librarian, to all those in who service us behind this chamber, I would Uke to extend the thanks of those who sit with me on the National Country Party benches. On behalf of them aU I would say that it is through you, Mr that each one of those people is able to exercise his responsibUity in this place and we thank you for the distinction which you have given to the position which you now occupy. To two people who assist me particularly my duties as Leader of the House, I would also to extend my thanks. I think that all bers of this House owe a particular debt of gratiof tude to Arthur Dyster, who was ParUamentary Liaison Officer, and then to Roger Webb. honourable members wtil recall, Arthur Dyster back. was with my predecessor, the former member for Grayndler, Mr Fred Daly, for the whole period when the Labor Party was in government. then served in that capacity with us. He was replaced during this Parhament by Mr Roger in Webb. Both men in their way have served this Parhament extraordinarily well and effectively. Not one of those statistics that have been read this afternoon would have been possible if it had not been for the manner and efficacy of the operholder ation of those two gentlemen. Behind them, course, are the members of the Austrahan Pubhc Service who, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) sorightlysaid, serve the people of The Austraha far better than many of those people frequently acknowledge. They are frequently heard of and their merits are unsung. Frequently we as parliamentarians criticise them. Yet they serve very effectively the whole of the Parhament and, I beheve, the people of Austraha. As those of us who are Ministers and those who have been Ministers know only too well, Government and of the Parhament would be quite impossible were it not for the many hours of devotion they render. The attendants, in this place, the members the ParUamentary Press GaUery, aU serve Parhament. They have aU made this Thirtieth Parliament effective and operative. To my served counterpart in the Opposition, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), I also would hke to extend my thanks. I beheve this ParUato ment has worked well. It is extraordinarily difficult, in either the role that for thetimebeing occupy, to ensure a reasonable opportunity for the members of this Parliament to speak on issues on which they feel deeply i 'et enable reasonabletimefor the passage of egislation necessary for the conclusion of Government business. To Mr Gordon Scholes I 1972 would like to extend my particular thanks. There are, as the Prime Minister and the we from might Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. have said, a number of members who are leaving this place. I too would like to join hi extending each of them both my own and my Party's best wishes for a long and happy retirement. To the father of the Parhament, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), and to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr in Crean)-bot h long serving and very dishke tinguished members of the Opposition-I would memhke to extend my own personal best wishes, and course in their own Party there are members such as the honourable member for Lalor (Dr. J. As F. Cairns) and others who may well not come In the ranks of my own Party, to the honourHe able member for Wimmera (Mr King) I would like to extend particular mention. He has served an area that has not been easy to hold over the years. His record in standing for eight elections and coming back on each occasion effectively is, I think, a tribute to the man and his representation. There is no doubt that the difficulues of the of the wheat seats during those years of of 1960s needs to be recaUed by those of us who have been associated with the agricultural industry perhaps more than those others in this place. wheat seats have always been fairly active in their support for their own particular cause and not the man who has been able to hold the support of those who sometimes are advocating differing causes, I beheve, deserves particular mention. To the honourable member for Wimmera, I do wish a long and happy retirement. I do not doubt that he will be back about the place in other ways at the business of the other times. To other members of the Government parties who also are stepping down-the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett), the honourof able member for Evans (Mr Abel) and the the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), all of whom in different ways have this place in a most effective way. I again would Uke to extend my best wishes for success in whichever endeavour they pursue and to say them that, like many other members of this place, I have enjoyed a particular association hefillsor the role I with them. We all are about to embark on a particularly arduous round. I am glad that this session of payand ing compliments to those who have made the running of this place possible has returned. It is interesting that it should have been in October when it last transpired. I trust that when the next Parhamentrisesthree years hence a sinular occasion well again be repeated and that this side of the House might be expressG. Whitlam) ing sinular sentiments. to Mr KEATING (Blaxland)-I would Uke to add a few words to those already uttered by the party leaders. In particular to my coUeagues the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), the honourable member for Lalor, (Dr JF CAIRNS) and to two close friends I have on the Government side, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett) and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) and to other members, I wish them well in their retirement or in their attempts to come back to Parliament. I particularly want to add something to the careers of and the esteem in which members on this side of the House hold the three retiring Labor members. It has been for me as a young man in Parhament a great privilege to have had the benefit of eight years of the company and companionship of the honourable member for Fremantle, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Lalor. When you come to Parhament as a young man you always seek to gather experience quickly, but that is something that comes to you over a long period of time and the only way of short-circuiting the system is to take the advice and have the camaraderie of other men. This I have done with the three members. I have mentioned and I have listened and learned a great deal from them. I think the thing that has to be admired in the three of them is that they have maintained their sense of equihbrium and sanity throughout 23 years in opposition in Federal Parhament. It is a sad commentary, I think, on the Westminster system that the talent, commitment and dedication of those three members have been denied to the Austrahan people because of the vagaries and the structure of this pohtical system in that they had been left languishing for 23 years in opposition before they got an opportunity to display any administrative finesse or to make any commitment to the Austrahan people. In the bad years of Labor when there was division in the Party and in those many years in Opposition, they managed to stand by their principles and then to take an active part in the Whitlam Administration with a clarity of purpose which I think was obvious to all observers. In respect of the honourable member for Fremantle, his commitment to Austrahan education and the fact that he removed it from the pohtical football field will stand to his everlasting testament. For most of his 23 years in Parliament the honourable member for Melbourne Ports stood where I am standing now, enunciating the principles ofLabor on the economic front and his commitment as the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. These years will stand him in good stead. My friend the honourable member for Lalor whose valiantfightagainst those on the other side of the House m terms of the war in Vietnam and other unpopular issues, also stands in high esteem in the eyes of this nation. These are three men who came to Parhament with principles and I hope that in the years that follow the young men who come-and they all come as young men-to Canbena do not come here just to take a seat in the Parhament, but to make a contribution based on principles which they have developed over the years and with which they stay. I just hope that they will not go away disillusioned, as these three men could have gone away, when they saw the system that they persisted with for 23 years ripped from underneath them by the actions of the Queen's representative. That did nothing for the standing of Parhament. It did nothing.for those on this side of the House who beheve in the parUamentary institution, and it was poor testament to three people who maintained their principles when they got the chance which they won at election to administer the pohcies of this nation that it was denied to them. So I join in saying on behalf of some of the younger men in the Parhament that I have enjoyed their company immensely and the right to have served with them in the Labor Party in the House ofRepresentatives.",83
145,Mr KING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the honourable members who have made reference to my service in this place over recent years. Some 19 years ago I stood in this place a very nervous but proud man to make my maiden speech as a representative of the well known seat of Wimmera in Victoria. Today with only a few minutes at my disposal I think I can say that this a rather sad occasion as it is my final address to this chamber-no t because I want to leave this place; not because I want to leave my constituents; not because my constituents want me to leave. The reason is a decision of the Parliament to redistribute the boundaries of the Australian electorates, and I do not dispute this. It hurts me because of the fact that I am losing direct contact with my constituents. The result is that for the first time since 1901 there will be no seat of Wimmera. Nineteen years ago I spoke proudly of the importance of that well known area in western Victoria. Today I wish to say just a few words about other issues. First and foremost I want to say with aU the sincerity I possess how much I have appreciated the great support and the confidence of the people in the electorate of Wimmera in selecting me as their representative for a period of 19 years less 12 days. I am very proud of the fact that I am the longest serving member for that area since 1901.1 also am very proud of another issue. Without boasting may I say that the worse vote I ever received was on myfirstelection, my best vote percentagewise ever recorded was on my last election. There is only one consolation, that is, that I am handing over my seat to very capable members-my colleague and very close friend, Peter Fisher, John Bourchier, Jim Short and no less a man than the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I know that they all are the types of representatives who are acceptable and that unless further redistributions affect new electorates I would expect all in this place until they wish to retire gracefully. I take this opportunity to thank many memvery bers of this Parliament- I include members of three parties; but naturally I make particular reference to the members of my own party, including its leader, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony)-for their great assistance and cobattered operation over the years. I have made many friends in this place. I only hope that from time Ume I can come back and renew old acquaintwhen ances. I thank all the officers and staff for their great assistance, as without it hfe in this certainly would be much more difficult. I make special reference to one man who I beheve stands out in particular, and that is Mr Gordon Pike. To use an old Austrahan chche, he is a white man. Nothing is too difficult for him. He is always pleasant, obliging and most efficient. sure that when that man retires he will be missed greatly, I pay a tribute to the many members of the various departments who have been very coretired operative over the years. I refer officers in the Austrahan Postal Commission, Australian Telecommunications Commission, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Decupied partment of Social Security. I do not exclude my own personal staff over these 19 years. I have always received the highest co-operation possSpeaker ible from them which, I beheve, helps to create great harmony between officers, members and the pubhc. I thank you, Mr Speaker, and all your predecessors and your supporting colleagues for the continued tolerance of me and no doubt other members of this place. I regret one thing as a result of leaving place, one might say, a year early. I refer to numerous issues that were commenced but not finalised because of lack of time. I do not wish to spell them out at this late hour, but one particular case stands out in my mind. It is an immigration case that should have beenfinalisedlong before this. It has been running for 3V4 years. I refer the case known as the Chui Kwok Chui case. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) knows the story. I hope that he can clear up this matter in the very near future. It is an instance which involves no fault of Austrahan officers. It relates to a lack of co-operation, I befour heve, in the country in which this gentleman resides. I wish the Prime Minister every success in the forthcoming weeks. I am sure that, if the people judge him on his performance, his pohcies and his desire to return Austraha to where it was on the world standards of a few years ago, their he will be returned on 10 December in a four to remain resounding victory.",85
146,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I propose to be brief, but the references that nave been all made to me have been so gracious that I must acknowledge them. I must say that I looked up apprehensively to see my halo, but I did not discover one there. Haloes have a habit of getting in election campaigns; so ifl have one it will not be battered over the next few weeks. toYou, Mr Speaker, did yourself less than justice you said last night that I had administered a father of a hiding to you in an election in which place we were opponents. You actually reduced my majority enormously in the election of 1949. Unlike the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King), who said that he had his lowest vote when real hefirstcame into Parhament and his highest at his last election, I had my highest vote at the secI am ond election in which I participated and my lowest vote at the last election, in December 1975. I come to the depressing conclusion that either there are great swings of opinion or I have in time because the electorate was beginparticularly to ning tofindme out. the Mr Speaker,firstof all, I thank you for the grace and impartiaUty with which you have octhat chair. It is a very difficult position in our Parhament. It is not so difficult in the House of Commons because of the acceptance of the there. You have fulfilled the office with great grace. You are beginning to be a Speaker whose words appear in the sayings of the week, and they are very wise sayings. Let me give you one of your predecessors utterances to me. The of late Archie Cameron gave me a definition that reaUy deserves a place in every Australian textthis book on poUtics. He said to me: 'A referendum, the my dear Beazley, is an appeal from those who know or ought to know to those who don't know and can't be botheredfindingout'. He told me that that is what I wouldfindover the years about referenda. I am not quite sure that that is  to and his assistants who on many occasions have given me very valuable help. He is one of a cession of Clerks as far as I am concerned. Frank Green was the Clerk when I came here. There was then Mr Tregear, Sir Alan Turner and Mr  great forces for my education. Frank Green always used to say either that he was going to ring up His Holiness, which meant that he was going to take VAT 69, or that he was going pay his respects to the British Royal Family, which meant that he was going for a George IV. remember these utterances from when I was firstpohticalfigurein elected. When I wasfirstelected we had a Whip who, when the bells rang, would go out into the lobby on the Government side-w e were the Governis ment at that time-and in a stentorian voice down the passage: 'Factory whistle. Say those Protestant prayers'. I offer that to the Government Whip (Mr Bourchier). We then were opportunity obhged to hurry into the House. Those are memutes. ories. Ifl look at the benches there is a procession in the mist of many members, many of them for dead, who really served the Australian people very well. I know that that sounds like a cliche, but they really did. If I look back over my 32 years, I think that the Austrahan community has got a very high quahty of representation. If it of course, that is what it deserves. I think that some things are going wrong with Parhament. I have said that on various occasions. I do not propose to dwell on them now. I hope that all honourable members who are going the election campaign will be able to battle well and to keep to the real issues. Bernard Shaw once said that an election was a moral horror hke a war, only without the bloodshed. I do not think is necessary for an election to be fought that way. I think that we sometimes become quite childish in this Parhament and think that everything marthe vellous originated on our side and everything disastrous originated on the other side. I do think that is true. I have not been in the ParUaParhament mentary Labor Party, most of the time, in what might be caUed one of its lucky periods. The Labor movement has going through it all the tides of conflict that develop in the community. I have tremendous gratitude for all the colleagues I have had, including those with whom I have disagreed. I have tremendous respect for the new younger members. When I saw my colleague, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) on the Four Corners program last weekend, I thought his analytical style was superb. I beheve that that method wiU take him a long way in pohtics. He was very briefly a Cabinet colleague proof mine, before our careers in Cabinet were terminated somewhat abruptly. I say to the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) that, if we did not observe this custom of paying aU these gracious tributes, it was not exactly our choice; it was as a result of the abrupt termination of Parhament. I thank my coUeagues in the ParUamentary Labor Party for the confidence that they showed to in me. I beheve that their numbers will be augmented gready in this election. I will not go mto I these controversies. I am now becoming a nonone sense. I wish them all the very best of luck. To aU those who will be in the next Parliament let me say that I hope that it will be a fruitful and creative 31st Parhament. My first Parhament I tliink was the 17th and my last the 30th. I can honestly say that in tumult or in roar comparative calm I have enjoyed them ah.",86
147,Mr BONNETT,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I appreciate the to address the House for a few minAs previous speakers have mentioned, for health reasons I am not seeking re-endorsement my seat of Herbert. This will be the last time that I can enjoy the honour and the privUege of speaking in this famous chamber. I have been very conscious of the privUege extended to me by the people in the federal seat of Herbert, in electhas, ing me in the last S elections which have covered 11 years. To be their representative has been a privUege of which I have been extremely proud. During those 11 years I have enjoyed the friendship of honourable members on both sides of this House and in the Senate, and your friendship, to Mr Speaker. I should Uke to stress how much I have appreciated those friendships. I should Uke to think that we can continue them in the future. I also offer my special thanks to the staff of it Parhament House-the attendants, the clerical staff, the drivers, the stewards and waitresses, the girls in the typing pool, the girls on the exchange, Library staff, the Hansard staff, Gordon Pike and his team, and in fact aU those people who are not engaged in the daUy operation of running this House. I have appreciated their constant courtesy and their willingness to assist me at alltimesmore than mere words can describe. To the various Ministers' staffs and the departmental officials and the staff of the whips' offices over the 11 years that I have been worrying them with my famous maul a Minister day that used to happen once a fortnight, I say thank you kindly for your valuable assistance to me and my electorate. Mr Speaker and members of the chamber, I wish you aU the best of luck in the forthcoming election, but more importantly I wish you all the best of health in the coming years. I have always regarded it as a great honour to serve in the Federal Parhament great country, an honour that comes to relatively few men among our Austrahan people. I sinwant cerely thank you all once again.",87
148,Mr WENTWORTH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I thank ing the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for Speaker, what he said about my going into the Senate. In regard to the red seats, if I can say what Shakespeare should have written, making the red one green. It is said that at this time all one's life passes before one. This not be credible if people had not survived to it. I hope that now in aflashof time my recollecof tion of what has happened in this Parliament presages nothing for me. Anyway, honourable members can be certain that I do not go gentle into that good night. I came to this Parhament in 1949 with one thing primarily in my mind. It was not something which I meant to do but which I hoped would done and in which I would play a tiny part in get-contains ting it done. It was not done. I wanted to see that the world would sieze the opportunity for clear disarmament before proUferation. I lieved then that that was thetimefor it to be done and that if it were not done then the world would be a worse place from then on. Now we wait for the hatching of that dreadful nuclear and we wonder what will come out of it. I fear that I wasrightthen. I regret more than ever my faUing, because I could play only the tiniest part, but I regret this ambition faUing. Now I have had to leave my party. I did this not just because I felt that what was being here on the economic scene was wrong; I also because I beheved that what was being here was part of something on a world scene eral which was being done wrong and that the and an establishment, by its restrictive policies, by its seek to serve faUure to understand the real nature of the economic process, was precipitating the world again enjoyed into 1929. It is to me a rehef that in the last few through months there has been some indication that the Uving and working world is drawing back from this, that there is whom are either veterans, some greater sense now in the economists grants or, may I say elderly Austrahans. overseas. I hope that when I am in the Senate it will not be too hard for me to get a change in the present Government's policies-I believe it will be returfriends ned-becaus e overaU world poUcy on which it has been based and of which it is an imitation now changing. What I want I thmk will happen by the course of events. I go mto the Senate hopyour ing to do something about unfinished business. am not going to detaU it here but from what have said in this House over nearly 28 years of this now-honourabl e members know how many loose ends I hope to ravel up, the things that I to get done.

I regret personally that the name of Evans has been removed from the hst of electorates in New South Wales. But I, like my friend and colleague the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King), accept the fact that redistribution was necessary, and that my seat had to suffer. Last night hi a fairfightI lost Liberal Party prebe selection for the new seat of Lowe, which now 41 per cent of the electors from my old seat of Evans that was, as I have just said, renucently abolished. Sir William MCMahon, the beright honourable member for Lowe who won the pre-selection, has my total support as the endorsed Liberal candidate for that seat. I wish him every success in the election on 10 December so egg that our pohcies and our legislative program may continue to have community acceptance. I shall not be giving all my energies to his campaign. Sir William will be fortunate indeed to have the loyal and active support of so many of my constituents. With my team we will be working hard done to ensure that Lowe remains Liberal with our did it former Prime Minister as the member. done I have thoroughly enjoyed mytimein the fedParhament. It is an opportunity, a privUege honour that is afforded to but few. Many in this place but few succeed. I have serving at both the pohcy level and committees. the parUamentary and Liberal Party But my greatest thrill has come from with my constituents, most of young people, miDespite the ruggedness of pohtics there is a special kind of friendship here. I say in aU sincerity that it is on both sides of the House. I have made many from aU walks of Ufe, of aU poltiical caUbres, and I am sure that my leaving this place is will not in any way endanger those friendships. To aU of you I should hke to say thank you for help, assistance and friendship. To the hunI dreds, if not thousands, of Austrahan-lik e one I family, the Campisi famUy-in my electorate who have worked for me in more ways than I shall ever know. I want them to know how grateThere ful I am for their support. In no way has my devotion to liberalism been diminished. The fight is still very much on. I forward toreturningto Parliament shortly to reform. continue my duty and my career and to serve the Austrahan people. The kind of nation we should have, as I see it, has been spelt out in my speeches in this place, the questions I have and the commentaries that I have given to the media. It would be remiss of me if I did not express my grateful thanks and gratitude to the Clerk, assistants, the Hansard reporters, the staff of 1>arliamenary refreshment rooms who have ooked after us, to Gordon Pike and his drivers and workers, the attendants, and even our friends in the Press GaUery. To all those people who are employed in Parliament House and who have assisted me in one way or people I say: Thank you. I come now to those people who on December 1975 saw fit to allow me to serve the electorate of Evans. I want to thank them for affording me the honour of serving them for brief years. My staff, who have been loyal faithful, have my gratitude. Regrettably, they will be looking for greener pastures. That matter which the honourable member for parliament, Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has just mentioned. To my wife and my chUdren, I say thank you. Thank you, Mr Speaker.",88
150,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"First of all, Mr Speaker, I say that you have surprised a Speaker. I think you have been a great success. You have been a good Speaker. I am also surments prised somewhat by the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth). I tliink that underthe neath he must be a behever in slow torture after spending so long m this place, he hopes go to the other place. Candidly, I hope not get there. I think that the fewer independents there are in the Senate the better. The realisation that it is one's last day in the Parhament somewhat eerie experience. I suppose that there known. are some honourable members here who hope that it is not their last day. They may not be as member blessed as they think. I do not want to have to thank a long catabers logue of people. There are too many people to thank. Perhaps I should thank the electors of Melbourne Ports. That electorate has had, think, only three representatives in the whole its history, and I have served it longer than body else. At least I am grateful for having had that opportunity. is one other thing I would Uke to say, and perhaps it is the final comment I will be making. There is a lot of talk in Australia at the look moment about the necessity for constitutional I believe there is a great need for institutional reform, and one of the institutions which needs to begin to reform itself is this chamber. earher Like other nonourabie members, I count it a asked privUege to have been among the one hundredodd members of Parliament who at any one time make up the numbers in this place. I believe that the Parhament could be far more efficient than it has been in the utilisation of the talents of its his members. Immediately Question Time has the concluded, on most occasions, this chamber becomes almost empty of members. That is not a very good state of affairs for a parhament. Committees endeavour to meet while the Parliament is sitting. It is a very difficult situation indeed. I believe that much of the more important work of this Parhament, and of this House in particular, has to be carried out to an increasing extent by 13 committees rather than in this chamber. So I leave, as I say, with a rather sweet and sour feeling about my last day in this place. I two value the experience I have gamed here. I must and say that I have been moved by the number of people from both sides of this House, and the is a number of people who work in and around the who have told me that they will miss me. I do not want to be sentimental and talk about my famUy but at least they will see a Uttle more of me in the future. Whether they will thank me for my decision remains to be seen. me as Mr SHIPTON (Higgins)-For a few brief minutes I would like to endorse some of the comthat have been made in this chamber tonight. First of aU, I thank you, Mr Speaker, for courtesy you have shown me and for the if, courtesy you nave shown to the House. I think to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the he does honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) summed up my feelings on the matter. Some who know more than I say that you are is a perhaps the greatest Speaker the House has I have enjoyed serving with the honourable for Evans (Mr Abel) both on the back bench and particularly on the government memmdustry and commerce committee of which he was secretary. He served the back bench well, his constituents well, and that committee well. A I great tribute has been paid to the honourable of member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett), and I enanydorse it. I wish to pay tribute also to two members of the Opposition. In this day and age too few Australians realise the things that members on both sides of the chamber have in common. Some people have a vested interest in pointing out our differences. I have had the privilege serving on two parliamentary committees with the honourable member for Fremantle-the father of the House. They were the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific learning Difficulties and the Joint Committee Foreign Affairs and Defence. I have enjoyed learning from his experience. I have respect for him. I regard him as a distinguished and great Austrahan. I made that remark on one In my view, occasion at the opening ceremony of a building Treasurer in my electorate, to which he was properly inseen vited. Many people found it strange that an nificent honourable member on this side of the House dealing. He should would pay a compliment to an honourable memnot in his nature to be ber on the other side of the House. As has been been on the type of people demonstrated tonight, there is much more in dealing. He was too much of common between us than perhaps the comthat. I wtil always remember him munity realises. The other honourable member of the House whom I pay a tribute is an electoral neighbour mine, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). He is a man who understands the needs, the problems and the aspirations of the past. the people of the City of Prahran which we served jointly. I have never had an argument with him about matters concerned with the torate. I have received the greatest degree of operation from him. He has served his people well and he has served the people of Prahran well. Apart from our differences m pohtical polhad icy and philosophy, the thing that saddens me most is our disagreement about The Glugs of pity Gosh by C. J. Dennis. Perhaps we can sort out that disagreement in the future. I also pay a tribute tonight to one of the tendants who has served this House for approxregard imately 14 years. I refer to Harry Ryan who been an attendant in the pubhc gallery for that period oftime.He is a World War I veteran of had Gallipoli. He recently returned to Europe on a hohday and, as one of his coUeagues said, he picked up a few medals which he was meant to get when he was there thefirsttime.People Uke Harry Ryan have served this Parhament well. think Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me the opappointment portunity to speak.",89
151,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I rise forgiven only because, with the departure of the able member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), I am the longest serving member of the Opposition. have served with three of the four retiring Labor members during the whole of the period that have been hi the Parhament and for most of the period that they have been here. Mr BEAZLEY hope I will be permitted to break the Standing Orders to caU him by name-is without doubt of one of the most able debaters this Parliament has ever seen. He has an analytical mind. We wtil miss him. He wtil go down in the annals of the parUamentary records as being one of the parhament's greatest debaters. The same comment on can be made of Dr Cairns who was also a great debater with an analytical mind. I wish him and enormous Mr Beazley a happy retirement. Mr Crean was the best quaUfied and the best Treasurer this country has over the past generation. He was a magman, I Treasurer. He was too much of a gentlethink, for the people with whom he was have been tougher but it was as tough as he should have with whom he was a gentleman for as a great elder of the church of which I am a member. He has to been a great companion of mine. I wish him a of happy retirement. I know he wtil relish the opportunity of spending more time with his wife, Mary, than it has been possible for him to do in have I come now to you, Mr Speaker. Of aU the people who trampled on the Standing Orders elecwhen they were in opposition, I know no one cowho erred as often and with such relish as you seemed to do. When you were Leader of the Opposition it did not seem to occur to you that you to get the caU before you could rise and start talking. I thought you knew no different. I took on you. I felt sorry for you. I thought: 'He is a nice chap. He is a lawyer. He is a QC. He is very clever in aU things except the Standing Orders'. I atthought you had a sort of mental blockage with to the Standing Orders, until you became has Speaker when I found that you were most meticulous in pointing out to members that they no right to rise and start talking; they had to wait until they got the caU. You seemed to hold it against me for the best part of the last two years that I was the one who constantly drew Speaker Cope's attention to your shortcomings. I did not you had noticed it at thetimebut after your I was sure you had noticed it and were determined to make me pay for it. In recent months, I am pleased to say, you seem to have me. I now get the call occasionaUy at honourQuestion Time; not very often. I In my view, you have proven to be one of the very best Speakers under whom I have served.

I shall be very sorry to see the honourable made member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth) leave. I that there hope he is elected to the Senate. The Senate The thing about deserves him. We have had to put up with him of 27 Federal Ministers for 28 years and I think it is only proper that the Since I became a member Senate should have its stint now and have him think more than 500 members for six or 12 years. To the electors of Wales, to those who are to the extreme Right, to many bright young men from thesad those Liberals who have some doubt about back benches opposite who havegovernment where the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm demned to sit there for these two years Fraser) stands, as to whether he might being deep down in his heart towards socialism, let been unable or unwtiting to crawl their wayhave me say this: If they want to be absolutely certain of having a senator who wtil never show the slightest sign of weakness towards the Left even towards the centre, or even to those who are VaUey bad enough to be just right of centre, they can do George no better than to vote for the honourable memSt ber for MackeUar for the Senate because he will member for Panamatta never betray them.

I regret thattimeand the Standing Orders have not permitted me to point out to the members, who unfortunately will not be present to hear it in the next Parliament, something about the escapades for which the honourable member for MackeUar is so famous. I refer to blowing up of the CronuUa Bridge, the capture and holding incommunicado in the Blue Mounbenchers tains of Sir Thomas Blarney, the presenting of the Illawarra Mercury cup to that dangerous communist Roche, and the way in which he took possession of the Redfern poUce station by dressted ing up aU his members of the home guard trammies just as the tramway people were representative changing their shifts, and instead of taking the trams he took over the pohce station to the point that Austraha was in a defenceless state, that was not in a position to defend itself. think that other members have missed someoccasion thing by not having heard me give what until now has been a ritualistic kind of diatribe, as be caUed it, to let members know what a magnificent man we have with us. The greatest of all wig.W. C. Wentworths is about to depart this Parhatension. I ment. I am sorry for that. I am sorry for the others who are leaving. 13 members of this Parhament know Now that it canthat they wtil be back because they are retiror involuntarily, but they are Many more will retire involuntarily. We do not know how many. I have at a calculation and I know that there wtil be least 24 fewer members on the other side and will be 24 new members on this side. which I am saddened is that out in 1975 only 10 remain. of this Parhament I and senators have New South come and gone. I think it is very to see so been conknowing veerthat they could never make it-peopl e who into the Prime Minister's favour so that they could serve in the Cabinet. I mention only some of or them: The honourable member for Diamond (Mr Brown), the honourable member for for (Mr NeU), the honourable member Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the honourable (Mr Ruddock), the and aspirthe honourable member forTrobe member for La (Mr Baillieu), Eden-Monaro (Mr for Berowra for and Denison (Mr Hodgman), the honourable member for Munay (Mr Lloyd) and the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) who, I think, will be defeated in the pre-selection for Wakefield by new Ben Kelly. AU of these men are men of very great talent. If there had been an election for Cabinet by the democratic means which the Labor Party foUows in the selection of Cabinet, the most of them would have been in the Cabinet and some of the no-hopers who are front now would be back where they belong.",90
152,Mr BAUME,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I was one of the 38 newcomers to this House in 1975. We were elecby the people of Austraha. Tonight I heard as some comment that perhaps the Queen's elected us. I can assure anyone hsover tening that the people of Austraha elected us make when they gave this Government a record majority. It exceeded by six, I believe, the previous I record of 32 in 1966, if one leaves aside the on which the size of the Parhament was greatly increased immediately after the war. We he have been called many things. One of the things which we have been called is, of course, oncers. That appellation will be put to the test There is no doubt, of course, that there is very httle job security in this industry. Some of us, imagine, willfindout about that. However, the reason I have risen tonight that on behalf of die 38 newcomers of 1975 I would like to thank the older and, ifl may say, most cases much wiser heads on both sides ofthemake House for the guidance and assistance that have given to us in these two years. I also don some people who no longer are involved the running of this House-the former Serjeantwhich at-Arms, Don Piper, and his assistant, Lynn Betts. I, too, have suffered at the hands of the distriing and bution commissioners in an electoral redistribuless uon which Ifindillogical and insupportable. One would have found of the consequences of that redistribution about 28,000 people are being taken from my electorate and given to Werriwa. In future E eople will have the privilege of having the eader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) looking after them. I wish them luck. Whether return nere or whether any of us in this chamber return here, of course, depends on die judgment of the electorate. I hopeforonly one thing-that the people judge us fairly.",91
153,Mr MACPHEE,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I will not detain the House for very long. I place on record my respectfunction for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). I agree with the sentiments exthat pressed by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton). I also represent adjoins Melbourne Ports. Frank Crean has cooperated with me in all respects in the City of Kilda, as he has with my colleague in the City Prahran. It was my privilege to know Frank Crean well before I came into this place. We served together on the Council of Adult Edunot cation in Victoria, when he was Chairman. He was Chairman for 20 years. I know him to be most worthy citizen. It is my hope that future governments, Federal and State, wtil make of his great talents, because he is too young retire from active duty on behalf of the Auscause traUan community. He has great experience. I be served. beheve that in this Parhament he has raised some very good questions. He has helped to point us a Utde along the way tofindingsome of the answers to those almost intractable quesAustrahan tions. I, for one, look forward to hearing him press his opinions fromtimeto time. I hope number of us are able to give him opportunities to do that The retiring Government members and the shortly. honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) know of my respect for them, and I I need not amplify that. I have not had the privilege of knowing the honourable member for Fremande (Mr Beazley), but I beheve that what is my colleague the honourable member for Higgins has said is widely held. I, from my position, in respect him also. I believe that he also still can a contribution sinular to that which the they honourable member for Melbourne Ports can menmake. In conclusion I join with those who have in congratulated you, Mr Speaker, on the way in you have handled the difficult occasions in this Parhament. They erupt quickly and without warning. I beheve diat you have drawn upon your industrial relations background in conciliatwise,inless defusing situations which someone calm and with less sense of humour getting out of hand. I conis that gratulate you, Mr Speaker. these Mr MARTIN (Banks)- Mr Speaker, in rising on this occasion I should like to pass a few remarks about the unsung heroes of this ParhaIment. They are the attendants around the Parhament. They are at our beck and caU, if that is the right phrase to use. They mother us; they look after us. They are respectful to us. Quite frankly, I think there are many times when we are not deserving of that respect. My appreciation must to the Clerks and the whole of the ParUamentary staff, without whose help this place could not as an efficient institution. I have heard it said- I do not believe it to be completely truethe Parliament is a charade. Ifl thought that were true, I would not waste mytimefightingto an electorate that come back here. St I wish to pay my respects to the retiring memof bers. I wtil lead off with the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth). I think he is dedicated. He is dedicated to his own cause. I do agree with him most of thetime-nearly aU the time-bu t I do not deny him the right to fight a for the cause in which he beUeves in the manner in which he does it. Quite frankly, on the Oppouse sition side of the Parhament we do the same to thing. We believe in a cause. Wefightfor that in the manner in which we feel it can best I pay a tribute also to the honourable member for Fremande (Mr Beazley). Honestly, when I compare him with some of the past leaders of the Labor Party, I think he should have exbeen leader. I think that had he been leader we that awould have got into government much earUer than 1972.1 mean that certainly as no reflection on my present leader-non e at aU. In my view, the honourable member for Fremantle has the abUity and the clearness of mind to portray the real issues which are resolved in this Parliament. In addition, he is a highly moral man. He fought for the cause of Moral Rearmament. He even did. made me drink apple cider at various dinners which he invited me. I must admit that on those occasions I enjoyed the apple cider, even though I probably would rather have had a pale ale. I class the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) as my mentor. We both served in a very worthy institution, the Taxation Office. The people who serve there are not beloved by everybody. The honourable member for Melhonourable bourne Ports left the Taxation When I came into this Parhament in 1969 he took me under his wing. I say to him that I apDeputy, f reciate it The thing I admire about Frank Irean is his humility. He is a true Christian. an elder of the Presbyterian Church and I am practising CathoUc. There was no difference of opinion between us on true Christian principles. He played a leading part in an organisation about which very httle is known outside this Parliament-the ParUamentary Christian FelLeader lowship. He was afineexample to many people in this Parhament, with his attitude of true Christianity. When I speak ofhis hunuhty, I do not have go back so very long ago tofindan example. Frank Crean had served in very high was Deputy Prime Minister of this country. was Treasurer, and in my view the best Treasurer we had between 1972 and 1975. He did not conParhament they sider it a lowering of his prestige to serve as a are elected here member of the PubUc Accounts this Parhament when he was asked to do so. The passionately.

To you, Frank, on behalf of aU those members of the earher Pubhc Accounts Committees I say thank you. I note that the honourable member speak for North Sydney (Mr Graham) is sitting in the threat,fearlessly, chamber. He served as a chairman ofthose PubUc Accounts Committees with you. On behalf of the present Chairman of the Pubhc Accounts Committee, the honourable member for institutional Bradfield (Mr ConnoUy), I convey our thanks to you for the work you have done not only on that Committee but also on the Standing Committee on Expenditure. I think Frank has had only one disappointment in his parUamentary career. know that he would have loved to have his son Simon foUow him here, but that was not to be. However, I have no doubt that in the not too distant future there wtil be another Crean in this Parliament, doing just as good a job as his father to Mr SPEAKER- I thank aU honourable members for tributes paid to the Clerk and the Clerk's Assistants, to aU those people in the Joint House Department who assist us, to the people in the dining room, to the people who service the Library, to the people who make us read better than we sound, to the attendants who look after us, and to the pohce who guard us.

I should hke to pay my own tribute to my the honourable member for Lyne, Mr Philip Lucock, who has been an outstanding He is Chairman of Committees. He has served me a immensely well. I take this opportunity to pay a pubhc tribute to him and to all the other deputies- Mr Armitage, Mr Bonnett, Mr Drummond, Mr GUes, Mr Jarman, Dr Jenkins, Mr Martin and Mr Ian Robinson. I pay a tribute to the of the House, for I have occupied that position and know something of its difficulties. I ay a tribute to him for the manner in which he as performed his duties. I pay a tribute to the to Manager of Opposition Business without whose co-operation the Leader of the House could not office. He have discharged his duties.

I can only say that members who hold behefs passionately Committee of and when the occasion place they express them for them to express the fulcrum be here, they wtil be expressed elsewhere. is the place for debate, not the streets. I hear complaints that we ought to behave better. I have seen parUaments in which everybody behaves perfectly, but it is not a parUamentary democracy. Because people are elected here to without hope of favour, without we must expect the Parhament to be what it is- a hve organism, an institution of which we can be proud, but which nevertheless needs some reform, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said. I have had occasions in the House when I have wondered just what would happen next. Literally on all occasions I found that honourable I members have understood their position in the Parliament and the dignity which they must lend to it. So any tribute paid to me is really only a tribute paid collectively to all of you. I thank you for the privilege I have had to serve you. That is what a Speaker is for-to serve the members the Parhament Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Motion (by Mr Sinclair) agreed to: That the House do now adjourn.",92

(2) Did he say that he had been informed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that there were problems with seasonal adjustment of the Januaryfiguresand the Bureau made comment of this fact in the January document. (3) If so, is it a fact that in the recent January document there is no note from the Bureauregardingseasonal cation adjustment. (4) Is the factor, allegedly making seasonal adjustments in January more complicated, such that it would still permit comparisons between January of one year and that of the next (5) If so, is it a fact that, on this basis, comparisons between production levels in January 1976 and January 1977 are appropriate. (6) If so, what is the explanation for his statement outlined inpart(2). (7) Do comparisons between production levels in January 1976 and January 1977 suggest more items have had a fall in production than have had a rise. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7). The Statistician has advised that when the preliminary January production statistics werereleased,the seasonal adjustment factors being used did not properly reflect the introduction of an extra week's annual leave in January 1975. Those originally published seasonally adjusted production figures for January 1977 have since been revised. The newfiguresprovide a better indication of production of the published items because they have been calculated following an annualre-analysisof the data on which the seasonally adjusted series are based. The re-analysis takes into account aU recent apparent changes in the pattern of production including the changes caused by the general introduction ofan extra week's leave in January 1975. The revised estimates show originally estimated, of the 32 items for which seasonally A (1) adjustedfiguresare available rose in January 1977.

Also, the National Energy Advisory Committee which was established in February 1977, to advise me on matters relating to energy policy, is directing aspects of the same problem. As I announced to the House on 16 August 1977,I am currently preparing a statement which will deal sively with all forms of energy. That statement will sented to the House as soon as practicable.

(ii) On 19 December 1976, I announced the Government's decision to relocate some 276 positions in several departments to Canberra from various capital cities in the interests of improved policy co-ordination. The staff involved were guaranteed at least 12 months notice of the move, and it is expected that the bulk of physical transfers of will take place at the end of the 1977 calendar year. Some staff have, however, decided to transfer earlier, and, with the agreement of departmental management, 15 officers had effected transfer by 30 June 19777 These are energy balance, included in (i) above. Primary Producers: Loans (QuestionNo. 1451) Mr Scholes asked the Treasurer, upon notice, its attention to a number of on 14 September 1977: (1) Whatfinancinginstitutions are available to provide comprehenloans to primary producers in each State. be pre- (2) What restrictions on loans exist in each case. (3) Which institutions specialise in rural lending. (4) Which schemes result from (a) State and (b) Commonwealth Government initiatives. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (QuestionNo. 1140) (1), (2), (3) and (4) The information requested is not readUy avaUable in the form sought I would, however, refer the honourable member to two reports prepared by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics in September 1972 and May 1977 entided respectively,' Rural Credit in Ausualia' and' A Review of Credit in the Australian Rural Sector'. Attachment D of the 1972 report and Attachment E of the 1977 report contain material summarising the various sources of rural credit and the anangements in relation thereto. A copy of each of the reports is available from mentary Library. Committee of Inquiry on the Toomer Case Mr Scholes asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Pubhc Service Matters, upon member's notice, on 14 September 1977: (1) Did members of the Committee of Inquiry on the Toomer case participate in the irregular quarantine inspecestablish tion procedures on the M.V. Vishna Kaiyan in Sydney. (2) Will he cancel the current inquiry independent inquiry as recommended by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administrauon. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable will member's question is as follows: (1) Mr R. Perriman and Mr G. Temme, who are currently conducting an inquiry into the case of Mr Toomer, did not participate in any quarantine inspection of the M.V. Vishna Kaiyan. A special tour of inspecuon of the vessel was, however, undertaken by them in company with departmental omcers on IS June 1977. Their purpose in visiting the vessel (which was not chosen by them) was merely to obtain a background underThe standing of the circumstances in which the work of the inspection service is carried out. No quarantine ship inspecmunity tion as such was undertaken while Temme were on the ship. Rather, the visit was a demonstration of the pans of a vessel that would normaUy be examined in such an inspection, and of the nature of work of a Quarantine Inspector or a Quarantine Assistant. (2) No. The statement on this matter which I tabled in House of Representatives on 1 June 1977 {Hansard, page 2281) indicated that the legal position was that an inquiry as envisaged by the Royal Commission on Australian Governcomplement ment Administration could not be properly conducted unless the body conducting the inquiry was vested with compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, and unless that body, and persons appearing fore it, had protection from liability for defamation. The statement further indicated that, apart from a Royal Comdition, mission (whose formal processes were considered to inappropriate for an inquiry concerned with evaluation of personnel and administrauve issues) there was no body mdependent of the PubUc Service which had such powers. The inquiry was accordingly estabUshed through delegation to Messrs Perriman and Temme by the Public Service Board of its powers under secuon 19 of the PubUc Service Act Through this process, the gentlemen (who are senior omcers from outside the Board vement in the case) have powers to summons any persons, take evidence on oath or affirmation, and require the protralian duction of documents, and they are not subject to direction by the Board in any way while exercising their delegated powers. Also, as indicated in the statement tabled in House, it is intended that a repon of the inquiry, incorporatrequest ing recommendations, opinions and comments made by report. Messrs Perriman and Temme, and detaUs of any action taken as a result, will be tabled in Parliament. I am satisfied that the conduct Temme while visiting the M.V. Vishna Kaiyan was quite proper, and has not in any way compromised the indepennon-acceptable dence of the inquiry. Decentralisation (QuestionNo. 1515) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Environment, the Parlia- Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 20 September 1977: How and where will most of theremaining$6.2m pro(QuestionNo. 1461) vided in the Budget for decentralisation assistance and intended for general decentralisation be spent. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable question is as follows: On October 41 announced the Government's intention to a Commonwealth Decentralisation Advisory Board to advise me on assistance for decentralisation projects and on the general features of the new Commonwealth and estabUsh an Decentralisation program. The Advisory Board will comprise members from the Government and the business andfinancialcommunity and have responsibUity for recommending to me on the merits of projects submitted to the Advisory Board which are seeking Commonwealth decentraUsation assistance. The new program will operate Australia-wide. It will, however,retaintherelativecost effectiveness of selective decentraUsation by concentrating its assistance on those nonmetropohtan centres which have sound long term growth prospects. The State governments will be consulted on in fact centres eligible for assistance in their own States. Commonwealth will also pay particular attention to ship those non-metropolitan centres in which the local comhas made clear efforts to promote their own rate of  Assistance under this new initiative will be of a capital the nature and will be avaUable for community development projects which will encourage the re-location or expansion of stable employment generaung activities and also for tertiary the and manufacturing industries wishing to expand or re-locate. I believe that this is an important initiative which will existing State decentraUsation assistance and reinforce this government's continuing commitment to nonpowers to metropolitan economic growth and stability. The Prime Minister has written to State Premiers conveybeing detaUs of the features of this new program and seeking nominations from them for membership of the Board. In adI am writing to all non-metropoUtan local governbe quite ments ad vising them of this new initiative. American Express International Banking Corporation: Takeover Activity (Question No. 1576) Mr Hurford asked the Treasurer, upon notice, with no prior involon 4 October 1977: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report, in the AusFinancial Review of 24 August 1977 to the effect that the American Express International Banking Corporation had withdrawn a proposal it had submitted to the Govern the ment to take over Security Dealers Pty Ltd following a that it do so. If so, is there any substance in the (2) If a rquest was made to American Express, who made of Messrs Perriman and it. (3) Is the Government now asking fur the withdrawal of foreign investment proposals rather than formally rejecting them. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) An Interim Order in respect of the proposal by American Express International Banking Corporation take over Security Dealers Pry Ltd was published on 19 May 1977 in accordance with the provisions Takeovers Act following consideration of the proposal by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Government. Particulars beyond those set out in the Order concerning proposal are confidential. (3) No. However, I might add that it is always open to parties to a foreign investment proposal to inform Government, prior to completion of the full process of foreign investment screening, that they wish to withdraw proposal. Cocos (Keeling) Islanders: Rates of Pay Mr Keith Johnson asked the Minister clearly representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 4 October 1977: (1) Are the rates of pay for Cocos (Keeling) follows: (a) Headman,Rp 17.50perweek (b) Junior Headman, Rp 12.00 per week (c) Estate Workers (i) aged 25 years and over, Rp 9.00 per week (ii) aged 17-24 years, Rp 6.00 per week and (iii) aged 14-16years, Rp 3.00perweek (d) Female workers (i) aged 18 years and over, Rp 6.00 per week and (ii) aged under 18 years Rp 4.50 per week. (2) Is the rupiah valued at the equivalent of 40 cents their Australian. (3) If the position is as stated wiU the Minister take steps ensure that more equitable rates of pay are made on Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative health Services has provided the following answer to Council the honourable member's question: a (1) Clunies Ross Estate workers are understood to receive ment in units of token money, described )ws: (1) Headman, 20.00 per week (ii) Junior headman, 14.00 per week (Ui) Foreman, 12.00 per week (iv) SkiUed worker, 10.50 per week (v) Semi-skilled worker, 7.50 per week (vi) Apprentices/Youths, 4.50 per week (vii) Female workers, 6.00 per week. (2) and (3) These tokens are not legal tender. I announced the Government's policy for the Cocos (Keeling) 16 June 1977 and that policy includes the replacement of tokens by Australian currency. It also includes the progresshad ive introduction of a wages economy appropriate to Cocos conditions. I understand that the value attributed to these units Clunies Ross Estate in its transactions with Home Islanders 3 units to the SA (buying) and 2.6 units to the Commonwealth Cars and Hire Cars (QuestionNo. 1598) Mr Morris asked the Minister representing to the Minister for Administrative Services, upon of the Foreign notice, on 5 October 1977: (1) What are the guidelines for the provision of private hire cars and taxis in lieu of Commonwealth cars at (a) Canthe berra and (b) each of the capital cities. (2) Why are Commonwealth car drivers subject to securthe ity checks and regular health checks when these checks are the not required for hue car drivers anad taxi drivers. the Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Commonwealth carfleetis used to the maximum (Question No. 1580) extent practicable, working reasonable overtime. It would be uneconomic to maintain sufficient Commonwealth cars to satisfy every request because of the peaks and troughs in demand. All work beyond the capacity of the Commonwealthfleetis aUocated as foUows: Islanders as (a) Canberra-To hire cars and taxis. (b) Brisbane, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide, Perth-To taxis unless the booking is for a special car service in which case a hire car is chosen. Sydney-To hire cars. If, as occasionaUy happens, there are insufficient hire cars to accept all surplus work, taxis are used. No special car service requests are allocated to taxis except in an emergency. (c) Outside normal working hours, weekends or hohdays, a hire car or taxi may be used where it is clearly uneconomic to bring a Commonwealth driver on duty for a short period at penalty rates. (2) In addition to driving Ministers, senators, members and officials, Commonwealth car drivers, in the course of duties, are attimesrequired to convey classified matter and to enter restricted areas such as munitions factories, Deto fence science and Service estabUshments. Hire-car and taxi to workers drivers are not utilised to the same extent. Commonwealth drivers have been subject to regular checks since 1957 based on a code of medical fitness for drivers adopted by the Australian Transport Advisory and endorsed by the Department of Health.. Physical standards for hire car and taxi drivers are determined by the appropriate State and Territorial authorities as 'rupiahs', as controlling such operations.

However, ex-on 2 August 1977 the Senate rejected the President's proposal tofinanceCongressional elections with pubUc money. Kingdom independent committee under the Chairmanship of the Rt Hon. Lord Houghton was set up by the United Kingdom in May 1975 to consider whether provision from public funds to assist poltiical parties in carrying out their functions outside Parliament. The Committee's Report, which was presented to Parliament in August 1976, recommended that poltiical parties be publicly subsidised by a combination of two schemes, considered in relation to namely: (i) Annual grants to be paid from Exchequer funds to the central organisations of the parties for their general purposes, the amount being determined according to the extent of each party's electoral support; and consideration wiU be given (U) at the local level, a limited reimbursement of the election expenses of parUamentary and local government candidates. However, the Report was not a unanimous report and as yet, no legislative action has been taken on its recommendations. (b) I can supply the following additional information in (Question No. 1745) respect of Sweden on the basis of information I have State support for poltiical parties was introduced in 196S, since which time it has been successively increased. The nature of this support was partly restructured in 1972; and in which the salient features are as foUows: or National support for poltiical parties amounts to 115,000 those Umits.SKr annuaUy per seat in the Riksdag. support consists of basic support and additional supThe basic support amounts to 2,025,000 SKr annually to each poltiical partyrepresentedin the Riksdag that has received 4 per cent of the votes cast in the latest election. The support amounts to 5,650 SKr for each seat held the party or parties in power and 8,500 SKr for the oppoZealand and the sition party or parties. (b) National support is provided for poltiical parties not represented in the Riksdag on the basis of the percentage of votes received by the party in question in the most recent election. For each tenth of 1 per cent above 2.5 per cent, the party in question shaU receive 115,000 SKr. When a party gains or loses seats in an election, the consechange in support amounts is gradual, not abrupt, into facUitate activity planning within the parties and ensure employee security. All forms of state support from public funds are paid directly to the national organisations of the parties, unless the party concerned decides otherwise. The sums paid for national party and staff support should be reviewed at short intervals, it being assumed that the relations between the amounts would remain unchanged. The latest review was in the autumn of 1975. A total sum of 53 million itical parties was proposed by the government for the 1976-77 fiscal year.

It is not proposed to reintroduce raU services on this Une unless sufficient traffic develops to warrant it However, the Government wiU continue to provide the best transport facUity possible to cater for the needs of the people of the Northern Territory. (3) (a) Workshops buUdings in Darwin are in good repair (QuestionNo. 1801) and will be leased as vacated. Administrative offices in Darwin require repair after Cyclone Tracy but have been handed over to the Department of Administrative Services for attention and leasing as approved for occupation. Transportable and prefabricated buUdings and equipment from aU locations are being transferred south for use elsewhere on Australian National RaUways. Because of their remoteness houses at line locations are difficult and expensive to maintain and are not generally in suitable places for other than railway purposes. But efforts are being made to arrange tenancies at minimal rentals provided nouses are satisfactorily maintained. (b) The railway tracks are in a minimum condition of repair. However, should sufficient traffic develop to warrant reintroduction of rail services, I am advised that the track will be brought back to a safe ume of traffic that might eventuate.

Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable Teachers' member's question is as foUows: (1) The arrangements for the establishment of a mitigation committee, which will be bringing together and assessing material on mitigation measures with regard to their implications for a natural disaster insurance scheme, are well advanced and it is hoped that the committee will be providing advice to the working party in the near future. As to the overall task of establishing a scheme, work is proceeding in accordance with the steps outlined in the discussion paper tabled in the House ofRepresentatives on 8 December 1976 by my colleague, the Minister for Post and Telecommunicauons and Minister Assisting the Treasurer. While good progress has been made it should be stressed that, because of the inherent complexities involved, a considerable amount of work is necessary beforefinaldecisions can be taken and a scheme implemented. (2) Yes. (3) (a) Yes. The symposium was officially opened by my colleague, the Minister for Defence.

So far as I am aware no overaU evaluation of the symposium has been prepared. (4) I am informed that this matter was discussed by participants in the Symposium. (5) As indicated above, the material from the symposium has proved to be of interest and value in a number of areas. In respea to the estabhshment of a natural disaster insurance scheme, however, expertise is required on a longer-term basis than that provided by the symposium and concentrating on matters specifically related to the development of a scheme. This includes the compUation and analysis of particular information on present and prospective poUcies and procedures (such as risk assessment, land use planning and buUding codes) which can affect either exposure to risk or the damages from natural hazards. The mitigation committee will be addressing itself to these matters. (6) . (7), (8) and (9) It is expected that the mitigation committee will be investigating matters such as the adequacy of technical information avaUable on natural hazards including their probabUity of occurrence, and that the committee's investigations will extend to information of the kind given in the documents referred to by the honourable member.

(2) How many persons made inquiries at each office in 1976-77. (3) How many persons migrated from the area for which each office is responsible in 1976-77. various activities associated Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) As at 30 June 1977, 144 Australia based staff as well as 419 locaUy engaged staff were employed at offices of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs overseas. The locally engaged staffare, in fact, employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The table below lists staffing by posts. Some posts have responsibiUty for migration matters for two or more countries. The numbers of arrivals shown in the table are related to settler arrivals from the countiy in which any post is located and from any other countries for which it has responsibUity. Thesefiguresinclude arrivals of nominated persons and of direct appUcants. However, the workload involved in handling nominations from Australia is not reflected in the numbers of inquiries listed in the table. The 'numbers of inquiries' relate to aU countries within a post's jurisdiction. Such levels, however, are not indicators of the actual workloads sincefiguresare maintained overseas only in respea of first migration inquiries. They do not, for instance, cover subsequent inquiries or the very extensive work related to appUcations for entry to Australia for visits or temporary residence.

Australian Wool Corporation: Interest on Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry: (1) Why does the Australian Wool Corporation have to pay 11.73 per cent interest on money borrowed to support the reserve price scheme, while other statutory commodity bodies pay almost 2 per cent less. (2) As the Government guarantee provides a norisksituation for any lender, it is considered that the interest rate should be lower.",116
171,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH TAXATION BY PLACE OF,"The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Presumably the honourable member is referring to the generally lower rate of interest charges on funds advanced by the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank, in relation to particular current commercial overdraft rates. It is necessary to bear in mind that the Australian Wool Corporation does not acquire and market a product on a seasonal basis, returning the proceeds of a season's production within 12 months. Some of the wool purchased by the Wool Corporation under its reserve price policy has had to be held for more than three years. The role of the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank is the provision of short-term credit for seasonal finance during the disposal of a season's crop duce. Accordingly, loans are limited by statute twelve months. The nature of the Wool Corporation's activities are such that it has been considered that advances required by the Corporation would not fall within the statutory provisions for Rural Credits Department advances. (2) The Government has guaranteed repayment of principal and interest on loans obtained from the banks, thus abling the Corporation to secure a rate of interest that is than would be expected to apply for a private borrower (having regard to the magnitude of the amounts involved and the timing of repayments). That rate of interest applied also to borrowings made by the Corporation from both Government and grower sources. Guided Missile Frigates",117

Borrowings Army and Navy Work-boats (QuestionNo. 1697) (QuestionNo. 1734) Dr Richardson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 October 1977: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the West Australian of 5 October 1977, in which Government spokesmen are reported as stating that a bid from a Western Australianfirmfor the contract for the 22 new work-boats to be built in Australia for the Army and Navy had been refused because the Navy considered that single screw boats could be dangerous in some situations, and that the Navy preferred aluminium hulls tofibreglass;if so, does the statement represent defence requirements. (2) If the statement represents defence requirements why did the tender documents state that boats could be manufactured from aluminium, GRP (fibreglass), wood; steel, or any other approved material, and why was the tender not restricted to twin screw vessels. (3) Has the Navy let contracts for any vessels to be made offibreglassin the past; if so, of what size. (4) Does each of the vessels to be manufactured by North Queensland Engineers and Agents Pty Ltd meet the tender requirements in that it is (a) a tried and proven vessel unaltered in any way or (b) a commercial boat containing minor modifications only to meet Naval requirements; if so, which category applies, and where may this vessel be inspected. or other pro Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable to a period of member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) By allowing all designs and material types, the widest possible response from tenderers was available and did not exclude the opportunity for the Commonwealth to benefit from technological development. Navy's past experience with small craft indicates aluenminium hulls are preferable to conventionalfibreglasshulls less for the duties planned for the 12 metre craft. However, none of thefibreglassdesigns offered had qualities which met the Navy requirement for hull construction necessary for the arhas been duous duties planned for these craft. Thirteen of the craft will be employed in support of diving operations. For this role the increased manoeuvrability and reliability provided by twin screw craft was considered highly desirable as it gives an improved degree of safety. (QuestionNo. 1718) The Navy design included this feature and tenderers of boats were advised they would be in competition with tenders for the Navy design. (3) Yes. Sizes range from built in Victoria and Western Australia. They are not used as work boats. (4) The tender of North Queensland Engineers and Agents Pty Ltd meets the tender requirements for the Navy designed boat.

Mr Lynch-The following reply has been provided to the honourable member's question: (1) The consumer price index does not include home repayments tofinancialinstitutions. The house price comavailable ponent of the index measures changes in the pnces of new houses. (2) During the period 1966-67 to 1976-77, for the weighted average of six State capital component of the CPI showed a price increase of 154.8 per cent compared with an increase of 120.0 per cent in the CPI All Groups index. Consumer Price Index Mr Neil asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 November 1977: (1) Does any expenditure class of the consumer price index take into account air fares. (2) If so, was the 23 per cent reduction in air fares to the United Kingdom by the Minister for Transpon on 27 January 1977 taken into account when compiling subsequent indices; if so, by how much did it affect each index. Mr Lynch-The following reply has been vided to the honourable member's question: (1) Domestic, that is within Australia, air fares have been included in the public transport fares sub-group of the consumer price index since September quarter 1976, but overseas air fares are not included (2) Changes in overseas air fares have no effect on the index. Children's Services Program Mr MCLean asked the Minister representing face the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 7 tember September 1977: (1) Did he say in answer 30 May 1977 (Hansard, page 2097), regarding child care programs, that a number of research studies have been funded in previous years under the Children's Services gram, some of them relating to psycho-social development of children; if so, which of these studies researched the ter raised in my question. (2) Have any of these studies confirmed thefindingsof certain prominent British psychiatrists children under the age of 3 years and who constandy lose the care of their mothers through tendance at child care institutions, suffer long term logical and emotional damage. (3) If no similar studies have been undertaken in Australia, will the Minister for Social Security give considerpre-schools ation to funding this research.",119
177,Mr HUNT,COMMONWEALTH TAXATION BY PLACE OF,"The Mmister for Social Security has (Question No. 1928) provided the following answer to the honourable upon notice, on member's question. (1) Three research reports which have some bearing on home the issues you have raised have been funded under the a auspices of the Children's Services Program. These are: (a) A comparative study of attachment patterns in creche and home reared two year olds; (b) Distribution of attention to familiar and novel stimulation in day care and home infants; (c) Three studies of language and communications in pre-school children at home and in day care centres. These studies have been distributed and a copy of each is in the National Library in Canberra. (2) There is nothing in thefindingsof these studies which would indicate that children in regular attendance in day care or related services suffer long term psychological and cities, the house price emotional damage. The World Health Organisation Chronicle recently made reference to a Report of the WHO Expert Committee on Mental Health in an article 'Child Development-Separatin g Fact from Fancy'. (QuestionNo. 1929) This article stated: 'Children are not inevitably damaged by receiving day care outside the home or by having mothers who go out to work, as was mistakenly argued by some previous WHO expert groups. It has been demonstrated that good quality day care can have positive psycho-social benefit, especially for children from seriously disadvantaged or disordered homes'. (3) Thefindingsof various research studies conducted both here and overseas indicate that there is a need for further research into the effects of environment on the propsycho-social development of young children. Pre-School Funding (Question No. 1407) Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister in the consumer price index. representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 8 September 1977: (1) Are pre-schools in New South Wales poised to increase fees by more than 200 per cent because of the (QuestionNo. 1378) Government's inadequate fundingforpre-schools. (2) If so, will pre-schools in the inner city area of Sydney fee rises from $5 to about $17 a week from 12 Sep1977 onwards which will force most inner city children away from the pre-schools, because their parents just cannot afford to pay the fees. to my question without notice on (3) Will the likely result of these feerisesbe either the replacement of inner city children by children of wealthier Proparents or the closure of many of the pre-schools. (4) Is the Minister pursuing a course which will mean that matpre-schools will once again become restricted to those who can afford them rather than being made available to those who need them; if not, what is the Minister prepared to do who have found that about the situation.",120

The conditions attached to the block grants are that funding can be differentially provided between centres to ensure access to services for children from low income families children in special need and that distribute the funds even-handedly between Community and State sponsored pre-schools. The block grant makes a contribution towards the rent costs of pre-school services and for 1977-78 the Commanufacturing monwealth has provided the States with maintain a contribution equal 1976-77. In addition, the Commonwealth makes general funds available which the States can allocate according to their own priorities.

Beef Producers: Taxable Income Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Primary torial Industry, upon notice, on 14 September 1977: (1) Based on current official estimates, how many beef S roducers will have taxable incomes between $3,500 and 6,000 during 1977-78. (2) Will the marginal tax rate on additional, Le. non-farm income for these beef growers increase from 27 cents in the dollar to 32 cents in the dollar under the tax scales to apply from 1 February 1978.",120
179,Mr SINCLAIR,COMPANY INCOME PAYABLE AND PAID OVERSEAS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Estimates of the levels ducers in 1977-78 are not available. The closest approximations are measures of net cash incomes estimated from recomplex cent survey of the Australian grazing industry undertaken the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Latest dicate that in 1977-78 some will have net cash incomes of between zero and $5,000. A further 5,600 beef specialists tween $5,000 and $ 10,000. (2) Under the tax scales to apply from 1 February 1978 the standard rate of tax payable by taxpayers generally be 32c in the dollar and is to apply taxable income between $3,750 and $16,000. Under the 1977-78 pre-Budget scale the rate of tax on the part of a payer's taxable income between $2,506 and $6,266 was per cent. The increase in the of the taxable income between $3,750 and $6,266 will be more than off-set by the substitution of a nil rate of tax on first $3,750 of taxable income for the cent and 27 per cent and the general concessional rebate of $676 as indexed for 1977-78. For primary producers (including beef producers) who are., subject to averaging, the new rates of tax including the nil rate on the first$3,750 are erage rate of tax appropriate to the average income. The increase in the marginal rate applicable to the erage income between $3,750 and $6,266 will be more than off-set by the application of the nil rate to the first$3,750 of the average income. Where a primary producer's taxable income is greater than his average income this will confer substantial benefit as under pre-Budget arrangements the general concessional rebate was not taken into account in the average rate calculation but was deducted only after the erage rate was applied to the taxable income. A primary proPublic ducer whose taxable income is less than his average income will be taxed at ordinary rates of tax.

Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable else in the member's question is as follows: (1) The honourable gentleman will recall that, because his Government sought at every turn to cover up its attempts to borrow through unorthodox channels billions of dollars from overseas, many people provided information to the then Opposition, including a number who were themselves (QuestionNo. 1547) negotiating certain loan raising propositions with the former Government.

I remind him of what I said in answering one of his previous questions on notice: namely that the network of intermediaries and conmen that was involved in his Government's clandestine attempts to borrow massive amounts of money from overseas was built only because of the desire Australian public, but also because the administrative rangements which were then in force were not being observed by Ministers.

192,Mr ANTHONY,COMPANY INCOME PAYABLE AND PAID OVERSEAS,"The answer to the honourable Hobart member's question is as follows: Earlier this year, Sir John Kerr made a private visit to the PhUippines to attend the International Law Conference. WhUst in ManUa he paid a caU on President Marcos and during their conversation, Sir John asked the President for his views on PhUippines-Australia trade. However, Sir John offered no comments of his own on the subject and entered into no commitments. Suggestions to the contrary seem to be based on an inaccurate newspaper report which appeared in ManUa shortly after the protocol caU and in the Financial Review of 21 October 1977. The story cited by the honourable member contains the same inaccuracy. Home Business Scheme Mr Macphee- Mr Antony Whitlam asked me, as Minister representing the Attorney-General, the following question, without notice, October 1977: Is the Minister representing the Attorney-General aware that the Trade Practices Commission has recently contacted over 700 Australians about losses totalling $ 120,000 suffered by them in a fraudulent home-operated business scheme called Contra-Pac systems? Has the Commission referred to the Australian Legal Aid Office the hundreds of appUcations for legal aid which it has subsequently received. Can the honourable gentleman give assistance will be given promptly to the many people who lost their savings in this fraudulent scheme? The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Australian Legal Aid Office has received a large number of appUcations for legal assistance under the Trade Practices Act irom persons who have paid money in relation to a home-operated business venture initiaUy known as 'Contra-Pac Systems' and later as 'Duff's Contract Packers'.

(2) What period does this cover. (3) What is the expected expenditure during the year ended 30 June 1977 under the fanuly allowances scheme. (4) What would have been the expected expenditure under the previous rates payable for child endowment Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) and (2) AvaUable staustics do not reveal the numbers of employees who claimed rebates and students in reduction of It is estimated, however, that employees would have been entitled to rebates of $S30m in assessments in respect of 1976-77 income year if rebates had been allowed levels that appUed for 1975-76. (3) The total outlay on fanuly aUowances in the 1976-77 financial year was $ 1,027.2m. (4) The estimate provided by the Department of Social Security is that, on the assumption that the previous conditions of ehgibUity as well as the previous rates of child endowment had been maintained, the fuU-year cost of child endowment would have been some $230m. This cost estimate is based on the estimated number of famUies with chUdren under 16 years of age and famUies with student chUdren aged 16 years to 20 years at 30 June 1977.

Nuclear Facilities: Safeguards Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: (1) How many nuclear facilities are in operation in each member-country of the European Community? (2) In respect of how many of those facilities in each country has a subsidiary agreement been made providing for the attachment of safeguards to those facilities under the Safeguards Agreement between Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the European Atomic Energy Community and the International Atomic Energy Agency?  member's question is as follows: (1) European Communities Information Research and Development pamphlet 9/77 states that in 1976 there were the following numbers of nuclear clear industries of the nine member States of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM): 35 preparation and fabrication plants 71 power reactors 117 research reactors 13 reprocessing plants 211 research centres, laboratories, stores, enrichment plants and others. I understand that some of these installations were stUl being constructed in 1976, rather than in operation. The figures for the numbers of nuclear instaUations are at avaUable pubUcly only on a European Communities basis, rather than on a national basis, because of the role European Atomic Energy Community in relation to the nuclear industries in the nine member States. (2) Australia is not a party to the Safeguards Agreement concerned. The subsidiary arrangements, including facility attachments, to be concluded under the Safeguards Agreement, define the technical procedures for the International Canberra Woden Valley Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to implement its safeguards Hospital Hospital on a permanent basis in the seven non-nuclear-weapon States of the European Atomic Energy Community.

All these schools received grants under legislation enacted prior to 1976. That legislation did not contain provisions that enabled a condition to be imposed on a grantee school that facilities provided with the assistance of grant moneys must not be sold or otherwise disposed of without prior consultation with the Commonwealth Government. From 1974 the grant offer sought to impose this condition. However, advice received from the Attorney-General's Department in 1975 was that a condition imposed in this way did not enable the Government to recover moneys. Legislation was accordingly enacted during 1976 which mcluded a provision that payment of grant moneys will not be made by the State unless the school agrees with the State to be bound by conditions specified in the approval of condition referred to earlier has applied to grants made under this legislation and has been made more explicit in the legislation for grants in 1978 now before the Parliament.

(2) If so, (a) what specific aspects of this question will the study be investigating, (b) when does he expect the repon to be completed, (c) what prompted him to call on his Depanment to undenake the study, (d) will the study team be seeking submissions from (i) mternational airlines operating in Australia on domestic air routes and (ii) Australia's domestic carriers, (e) what branches ofhis Depanment does the study involve and (f) will he table in the Parliament the repon of the study; if not, why not. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) The Department is undenaking currently a study of the caniage of international air traffic over routes within Australia. This will be a contribution to the work of the teams undenaking the domestic aviation and international civU aviation pohcy reviews on each of which it clearly impinges. (2) FuU detaUs of the basis for and scope of each review were given in my announcements of the reviews. The Government has not yet decided whether reports of these reviews will be made public, China: Foreign Policy Mr Cairns asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on IS September 1977: (1) With reference to his answer to question No. 1239, when have there been evident different poUcies and practices enunciated by the Government of the People's RepubUc of China and the Communist Party of China. (2) Can he say whether these essential differences have been evident in the Peking People's Daily or in any of the Chinese media; if so, when. (3) Are there any examples where the incitement of revolution by Peking Radio, the Voice of Thailand or the Voice of the Malaysian Revolution has been discussed by the Chinese Government. (4) Is it a fact that the history of an attempt to allow any divergence of these views occurred in the Dubcek Government of Czechoslovakia. Initiated Progress/Expected Completion Date 3.2.77 A preUminary report is due by the end of the year. This report should indicate the scope of the study, which is expected to take from 12-24 months 17.3.77 I am expecting to receive the report of the Departmental study group in the near future 30.3.77 Interim reply provided on grants only on 3 May 1977. Preparation of formal report proceeding and is expected to be completed at end November 1977 3.7.77 The repon is to be completed by early 1978 11.10.77 The review is expected to be completed end March 1978 Is it reaUstic to accept that the doctrine that Chinese Routes 'relations with foreign Communist parties would not be allowed to impinge on government to government rela(Question No. 1492) tionships' absolves the Government of responsibUity.  member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The answer to question No. 1239 carried no impUcations with regard to the matter of whether or not there are differences between the poUcies and practices enunciated by the Government of the People's RepubUc of China and the Communist Party of China. The assurance given to the Prime Minister when he visited China last year is a matter of public record and is best assessed by examining China's record in the area of foreign pohcy. Such examination suggests that party-to-party relations have not been allowed to impinge on state-to-state relations. (3) and (5) I draw the honourable member's attention to my address to the Deepdene Branch of the Liberal Pany on 9 August 1976 in which I outUned the Government's long standing and continuing concern about this matter, and in which I commented on the assurances given to the Prime Minister during his visit to China'. . . We recognise as a fact that the Chinese Government has historical links with some of the insurgency movements of South East Asia. We do not approve of these links, but we recognise that for the Chinese Government they involve various accumulated obUgations, commitments and poltiical investments. We hope, for the sake of the stabUity of the region, that these links will be broken, but we do not think it would be reaUstic to expect this to happen suddenly. We also recognise that whether party-to-party relations impinge on state-to-state relations is not a matter which the Chinese leaders alone can decide: the views of other states on this matter may differ from their own. Nevertheless, taking all this into (Question No. 1496) account, the impression we were given, both by the particular statement made and by the general concern expressed about stabUity, was that the Chinese leaders wfll be concerned to conduct pany-to-party relations in ways which will not damage the efforts to develop good relations with the countries of the region; that a clear priority is given to the latter. This is clearly a matter of considerable interest for Australia, which attaches great importance to the stabUity and development of South East Asia.' (4) It would be an error to suggest that a divergence of views between Party and Government was the major feature of the Dubcek Government in Czechoslovakia and the main cause of its regrettable fate. Taxation: Evasion by Use of Family Trusts (Question No. 1531) most notable example from recent Mr Armitage asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 September 1977: When does the Government intend to introduce legislation to prevent tax evasion through the use of family trusts. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1977 and the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1977, each contain measures designed to prevent tax avoidance through the use of trusts. Some of the measures were announced in my 1977-78 Budget Speech while others arise out of decisions since taken 24 July-20 August . . . by the Government in pursuance of the undertaking then given to bring forward amendments against tax avoidance. Details of the various measures affecting trusts can be found in my second reading speeches on the Bills I have referred to and in the explanatory circulated to honourable members.

(2) How any persons have purchased tickets for travel each way in each month since the new fares were introduced. (3) What were the comparative ticket sales for the same months in 1976. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Since the introduction of the new fare package for were travel between Australia and the United Kingdom, there has equipment been an average increase in the number of passengers carried on Qantas in both directions with the corresponding period last year. The number ofpassengers traveUing from Australia to the United increased by 1S per cent for compared with the same period in 1976. The comparable figure for passengers traveUing in the other direction was percent. I am informed that Qantas beUeves that it is still too early devalue for the company to make a final evaluation of the extent of the the success of the new fares package. date, together with current forward booking patterns, most encouraging and Qantas considers that the new fares package has certainly stimulated the travel market between Australia and the United Kingdom.

In fact, in the report of the commission of Inquiry into Transport to and from Tasmania initiated by the previous Government and presented in March 1976, Commissioner J. F. Nimmo, CBE. stated that 'The air fare formula used by Ansett and TAA is standard throughout Austraha for all routes. Thus Tasmania suffers no disability so far as comparative air passenger charges are concerned'. The tourist industry in Tasmania is favourably served by the large discounts extended by the airlines in the form of package tours from the mainland, as 30 percent. In addition there are off peak fares available at substantial discounts such as the newly introduced APEX fares.

230,Mr HUNT,TOTAL COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"In consultation with my DepartAct ment, the Minister for Social Security has prointo vided the following answer to the honourable approved member's question: (1) Most nursing homes accommodate two types of patients; those requiring what is known as extensive care and those requiring ordinary care. The Commonwealth minimum nursing requirements differentiate between the levels of nursing required by each type of patient. In Victoria, however, because of the high required by State Health Authorities, private nursing homes tend to accommodate almost exclusively extensive care patients. A need could therefore exist in Victoria for nursing home accommodation for ordinary care patients. This would need a much lower staff/patient ratio required by the Victorian health authorities. (2) In a Report published in January 1977 on Care of the Aged and Infirm ('Holmes Committee') expressed doubts as to whether, deficiencies, a pressing need exists to further increase the dromes,headings stock of self-contained units and therefore recommended cessation of capital assistance for self-contained accommodation in 1979, at the end of the current 3-year program.

It is the owners' responsibUity to ensure that standards are met and it is the responsibUity of any pilot using such an aerodrome to ensure that the operation in which he is involved is safe. Such aerodromes to Department of Transport inspection and they may be used, closed or modified without reference to the Department. At any time, there are thousands of Authorised Landing Areas throughout Australia and no record of location ownership is kept by the Department of Transport. WhUe small number of these are owned by local government per authorities, the great majority are owned by private interests. Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, affected upon notice, on 26 October 1977: (1) What progress has been made in the estabhshment a joint review team to investigate in detail the structure functions of Airpon Safety Omcers as set out in the Departthree ment's annual report. (2) If the review has been completed, will he make copies of the report avaUable. (3) Is he able to say what changes are structure and functions of Airport Safety Officers. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A joint PubUc Service Board/Departmental team was estabUshed in July 1976 to inspect the Airport Safety Officer South Australia work group within the Department As a consequence, agreement in principle was reached between the two parties in thefirsthalf of this year on a new structure for Airpon Safety Officers. (2) The study, as such, of the structure and functions of the Western Australia Airpon Safety Officer work group has been completed. But, inasmuch as it took the form of a joint inspection as distinct from a joint review, a formal repon was not prepared. (3) The agreement with the Pubhc Service Board provides the introduction of a new three level structure for Airport Safety Officers. The Department and the PubUc Service Board are currently pursuingfinalisationof position classiNorthern Territory fication standards prior to seeking final agreement to and Island, Delara implementation of the new structure. Contributions to United Nations (Question No. 1925) Mr Abel asked the Minister for Foreign River, Affairs, upon notice, on 1 November 1977: Innes1. What actualfinancialcontribution was made to the United Nations by each of its member States during the last River, year for whichfiguresare avaUable. 2. What sum per head of population did each contribution Mt represent in each of the member States. 3. What percentage of each member State's gross national or some other internationaUy recognised measuremember State's wealth, did each contribution 4. What national States are not members of the United  member's questions are as follows: are, in effect, private aeroThe Report of the Committee on Contributions of the United Nations (Supplement No. 11 (A/23/11) ) dated 26 these August 1977 and the Addendum thereto dated 1 September 1977. The addendum lists both the assessed and voluntary financial contributions paid by member States in each of the are not subject calendar years 197S and 1976. Concerning the second and third of the honourable member's questions, contributions to the United Nauons are based essentiaUy on national income. Having estabUshed on the basis of comparative national income what proportion of or its overaU budget each member should pay, members are a bUled for an amount Thus Australia in 1976, paying 1.S2 cent, contributed $A4.4 miUion. It is agreed that least developed countries and most seriously affected countries should pay 0.02 per cent and also that the low per capita Airport Safety nauonai income countries (below $1800) should receive a deduction. The relationship between contributions and (Question No. 1914) national income in the least developed, most seriously and low per capita income countries is thus different to that of the high per capita income countries. Paragraphs 26-34 and 45-53 of the Committee's Repon of set out problems in comparing GNPs. UntU the 1978-79 and period the calculation of contributions has been based on a year base period. For 1978-79 a seven year base period (1969-1975) wiU be used. This method of calculations avoids widefluctuationsin contributions and gives some recognition to the concept of national wealth, which is of to be made to the course difficult to measure. The Committee's repon was adopted last month by the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly and wtil be considered in plenary session in December. The following States are not members of the United Nations, but have made somefinancialcontribution to certain United Nations activities in which they participate: Holy See, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Republic of Korea, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Nauru, San Marino, Switzerland and Tonga. Air Services to South Africa (QuestionNo. 1954) Mr Wentworth asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 4 November 1977: (1) Has Qantas withdrawn from the Australia-South Africa route. (2) Has South African Airways appUed for a second flight per week on the Sydney-Perth-Mauritius-Johannesburg route. (3) Has South African Airways also appUed for approval of cheap excursion fares on this route. (4) What decisions have been made on the South African Airways apphcations, and what is the reason for each cial decision. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable years. member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) Both requests are still under consideration by partment of Transport. (Question Na 1961) Mr Chapman asked the Minister for Primary torium Industry, upon notice, on 4 November 1977: Is the Government giving consideration to the adoption of a poUcy on conservation of whales simUar to the policy reported as having been estabUshed by resolution at the recent Federal Council Meeting of the Liberal Party of Australia; if so, when does he anticipate announcing the Government's policy on this matter.",184
231,Mr SINCLAIR,TOTAL COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has consistently foUowed poUcies on whaling directed towards the conservation of all whales on a global basis. I understand that at its recent meeting the Federal Council of the Liberal Party of Australia resolved that Australia should support a ten year moratorium on commerwhaling. This overlooks the fact that moratoria on right, Gray and bowhead whales have been in force for over 30 years, on blue whales for 14 years and on humpbacks for 12 Selective moratoria have been appUed to various other stocks which are not at satisfactory levels and these moratoria will apply for whatever period is necessary to restore the stocks, whether it is 10 years or more. The quesuon of a 10 year moratorium has not been on the International WhaUng Commission (IWC) agenda since 1974 as the the Depresent management regime overcomes the necessity to introduce a blanket moratorium. The Government's policy is based on the advice of the IWC Scientific Committee which Whaling comprises the world's leading whale biologists and population dynamicists. The Scientific Committee does not consider there is any scientific justification for a blanket morain view of the stringent and conservative management measures now adopted by the IWC.",187
