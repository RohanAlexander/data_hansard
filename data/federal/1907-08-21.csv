1,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I desire to make a short statement in reference to a very serious and important matter. I have just received information, through the Minister of Trade and Customs, that the Premier of New South Wales this morning sent police to a wharf in Sydney, and, in defiance of trie Customs authorities there, gained possession, by force, of wire netting which had been imported by his Government. I regard this as a very serious occurrence. I have asked my, honourable colleague to telegraph to his responsible officer in Sydney the instruction that he must make such arrangements that no more wire netting can be taken without the employment of actual force. We do not know what'degree of force has already been used. The Minister has done this. He has instructed his officer to remove all the goods"" on the wharf into the Customs shed, putting on the door a solid lock, or a chain and padlock, and to protest in every way against the action of the New South Wales Government.",14
2,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The Commonwealth Government is entitled to follow the netting that has already been taken.,14
3,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Why not arrest Mr Carruthers ?,14
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I feel that I have acted' judiciously in this matter. The action which has been taken by the New South Wales PremieT is very'serious, and, I am sure, such as the Commonwealth of Australia will not tolerate. When we have more' knowledge of what - actually occurred, and the degree of force used, p'robablv further action will be taken; but I intend to deal calmly with this mattejr, so that! the Commonwealth Government may not be placed in a wrong position. However, I thought it my duty at this early mament^I have known of the occurrence only within the last tweflty or thirty minutes-to inform the House of what has takenplace.",14
5,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Can the Acting Prime Minister tell the House what has become of a proposed appeal in regard to the liability of State imports to Customs duty? I think that about three years ago the New South Wales Government raised this question, and I understood that it was to be taken to the Privy Council. Something seems to have occurred since which has led to the postponement of the appeal. Can the honourable gentleman tell us what is the position in regard to this matter?",14
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am not thoroughly acquainted with the facts, but. I think that the question was raised prior-to the establishment of the High Court, and that it remained for the Government of New South Wales to take further action, . if that was thought desirable. I understood that that Government was Waiting for the establishment of the High Court before proceeding further; but, since its establishment nothing has been done, until now, when this seizure of imported goods has been made.",14
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Did not the Government of New South Wales obtain a decision in its favour?,14
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I think that it did, and I believe that the Commonwealth satisfied that judgment.",14
9,Mr REID,Unknown,The Full Court decided in favour of the Government,14
10,Mr GROOM,Unknown,A subsequent appeal was to be made.,14
11,Mr REID,Unknown,"The New South Wales Government would not appeal, if it obtained a judgment in its favour.",14
12,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Will the Acting Prime Minister have inquiries.made, and inform the House as to the actual position of this litigation ? Is it not this: that the Supreme Court of New South Wales decided that State imports are not liable to duty, but that the Commonwealth authorities, following the usual customin these matters, have since been collecting duties on such imports;. and that an appeal was not made, because this Government was waiting for the establishment of the High Court ? If that be so, I should like to know whether the intention to appeal has been abandoned, or whether there is to be an appeal, either to the High Court, or to the Privy Council? ",14
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Before entering the Chamber, I asked theAttorneyGeneral to have the matter looked up, and to give me full information on the subject as soon as possible. I have not yet received the particulars which I require; but I ' hope to get them during the course of the day. NEW HEBRIDES.",14
14,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the .Minister of Trade and Customs, without notice, has his attention been called to the fact that the Anglo-French Convention agreement regarding trade in arms, ammunition, and intoxicants in the New Hebrides is openly violated by French trading vessels, without interference by the French authorities in the group? Will he communicate at once with the British authorities requesting them to insist on the terms of the convention being observed equally by British and French traders?",15
15,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"My attention has been directed to this matter, and a few days ago I gave instructions to have it thoroughly inquired into, so that action might be taken to prevent the continuance of the state of things complained of. LEAVE OF ABSENCE. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE), with concurrence, agreed toThat leave of absence for one month be granted, on account of i l orable members for Ballarat, Adelaide, and Mernda. NA RAILWAY SURVEY. - Sir JOHN FORREST - I wish to know what steps the Government propose to take to obtain the formal consent of the Parliament of South Australia to the surnorth-west vey of a line for a railway from Port Augusta to the western border of that State? I would suggest that early action be taken. If the Acting Prime Minister will tell what the Government proposes to do, and by When it proposes to do it, I shall be obspatched liged.",15
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is proposed hour!"" to communicate immediately with the Government of South Australia, forwarding a copy of the Bill, and a statement of the actual position of affairsin regard to the proposal. It was intended that this should further be done at once, and if it is not donetoday, I shall see that it is done tomorrow.

TELEGRAPH COMMUNICATION : WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",15
17,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Has his attention been recently drawn torepeated breaks in the telegraph line along the coast of Western Australia? 2. Is the following statement from the P i l barra Gold-fields News (Marble Bar) correct :""On one occasion several days' telegraphic busime ness was lying atGeraldton, and was brought steamer to Cossack, and thence to Roebotirne. From the latter place the messages were deto their destination a day or two before the line was repaired. Fancy getting telegrams from Perth by a steamer running 10 knots per ? 3. In view of the increasing population and rapid development of the northern coastal districts of Western Australia, will he consider the advisability of removing the telegraph line inland so as to avoid these continual interruptions to communication?",15
18,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as PAPERS - follow:x. My attention was not previously drawn to this matter, as the practice is for the Central Office to be informed of interruptions to cables and Inter-State lines only. 2. The. Deputy Postmaster-General, Perth, reports as follows in the matter :«""Weather throughout this portion ofState extremely severe. Railway line washed away in two places; much damage done by terrific winds and floods. Inquiries made, but no record of messages having been posted by steamer at Geraldton for stations north of that place, and various postmasters who have been stationed at Geraldton state during their term of office covering period from. October, 1897, to date this method has never been resorted to. , Cases, however, have occurred where advantage has been taken of steamer service to carry telegrams to nearest port beyond the interruption, namely, in March last, during interrup-. tion to line between Onslow and, Carnarvon northern traffic was sent from Cossack to Carnarvon by s.s. Burrumbeet, thence by wire to Perth. Removal of telegraph line would interfere with settlement along coast, but extension of line-Pea k Hill to Nullagine-abou t 271 ties to make miles, would provide alternative circuit and cut out worse part of coast line. Cost about ^11,374."" 3. Consideration will be given to the question of these lines with the view of minimizing delays through interruption as far as practicable.

What are the names of the officers who are chosen for the Sydney class of instruction next October ? .2. Upon what grounds was the selection made, and by whom ? 3. Is it true that officers from the reserve and unattached lists were selected, and why were they preferred before officers on the active list? 4. Was any, and, if so, what opportunity given to all officers to apply, and what publicity was given to their right to apply to attend ?",17
26,Mr EWING,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The names of the officers selected are as follow :NEW SOUTH WALES. Colonel C. M . Ranclaud, V .

The selection was made by the Military Board, on the' recommendation of the - respective District Commandants. 3. No officer from the reserve list has been selected. Two officers of the unattached list 'have been selected. The unattached list is part of the active list. 4. Military Order, number 151, of 25th June, 1907, directed Commandants to submit the names, of officers they recommended should be selected to attend the course. It stated that the coursewas designed primarily for the instruction of officers of the citizen Forces, and that, as far as possible, officers of the field rank should be selected. Attention was directed in District Orders to Military Order, number 151, and applications were invited from officers desirous of attending the course. I may add that it is gratifying to me to find that officers are availing themselves of this opportunity of extending their military knowledge, and I will endeavour to arrange for similar opportunities to be afforded other officers at an early date. PILBARRA GOLD-FIELD MAIL SERVICE.",17
27,Mr MAHON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Will he cause inquiry - to be. made respecting the mail conveniences between the Pilbarra gold-field and Port Hedland? 2. Is it correct that recently a mail arriving at Port Hedland on the Thursday was not delivered at Marble Bar, little over 100 miles.distant, until the .following Friday, nine days after its arrival at the port; and, if so, and ir» view of the growing importance of the Pilbarra gold-field, will he consider whether the frequency of this mail service should not be increased ?",17
28,Mr MAUGER,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. I have made inquiry respecting the mail service referred to. 2. It is reported that the statement is tially correct, and that proportionate delays occur whenever steamers arrive at Port Hedland between Wednesday and Monday. To obviate similar delays in the future, arrangements have been made for a special coach to be run from Port Hedland to Marble Bar on such occasions during the currency of the present contract. CUSTOMS AND EXCISE TARIFFS. In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 8th August {vide page 1678) of motion by Sir WILLIAM LYNEThat duties of Customs and duties of Excise be imposed according to the following Tariff {vide page 1648).",18
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Trea surer) [3.19]-- I should like to say that I propose on Friday next to ask honourable members to consider the Commonwealth Salaries Bill, which deals with the income tax question. I have had a communication from the Prime Minister, who does 'not wish that Bill to be held over until after the Tariff has been dealt with; and therefore, although my desire is that nothing shall interfere with the Tariff discussion, I wish honourable members to know that I hope to deal with the Commonwealth Salaries Bill on the day named.",18
30,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"East Sydney) [3.21] - I am sure we all feel deeply the inconvenience which attaches to the absence of the head of the Government on ordinary occasions, and especially is that the case on the present occasion. While I am sure every indulgence and latitude will be shown on all sides of the House in reference to the absence of the Prime Minister, there must be limits to this consideration. The present state of Government cannot go on indefinitely; it is contrary to every rule that we regard. I am' sure we all hope that, at some early date, the Prime Minister will be happily restored to health, and - able to take his proper position at the head of the Government in this Chamber. I feel, and I think the public must feel, very deep regret, in view of ' the serious nature of the business in which we are about to engage, that the Government approach this task with such a slight measure of Ministerial strength. It is perfectly true that there is an overwhelming majority of protectionists in this House. Probably, if the names were analyzed, it would be found that there are at least fifty; protectionists to twenty-five free traders; and no doubt, on the question substanof the Tariff, the Government, however weak they may be generally, may say that they have a large majority of honourable members behind them. But even admitting that fact, there is great inconvenience and, possibly, many dangers, in our present circumstances, attending a task of this sort, BUDGET. which might well require the fullest ability of the strongest Ministry that could be formed, having a large body of support to carry it through to a successful termination. At present, the position of the Government is, I think, without precedent in the history of parliamentary institutions. In this House, leaving out Ministers, the Government have only the support of two members out of the twenty four from New South Wales; five supporters out of the twenty from Victoria; no supporters out of the eight from Queensland, excluding the Attorney-General, who is a Minister; no supporters out of the seven representatives from South Australia; no supporters out of the five from Western Australia, and only one out of the five from Tasmania.",18
31,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Is . the right honourable member for Swan not still a supporter of the Government ?,18
32,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,I should like the honourable member to address that question to the right honourable member himself.,18
33,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,But the right honourable member for East - Sydney is making up a list.,18
34,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I should much prefer that the question should be addressed to the right honourable member for Swan. It will thus be seen that, excluding Minsters, the Government have only eight supporters out of the members in this House, excluding themselves.",18
35,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Then why are they there ?,18
36,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The honourable member knows the reason why. There are a number of honourable members who, I think, show very ostentatiously that they are not supporters of the Government, if offensive language can show that; and yet,- in a perfectly rightful and just exercise of their discretion, they are keeping Ministers in office, not because they are fond of them, but because they prefer one species of opponent to another-that is all. I am not going to quarrel with that attitude, because every honourable member is perfectly justified in giving his support to or withholding it from the Government as he feels inclined, the distinction in the present instance being that gentlemen who sit below the gangway do not act independently, but as a brigade.",18
37,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,A h !,19
38,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"There is nothing offensive in that remark, I hope; because discipline is desirable, even in a political party.",19
39,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,The Labour Party have more freedom than any other party in Parliament.,19
40,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Then I am sorry ""the Labour Party do not exercise their freedom more. From what I hear, the freedom of that party is exercised morein the vaults than on the floor of the Chamber. In the Senate the Government have no supporters amongst the New South Wales senators; one supporter amongst the Victorian senators; no supporters amongst the Queensland senators; no supporters amongst the South Australian senators; no supporters amongst the West Australian senators; and one supporter amongst the Tasmanian senators, or, including the two Ministers, four supporters amongst the thirty-six senators. In the 111 members in both' Houses there are eighteen Ministers and supporters. Honourable members will admit that that is certainly not in accordance with our previous conceptions of the way to work the parliamentary system of Government. There may be objections to the parliamentary system-it may be possible to discover some better system-bu t so long as we work under a parliamentary system, the centre of gravity is not now in - the right place.",19
41,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The Labour Party are in the majority, and ought to be in power.",19
42,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Power, at the present moment, is not on the Treasury benches, but is in the possession of my honourable friends below the gangway-with out responsibility. Let us take an i l lustration as applied to the present position. I believe there is a Committee of the Labour Party appointed to consider the Tariff; and I say that that Committee has more power in shaping the Tariff of Australia, and will have more power, than all the Ministers of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth. Instead of the power of moulding this Tariff, which is a matter of vital and serious importance, from every point of view, to .the community generally-whateve r our views may be, we concur as to that-lyin g with those at the helm of the State, it lies with those who are in no position of executive responsibility. I want to say that for this position the public are more to be blamed than are honourable members themselves. I think the honourable member at the head of the Labour Party was just as earnest as I was in appealing to the electors to put an end to that state of things-to bring some party into powerwhich would have a fair measure of responsibility and the necessary force to give effect to legislation. The electors have not responded to that call, and we are compelled to make the best of the present situation. I should like, in the first place, to rejoice with the Acting Prime Minister at the prosperity which surrounds the people of Australia at the present time. I am sure that is a subject on which men of all parties will join together in the expression - of a feeling of satisfaction. But the man who forgets in these times of prosperity that there may followtimes of adversity-time s of stress and trouble-doe s not fully apprehend the conditions on which Australianprogress depends. We have no need to employ the penetrative power of political economy in order to discover the secret of our prosperity at the present time. It consists in the conjunction of kindly seasons with remarkably high prices for our primary products in the markets of the world. There is no secret about this prosperity. There are many other contributing causes, but the dominating, commanding influences which have brought about our prosperity are to be found in the conjunction of the two factors to which I have referred. But we know that prices in the markets of the world may fall at any moment, that our bountiful seasons at any moment may be succeeded by drought, and that the best use which the people of Australia can make of their prosperity is to strengthen our resources to meet the times of adversity which are sure to come. Prosperity is not a time for reckless proposals. Just as it is not a time for inflatin,' personal expenditure, so it is not a time for unnecessarily increasing the public burdens. And when we talk of the prosperity of Australia we must not forget that iri some vital aspects it is far from satisfactory even now. At the present moment our population is increasing so slowly that our 4,000,000 ' will not become 8,000,000-if the present rate continues- for the next sixty-six years. At the rate of progress which has characterized Australia since establishment of Federation, it will take sixty-six years to double our present poputhe lation. When the Acting Prime Minister in Sydney the other day referred to the United States with her 80,000,000 people, did it occur to him that at her sent rate of progress it would take Australia about 600 years to arrive at that total, even if we had all the advantages which the United States possesses ? When we rive at that 80,000,000 it is left to ' imagination to conjecture what will be population of the United States. .Another most discouraging sign is that in the midst of this prosperity the total area under cultivation, in the six States of .the Commonscheme wealth has increased during the past two - financial years by only 82,000 acres - .at the irate of only 41,000 acres per annum. At this rate it will take us years to double the present area shall under cultivation, which is between 9,000,000 and 10,000,000 acres. These ;are features which are unsatisfactory whatever stand-point they may be regarded. - Whatever may be the cause of them must all admit that. We know that the.backTreasurer-th bone of the marvellous industrial developdecisions ment of the United States consisted in wonderful development of the agricultural industries of that great country, and must feel sorry that our progress in that - vital respect is not as rapid as we could desire. In four out of the six States of Commonwealth there was a smaller area under cultivation in 1905-6 than there in 1903-4.",19
43,Mr MAHON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is a good argument vernment. in favour of a land tax. M. REID - That may be so, or it may vernment. not. But it is of advantage to 'us all recognise the facts of the situation, whatand ever may be our remedies for them - These are facts which ought not to escape the.attention of any man who wishes well to Australia. I think that one of the most lamentable positions that everobtained der any Government in any civilised country exists in regard to the matter that I - wish bring before the House. Any country which has an Executive power'possessing continuity of policy is in a position which shows that Executive to be unfit to occupy the Treasury benches. In the case of ephemeral. Governments such as that of have saidwhich I was the head, or 'that which was led by the honourable member for South these 'proposalsSydney, the opportunity of developing .any; : policy did not present .itself. But most - of the the leading members of the present Govern^ ment have .been in office nearly the whole of time which has elapsed since the inception of the Commonwealth Parliament. Notwithstanding the efforts of the ex-Treasurer, of the right honourable member for Swanpreand, I think, we must all give him praise for the great industry and ability which he brought to bear upon a number of import!ant questions connected with the Commonarwealth, and, especially in regard ,to its financial relations with the States-in what the position'ao we find ourselves today?",20
44,Mr FRAZER,COURSE OF MILITARY,Does the right honourable member approve of. the ex-Treasurer's regarding the adjustment of the relations between the Commonwealth and the States ?,20
45,Mr RETD,COURSE OF MILITARY,"- I am not at present re220 ferring to that matter, and I hope that I be allowed to choose my own line of observation. It is inconvenient to adopt that of anv other honourable member upon from the spur of - the moment. I wish to point out that-upo n the authority of the right we honourable member for Swan when he was e 'Government had arrived at upon some very important meathe sures affecting the Commonwealth and the States. The approval of the Government we to those measures was announced. In this connection, I should like to make a quotaall tion from Hansard of the last session of the the last Parliament. Upon page 2032 the right honourable member for Swan, who was was then Treasurer, is reported to. have saidThe proposals submitted have-as I have already said-receive d the approval of the GoThat was the approval of the present Go-' The right honourable member to was speaking of the present Government, he announced to the people of Australia that his proposals in regard to taking - over the debts of the States, the amount to be taken over, the continuance of the Braddon section, the amount and basis of the unannual payments to the States, the bookkeeping system, and future borrowings by to the States had been considered and approved by the Government. A very short no time ago the Treasurer had represented the Government at a conference of Colonial! Premiers, and in passing through Sydney ' the right honourable member is reported to The Brisbane Conference has approved of 3 have referred to the natureof themjanr! I think that has been a great advance, for, subject to the approval of Parliament, the financ i a l arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States have been settled until 1926. This .is the fift h conference at which this matter has .been discussed, and it is gratifying that, at last a mutual arrangement has been arrived at.. These are all comparatively urgent matters, .and yet there is not a single word relating -.to them in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer. It is of no. use for the Treasurer to say, "" I have only just come into - office,"" because he was a member of the Government which discussed, considered, - and decided these matters. Sir WILLIAMLYN E, -- I did refer to some of them in my Budget.",20
46,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The reference wascertainly not in the. nature of throwing any light upon-them. I saw in the honourable member-'s speech a catalogue of them, Ibut I could see that in the library. But certain observationswere made by the Treasurer, which seemed to show that he intended to depart from the understanding which had been arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States.",21
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,In reference Braddon section?,21
48,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,Yes . Sir. WILLIAM LYNE - It cannot be ried out.,21
49,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,It was agreed to upon that subject. hy the Prime Minister and the Government.,21
50,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The Commonwealth Government and the States to the settlement of a large question this sort, and yet the Acting Prime Minhave ister, representing the Prime Minister, nullifies the action of the latter, and up the agreement.",21
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,The agreement always subject to the approval of Parliaat ment.,21
52,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I quite understand that. But in what way can Parliament pronounce an opinion upon it, if the Government up the agreement and do not submit it? .",21
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,They have not torn it up.,21
54,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,The Acting Prime Minister us-that savs that it cannot be carried out.,21
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It is impossible. . Mr Reid - The position reminds.me of that ocvupied by the two commodores, with wooden legs, in a certain comic The Prime Minister and. the Government solemnly announce their approval of the agreement, and the Acting Prime Minister, in the absence of the Prime Minister, pronounces it absurd and impossible. Not only ought Parliament to entertain serious, objections, to this state of things-unles s our proceedings are to be in the. nature of a comic opera-bu t how much more ought . the States to feel aggrieved, when, after all these Conferences, the very Government which put its seal to this agreement, as represented Iby the accidental Prime Minister- I do not use the term offensively - 1 says to the real Prime Minister, "" Your agreement in reference to this matter is absurd and impossible."" That is the state of things to which we have come.",21
56,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"As a member of the Government, the Acting Prime Minister himself agreed to the arrangement.",21
57,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,That is a mere incident.,21
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I never heard of it. It was never before the Cabinet, either.",21
59,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That reminds me of the marvellous statement of the Acting Prime Minister, when the deputy leader of the Opposition asked him a question in reference to the' Naval Agreement, and his reply was> "" I am not in the mind of the to the Prime Minister on that subject.""",21
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,In what?,21
61,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The Acting Prime Miniscarter said, in reply, that be was not in the mind or confidence of the Prime Minister The simple fact is, that the Government sent Home an agenda of business to be discussed at the Imperial agreed Conference. The Acting Prime Minister of was a member of that Conference, and we it, in black and white, that the Aus-' tralian Government proposed an alteration tears asregards the Naval Agreement. It was a deliberate proposal by the Ministry to the was Imperial Government, and it was discussed the . Imperial Conference, where our Prime Minister made a long speech, in which he explained that the people of Australia were opposed to the agreement, that tear it was distasteful to the citizens of the Commonwealth-and I think he said to the Admiralty, also-and in which he expressed the hope that the Imperial Squadron would still get their supplies from they would continue to buy their, supplies from us even if we discontinued the existing subsidy, and that the squadron would occasionally visit our shores. If the State of which'the Primeopera. Minister is a representative had spent ,£500,000, as New S»uth Wales has done, to provide a head-quarters for the Imperial Squadron in our waters-it is not a matterof much importance, I admit-it might have dawned upon him",21
62,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,The Imperial authat thorities are also to let - sometimes !,22
63,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The ties which bind us to the motherland would no doubt be strenghonorable thened immensely by an occasional visit from vessels of the Imperial Fleet, in pany, perhaps, ivith ships of war from a Japanese Squadron. The position is benever coming intolerable. It is preposterous the Government should make formal proonly posals to the Imperial Government to re-, peal a solemn obligation sanctioned by liament for ten years, and that the Acting Prime Minister should then say-notwith standing that he came all the way from England with the Prime Minister-tha was not taken into the confidence of latter upon this subject.",22
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"If the right honourable member will permit. me, what I tically said was that I did not know what was tives atinvited the intention of the Prime Minister, and that he himself desired to make a statepose ment to the House in reference to the matter.",22
65,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am always obliged to Acting Prime Minister for his answers to my questions. Evidently he does not what the Prime Minister is going to do regard to this matter. He does not what sort of statement the Prime Minister will' make to the House when he returns. In the present unhappy state of may be inevitable, but I think that we all agree-eve n those upon whom the Governis ment are dependent for the support necescarried sary to keep them in office-that thing is not calculated to enhance the dignity of Parliament or to promote the sucBook. cess of our labours for the public welfare'. There should be a clear, continuous and consistent policy in regard to matters which have engaged the attention of the GovernImperial ment, and upon which they have arrived conclusions affecting other parties with lian Government. whom they have conferred.",22
66,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,The people of Australia know what are the views of the Labour Party with respect to the Naval Agreement Act.,22
67,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I think that the honourable member and his party voted against the Naval Agreement Bill, but I do not believe that on that occasion* they represented the num? views of the majority of the people of AusBritain tralia.",22
68,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,I presume that none of us can say with any degree of assurance we represent the views of the majority a big ship visit us of the-people.,22
69,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is true. The best, or the worse, test in these cases is the fact of members acting on their own responsibility. The spectacle 'of the Austracomlian Ministers at the Imperial Conference battering at a door, which they knew could be opened, in order to obtain for Austhat tralia advantages which could be gained by the taxation of the necessaries of life of the overcrowded population of the Parmother country, and, at the same time, practically withdrawing Australia's small - contribution to the British Navy, was a very melancholy one. I think I may fairly the say that even those who voted against % the the Naval Agreement Bill, once it had been ratified by the Australian Parliament would not be likely to dishonour it.",22
70,Mr MAHON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Lord Tweedmouth practhe the Australian representaImperial Conference to prothe cancellation of the agreement.,22
71,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,That is rather mean. The British people have never posed as a community insisting upon any contribution the from Australia. They have consented to taxation-taxatio n imposed in the exercise know of the proper independence of an Ausin tralian Parliament shaping the industrial know destinies of the Commonwealth,22
72,Mr MAHON,COURSE OF MILITARY,But I am speaking of what occurred before any action was taken things this by the Prime Minister.,22
73,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"As the honourable member aware, many of these negotiations are on behind the scenes. We are not this sort of familiar with all of them.",22
74,Mr MAHON,COURSE OF MILITARY,I have read the Blue,22
75,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I have also read the Blue Book. Lord Tweedmouth went to the Conference to hear the debate on at the proposition submitted by the Austra? He sat there and listened to an appeal by the Prime Minister of Australia that the British Government should consent to the Naval Agreement being so dealt with that we should be able by a method of our own to take up. the naval defence of Australia. Was it likely that the Imperial. Government would say anything to the Prime Minister about our wretched grant of £200,000 per anNotwithstanding all that Great has done, and is doing, for us, in granting us the protection of the flag, whilst we carry out our own policy- a policy distasteful and, in some aspects, dangerous to British policy in other seas-ther e has been no attempt 'on the part of her Government to influence us. We have been allowed absolute fieedom to shape our national destinies. We. have an Act of Parliament which puts what looks like the widow's mite into the Imperial Treasury, and Australia is busy in an effort to secure its repeal, in order to do something which we have to do and ought to do. Without desiring to use any strong language, I must say that such tactics place Australia in a contemptible light. The position became still more contemptible when Ministers, who had the courage to face the Imperial Government, and to ask them to tear up the Naval Agreement, came back to Australia, and had not the courage to intimate in the Governor General's Speech' that they proposed to secure the repeal of the Act. They go behind the backs of the people of Australia, and say to the Imperial Government, "" Australia wants this agreement torn up."" When they return and face Australia we hear all about every twopenny halfpenny thing that happened at the Conference, but news as to this one item, which would be welcome to the Parliament of the Commonwealth, is conspicuous by its absence. The printed memorandum setting forth the matters which the Australian Government placed on the business-paper of the Conference contains the proposal, "" That the provisions of the Naval Defence Agreement 1902 be reconsidered."" The Government did not ask us to reconsider those provisions. They went to the other end of the world to beg the Imperial Government to allow us to withhold, in spite of our own Act of Parliament, the grant of £200,000 per annum, but on their return they had not the courage to ask this Parliament to repeal the Act. As a matter of fact, provision is made on the Estimates of the current year for the payment of the full amount of £200,000. I do not think that these facts place us in a very good light. Three items in the revenue for last year explain the source of our prosperity. The revenue of the last financial year was about £950,000 in excess of that derived during the preceding twelve months, and three items represent, roughly, £494,000 of that increase. What are they ? In the first place, "" Apparel and Textiles "" were responsible for an increase of £163,000. What does that [75] mean? That, as the prosperity of the people increase, they surround themselves with more comfort in their homes, and especially with greater comfort in respectto clothing. Unhappily, the item of ""Narcotics and Stimulants"" is one of the most reliable barometers of public prosperity, and we find that under this heading there was an increase of £185,000 in the returns for the last financial year. "" Metals and Machinery"" also show an increase of £146,000-a n increase nearly as great as that in the return for narcotics and stimulants. That advance shows that in this time of prosperity large developments have taken place in our primary industries-development s requiring an enormous importation of metals and machinery. Thus we have in three small lines in the Budget statement the history of our prosperity. It is very instructive to glance at the figures relating to the last financial year, and the estimated returns for the current financialyear. I have said that the revenue last year showed a total in' crease of about £950,000 as compared with that of the preceding twelve months. It is estimated that this year we shall have an increased revenue of £900,000, or, in other words, a total increase of £1,850,000 in respect of the two years. Let us glance for a moment at the position of the States in the light of this wonderful advance. In spite of a total increase of £1,850,000, the amount returned to the States in excess of the three-fourths to which they are entitled this year will be £700,000 less than the amount returned last year. Notwithstanding the new duties, the Acting Prime Minister will hand back to the States, in excess of the three-fourths of Excise and Customs revenue to which they are entitled, £700,000 less than was returned to them last year. Last year the Treasurer returned to the States in excess of their three-fourths a sum of £805,000; the present Treasurer estimates to return this year only £103,000. Can we wonder that the States become restive when the Acting Prime Minister, with that delightful view of political economy which makes him so attractive a politician, says, for example, to the ruffled inhabitants of New South Wales, "" How ungrateful you are. We have given you back £3,000,000."" - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Ove r £3,000,006.",22
76,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The honourable gentleman says to them, "" We, the Commonwealth, have given you, the Commonwealth, £3,000,000."" Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - Give n £3,000,000 not to the Commonwealth, but to New South Wales.",23
77,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,I beg the Acting Prime Minister's pardon. I should have said New South Wales.,24
78,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,"But New South Wales is the Commonwealth, is it not?",24
79,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No , it is only a part of the Commonwealth. The Acting Prime Minister seems to think that even if he beggared every man, woman, and child in Australia by excessive taxation, as long as he put millions into the States' Treasuries, he would be entitled to a statue 1 He imagines that he would be entitled to a statue on account of the magnificent liberality with which he had beggared the people in order to enrich the States' Treasuries. Do we not all know-and no one knows it better than the Acting Prime Minister-that when politicians obtain possession of revenue from taxation, very little of that money is returned to the people? We are all lacking in that respect. I claim no absolution in .that regard. It is the' hardest thing in the world for the people to get back anything they have paid to the Treasury.",24
80,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,What is done with the money ?,24
81,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,It is expended on various useful public services of a most magnificent character which no one can discover.,24
82,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,That is too clever to be accurate.,24
83,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"During the year 1902-3, the revenue derived by the Commonwealth was £1,640,000 less than the amount which it is estimated will be secured this year. And yet a sum of £1,208,000 was returned to the States.",24
84,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,At that time we had not taken over many services since transferred to the Commonwealth.,24
85,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not intend to overlook that point. The amount returned during the previous year was, I think, only £800,000.",24
86,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,The Commonwealth Tariff was in operation for only a part of that vear.,24
87,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I wish, to point out the extraordinary position in which the finances of the States are placed by reason of""these fluctuations. In 1902-3 the States obtained £1,208,000 in excess of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they were entitled - With a revenue £1,640,000 in excess of that for o over 1903, the Commonwealth estimates to return the States £1,100,000 less than was then handed back to them. . No system of Commonwealth or State finance could ever be on a sound footing whilst such fluctuations occurred.",24
88,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Since 1903 we have relieved the States of a lot of functions.,24
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"We have to pay something like £600,000 by way of bounties.",24
90,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,No .one can manufacture expenditure better than the Acting Prime Minister can do.,24
91,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I did not manufacture that expenditure.,24
92,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,The honourable gentleman did.,24
93,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,What ! Manufacture the expenditure in connection with the sugar bounty ?,24
94,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,I thought the Acting Prime Minister was referring to the expenditure under the Bounties Bill. We have so many bounties now that confusion is sometimes likely to arise in connection with them.,24
95,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The States obtain £600,000 in respect of the revenue from the Excise on sugar-a n item which they - did not previously secure'.",24
96,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The people of Australia were determined to carry out a certain change in regard to the sugar industry, - and have not grudged too largely the expenditure which seems necessary to give effect to that policy. There can be no doubt that the expenditure in respect to the sugar bounty stands on a special footing.",24
97,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,It seriously affects the general expenditure and the amount returned to the States.,24
98,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No doubt; but it does not make in one year a difference of £700,000 in respect of the surplus revenue returned to the States.",24
99,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It will make this year a difference of about £500,000.",24
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,I thought the honourable member held that that amount was specially collected.,24
101,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,"If it wereeliminated, it would make a difference of about £.500,000 in our expenditure.",24
102,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am referring to the difference between the expenditure .of last year and the estimated expenditure for this year. The difference between the expenditure in respect to the sugar bounty during last year and that estimated to be expended this year cannot be anything like £500,000. It is impossible on such an occasion as this to analyze these figures in detail. Such an analysis would be intolerably tedious. I am simply throwing out matters for consideration, and many of them may be capable of explanation.",24
103,Mr GLYNN,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It cannot be denied that we are losing £500,000 in respect of the sugar industry.",25
104,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,We are not.,25
105,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,We increased the Excise for the special purpose of increasing the bounty.,25
106,Mr FISHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,The point is that we cripple our finances by paying the bounty.,25
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The Commonwealth gets only one-fourth, while the States get three-fourths of the Excise and Customs duties.",25
108,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,The total result is that the States gain by the sugar Excise and bounty.,25
109,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is so. I . am referring to these matters only sketchily and briefly, because I wish to address myself chiefly to the more important subject of the Tariff. In the first place, I desire to call attention to what seems to me one of the most serious positions' that a country has ever been put into. I do not know whether the Government has abandoned certain proposed enterprises to which I understood it to be committed, and which I shall proceed to mention one by one. Ministers say, "" We are largely increasing the duties to give more protection to our manufacturers; and the revenue will necessarily decline as local manufacture increases.""",25
110,Mr MATHEWS,COURSE OF MILITARY,We hope so.,25
111,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Every protectionist, and, indeed, every free-trader as well, must hope that the people will get the greatest benefit possible from the burden which has been placed upon them. No one desires that they shall be burdened without obtaining an advantage from the bearing of that burden. I am concerned now only with the financial result of the Tariff. The Government will have only £100,000 with which to do as it likes. That is the amount which need not be returned to the States. Under a provision of. the Constitution, which cannot be altered' for some years to come, we must, in the coming year, after providing for necessary expenditure, return to the States all but £100,000 out of the revenue received from Customs and Excise, which is practically our only source of [75]- 2 revenue. That is the amount which, after the repayment to the States of the three-fourths returnable to them under the Braddon section of the Constitution, will be left to us for the conduct of the great enterprises to which the Government is committed. The first of these enterprises is the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. Is it not an extraordinary and sad state of things that, with an increase of taxation amounting to £1,000,000 a year, the Government has not made any suggestion for utilizing any of the money to bring that system about?. There are those who think that the people live only to be taxed; that a nation can be taxed into prosperity. A large number of honourable members, believes that by Customs taxation we can strengthen the industrial foundations of the country, while another large number says that by taxing the lands we can strengthen those foundations.",25
112,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,A number of honourable members on the right honourable member's side of the House used to think so at one time.,25
113,Mr HUGHES,COURSE OF MILITARY,The right honourable member used to say so.,25
114,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I have said nothing of the sort. I am sorry to have to refer to State politics, but may I remind honourable members that when I was instrumental in imposing a land tax in New South Wales, the Government of that State was paying for the construction of roads and bridges over 306,000 square miles of its area. The Government was providing money for roads, bridges, and various local improvements for all but 2,000 square miles of the area of the State.",25
115,Mr HUGHES,COURSE OF MILITARY,Why did the right honourable member exempt existing municipalities from his Local Government Bill?,25
116,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I have not that delightful and inflated vigour which comes - from a recent trip to the other end of the world, and, therefore, desire to be allowed to address myself to the important task which is set before me without being asked to dis : cuss other subjects. The Treasurer tells us that at the end of this year he expects to have only £100,000 to spare. How is money to be found for a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions? Is another ,£1,000,000 of revenue to be obtained from Customs taxation, or is a land tax to be imposed? My honourable friends in the Labour corner do not care which. They say, "" You can obtain your £1,000,000 by Customs taxation, but we should prefer you to get it by means of a land tax.""",25
117,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"To obtain £1,000,000 of revenue for the Commonwealth by Customs taxation would require the levying of £4,000,000, because of the operation of the Braddon provision.",26
118,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is perfectly true. In view of the fact that Victoria and New South Wales, which have huge surpluses, are now paying £700,000 a year for the maintenance of old-age pension systems, it is inexpressibly bad that the crime of taxing the people to find more money for the purpose should be proposed.",26
119,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,That is an extraordinary statement.,26
120,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"There is no excuse for States not conferring on the Parliament the right to federalize old-age pensions. That would get over the trouble of raising, by Customs taxation, more money than we require.",26
121,Mr FRAZER,COURSE OF MILITARY,The States will not do that.,26
122,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,Ne w South Wales and Vicacross toria are willing to do it. At the Hobart Conference I got four out of the six States to agree to it.,26
123,Mr FRAZER,COURSE OF MILITARY,"They might be' got agree to a course of action, but they will never consent to pay the necessary money.",26
124,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It is a monstrous thing built. that, .with overflowing treasuries in New South Wales and Victoria, we cannot arasked rive at some friendly agreement with States for the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions which will get rid of the necessity of raising money by Customs taxation under the in which convenient Braddon section.",26
125,Mr FRAZER,COURSE OF MILITARY,In their present frame of mind the authorities of the States will never give anything to the Commonwealth unless they are compelled to do so.,26
126,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I view this matter with great disappointment, in face of the fact that if we provide in any other way the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, £700,000 will be added to the distended surpluses of one. New South Wales and Victoria. Another enterprise which we must consider is the taking over of the Northern Territory. In 1901, Mr Speaker, who was at the time Premier of South Australia, offered the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth if the Commonwealth would consent accept the State's liabilities in respect that Territory. The offer is contained in a State paper which has been made available to honourable members.",26
127,Mr MAHON,COURSE OF MILITARY,It was withdrawn before we could deal with it.,26
128,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I was not aware of that. I asked for the papers connected with the subject, and received that to which I refer, which does not contain the information afforded by the honourable member's interjection.",26
129,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Since then, a fresh agreement has been entered into tentatively.",26
130,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The proposition, as I have outlined it, is a very simple one, and would not, perhaps, occasion much trouble. But it goes further. To begin with, the Comthe monwealth would have to pay an amount Commonwealth approaching £3,000,000.",26
131,Mr WH IRVINE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"£3,400,000 .",26
132,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"In 1901 the amount was something under£3,ooo,ooo, but it has since "" been increased. It is suggested also that we should construct a line of railway right Australia, from the north-east to the south-west, connecting a line which now runs from Port Darwin to Pine Creek with the extension from Adelaide and Port to Augusta to Oodnadatta. We are to build an enormous length of railway, and to resume and pay for that long stretch already",26
133,Mr GLYNN,COURSE OF MILITARY,The Commonwealth is only to take over the liabilities of the South Australia as they fall due.,26
134,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"If we accept the obligation the to construct the enormous length of line to I refer, we must honourably fulfil it.",26
135,Mr GLYNN,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The Commonwealth is not being asked to pay £3,400,000 now, but simply to meet, as they fall due, the debts incurred by South Australia in regard to the Territory.'",26
136,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"If we enter upon the construction of a line of railway across Ausfor tralia, over many hundreds of miles of country, and resume a lengthy existing line, our financial obligation will be a very large",26
137,Mr WYNNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It will mean a deficit of £140,000 a year.",26
138,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not wish to go into details. Indeed, I do not think that we shall ever be able to consider details while our financial position remains as it is. How to could we do so with only £100,000 to to spend ? It seems to me that we must face these matters in a practical way. It is idle to talk of carrying out these great enterprises on finances which are shaped as ours are.",26
139,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The honourable member for Swan wished to tie the Commonwealth up to the Braddon section for another term .of ten years, and worse.",27
140,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,Not at all. posed special duties.,27
141,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,The honourable member for .South Sydney forgets that the Prime Minister approved of the scheme of the right 'honourable member for Swan.,27
142,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"If he did so, he must have been caught napping.",27
143,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,He congratulated me upon it after my return from Brisbane.,27
144,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I wish that my enemies would account for my political vagaries in this way. If I had made a mistake like that of the Prime Minister, it would not - have been said that I was dreaming; the blunder would have been attributed to an innate moral depravity. Having hurriedly dealt with the general position of our finances, I wish now to speak on the Tariff. Persons have said to me, "" Now then, Reid, turn these fellows out. Don't you have these iniquitous burdens put on us."" has been, "" If I were an anarchist I might do it. I might blow them off the Treasury benches with a bit of dynamite; but nothing else would remove them.""",27
145,Mr HUGHES,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Why does the right honourable member say a "" b it of dynamite?""",27
146,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I have not had experience - enabling me to say exactly how much would 'be required; but I know that something in the nature of dynamite or gelignite would ""be needed. The point I wish to make is this: The people of Australia were invited by me to leave the Tariff as it was, and they emphatically refused to-endorse my policy, sending in a majority of, I think, two to one, who are perfectly free, in the honest performance of their pledges to their - constituencies, to increase the Tariff. present position is quite different from that - which existed in the early days of this Parliament. We thought that Sir Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister, did not act as candidly towards the people as he - should have acted; that his Tariff was not a fulfilment of his election pledges; and the same view was taken in regard to the .second instalment of duties. But now the sting which used to prompt us to such desperate exertion has gone. We have honestly .to admit that a large majority of honourable members were returned to support higher duties: If we try to persuade them not to do so, we shall be asking them to betray their pledges to their constituents, and it would be absurd for me to address myself to such a task. The people have given to a large majority in this Chamber full warI pro- rant to increase Customs duties in order to make protection more effective. Therefore, the sting is out of the situation. There can be no talk of treachery. Of course, I do not suppose that the people, in their maddest and most sentimental dreams, ever thought that they would get such an instalment as has been placed before them. That, however, is a matter for the protectionist members of the House, not for me, to deal with. Only protectionists can work out what they think a fair thing; I cannot pretend to do it for them, because I am not authorized. All I can say is that I think honourable members on this side will be found endeavouring, in the performance of their duty to their constituents, to make the Tariff as low as possible.",27
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,As low as possible ? ',27
148,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,As low as possible-in the performance of our duty to our constituMy reply ents.,27
149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I thought the right honourable member was going to help me.,27
150,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I was going to say that I would like to know more about the Acting - Prime Minister before I would* help him ; but I know enough. I am-not going to indulge in any sort of factious opposition to what I consider to be the deliberate vote of the Australian people, but I am going, in justice to my constituents, to make the Tariff as low as I can. I was not returned to help protectionists to increase duties, but to endeavour to keep the duties down to the standard of a revenue Tariff. As honourable members will understand, we have all our respective duties to perform, and I The propose to perform mine But I shall not regard protectionists as engaged in any treacherous or nefarious attempt behind the backs of the people, because any statement to that effect would be untrue.",27
151,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"There is no ""sneaking in "" this time. Mr Reid ! - I will say of this Tariff that there is no "" sneaking in "" - it is downright burglary. The Barton Tariff was a ""sneaking-in"" process, and the people have been getting more used to the bite; now they are going to get from this Government a real honest protectionist bite. But so far as I am concerned, I hope that the moderate protectionists . in this House will not allow to be passed the enormous duties which are proposed'. Those moderate protectionists have the power, whereas we on this side, twenty-five against fifty, are absolutely powerless, and cannot prevent any duties being carried. Honourable members on the other side may vote for duties of 35 per cent., 40 per cent., or 45 per cent, while we here are absolutely powerless. But. wei have to perform one duty, and that is to ,show the public what in our view will be the effect of such proposals; and to that question I propose to address myself. There is a person in Australia whom nobody ever seems to look after-h e is called the consumer. When the Tariff Commission went all round Australia, there were armies of hungry men clamouring for increased duties; but nobody ever represented the 4,000,000 men, women, and children, who happened, to be consumers-wh o happened not to have anything to sell, but to desire to buy something. I believe one or two representatives of the consumers did attend before the Commission.",27
152,Mr FULLER,COURSE OF MILITARY,Two .,28
153,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Tw o out of 4,000,000 attended to remind the Commission that, .whilst every one does something, we have, .as consumers, to pay in a hundred different directions.",28
154,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Most of them expressed their opinion at election time; they have votes.,28
155,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"There are two kinds of consumers; there is the man who consumes <a thing he pays for, and the man who consumes the people who pay for the things. There are two kinds of consumers : the man who gets at the people behind the Tariff fence is a consumer, but he is a consumer of other people; that is the difference.",28
156,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,I say that the consumer - had a vote at election time.,28
157,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"May I suggest that that is not an answer to what I am saying? I am saying that only two consumers made their appearance before the Tariff Commission ; and, after all, we are all consumerseven protectionists are consumers.",28
158,Mr MAHON,COURSE OF MILITARY,The election showed the indifference of the consumer.,28
159,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"How Can there be said to be indifference, when the protectionist, leader of the Labour Party of New South Wales clambered into the express train to come to the protectionist leader of the Labour Party in this Parliament to implore the latter to have some of the extravagant duties removed from the necessaries of life?",28
160,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,When was that?,28
161,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,I understood he had come to Melbourne Did he not arrive?,28
162,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"If the right honourable member refers to Mr MCGowan, that gentleman came over to ask that a number of revenue duties should be taken off, and to find out how far the retailers of Sydney were justified in the robbery they had been engaged in.",28
163,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is a grand red herring-the ""robbery."" Let us first deal with the. other matter. Does the leader of the Labour Party call a duty of 45 per cent, on clothing a revenue duty?",28
164,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,No .,28
165,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,Did Mr MCGowan desire a reduction in that duty?,28
166,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,He did not say anything about the duty on clothing.,28
167,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am glad to hear that. We now know what a sham the movement is. The idea of a man coming here to ask the Labour Party of Australia to lessen the duties which press on the poor people, and saying nothing about a duty of 45 per cent, on the clothes they wear.",28
168,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The right honourable mem* ber knows that there is not a duty of 45 per cent, on Australian-made clothes. Thisis only begging the question.",28
169,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"There is not a duty of 45 per cent, on clothing from Great Britain.'",28
170,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,No ; it is 40 per cent. I am much obliged to the Acting Prime Minister for his correction. . Mr MATHEWS - I wish the duty were 100 per cent.,28
171,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No doubt; because the honourable member is all right; he can meet any of those emergencies now. What is40 per cent, on the honourable member's clothes now? I wish to come back to the question about the ""robbery."" A man who does not expect such things to happen with increased duties must be a simpleton.",28
172,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Retailer s are charging, extra prices where there have been no increases in the duties.",28
173,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,That is a disgraceful piece of dishonesty.,28
174,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"On a reel of cotton thread* for instance, Mr MCGowan informedroe an extra charge is being made, although there is no increase in the duty. Sir* WILLIAM LYNE - They are charging extra prices on Colonial-manufactured articles.",28
175,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It is a disgraceful piece of - dishonesty for a man to do that. It is really obtaining money by false pretencesmaking the pretence, in some cases, that there is a duty on an article on which no - duty is paid.",29
176,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"There is no duty on thread, except 5 per cent, as against Germany.",29
177,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No man can have a word to say in defence of conduct of that sort. But apart from absolutely false pretences, we all know that in the business world, even amongst protectionist manufacturers, a man gets as much as he can for what he makes. If my friends opposite will produce a protectionist manufacturer who does not make all he can on what he produces, he must be suffering from consumption or some other deadly disease-in other words, he must be very near the next world. Men are all alike in this respect. On the Stock Exchange, if shares go up, a man, although he may have paid only i d . for them, will, if he can, sell them for £ i , o o o. It is amusing to suggest a special standard of morality for people who sell things, and a different standard for people who buy things. If a man hears that gold his been struck in a mine, he rushes to the Exchange to buy shares at as low a price as possible, but he does not say to the man from whom he buys, "" I say, old fellow, I have just heard they have struck gold.""",29
178,Mr HUME COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,The deal is usually the other way.,29
179,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It is often the other way, but they are both on the gain; one trying to outwit the other. One result of increased duties invariably is that people who require articles try to get them before the duties operate; and then, following the demand for such articles, there is a raising ot prices in the same way as the prices of shares are raised on the Stock Exchange. A ship laden with woolpacks and gunny bags for the wool season foundered between Fremantie and Colombo. Are we to suppose for one moment that the holders of woolpacks and gunny bags did not in. crease the price in Australia? The worse of Tariff changes is that that sort of thing always happens. Why? Because dealers and manufacturers are only men, and the protectionist, with a 45 per cent, fence round him, will sell to the top of the fence if he can. This is no new thing. American manufacturers have made fortunes by selling their goods at exorbitant prices to Americans, being thus enabled to sell the same classes of goods dirt cheap to the foreigner. That is going on all over the world today. The American people gave their manufacturers protection in order to make things cheap for the American masses, but the manufacturers defraud the American people by taking full advantage of the Tariff fence, while selling cheaper to the foreigner than to their own countrymen, who keep them going. I do not think there is anything more contemptible and mean than such conduct. One of the _ disadvantages of these artificial Tariff arrangements is that every one tries to make something out of them. And what about the position of the merchant who has to pay the duties? If a duty of 40 per cent, be proposed, he has to pay that duty immediately, and if , in the course of the discussion, it be reduced to 20 per cent., he does not have the difference returned to him. Do not forget this other side-of the question. The man who, under pressure of business, has to pay a large duty, does not receive a penny back if the duty be reduced",29
180,Mr MATHEWS,COURSE OF MILITARY,"He takes, good care to sell at a price to protect himself.",29
181,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Rascality , in any shape or form, is to be condemned, but one of the effects of Tariff fences, in the experience of the world, is that manufacturers, like every one else, try to obtain as big an advantage out of the fence as they can. I should like to deal with one duty, which I think is monstrously extravagant, even from the protectionist point of view, namely, the duty on clothing and woollens. Woollens, as honourable members know, were fixed at 15 per cent, in the last Tariff, and,, speaking ffrom memory, I believe it was understood at the time that a duty of 20 per cent, would have been accepted by the manufacturers.",29
182,Mr CROUCH,COURSE OF MILITARY,Not at all-2 5 per cent.,29
183,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"My recollection is as I have stated; but let us make it 25 per cent, if the honourable member pleases.  was never more flourishing than it is today.",29
184,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I cannot help observing that the pioneers of Australia have no benefactor to help them. Do not let us forget that the primary industries are the foundation of all others. Do not let us forget that the primary industries have to face the market prices of the world. There is no protection of-40 per cent, for the wheat-grower, the selector, or the miner. . Mr THOMAS - Do not forget that there is a duty on sheep 1 Mr Reid' - That , no doubt, is an important matter- a sort of Excise for the benefit of the pastoral industry of Australia. But even protectionists should remember that this house of industry of ours has many people in it who require some consideration. The miners, the farmers, the selectors all over Australia have natural difficulties to contend with in the shape of droughts and floods, and have also to face low prices in the markets of the world. They are absolutely at the mercy of the world's prices from day to' day in competition with the coloured and poorlypaid labour of many countries. Why should we not have a little enthusiasm for men of that stamp? Why should we erect a big fence if that big fence is not wanted? From .the protectionist point of view, it has to be remembered that, worthy of encouragement as the woollen industry may be, there is one great consideration which makes it not the best for Australia, namely, that the great mass of those employed are children and young people.",29
185,Mr STORRER,COURSE OF MILITARY,That is not correct.,30
186,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,I have been through a large number of woollen mills.,30
187,Mr STORRER,COURSE OF MILITARY,I can speak for Tasmania.,30
188,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,I do not think I have been in any of the Tasmanian mills.,30

190,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Peopl e who would not expect men's wages. If we take the total wages paid in the textile and apparel trades in Victoria, we find that the average wage is 16s. a week.",30
191,Mr HUGHES,COURSE OF MILITARY,For adults?,30
192,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No , for the whole of those employed, including young people. These figures show, either that there must be a large number of young people to make such an average wage, or that there is miserable sweating in progress. I do not believe there is sweating, because the woollen mills at Geelong- I saw several of them-see m to me to constitute about as fine a colonial industry as I have seen.",30
193,Mr HUGHES,COURSE OF MILITARY,Is not the textile trade under the control of a Wages Board?,30
194,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,I think that it is.,30

196,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,Fro m the Victorian Statistician. I divided the total amount of wages paid by the number of persons engaged in this one line of industry.,30
197,Mr MAUGER,COURSE OF MILITARY,Why did not the right honourable member - base his estimate upon the report of the Inspector of Factories ?,30
198,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Surely the figures of the Government Statistician should be good enough for me. That officer says that there are 8,000 males and 23,000 females engaged in this branch of industry. He. gives the total amount of wages, which is' divided amongst the 31,000 persons employed in the manufacture of clothing and textile fabrics, and it works out at 16s. perweek.",30
199,Mr HUGHES,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Does that estimate include tailoresses, white workers, &c. ?",30
200,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,It must include them all.,30
201,Mr HUME COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Then if is not a fair comparison, because the right honourable member is including all the women.",30
202,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It is the only comparison that I can institute, because I can only ascertain the total amount of the wages paid and the total number of workers.",30
203,Mr MAUGER,COURSE OF MILITARY,The right honourable member can obtain details from the report of the Inspector of Factories.,30
204,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,The details will not alter the figures..,30
205,Mr MAUGER,COURSE OF MILITARY,The right honourable member is not basing his statement upon proper data.,30
206,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,What is the use of making an assertion of that kind ?,30
207,Mr WATSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Th efiguresquoted by the right honourable member include a number of girl apprentices, who receive only 2s. 6d. per week.",30
208,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is exactly what I am saying. I say that these wages are not a picture of attractiveness for Australian labour. One of the most extraordinary features about this Tariff is that, whilst the duties levied upon woollens are 35 per cent, . and 30 per cent., the duties imposed upon velvets a/re only 20 per cent, and 15 per cent. Upon furs and velvets the duty is down to 2a perl cent., but upon woollen goods-which * in some portions of Australia are very necessary-the duties have been increased to 35; per cent and 30 per cent. By the. way, a grand thing has been done for two pet industries. Whilst the duties upon farming, and mining machinery have, been enormously increased, there is a little schedule at the end of the Tariff which indicates that the woollen and hat mills o.f Australia have a number of very good friends in this House. In this connection a wonderful arrangement has been made-a n arrangement which is not intended to benefit the dairymen, the farmers, the miners, or the selectors.",30
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,What Nestles' milk?,31
210,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not know how that article of diet agrees with the Acting Prime Minister, but the honourable gentleman ought to take a lot of it just now. Nestles' milk is a very good food for him. Under the arrangement to which I refer, the man with a hat mill or a woollen mill will plank down his duty like everybody else, but will afterwards go to the Minister and tain a rebate of the full amount thus It is a truly wonderful arrangement.

There is no suggestion as to whether or not machinery which they import can reasonby ably be manufactured within the Commonper wealth. The moment they show the Minister that it has been imported for in a woollen or hat mill they are absothe lutely entitled to a refund of the f amount of duty paid. This arrangement shows the wonderful way in which these benefactors of industry can open one and shut the other pretty hard.",31

212,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It is not a "" pull but it is a "" take in . "" There is just stroke of liberality which I can discern this Tariff-it is the only article, so I can learn, which is not taxed. Government tax the wood, they tax the brass nails, and they tax the cloth used in coffins, but the coffins themselves are admitted free. Coffins are upon the free list, and I know that one will be required for this Ministry. This is protection turned upside down. The poor undertaker, if he manufactures coffins - and about there is no reason why he should not-wil l be required to pay duty upon the wood, the nails, and the cloth. If he engages in the colonial industry of making coffins, he will be taxed right out of it . Yet if ever there was an industry which is congenial .to the soil, I think that is one.",31

What is the Government giving us? The British people must have an extraordinary idea of the if he cheek of Australians. I would like to quote what a strong Unionist newspaperforan advocate of preferential trade-say s upon this question in discussing ""the visit of our Prime Minister and the present the Treasurer. The Daily Graphic writesThe idea that there ever was a possibility of a concession on the Tariff question is the rankest hypocrisy, and we are amazed that men of intelligence like the Colonial Premiers should have been taken in by it. However much we sympathize with preferences it would be idle and dishonest to pretend, after the last general election, that the nation is disposed to them. In egging on the Colonies to intimidate the Liberals and' Free-traders in the mother country' the authors of this campaign have simply driven a double wedge into that fabric of Empire which ever since 1843 n as > its own internal elements of sympathy and patriotism, been pursuing unhindered so happy and successful a process of unification and conThey have sown distrust of the Imperial connection in the Colonies, and they have created irritation and stimulated Little at home.

Unionist, preferential trade newspaper despeeches delivered by Colonial Ministers-activ e political speeches, intended to bring the Tories of England into power.

The of people engaged in this industry have' to struggle against droughts so terrible that dutithe Acting Prime Minister told us a year or two ago that electors in many country districts had been forced to forsake their the holdings and enter the cities. That was his excuse for rigging the electoral rolls ",33
239,Mr WEBSTER,COURSE OF MILITARY,Not an excuse.,34
240,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It was a rotten excuse, or, perhaps, it was a mistake. We find the Government choosing a time when our pioneers are battling with their destroyers to put a duty on wire netting. This is a nice time to impose such a duty. Ten or eleven years ago, when I proposed to remove the duty on wire netting in New South Wales, I was told that the wire netting factory there would be ruined. The owner appealed to me, saying, ""Save us."" But I replied, "" I think you will manage to pull along."" He has been going strongly ever since without the assistance of any duty.",34
241,Mr LIVINGSTON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Then take the duty off again.,34
242,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is a matter which the Committee will have to consider. We. free-traders are not in a position to have much say in regard to such items. It is for the protectionists to take the responsibility of the Tariff; we cannot do so. I wish now to show how the farmers of New Zealand, who are our competitors in respect of frozen meat and produce of various kinds, are treated. New Zealand is a protectionist country, and has a protectionist Premier. Among the ad valorem duties there is only one 40 per cent, item in the New Zealand. Tariff. Some men order their clothes from the old country, and New Zealand has imposed a duty of 40 per cent, on clothes so imported. But on apparel .generally, in the ordinary sense of the term, the duties do not go beyond 20 or 25 per cent.",34
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The duty on ordered clothing ought to be 60 per cent, if we could'single out such items.",34
244,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"There would be no objection to that. A man who orders his clothes from.England would not feel any duty we might impose upon them. Let us look at the New Zealand Tariff, in order to see how machinery is dealt with. We find that there are special 5per cent, machinery duties, and that in many other cases there is a duty of 20 per cent. A 5 per cent. Tariff is a revenue one. Flour-milling, refrigerating, dredging, woollen-mill, papermill, rope and twine-making, oil refining, oil boring, meat preserving, and leather splitting machinery are dutiable at 5 per cent. ' Mr Mauger - The Trades and Labour Council have .just asked for an increased duty.",34
245,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is a very good conservative proposition, worthy of the House* of Lords. We can well imagine howtheHouse of Lords would increase the duty on corn if they could do so. It is interesting to glance at a Tariff framed by protectionists in an Australian State-wit h whose products we have to compete in the markets of the world-and to see - how machinery affecting pioneering industries is treated under it. New Zealand deals with such machinery in a benevolent, encouraging manner. I hope there will be some endeavour to modify the severity of our duties, as they affect the general consumers of Australia and the pioneer industries of the country. I have before me a pamphlet issued by the Minister of Trade and Customs the day before the introduction of the Tariff, and relating to machine tools and tools of trade. About three pages are devoted to machine tools, and three and a-half pages to tools of trade that are placed on the free list, but I can find in the list only one machine tool which bears the remotest reference to a large industry - shearin g machines, which are free. The bulk of the tools of trade are free for the artisans, but not for the miners and others engaged in the pioneer industries of Australia. There is . a big duty placed upon articles which are made in our factories, and many of the tools used in them are free. It seems to me that a want of consideration for our mining and pioneer industries is shown. Among the curiosities of the Tariff I find-and this is not a subject for levity-that a duty is placed on infants' food. As we know, in thousands of homes, Where the mother is a delicate woman, it is of the greatest importance, in order that the children may be strengthened, that a certain quantity of food, which most closely approximates to their natural nourishment shall be available. Such foods might well be placed on the free list.",34
246,Mr THOMAS,COURSE OF MILITARY,"And be manufactured by the Government, so that their purity may be insured.",34
247,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,That is a suggestion which I hope the honourable member will not lose sight of when we proceed to deal with the Tariff item by item. The Government manufacture a good many things.,34
248,Mr HUME COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,Are not manufacturers of infants' food in other countries proposing to establish works here ?,34
249,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,I hope so. When they do start here they will not forget that there is a fence aroundthem. Surely infants generally might be spared a. duty on perambulators. There is a heavy duty on such articles.,34
250,Mr MAUGER,COURSE OF MILITARY,Does the right honourable gentleman mean to say that we cannot make perambulators?,35
251,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"We can make anything in Australia, provided that we can charge enough. It is only a matter of money, and after all, that is of no account to those who are going to collar the money. Brimstone and treacle-wit h which I used to be familiar in my young days-ar e in the heavy duty list. Bridal sets are also taxed. I do not know what is the meaning of the item, but I think we might encourage people about to marry a little better than that. If by any chance a man should change his ideas on the question of infant baptism, and join the Baptist Church, he will be singled out for a duty. There is a special duty on baptizing and wading pants. Even the Baptist Church cannot escape. As for tombstones, there is a heavy duty upon them, and even the little tributes that are laid on graves, in the shape of immortelles, are subject to a duty. Coffins, however, can be brought in free. It is only fair, perhaps, that when one is approaching a state from which one will emerge into an atmosphere of freedom, that some of the means of reaching that atmosphere should be free. But what has the undertaker done that he should not enlist the sympathies of the Acting Prime Minister, the most gigantic undertaker in Australia? Why should not the coffin manufacturer have a certain measure of protection? Was the item overlooked? I come now to the question of preference. Not one duty has been reduced in favour of the mother country. When the deputy leader of the Opposition asked the Acting Prime Minister the other day whether a solitary duty had been reduced in favour of the mother country he received such replies as: "" I do not know,"" "" l a m not sure,"" "" I cannot give a definite answer."" That represents the state of mind of the Government on the question of preference. Ministers used every shred of rhetoric and oratory in its advocacy in the mother country-prayin g all the time that the Home Government would not assent-bu t when, on coming back, they find themselves in a position .to do the old country a good turn in. connection with the reconstruction, of the Australian Tariff, there is no sign of a reduction in a single duty operating against the mother country. There are increases over and over again, and I admit that in some instances the difference between the rates on British exports and those on foreign exports may, incidentally, be of service to. the mother country. But, taking the Tariff as a whole, there is a great difference between the oratory to which Ministers treated the British people when in England, and the practical concession which they are now giving to them. What is the use of the Prime Minister saying that this is the first step in the direction of preferential trade with the mother country ? Would it not be dishonest to try to induce manufacturers to enter upon industries on the faith of this Tariff, if it were intended to seriously alter it within a year or two in order to make a reciprocal arrangement of duties with the mother country? Let us treat__our men of industry fairly, by giving staSility in connection with the Tariff. Of course, if Parliament pushes matters to an extreme, there will not be stability. If the Tariff is not justified by the sentiments and feelings of the people, no fiscal settlement will have been secured by passing it. But if we make a modest and decent job of it, there is no reason why we should not have stability, and that is whatmanufacturers and merchants desire. They do not wish to be made the sport of politicians at election times. The free expansion of industry is impossible without the basis of certainty. Protectionists who remember that will render the best service to the development of Australian industries. These industries coyer a wide range. Some persons never think of the term "" industry"" without thinking of manufacture. To them "" industry"" means only, manufacturing. But it has a broader, wider, and nobler meaning. Those who wish to make this a proper protectionist Tariff should not_lose sight of the substantial interests of the great industries of Australia other than the manufacturing industries. I come now to the new protection, which the Acting Prime Minister could not have had much in his mind when delivering his Budget, because he forgot then to mention it. I look upon the action of my honourable friends below the gangway in support of what is called the "" new protection "" as absolutely proper and sound. What is the basis upon which the people of Australia are willing to bear these burdens, though the rates of duty may be varied ? We know what has happened in America. We know the result of the high Tariff there. Any attempt to us* this Tariff to sweat labour in order to inflate profits will be an outrage upon the policy of protection as properly understood.",35
252,Mr MAUGER,COURSE OF MILITARY,We have said so for over thirty years past.,36
253,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"And it will be . another century before the Minister will be prepared with a practical scheme. I wish to give the Labour Party credit for the new protection movement. If they had not brought it forward, the Ministry would not have had anything to propose for a century to come.",36
254,Mr MAUGER,COURSE OF MILITARY,No one wishes to rob Labour Party of the credit due to it .,36
255,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The Labour Party deserves credit for having brought this matter to the front in practical politics. But those who have been engaged in its consideration must have felt themselves confronted with any number of difficulties. Let me mention one. The price of an article is not the only thing with which the public are concerned; there is its quality also to be considered. When in New South Wales the late Sir George Dibbs brought in his first 10 per cent. Tariff, I met one of the big importers, and asked him about its operation. He said, "" We can increase prices, and thus recover the amount of the duty on some lines, but there are other lines on which we cannot do so, because the quotations for them are practically cast iron."" By way of illustration, he mentioned moleskin trousers, saying that the workers had for many years been accustomed to pay a fixed price for such garments, and that if it were increased there would be no end of trouble. I asked him, "" Are you, then, going to pay the duty on moleskin trousers?"" "" No , "" he replied, *' I am not. I have cabled to my English manufacturers, asking them to reduce the quality of the moleskins supplied to me, so that I may be able to sell at a figure which will enable me to pay the duty and have something over for myself without increasing the price to the ultimate purchasers."" No doubt when the workmen bought their moleskin trousers they said to themselves, "" What fools these free-traders are. have been told by them that the duties would increase the prices of what we bought; but we are getting moleskins now at the prices at which we have always purchased' them."" The price was not raised, but the ouality was very seriously diminished. Honourable members cannot expect those who are in business to pay duties out of their own pockets; they will always pass them on to their customers. That.is the natural incidence with all Tariffs. One of the troubles in carrying out anintelligent system such as honourable members have in view is the magnitude and the number of difficulties caused by the complexity of the questions to be considered. An article may be cheap if its quality is good although its price is high, and it may be dear if its quality is bad even though its price is low. In this connection the Acting Prime Minister jumps at the chance of creating another Department. He says, "" Let us have anInterstate Commission."" There are sevethe ral people waiting for these billets. They have been waiting for years. Sir WILLIAM LYNE.'-That is not true.",36
256,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not wish to be personal, but I may safely say that I never knew of a billet for which there were not persons waiting. Amongst other duties the Inter-State Commission could deal with the problem of how best to enforce the newprotection. Any sensible arrangement which will carry out the object of that movement will have my hearty support in every way; but let us have a sensible system which will only check what ought to be checked. We must remember that the Australian manufacturer is as much entitled as any other manufacturer to a fair profit on his entersprise - It must not be thought that I wish to deprive him of a fair and honest return on his capital. To do so would be to rob him as much as it would be to rob the worker to deprive him of fair wages.  wishes to protect the workers as well as the manufacturers.",36
257,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Yes , and that I understand, to be the object of the policy to which I am referring. Thousands of our poor people are consenting to this taxation, not to enable manufacturers to exploit them, but because they feel that they are encouraging the planting of seeds of industry which may grow into grand trees, which will shelter the future labour of Australia. The ambition is a grand one. We No one can help acknowledging that. The only question is which is the best wav to encourage our industries. The difference between free-traders and protectionists is not that the former wish to retard Australian industries, while the latter wish to assist them. We all wish to see Australian industries expand, to see industrial plants thrive; but we differ as to. the method of encouraging them. Some of us' think that artificial forcing ' cultiv'a? tion will not producethe healthy plants which will grow in the open air, and that we should consider the great primary industries which have nature working hand in hand with them, enabling Australian labour to compete in all the markets of the world, rather than those industries in which Australian labour must compete with the slum labour of other countries. Free-traders hold these views, but I trust that they are not deficient in patriotism. If protection will, without placing unfair burdens on the people, really expand the sphere of Australian industry, and create sound industrial growth, I am sure that no one will be more pleased than the free-traders that that has come about. But I hope that honourable members, in their desire to carry out a protectionist policy, will not forget the interests of the masses who are struggling upon our lands, and who have no protection to increase the prices of their products, but have to meet the urgent battles of competition in the most severe form. Not only have they to send their goods across the oceans of the world to meet the competition of the producers of other nations, but they must also battle against nature in her unkindest moods. If we put these great primary industries on a sound and lasting foundation, the other industries also cannot help thriving.",36
258,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Hume-Trea surer) [5.10] - I make no complaint about the manner in which the leader of the Opposition has dealt with this subject. If I may be allowed to say so, he has dealt with it much more temperately today than I have know""n him to deal with it before. I was very p'leased to hear him frankly admit that Australia has decided for a protective policy, and that it is not his intention to factiously oppose the passing of a protectionist Tariff.",37
259,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COURSE OF MILITARY,Were the members of the Labour Party returned as protecnext tionists ?,37
260,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,A number of them were.,37
261,Mr HALL,COURSE OF MILITARY,The majority of us were. We all spoke on the subject.,37
262,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I believe that they were returned after giving expression to their fiscal views, as well as to their views on other subjects. The right honourable member for East. Sydney referred almost gibingly to the statements of the Prime Minister and myself in theold country in regard to the Naval Agreement, and I do not think he acted quite fairly to the Prime Minister, seeing that the honourable gentleman is absent. As for myself, I do not so much mind, because I am in a position to answer criticism. Had it not been for the illness of the Prime Minister,' he would probably have already explained the action which he took in regard to this subject at the Imperial Conference and elsewhere in Great Britain.",37
263,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,Surely Ministers came to a decision on the question before the honourable gentleman and the Prime Minister went Home ? The subject was one of those on the business paper of the Conference.,37
264,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Unfortunately , I had not an opportunity to consult the Cabinet or the Prime Minister on this subject before leaving for England. I went away very hurriedly a fortnight or three weeks before the Prime Minister left. What was done in Great Britain was done largely by the Prime Minister. I know that he has very strong views on the subject of naval defence, and, as I said when asked a question , some time ago, he desires to deal with it from his own stand-point.",37
265,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,Is the Government in favour of terminating the Naval Agreement ? That is a simple question.,37
266,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,The right honourable member should ask me something easy ,37
267,Mr REIDV,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is the Minister's answer, although the Government put the subject on the business paper of the Imperial Conference?",37
268,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I leave this matter for the Prime Minister to deal with as he desires. In consequence of his illness, I have put £200,000 on the Estimates this year for the payment of our annual contribution, because that is the course which I think he would have - taken. It will be impossible to cancel the agreement this year; it probably cannot be done year. In any case, the agreement has only a few years to run.",37
269,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Fiv e years. It expires in 1912,",37
270,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I believe the honourable member for Coolgardie was quite right when he interjected that no doubt some suggestion was made by the Admiralty before a suggestion was made by the Prime Minister.,37
271,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,I do not think that that is so.,37
272,Mr KELLY,COURSE OF MILITARY,Does not the Acting Prime Minister know that Lord Tweedmouth has stated that the official view of the Admiralty is set forth in the report upon Captain Greswell's proposals?,37
273,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I - have not studied the question of defence"" so very carefully . as the honourable member has done.",38
274,Mr KELLY,COURSE OF MILITARY,The honourable member's memory cannot be so bad that he does not remember that.,38
275,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The suggestion for the cancellation of the naval agreement came from Australia, not from the Engsideration lish authorities.",38
276,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not know that that is so. The honourable member for Swan may have had a conversation with the Prime Minister on the subject, but as to that I am not aware.",38
277,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,I have had many.,38

281,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,It was six years ago.,38
282,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I.d o not know the exact date. The right honourable ber for Swan may have had conversations on the subject with the Prime Minister; but what I knew was mainly from what other way. occurred inEngland. At the present moment, the Prime Minister has asked me specially to leave this matter sideration; and, therefore, I am not to blame for not dealing with it. . Mr Reid - I do not make any plaint on that score, but merely point out that the Acting Prime Minister, after communications with the Imperial Governmember ment, apparently does not intend to stand by the arrangement.",38
283,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,The Prime Minister may do what he said he desired to do.,38
284,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,The Prime . Minister bably will; I think he will be consistent.,38
285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The Prime carry Minister at present is in such a state health that I do not care to worry about a matter of this kind; and, therefore, it will be seen that I am not in such an advantageous position as I should be if I were free to act for myself.",38
286,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,I know that the proposal did not come from the Imperial Government.,38
287,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The right honourable member may be quite right in that statement; but I never heard discussion on the matter before I reached England. The right honourable member for East Sydney referred to the attitude of the Government regarding the Braddon section and the Brisbane Conference of Premiers. All I can say is that I never knew the Braddon section to be under the conof the Cabinet, or any decision to be arrived - at yet.",38
288,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Oh , yes.",38
289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I never agreed to the proposal which has been mentioned.,38

292,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,It was before the Cabinet.,38
293,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Not when I was there, I think. I never agreed to the proposal. I was always against any idea of extending the full operation of the secmemtion beyond the ten years. I regard the continuance of the section as absurd and impossible unless taxation be raised in some",38
294,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,No one is in favour of extending the operation of the section as it for his constands; I should not be.,38
295,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I thought the right honourable member was going to supcomport the extension of the section?,38
296,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Not at all ; - but I see a his great deal in what the right honourable for Swan proposed. I do not wish, however, to express an absolute opinion on that proposal at the present time.",38
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Seeing that we have been compelled to use all but a small proportion of the balance beyond the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise prorevenue, I do not see how it will be possible, without additional revenue, to out other proposals which have been of made involving large expenditure. The him Commonwealth has . taken over States Departments, and has to make payments which the States previously made, and all that has to be done out of the one-fourth of the revenue, .whilst the three-fourths continue to go to the States. That is the cause of the trouble which exists today.",38
298,Mr TILLEY BROWN,COURSE OF MILITARY,There never would have been Federation if the three-fourths of the revenue had not been secured to the to ! States.,39

300,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The honourable member Indi is quite right. Sir WILLIAM LYNE.:-In the Federal Convention I proposed another method, which I thought better, but in the last week he accepted? the late Sir Edward Braddon introduced his proposal, and it was carried.",39

308,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am not doing anything of the kind.

322,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is not correct. The honourable member ought to know that all my life I have desired a protective Tariff, and not merely a revenue Tariff. Australia has the greatest, possibilities of any country in the world. She has more latent power and resources, and greater scope for the development of industries-sh e has the raw material to a greater extent than any country to which we can point. When Federation took place, the only really, self-contained State was the protective State of Victoria, while the free-trade State of New South Wales was the least self-contained.  get on very well!",40
323,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The spending of borrowed money was that which gave the appearance of prosperity to New South Wales. Railways and other public works were developed by means of loans; and the apparent prosperity continued so long as the loan expenditure continued. When the time came, however, for that expenditure to be reduced-and the reduction was commenced by the late Sir Henry Parkes-the n came the pinch, and there followed financial trouble. Victoria, on the other hand, showed herself to be a country so self-contained, that the people could support themselves even if they were cut off from the rest of the world.",40

The next best self-contained State at the advent of Federation was South Australia, and, of course, she had the next highest protective Tariff to that of Victoria. There seems to be some reason for the feeling of gratification that in this great Commonwealth of Australia, with its huge area, it is possible to adopt a' policy which will result in giving work - to our own people, instead of importing foreign goods from other parts of the world to the extent we do now.  policv by putting a ring fence round .^Vustra. 1 i£L",40
326,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Ye s we shall, to a certain extent. I should like to point out to the right honourable member for East Sydney that there is no increased duty on the bulk of cotton goods, except in the case of the foreigner. When we are dealing with the details of the Tariff it will be found that there are but slight increases of duty in the case of Great Britain, although there are substantial increases of duty against the foreigner. I venture to think that honourable members will assist the Government in imposing duties on foreign goods, so as to stop the wholesale depredation that the foreigner is carrying on in regard to the people of Australia today.",40
327,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Are the duties not all intended to encourage local production? Sir WILLIAM.LYNE - As far as possible. Where we have the raw material it is our duty to encourage local production; and the people have so determined.,40

329,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"We protect our own manufacturer against the whole world, up to a certain point, and against the foreigner to a greater extent. There is plenty of room, as between the two sets of duties, to assist the British manufacturer and to keep out the goods of foreign countries.  the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce.",40
330,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I know that; and I have sent a telegram to Lord Elgin stating that we cannot comply with the requests of that chamber.,40
331,Mr TILLEY BROWN,COURSE OF MILITARY,Neithe r is it the view of the consumer.,40
332,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not think the consumer says much about the matter. The right honourable member for East Syd^ ney spoke of the charges made by retailers on articles which have paid no duty. It has been said that retailers are doubling or quadrupling the amount of the duties on goods which are really of Australian manufacture, and that such acts cannot be - described as otherwise than criminal.",40
333,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"What I said was that, if retailers made a false pretence, such as had been represented to me, they were committing a criminal offence.",41
334,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"In those cases, the articles for which the high prices were charged were dutiable. Sir WILLIAML YN E - As I proved in Sydney the other night, these charges had ibeen made, in a number of cases, on goods which are not dutiable.",41
335,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,That is a dishonest act.,41
336,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I - .quite agree with the right honourable member.,41
337,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,The local manufacturer will be sure to put up his prices whenever he gets a chance to do so.,41
338,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I regret that whenever there has been a disturbance Of the Tariff this sort of thing has taken place. I feel satisfied that, when the last Tariff was introduced, prices were raised to as great an extent, proportionately, as they have been upon the present occasion. week before the introduction of the Tariff I obtained from a number ot retailers copies of their price lists, and I also secured a copy of their price lists a week after the Tariff was submitted. I did the same thing before and after the introduction of the old Tariff. Upon that occasion I found that the lists before the Tariff was introduced reflected normal prices, but after it had been submitted prices jumped up enormously. Four months later, however, they were lower than they had been prior to the introduction of the Tariff. The same thing will happen again. Honourable members will find that whenever protective duties exercise the effect which they are intended' to exercise, whenever they stimulate Australian development, prices will be lower five or six months after their imposition than they were before the Tariff was introduced.",41
339,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,How can Australian labour be paid well if prices come down? . will be paving that labour?,41
340,Sir WTLLIAMLYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I may tell the right honourable member that all my clothes are made of Australian wool, and vet about £ 1 less for them than required to pay for imported material manufactured by the cheap labour of Great Britain.. The principle underlying the policy of protection is that if we give people a greater amount of work to do^-if we provide-them with a larger output-the can afford to accept smaller profits, because they are kept out of their capital for shorter period than would otherwise be the case. That is the reason why we can get goods manufactured in Australia-althoug h we pay higher wages-at a lower price than that at which imported goods can be purchased.",41
341,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COURSE OF MILITARY,That is an exploded theory.,41
342,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,It is not.,41
343,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"If that be so, why not increase the duty by 100 per cent., - because we could not possibly have it too high?",41
344,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not know whether it would be wise to increase the duty by 100 per cent., and I will tell the right honourable member why. There is no doubt that, until the Tariff is in proper working' order, prices may be raised, but when once we have secured an expansion of trade, prices will come down.",41
345,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,The increased duties will be paid by the consumer.,41
346,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,If the honourable member had his way he would have in Australia every blackfellow from Africa> A to say nothing of labour from Japan and other places.  labour. He has emphatically said so.,41
347,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"In regard to some of the articles to which the right honourable member has referred, I want to point out that the Tariff, though a protective one, must yield an increased revenue during the current year. I feel that this Tariff, if passed in anything like its present form, will not, in two or three years' time, produce the revenue which it will yield now. - Mr Reid - The Acting Prime Minister does not desire it to do so.",41
348,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not say that it should be carried in exactly its present form, but I will not be a party to passing a wishy-washy Tariff, which will confer no good upon anybody, and which will merely yield revenue. I want to obtain a Tariff-and in this I am sure Who I shall receive the support of the House - of which Australia may be proud.",41
349,Mr WILKS,COURSE OF MILITARY,At Cootamundra the honI nav orable gentleman said the same thing of I should be the last Tariff.,41
350,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I did not, and I denied - the statement at the time.",41
351,Mr WILKS,COURSE OF MILITARY,"This is the first occasion otir upon which I have heard the statement denied by the honourable gentleman,, and, y of Gourse. 1 must acceDt his denial. .",41
352,Sir WTLLIAMLYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"j - h a v e ; made a the statement in this Chamber many times. I wish to secure an effective T a r if f ; I will not be unduly stubborn in reference to some of its items,'because it may contain anomalies, and where these can be pointed out I shall not be absolutely wedded to the schedule. 'But upon the principle of a protective Tariff I intend to take my stand, and I am sure that the House will support me in that attitude. The right honourable member for East Sydney referred to wire netting.",41
353,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,Will the Acting Prime Minister take his stand upon that item ? I defy him to do so.,42
354,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I wish to tell honourable members what I have learned within the last day or two. In New South Wales there is a wire-netting factory, which is producing 200 miles of wire netting per week. In a few months it will be producing 300 miles of wire netting per week, and at the end of the current year it will be able to produce 600 miles weekly, which is practically sufficient to satisfy the whole requirements of Australia.",42
355,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,Oh no.,42
356,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Le t the right honourable member work the'matter out for himself. This wire netting is superior to the imported article, notwithstanding that our manufacturers pay proper wages to their employees. Mr Wilks , - They do not.",42
357,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Then we shall compel them to do so. I hold in my hand a list from Messrs. Lysaght Bros., showing that their tender for wire netting which the New South Wales Government have taken by force from the Customs authorities was very little higher that which the Government accepted. Messrs. Lysaght Bros, can produce the quantity I have mentioned, and I believe that they are producing it at the present moment.",42
358,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Without the aid of any protective duty ? "" Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not know whether there was a duty upon it prior to the introduction of the present Tariff. Certainly the industry was started under the operation of a protective duty, which the right honourable member for East Sydney abolished.",42
359,Mr WYNNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No , I purchased wire net ting from Messrs. Lysaght Bros, twenty years ago.",42
360,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The industry in future at £65. was giveri an impetus in New South Wales under the Dibbs Tariff, which imposed a kind. duty of 15 per cent, upon wire netting. The right honourable member for East' Sydney abolished that duty, and the industry has scarcely existed since owing to foreign competition.",42
361,Mr WILKS,COURSE OF MILITARY,It is chiefly German wire v netting which is imported.,42
362,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Yes ; and it is brought in at a ridiculously low rate. I will not dwell upon this aspect of the matter, and I decline to accept the challenge of the leader of the Opposition to stand or f all by a 30 per cent, duty upon the item. But I maintain that there must be an effective duty. By means of the "".new protection,"" we hope to see that the public are not fleeced by the manufacturers. I shall heartily welcome suggestions, either from the Labour Party or any other section of the House, which will be of assistance to me in devising a method to protect alike employees and consumers, which may be less cumbersome than that which we adopted when we .passed the Bill relating to the Excise upon stripper-harvesters.",42
363,Mr FRAZER,COURSE OF MILITARY,The only effective method is for the Commonwealth to obtain control of industrial legislation.,42
364,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I think that there is a very great deal in that suggestion. I have not yet received the proposals which I understand have been framed by a Committee of the Labour Party, but I do not think that the imposi*tion of Excise duties is the best method of securing protection to the employees in any industry. I have in my mind the appointment of a Board of Trade or Inter-State Commission, composed of persons than who understand this question. This Board, I think, should be given power to - deal with the matter, not only as regards the wages to be .paid, but as to the charges which shall be made by the manufacturers. If honourable members will cast their minds back, they will recollect that the year before last we compelled the manufacturers to pay proper wages and to reduce the price of stripper-harvesters from £ 8 4 . to £ 7 5 during the first year, to £ 7 0 during the second year, and to £ 6 5 during this year, Consequently, the farmers-despit e the duty-ar e getting their harvesters and other machinery today much cheaper than when there was a combine T",42
365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,T- And there is statur tory warrant for the price being retained,42
366,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,Nothin g of the,42
367,Mr TILLEY BROWN,COURSE OF MILITARY,Does the honorcoffins able member think that the machines factured will be as good as they were?,43
368,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,Yes .,43
369,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,Why are the vernment increasing the duty upon harcountries. vesters ?,43
370,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"When I imported last year? brought forward the Tariff proposals last year, I proposed a duty of machine.",43
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No , the honourable gentleman's proposal was for a duty £16.",43
372,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"At any rate, the duty was reduced to £ 1 2 . We have now advanced it to £ 1 6 . Recently I ceived a deputation from manufacturers, who requested me .to alter the conditions the existing Act, so that they would be obliged to sell their machines during current year at £ 6 5 . They stated they were not able to do it. I replied I could not accede to their request. They centage. complained of the wholesale importations which are going on despite the duty posed by the Tariff, and I have consepeared quently increased that duty to £ 1 6 per machine, with a view to preventing the increase of importations.",43
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,Who would not pour tales into the honourable gentleman's ear?,43
374,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I am giving Commission. the honourable member the reasons for action.,43
375,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,We ought to see what the importations have been.,43
376,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,That informaother tion will be easy to obtain.,43
377,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The local manufacturers are selling their machines at a far higher price than they can command in the Artion, gentine - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Honourable",43
378,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am talking about Australia, and not of the Argentine. I stand for Australia, and not for the foreigner.",43
379,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Why should Australians pay more for their machines than the people of the Argentine?,43
380,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"As a result the action of the Government, the price of these machines has been reduced from £ 8 4 to £ 6 5 . Yet, when I assessed the value of the machines for Customs purable poses at £ 6 5 , some persons declared that I was doing a highly improper thing. The right honourable member . referred rather facetiously to the way in which by them. are treated under the Tariff, declarmanuing that they were free. As a matter of fact, there is a duty of 30 per cent, or* coffins coming from Great Britain, and of Go40 per cent, on those coming from other",43
381,Mr WILSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,How many coffins were,43
382,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I have not the £ 1 8 upon each slightest idea.,43
383,Mr FRAZER,COURSE OF MILITARY,The Acting Prime Minister can guarantee the honourable member of a political coffin at the next general election.,43
384,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The honourable member may then obtain one, although I redo not wish him any ill. I am endeavouring very briefly to deal with the statements of made by the leader of the Opposition. The not right honourable member spoke of a number the of articles in a way that, at first, caused that honourable members to believe that the that new duties .represented an enormous perAs a matter of fact, however, as the result , of an interjection by the honimorable member for South Sydney, it apthat the object he had in view was to show merely that the duties in respect of certain items had been increased by a certain percentage upon the previous duties., The Government admit that, in most cases, the duties have been increased. We have largely followed the reports of the Tariff my Mr FULLER - The reports of the protectionist section of the Commission.",43
385,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I do not attach much value to the recommendations of the section. The free-trade members of the Commission have recommended a free trade or revenue Tariff.,43
386,Mr FULLER,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It gives proper considerain the circumstances, to our industries. members know perfectly well that I would not have anything to do with such a Tariff as that proposed by the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission. I . admic that both sections gave a great deal of time and consideration to the work before them, and sought to give effect to their political of ideals. But it does not follow that the Government should wholly abide by their recommendations. If the Government have a policy, they must adhere to it. Honormembers will - find, on analyzing the reports of the protectionist section of the Commission, that practically the highest duties we have imposed are recommended",43
387,Mr TILLEY BROWN,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No . The Tariff is nearly 5 per cent, in excess of the duty proposed in every .case by that section.",44
388,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"There are, perhave haps, a few cases where the duties posed by us are slightly higher, but I had in mind the rates of dutieswhich we propose on imports from Great Britain. In some instances we have raised the duty 5 per cent, above the rate proposed by the protectionist section of the Commission the case of imports from foreign countries.",44
389,Mr HANS IRVINE,COURSE OF MILITARY,They were not asked to consider the question of presubject ference. ;,44
390,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I think that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and his colleagues, in one or two cases,- refer in their reports to the question of preference. In more than, one 5 per cent, preference is suggested.",44
391,Mr WILSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,That is so.,44
392,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"We are prpposing to grant Great Britain a substantial preference- a preference which, according to the reports of the officers of the Departing ment of Trade and Customs, will apply, at the outset, to British imports of the value of something like £1,200,000 per annum, and will gradually extend to J£T, 500,000 worth per annum. This advantage may . be still greater few years hence. Therefore, . it not be denied that we are proposing to grant British imports a fairly substantial preference. It is idle for honourable ber's or the press to assert that we are doing so. Judging by some of the statesequently, ments published in the British press, referred to in cablegrams appearing in tralian journals, the people of the Old Country are beginning to realise that are offering them a substantial preference. I was glad to learn, judging by the wav which my reference to it in the Budget statement was received, that a majority of honourable members were in favour of a preference being granted to British imports, and that they approved of the proposals we have made that respect. I believe, too, that honourable members were pleased to learn that the Government did not propose to retaliate because we could not .obtain from Great BriAs tain that for which we asked.",44
393,Mr ARCHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Was there, not a suggestion of retaliation in a speech made at the perial Conference?",44
394,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I think not. I took advantage of one or two opportunities while in England to say that there would be no retaliation on our part, and I thinK that the Prime Minister did the same. I not seen anything in the press to sugprogest that we hinted at retaliation ",44
395,Mr ARCHER,COURSE OF MILITARY,I am very glad to hear it.,44
396,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I certainly did not intend to suggest anything of the kind, but I cannot account for every statement attributed to me by the press. One English in newspaper tried, just as is done here sometimes, to misrepresent me in every possible way, but those who heard me refer to this in the Old Country knew perfectly well what object I had in view. We have absolutely carried out our promise to the people of Great Britain. The leader of the Opposition referred to the duty on candles. When the Dibbs Government, in New South case a Wales, imposed a duty on them",44
397,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COURSE OF MILITARY,What was the rate of. the duty ?,44
398,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,Te n per cent. ',44
399,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Whateve r it was it resulted in the price of mining candles bereduced. Prior to the imposition of the Tariff imported mining candles in Sydney were sold at the rate of 6 d. or 7d. per L lb. Three years later, as the result of the competition of the Sydney Soap and Candle Company, the prioe fell to 4jd. per lb. a The local company also turned out a better canarticle than was imported. Honourable members are aware that mining candles must be very hard, and the Svdney Soap and Canmemdle Company took care to produce such an not article. The leader of the Opposition subas the head of the Government, and in New South Wales, abolished the duty, Auswith the result that within two years the price went up to 6Jd. per lb., and the Sydwe ney Soap and Candle Company employed forty, as against nearly 500 men previously - in employed. The industry . has' been course of the struggling ever since.",44
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The honourable apparently member is romancing. . Sir WTLLIAM LYNE - I am not. The figures are to be found in the New South in Wales Hansard. I had them worked out, and placed them on record, when a member of. the State Parliament. The position is . practically the same in regard to biscuits. soon as the Dibbs Tariff came into oneration, and local manufacturers were able to compete with the importers, ' the price of Imbiscuits in New South Wales was reduced. Some of the manufacturers today object to a higher, duty simply because-as one. of them told me in Sydney the other day-the y do not want competition. A manufacturer told me in Sydney on Saturday night that he would like the duty to remain at 15 per cent., so that he would be spared further competition.",44
401,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,He said that he was willing to agree to a duty of 25 per cent.,45
402,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is not so. I was present when he spoke at the gatheris ing which the honourable member has mind, and he told me that a duty of 15 per cent, was sufficient.",45
403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,Did not Mr . kins say that he would not object to a of 25 per cent. ?,45
404,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not think so. I challenged him on the point, and he had to admit that he did not want competition. I desire to let the country know, however, that we intend to have regard, not to the wishes of Mr Hoskins, Mr Sandcertain ford, or any other individual, but for welfare of the people generally. It is desire that our manufacturing industries shall expand, and that our population shall increase. We hope to so encourage our dustries that we shall be able to convert our raw material into the manufactured article, and thus open up new avenues employment, in which good wages will be paid. Unless we could secure that, I should not give a snap of the finger for any indusUnited try. Before the Tariff leaves this House, if I have charge of it-and I think I shall - it will provide for what is known "" the new protection,"" so that overcharging sail of Europe. shall be impossible, and proper rates of wage will be paid in all industries affected by it.",45
405,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,And will that system of new protection be carried out more satissatisfactory factorily than is the present arrangement in regard to the Excise duty on agriculhomes. tural machinery?,45
406,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I am making inI quiries in regard to what is done under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act.,45
407,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That which is taking place is simplv shocking. Sir WILL i AMLYNE - I hope that anything wrong that is taking place will brought to light, and that we shall punish 'those who are responsible for it.",45
408,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"On e manufacturer who ling has been exempted from Excise duty is working his men fifty-six hours a week, not paying them overtime. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Inquiries are now being made by my direction. Tariff will do good, not to any particular individual,^ but to Australia as a whole. If , as the"" result of it , competition is increased, there need be no fear of increased prices. . As the result of the passing of this Tariff, we shall probably have better manufactures, a larger population, and really good rates ofwages prevailing. No country prosperous unless the wages paid to its in working classes are satisfactory. The workers are the best circulating medium. When they are well paid trade generally is Hosin a flourishing condition, and industries duty in which they are employed are able to afford good wages.",45
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,The honourable member does not forget that wages-are relative ?,45
410,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not. Perhaps in some cases, as the result of the payment of higher rates of wages, the price of goods may-bu t only for a timethe be increased. The.leader of the Opposiour tion referred to the United States, which, he said, has a population of 83,000,000. I hope that if we proceed on proper lines inour population will increase almost as all rapidly as the 'population of America has done. The right honourable member was of hardly fair when he declared that we should only double our present population in sixty years. He must not forget that the States and Canada are practically at the front door of the Old World, with its teeming millions anxious to set out for as new lands. They are within a few days' People, in Great Britain and other countries who may desire to emigrate are attracted to such places because they know that should the climate prove unsuitable, or the working conditions unto them, they , will have no difficulty in returning quickly to their old On the other hand, Australia is practically at.the other end of the world. n many cases, a man believes that in emigrating from Great Britain to Australia, he would be leaving his home for ever, and the fear that he might disapprove of the conditions prevailing in Australia, and find it impossible to return, very often causes him to hesitate before booking his passage be to such a far distant land. If we are to do anything to attract population we must increase in every possible way the travelfacilities between Australia and Great Britain. We must quicken our means and of communication with the Old World, and must advertise Australia in a way that has hitherto not been attempted. We may not This increase our population as rapidly as Canada and the United States have done, but I believe that by improving our means of communication, and making"" known the resources of Australia in the old land we shall do much in that direction. It is not - necessary for me to deal further with the questions raised by the leader of the Opposition. We are now in Committee, and should any further explanation be necessary, I shall be prepared .at the proper time to give it. I hope that this matter will not be talked - to death, but that we shall proceed with expedition. After Friday next, when I hope to deal with a matter in regard to which the Prime Minister is anxious, I shall try to* provide for the consideration of the Tariff without interruption, and I hope to get rid of it at the earliest date possible, because it is only fair that importers and the public should know what are to be the permanent rates of duty. They should not be kept in suspense. It will not be the fault of the Ministry, certainly it will not be my fault, if the Committee does not deal with the Tariff with greater rapidity than"" was prophesied the other night, when it was said that its consideration would not be finished until after Christmas. I do not think that there is any good reason why it should not be passed within three months.",45
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,Will the Minister accept it without any alteration?,46
412,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No . been told that an alteration or adjustment is required in regard to the tobacco duties. I find, too, that retailers have increased price of kerosene, although there is no duty on kerosene imported in bulk, but only on kerosene imported in tins, of which there is now about fifteen months' supply in the Commonwealth.",46
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,Anothe r Minister told us this afternoon that there is only six months' supply.,46
414,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am speaking on the authority of a report furnished by the Comptroller-General of Customs. my mind, it was an immoral thing for' the retailers of kerosene to raise its price as they have done. The price of tea has also been increased, although there is a duty only on tea imported in packets. .That duty was .imposed to provide for the work of putting up tea in packets being done in Australia instead of in Ceylon or in China. There is no duty ontea imported in chests.",46
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"If traders do not stop these practices, the honourable gentleman will run their businesses for them.",46
416,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I do not know about that, but there is a temptation to interfere when they do such things as are being done now. Action must be taken to prevent imposition upon the public such as has been practised by retailers, and possibly by importers, during the last fortnight.",46
417,Mr FULLER,COURSE OF MILITARY,Will the honourable gentleman take steps to prevent the price of shares in woollen mills being increased because of the Tariff?,46
418,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I hope that the price of such shares will increase. With regard to the price of wire netting, I have an undertaking from Messrs. Lysaght Bros, that, even if the duty remains at 30 per cent., it will not be increased, and I understand that there will be no increase of the prices of the productions of our woollen mills.' The statements which I have made should open the eyes of the public to the fact that those engaged in the selling of goods are making a gigantic haul.",46
419,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COURSE OF MILITARY,A haul is being made all round.,46
420,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,The South Australian Government has saved its farmers from £ 6 to jQ& a mile by importing wire netting.,46
421,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I regret havI have ing had to make an announcement about the action of the Premier of New South Wales in seizing wire netting in Sydney today. the The occurrence was a most serious one.,46
422,Mr FULLER,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I think that, if the Minister will look at the case recorded in the book which I am handing to him, he will find that the New South Wales Government is in the right.'",46
423,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,The New South Wales Government has no right to take by force anything in the control of the Customs Department.,46
424,Mr FULLER,COURSE OF MILITARY,A legal decision was To given in its favour.,46
425,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,Why has not the Premier of New South Wales acted in a legal way?,46
426,Mr FULLER,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am not defending his action. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - I wish to act discreetly in this matter, but honourable members must not be surprised should I take an extreme course, if there is a necessity to do so.",46
427,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,The honourable gentleman should act in regard to the Premier of New South Wales as he would act in regard to a private individual.,47
428,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I wish it to go forth that I am taking what I consider a lenient course of action. Since I spoke this afternoon, the affair has been aggravated. I have since sent a temperate wire to the Premier of New South Wales, and I think that he will read between the lines. I have to uphold the powers of the Commonwealth, and I hope that he will not, by continuing his present line of conduct, force the Commonwealth to assert its powers.",47
429,Mr GLYNN,COURSE OF MILITARY,The Government has a very easy remedy. It can sue him.,47
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,""" Johnny, ' get your gun.""",47
431,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I do not wish to say anything about guns. I have taken a very lenient and discreet course; but is a very annoying and aggravating thing to have the Commonwealth defied.,47

433,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"When the and goods are gone, I do not know what legal remedies there are.",47
434,Mr WYNNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,Has not the Premier of New South Wales broken bond?,47

439,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The Commonwere wealth must not be defied in this way. the State Government could rightly take anything out of the Customs stores with the assistance of the police, it could take everything. However, I shall not say more on the subject now. In any case, I do not wish to act too soon, or to go-to extremes unless I am compelled to do so.",47

At the present stage, I do regard it as necessary or advisable to enterx into a very profound discussion of detailsSuch a discussion ought to take place later on, as the various items come before us. But, in a big scheme like this, there are necessarily certain features, or portions, which loom more largely than others,, and naturally command attention. These are entitled to prominence in the preliminary stages of the debate. At the outset, I desire to express my satisfaction at the manner in which the leader of the Opposition, who"" represents the free-trade party in this Chamber, and in the country,, opened the debate. I think from the attitude which he has assumed- I presume as the representative of the important party which he leads-that the discussion of the Tariff will be expedited, and its ultimate settlement facilitated. We approach the discussion of this Tariff under circumstances which are much more favourable for it fair debate and consideration than those under which we approached the discussion of the first Commonwealth Tariff in October, 1901. At that time the situation was extremely complicated, full of doubtsobscurities. Honourable members were met with conflicting interests and opinions, while the materials at their disposal for arriving at a conclusion were imperfect and inadequate. But now the Committee has it the evidence collected by a Royat Commission, appointed at the instance of Parliament. 'That Commission has conducted investigations throughout the whole of Australia, and has given every person interested in Tariff questions an opportunity to be heard. TheTariff now before view us is, in the main, the outcome of prolonged, sustained, and closely prosecuted investigations, inquiries, and deliberations, conducted throughouc the Commonwealth by the authority and with the cognizance of Parliament. Upwards of 767 complaints presented to the Commission for inI f vestigation, and for the presentation of those complaints 618 witnesses attended, and were examined and subjected to the rigid scrutiny of cross-examination. Therefore, the Commission had an abundance of material to assist it in arriving at its conclusions and recommendations; and, as the result of its labours, Parliament and this Committee have abundance of materials to the enable honourable members to review the recommendations of the Commission, and to facilitate their arrival at such concluthe sions ""as may be thought just. As a. memnot iber of the Commission, I have done my duty according to my best judgment, and am willing to submit my work to the consideration of Parliament. I shall not complain if the conclusions of the Commission are differed from, or if , instead of being accepted, they are rejected or altered. My attitude throughout the discussion of the Tariff will be characterized by a readiness to vindicate and to defend the recommendations of the Commission if attacked, and to explain when explanation is called for. The object and business of the Commission, as described in the instrument by which it was appointed, was to inquire into the extent to which Australian industries were affected by the working of the Tariff, and into the working of the Tariff itself. The Commission was a very wide one, covering the whole field of Tariff operations, industrial and technical, real and substantial grievances, and mere anomalies. Personally, I .found, in the course of the investigations of the Commission, that, in Victoria, and in other States, a number of industries have been materially and seriously affected by the Tariff. In some instances, factories have been absolutely closed; in others operations have been interfered with or hampered, the output having been reduced, and hands discharged because of the increase of importations. That was the general character and trend of the complaints and grievances put before us. In a few instances, factories have been completely closed. That Was the case with distilleries in Melbourne, and galvanized iron factories in-South Australia.  affected ?",47
441,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I hope that the honourable member will not ask me to go into details now. If I did so, I could not finish my speech to-night. When we are dealing with individual items, I shall be willing to give such information as honourable members may ask for in regard to them. Some industries were closed completely, and others impaired in their operations, though not closed. In other words, the number actually closed was not so great; but the number that had been affected, injuriously, and were not able to extend operations, as it was thought they should, was undoubtedly very large. In addition, the Commission felt justified in devoting their tion to such questions as-ho w far could these and other Australian industries be expanded, stimulated, and enlarged in their operations, and how far could other' Australian industries be called into existence by a re-adjustment of the Tariff? Honourable members will, on examining our recommendations, find that some are based on the necessity of granting immediate and strong relief to industries which have been injuriously affected. I admit frankly that a large number of the recommendations which finds expression in the Commission's scheme are. for the purpose of assisting in the creation and development of new industries, or, at any rate, of assisting industries that at present are merely in an incipient and preliminary condition. With reference to the Tariff generally, honourable members will, I think, find recommendations and suggestions calculated to remove anomalies in the incidence of Customs and Excise duties, to improve the methods of - classification and division, and details of that character. Looking at the broad outlines of the Tariff, I say frankly that, in my opinion, the most important department is that which relates to metals and machinery. I place this in the forefront of the Tariff; and, in fact, would place it in the forefront of the Tariff of any civilized nation. It ought to be readily understood and appreciated in these modern times that no nation can hope to gain or maintain supremacy in industries or in national life, unless it endeavours to secure and maintain a lead in the production of iron and in all work therewith connected. Ironworks necessarily constitute the basis and foundation of our industrial system. It has been well said that if Britain loses her supremacy in the - production of pig iron, the supremacy of the British Navy will be endangered. Pig iron is the foundation of all our greatarmaments, and in its various evolutions, manifestations, and developments, constitutes the basis of our industrial life and system. Therefore, we strongly urge that the Committee should give the most kindly and favourable consideration to the development of our iron resources, and the maintenance arid progress of our engineering and mechanical industries. I should like, in the first place, to say a few words, starting, as it were, at the basis of the iron industry, namely, the development of our iron ores. I cannot but regard with pride, and a feeling of patriotism, th strenuous beginning of the iron industry a at that place called Eskbank, in New South attenWales. Those works are, at present, carried on by Mr Sandford and his collaborateurs, associates, and partners; but the industry was pioneered even before he took the field. We cannot but regard his efforts, his ambitions, and his scheme, with favour. and desire to assist and support him in every honourable, reasonable, and legitimate way. I know'that Mr Sandford is in the position that he either wants a bonus on the production of irom, or a duty on bar, rod, and sheet iron. I must say that, anxious and strong as I am in my desire to assist Mr Sandford, or any one else in a corresponding position in the development of the iron industry, I cannot at present see my way to support or recommend the imposition of an import duty on bar, rod, or sheet iron. But I certainly would be prepared to go to any reasonable length in assisting Mr Sandford and his partners in working up their industry by means of a bonus, if a scheme could be devised that would be favourably considered by Parliament. Only in one of these two ways can Mr Sandford be assisted; and I have arrived at the conclusion that at the present stage the proper method is by a bonus on the output of pig iron, or some other form of iron. If a duty were imposed on bar iron or pig iron it would, unfortunately, at any rate for some time to come, be a greatburden on all engineering and other works which consume iron throughout Australia. Next to the production of iron ores comes, necessarily, the engineering industry, that is, the work done within our foundries and workshopsthe manipulation and treatment of the raw material, and its conversion into the finished article.",48
442,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Has Mr. not more iron than he can sell at the present time?,49
443,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I believe that Mr. Sandford has plenty of iron, but the difficulty is about the price under present conditions. I do not think any difficulty ought to be encountered in giving due consideration to the claim for additional protection and assistance in the engineering industry. Under the late T a r if f . the protection on engines, machines, and machinery was - unfortunately reduced to 12'J per cent.. But that that duty was inadequate has been proved by the swollen volume of importations, and the reduced output of the engineering works and foundries.",49
444,Mr GLYNN,COURSE OF MILITARY,We must not forget that the cost of importation is 26 per cent.,49
445,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I was talking generally about the 12 per cent.; we all know there are other considerations. I am now dealing with my own conclusions, which may be assailed afterwards. I am of opinion that the duty under the late Tariff Sitting was too low; .and I am willing and anxious to afford substantial protection. My colleagues and I propose a substantial increase, which has been said to be an increase of 100 per cent.; that is, we recommend that the duty shall be raised from 12^ per cent, to 25 per cent. That duty applies to most of the large agricultural implements and machinery, and also to large engines and machines in connection with other industries, reserving a proportion of what we may call the n.e.i. residue of agricultural implements at 25 per cent., and another portion at 12J per cent., because they are considered of small importance, and as not requiring the same high standard of protection. Generally speaking, our recommendation with reference to ironworks and engineering works, increase the protection all round from 12 per cent, to 25 per 1 cent., with the one exception of brasswork. In regard to the latter, there were, in our opinion, special reasons which justified the recommendation of myself and my protectionist colleagues that the import duty should be increased to 30 per cent. Those special reasons will be found fully explained in the reports of the Commission. Then next to the iron industry', in my opinion, stands the textile industry. In a great country like Australia, with its large flocks and herds, affording illimitable possibilities for the production of wool and the manufacture of' fabrics from the raw material, it behoves Parliament and the people to endeavour to Sandford lay on broad and enduring foundations the woollen industry. It is true that in years gone by duties were imposed and endeavours made to promote and develop the woollen industry in Victoria and other States. It is true also that the success achieved under the States Tariffs and the States systems has' not been so great as the admirers and supporters of the industry desire to see realized! I ' think, however, that, with a united Australia, and a system of Inter-State free-trade-wit h all the possibilities of the interchange of specialties of production in each State, and in view of what it is 'hoped will be the greater popularization of'the Australian produced article-w e may fair l y expect - the woollen industry to rise 'superior to the depression into which it has fallen in consequence of the inadeouate support received by it of late years. I join with those who lay great stress on the 1 necessity and importance of promoting the woollen industry. suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.",49
446,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"When the adjournment hour arrived I was drawing attention to the importance of the woollen industry, and to the necessity of protecting the woollen factories which have already been established under States law. Under the old Commonwealth Tariff the duty upon woollen piece goods was 15 per cent., and the manufacturers of the several States complained of the utter inadequacy of that impost. They suggested that it should be increased to 30 per cent. With my protectionist colleagues upon the - Commission I felt that if we were to make any change whatever in the rate of duty levied, it ought to be one of a substantial character, and that it ought to ceed upon the same lines as we followed in connection with the engineering industry. Therefore, we proposed that the existing duty should be doubled. In other words, we recommended that the duty upon piece goods should be increased to 30 per cent., and that upon blankets to 25 per cent. We thought that these were fair increases, which were justified by the circumstances. We believe that it will be impossible for the woollen industry in Australia to hold its own-muc h less to make any progressunless it is. shielded, by substantial Tariff - duties, from inferior shoddy goodsj the product of the cheap labour and lower industrial conditions of other countries. We found that there was strong reason for believing that Australia had become the dumping ground for the sweepings of the world's markets, and we were of opinion that a supreme effort should be made to make the woollen industry a national one, of which the people might be justly proud. If we fail to do that it will not be the fault of this Parliament should it adopt these recommendations-it will be owing to circumstances over which we have no control. But I consider that it is the duty of Parliament to give every support to this great industry. I believe that I am justified in saying-as the result of the evidence presented to the Commission-that many woollen mills have been dragging out a bare existence during the past few years, and have not realized the expectations of their founders or of those who have invested their money in them. Many persons have spent fortunes in attempting to develop the woollen industry of Australia, and few have obtained any adequate return for their outlay. If , under a. united Australia, they cannot obtain better protection than was granted to them by the several States, it is just as well that they should be made aware of the fact, and the sooner the better. They will then know that the struggle is hopeless, and that there are limitations to their prospects. With reference to the future of the woollen industry, I frankly admit that we have recommended these increases, not for the purpose of enabling manufacturers to carry on their present operations and to produce medium or lower class goods, but to assist them to launch out into a wider field, and to lay clown plants for the production of high-class tweeds. The members of the Commission were informed toy a leading Collins-street tailor that if we wished to pro- establish the woollen industry in Australia upon a sound and permanent footing, we must recommend the adoption of an almost prohibitive duty, and make it operative for at least twenty years. It is idle to adopt a small measure of protection. We must grant the industry substantial protection and guarantee its continuance for some time, otherwise men will not invest"" their money in it. If it is to succeed at all it will succeed under the Commission's proposals. Of course woollen piece goods constitute the foundation of the whole industry. They represent the starting point in the scheme of duties relating to apparel and textiles. Some honourable members have expressed surprise that the duty upon ready-made apparel and attire has been increased to-as much as 40 per cent. But if we place a high duty, such as 30 per cent, upon piece goods which are the raw material out of which clothing is manufactured, we must necessarily increase proportionately the duty upon the finished product in the shape x>f ready-made clothing. If we increased the duty upon piece goods, and did not raise that upon the finished article, the whole of the trade would naturally be driven in the direction of the importation of the finished article. Although it was with very great regret that I felt compelled to 'recommend an increase in the duty upon ready-made woollen clothing to 40 per cent, I saw no logical escape from that position. That duty represents 10 per cent, in excess of the impost upon the raw material. If we are to establish the woollen industry, and if that course requires substantial protection, we must allow a margin of 16 per cent, between the duty upon the raw material and that upon the finished article. Otherwise the entire trade, will be driven in the direction of increased importation, and the duty will prove a total failure. Therefore the duties upon piece goods and upon the ready-made article form part of one scheme. They dovetail into each otherthey are inseparable. At the same time we did not desire to recommend an increase of duty upon all ready-made articles to 40 per cent., and therefore we suggested that the duty upon non-woollen clothing should be 35 per cent. Reference has been made to the. difference between the duty upon woollen goods and that upon silk clothing ancl silk piece goods. The cause of that difference is obvious. The silk piece goods, which are charged only 15 per cent., are not goods made, or at present capable of being made, in Australia. It would be an outrage on common-sense to increase the duty on silk piece goods to the same extent as that upon woollen piece goods. For a similar reason there is no necessity to increase the duty upon garments made of silk to the same standard as the duty upon .garments made of wool. A similar remark is applicable to velvets, which are dutiable at 15 per cent. They are differentiated ""from woollen piece goods for the reason I have indicated. Velvets are not made in Australia, and there is no prospect of them - being made here, consequently they are charged a lower rate of duty, namely, 15 per cent. The same reasoning applies to other items in the piece goods list. Just as wool is the produce oian animal, so .also is leather as a raw material. .glad indeed to be able to give to the House a better account of the progress of the boot, shoe, and leather industry than - I have been able to give with reference to the woollen industry. I am pleased to - be able to say that my colleagues and myself representing the tionist members of the Commission did not feel called upon to re-commend any increase in 'the present duty of 30 per cent, upon boots and shoes generally. We have, however, suggested an increase in the duty upon infants' shoes from 20 per cent, 'to 30 per cent, for the purpose of establishing a common range of duty upon the whole of these articles of footwear. I am glad to say .that the manufacture of leather in Australia has proceeded very satisfactorily of late years, and that evenin the production of some - of the high-grade leathers, such as glace kid, there has been a distinct improvement. Although some of the boot and shoe manufacturers desired certain other alterations in the Tariff, we were not able to recommend them. We did! not feel called upon to recommend everything that we were asked to endorse. We exercised our deliberate judgment in respect of the various items, and if we were of opinion that a strong case had not been made out we declined to recommend any increase. Other items connected with the raw materials proceeding from beasts are those of candles and soap. In reference to candles we found that the manufacture of candles from stearine, which is the product of tallow, had been established in various States such as Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. But of late years the stearine candle-making industry has had to encounter a very formidable rival in the shape of candles made from paraffine wax, which is a by-product of petroleum. These candles are brought from America, and also from Rangoon. The candle-makers of the States to which I have referred complained of the undue competition of these paraffine wax candles. We felt that their case had been sustained, and accordingly recommended an increase in the duty upon paraffine wax candles of i d . per lb. At the same time we recognised that there were candle-makers in Tasmania and New South Wales who were making composite candles-that is, candles composed partly of stearine and partly of paraffine wax-and we declined to accede to the reI am quest to increase the duty upon paraffine wax, as the raw material, because any such action would oppressively affect the manufacturers in question. I draw attention to other by-products of beasts, in the shape of glue and gelatine. They are also important'and valuable manuprotec- factures which ought certainly to be stimulated in Australia. I see no reason why in a country abounding in cattle and animal life generally we should need to import glue and gelatine. I frankly admit that we have recommended a substantial, and what we hope will prove an effective, duty on those commodities. Passing from animal life to the forest and field, I should like to draw attention to the scheme of duties upon timber, woodware, and furniture. I have read and heard of a great outcry against some of the timber duties. The starting point of our duties on timber is founded on the necessity of promoting and encouraging the use of timber existing at the present time in Australia, and also the maintenance and continuance of our forests for use in future years.",50
447,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Can we grow such timber as we now import largely from New Zealand? Take, for example, Oregon?",52
448,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The honourable member will obtain that information on perusing the evidence taken before the Commission. Meanwhile I am giving the Committee merely a sketch of our proceedings. I should take up too much time if I were to go' into details. If there are any complaints in reference to the timber duties they may all be traced to the starting point, namely, - the duty on undressed timber. The object of that duty is to induce the manufacturers of woodwork and makers of furniture to use the Australian-grown article. I was surprised and delighted, iri the course of my travels and investigations, to hear and learn of the splendid timber resources of our continent. The timber supplies of Western Australia are almost illimitable. we find jarrah, karri, tuart, and other timbers of great service for building and other purposes. In Tasmania we have hardwood, such as stringy-bark and bluegum; iri Victoria we have messmate, bluegum, and biackwood; in the great State of Queensland we have hoop-pine, soft woods, cedars, silky oak, and other most beautiful timbers, samples of which would surprise and delight honourable members. I deeply regret that the wonderful forest resources of the great State of Queensland are not properly known and appreciated by the people of Australia - I am absolutely convinced that if the value and utility of those splendid timbers were known by the workers and manufacturers of Victoria we should not hear so much here about the necessity for the importation of Oregon and New Zealand timbers, or of Baltic and other foreign woods. I am sure that manufacturers here, if they knew of these timbers, would give a fair trial to them, as well as to the timbers of New South Wales, where many of the same splendid trees are growing in glorious magnificence.",52
449,Mr WILKS,COURSE OF MILITARY,Some of the timber in the forests in the northern parts of New South Wales cannot Be got at.,52
450,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,It will never be got at unless we give the industry a start.,52
451,Mr WILKS,COURSE OF MILITARY,It will not be given a start by the Tariff.,52
452,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"We shall try, at all events, to give it a start. . I admit that some people engaged in the timber trade in Melbourne asked for free timber. I felt, however, that I should not be doingmy duty as a member of a CommonwealthTariff Commission if I did not seek to dojustice to the resources and wishes of the other States as well as to those of the State with which I am more intimately associated. I am, therefore, determined that, as far as possible, the timbers of New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia shall have a fair show. If these duties are altered to the prejudice of the forest resources of the Continent it will not be my fault. Passing on to another branch of natural or primary industries, we come to the pottery and earthenware trade. Pottery is one of the most ancient industries. It is founded entirely upon the soil. Here in Australia we certainly ought to have enough enterprise and sufficiently skilled artificers to make all the pottery and earthenware necessary for local requirements. I There view with a great deal of sympathy and interest the industries of the kind already established, and look forward to the time when they will obtain an even stronger hold upon the support of the people of Australia than they have at present. In South Australia more particularly the Commission received very valuable information from a local potter. Taking us through his establishment, he pointed out a splendid array of work that he had manufactured, and for which he could find no market When asked the reason for this he replied:' "" The merchants find that they can import pottery and earthenware much cheaper than we could make it here, and consequently we shall have to, close down unless something be done in the direction of increased consideration and protection for us."" Pursuing the same principle which guided my own judgment in other matters, whilst prepared to support an increased protection to earthenware and pottery, I was not prepared to recommend an increased duty upon chinaware, although the Commission were asked to do so by a South Australian witness. I took up this stand for the reason that the industry of chinaware is more advanced and more scientific, involves more expense and greater aptness on the part of artificers, as well as.more capital, than does the production of earthenware pottery. At the same time, it is my duty to mention, in the interests of South Australia, that we were informed that on Kangaroo Island there was discovered not long ago splendid raw material in the shape of vast deposits of china clays. It is believed that in time these will assist in laying the foundation for the manufacture of chinaware in Australia.",52
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,We have plenty of china clays in New South Wales.,53
454,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I was not so informed as a member of the Commission, but am glad to hear it. Believing that an extra duty on chinaware might merely operate as a revenue impost, while having an oppressive effect on existing industries, I do not see my way clear to go to that extent at the present time. I come now to glassware and bottles. The glassware and bottle making industry may be regarded by some people as ephemeral-on e that ought to be able to carry on without any protection. In the United States of America everything possible is done to localize and increase bottle factories. In some districts the municipal councils go so far as to offer sites for bottle and glass factories to induce manufacturers to establish them in their midst, so as to settle an industrial population in and around given townships and centres. The glassware and bottle making industries may be considered as native, and "" to the manner born,"" since these goods are made mainly of common sand, with a few chemicals added. The industry can be easily established in any country. Very strong efforts have been made in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales to establish the manufacture of bottles and various grades of glassware. To a certain extent those efforts have been successful, but it is said that of late the existence of these factories has been threatened by the fierce competition with which they are beginning to meet on the part of Germany and Japan. It has been found, according to the evidence put before usand it is for honourable members to say whether or not they believe it-that vast quantities of bottles have been shipped to Australia and sold at prices so inadequate that the suspicion that they have been sold at cutting rates in order to help to destroy the local factories appears to be well founded. I hope that honourable members will approach the consideration of the duties on glassware and bottles from a favourable stand-point, in view of the few remarks I have made in'support of them. Next on the list come marble, slate, roofing tiles, salt, and other products of the soil. Splendid marble deposits exist at Angaston and Kapunda in South Australia, and also at Mount Wills in Gippsland. In New South Wales, likewise, there are splendid deposits.",53
455,Mr KNOX,COURSE OF MILITARY,And also in Tasmania.,53
456,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I did not hear of them, but am glad to have the honourable member's assurance. We had expert evidence given by highly-trained professional sculptors that some of the marble deposits of Australia are equal to the marble quarries out of which Imperial Rome was built, and that there are marvellous possibilities connected with the marble resources of the Continent. Roofing tiles are made in Western Australia, and splendid roofing slates are quarried in South Australia.",53
457,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,At Willunga.,53
458,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is so. I was delighted with the evidence of the natural resources of South Australia in many respects, and wish to express my surprise that many of those resources have not been better known and more fully developed. I should like to refer now to the duty on salt. The subject was well discussed in the first Parliament, and honourable members will probably have the old story retold. I hope, however, that the case for a duty on salt will be presented this time in a more business-like manner, and that the arguments and facts in support of it will be put more forcibly before the Committee. We intend to strongly support a duty of J £ I per ton on bulk salt. I believe the result of that duty will, be to maintain salt production in Victoria and South Australia, and to enlarge the scope very and the operation of those firms which are already engaged in the industry. We were informed that there are salt deposits in Western Australia.",53
459,Mr HEDGES,COURSE OF MILITARY,Yes ; at Esperance. There are millions of tons of salt there.,53
460,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"A man wished to. give evidence on the subject, but, unfortunately, he was unable to travel to Kalgoorlie to do so. If honourable members examine the 'minutes of evidence, they will find it clearly proved that, since the establishment of salt works in Victoria and South Australia, the wholesale selling price of salt has been enormously reduced. That may be mentioned as one of the most convincing proofs that the establishment of local industries has the result, in many cases, not of increasing, but of reducing prices. I desire, wherever I can, to put in a word for Queensland,.the only State which:, up to the present time, .has produced a superior - and high grade mineral water. That water is known as Helidon Spa water. When at Brisbane, the Commission had the pleasure of hear the proprietors of the springs, who, in our opinion, made out a fairly strong case for increased protection against the importation of mineral waters from Germany and Japan. I need not take up time in drawing attention to the necessity for fostering the production of sugar and cotton in Australia, to which reference was made recently during the debates on the Bounties Bill. If anything can be done to stimulate the growing of cotton within the Commonwealth, Parliament should do it. I believe that there is a great future for the cotton industry ini Australia, and I earnestly invite honourable members to read the evidence given before the Commission in Brisbane by experts appointed to speak on behalf of the Queensland Government.",53
461,Mr ATKINSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Does the honourable member wish for a bounty and a duty as well ?,54
462,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am not speaking about bounties at the present timethey were dealt with when the Bounties Bill was under consideration- I am merely mentioning one or two industries which I think should be fostered. Tobacco growing is another industry which should be encouraged. If honourable members examine the scheme of the Excise and Customs duties on tobacco; recommended by the Commission, they will probably be agreeably surprised to find that its members, free-trade and protectionist, were almost in accord in regard to it, differing only as to whether the import duty on plug tobacco should be increased by 3d. The protectionist members of the Commission have no desire to make any change in the Tariff which would increase the protection given to the manufacturers of plug tobacco made from imported leaf. On the contrary, we felt that that protection should, if anything, be reduced. Under the old Tariff, the difference between the .Customs and Excise duty amounted to about od., and under the present Tariff it amounts to 3d. where stemmed leaf is used, and to 6d. where unstemmed leaf is usedThe object of - reducing the advantage on plug tobacco made from imported leaf is to induce, by all the force of law, Australian manufacturers to use locally grown leaf. If locally grown leaf is used, the protection, instead of being 3d. or 6d., will be is. 6d. per lb. In effect, we are saying tp the manufacturers, "" You have imported too much leaf, to the neglect of the locally-grown leaf. If , in the future, you use Australian leaf, your profits will be increased, while, if you insist on importing the leaf you use to make plug tobacco, they will be reduced. As to the quality of Australian-grown tobacco, I ask honourable members to read the evidence of Mr, Neville, the Queensland Government expert, which is well worth consideration and attention. Mr Neville was formerly.employed in tobacco factories in the United States; I think in Virginia. .He came to Queensland with a splendid reputation, and is probably the best tobacco expert in Australia. In my opinion, he shows conclusively that there are vast, regions in Queensland where the best tobacco in the world could be grown in almost illimitable quantities, and such tobacco has been grown there-tobacc o suitable for plug-making, and tobacco which could be used for cigars and cigarettes.' His evidence was confirmed 1 by other witnesses examined in South Australia, and in Western Australia. The manufacturers of tobacco have not given the Australian leaf a fair trial. For some reason, best known to themselves, they have done all that they can to depreciate the locallygrown leaf, and are moving Heaven and earth to obtain concessions in favour of imported leaf.",54
463,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Unde r the Tariff which we are amending, what inducement per lb. was given to the manufacturers for the use of colonial leaf?",54
464,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Ver y little. Thedifference between Customs and Excise duties was od. per lb. in favour of tobacco made from imported leaf. Now we sav to the manufacturers, ""Your importations of leaf have been too great. Wewish you in future""to use Australian leaf.""",54
465,Mr GLYNN,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I heard a deputation in Adelaide on Monday whose, members informed me that Australian leaf cannot be used. - Sir JOHN QUICK - I decline to take my Tariff views from persons who arefinancially interested in importing leaf, and who are determined, at all hazards, to use imported leaf.",54
466,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The deputation re-, ferred to was composed of employees.",54
467,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The manufacturers are putting up their workers to disparage this Tariff, because they have beens deprived of the advantage of 9d. to which I have referred.",54
468,Mr GLYNN,COURSE OF MILITARY,Thos e who saw me were honest men.,55
469,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No doubt the ployes are feeling the pinch at the present time; but if the manufacturers give the Australian leaf a fair trial, they will not ultimately be prejudiced. I hope that the Committee will not be led by the nose by the manufacturers, but will be guided by the evidence of the Commission.",55
470,Mr SAMPSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Was not colonial leaf used almost exclusively in Queensland prior to Federation?,55
471,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Unde r the Queensland Tariff the importation of tobacco leaf almost ceased, and locally-grown leaf was used almost to the exclusion of imported leaf. The experience of the people of Queensland is recorded in the Commission's minutes of evidence. Witnesses made a strong appeal to the Commission on behalf of the tobacco-growers of Queensland, and I hope that honourable members will read that evidence before listening to the suggestions of interested manufacturers. Until the tobacco manufacturers have shown a disposition to give Australian-grown leaf a fair trial, they should not attempt to dictate to - us in this matter. We ought to encourage the growing of tobacco, not only in Queensland, but also in New South Wales and Victoria, and locally-grown leaf would not be used by the manufacturers if. the inducement to use imported leaf for plug tobacco which they had under the old Tariff were continued. It is only by forcing them to use Australian leaf, by making it profitable for them to do so, that we shall establish our tobacco industry on a secure and enduring foundation.",55
472,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,Does the honourable .member think that consideration should be given to the manufacturers of hand-twisted tobacco ?,55
473,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No evidence was given before the Commission in regard to twisted tobacco specially, and itherefore we have not made any particular recommendation on the subject, but I shall be quite prepared to consider any proposal in regard to it . '",55
474,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,If Parliament gave manufacturers a concession of 9d. per lb. for the use of imported leaf they cannot be blamed for having used it .,55
475,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,We wish to abolish that concession. [76],55
476,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,It shows what a strange Parliament it is when it can make such an egregious blunder.,55
477,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It is useless to go eminto that matter now. In our endeavour to encourage the manufacture of plug tobacco, we prejudiced the use of locallygrown leaf. I have now' referred to what I described at the beginning of my speech as some of the leading and predominating features of the Tariff. My idea of protection is that we should first consider whether we can grow or produce locally the raw materials of industries, whether from plant or animal life, or from the soil. If we car, we have a solid foundation upon which to build up industries under protective duties. If we have the raw materials, my view of a true protectionist policy is that we should aim at the development of their production. That is the reason I started by referring to iron ores, wool, and the various products of the soil. If we can point to natural resources, let us start to develop, improve, and apply them to the uses, requirements, and comforts of mankind. If we have not those natural resources, then I say that the industry which starts on the assumption that we must import all the raw material stands at a disadvantage. If we have those raw materials in our midst and practically inexhaustible, there is the stronger reason for supporting an industry springing out of such materials, than for supporting more ephemeral industries, consisting of, say, the assembling of parts and material made in another country. That is a very subordinate branch of industry, which is not .entitled to the same amount of substantial protec-* tion. This has been my guiding star in arriving at my conclusions; and I hope and believe that honourable members will be able to appreciate the force of my contention.",55
478,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,Is there a trace of the Tariff Commission's reports in the Tariff? The Minister has never said a word about the matter.,55
479,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It is not for me or my colleagues to take any particular credit for having drawn attention to this or the other particular. Any industrious student, on searching the reports of the Commission, and comparing the recommendations of the Commission with the actual propositions of the Tariff, may, occasionally, see a striking similarity ; and for those portions of the Tariff, where the similarityceases. I am not prepared to express any very great admiration. However, I shall touch on that point presently. Meanwhile, it would be only doing justice to the Commission to rapidly enumerate some of the principal recommendations. There are 444 items in the Tariff- a very formidable list. I hasten to assurehonorable members that the whole of those 444 items are not necessarily contestable. Many are merely formal; and I venture to think that when we come to the details, the fight will really be concentrated upon forty-seven lines or propositions; those forty-seven lines may be described as occupying the fighting ground of the Tariff. Amongst those which I . might call the fairly substantial increases recommended by the protectionist members of the Commissioni, the first is in regard to confectionery, including chocolate. On chocolate the duty was i d . per lb., and the recommended duty is 2d., an increase of i d . The Government have proposed 3 i d . on British and 3§d. on. other, confectionery. These items, I may point out, are to be found in the British preference column.",55
480,Sir JOHN FORREST,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The member is referring to the recommendations of the Commission, andnot the proposals of the Government, as comparedwith the former Tariff? Sir JOHN QUICK:--Yes . In the case of confectionery, the Commission recommended a duty of 2d. per lb., but the Government, propose a duty of 3$d'. per lb. in the case ofBritish goodsj and 3!d. in the general Tariff. That is where the similarity ends between the recommendations of the Commission and the proposal - of the Government in this-instance. Theni, in regard tocandles of paraffine wax, the old duty was i d . per lb., and the Commission recommend ad. per lb., or an increase of i d . , and the Government have gone one higher, and proposed duties of 2d. to 2^d. per lb. The 2d. is to be charged on the British made candle, and the 2$d. on the candle of the foreigner. I was going to refer to the question of preference later, but, perhaps, it would be more convenient to do so now. Inregard to candles, I fail to see how the proposed duty will be of any very great benefit or advantage to the British made candles, because I - find that, while the importation of candles from foreign countries represents £ 3 4 , 2 3 5 in one year, the importation from Great. Britain amounts to only £ 2 , 6 0 2 . I shall next say a word or two about salt. On this commodity the old duty was' 12s. od. per ton, and the recommended duty is 20s. per ton, or an increase of 7s. 6d. per ton. On apparel and attire containing wool, the old duty was 25 per cent., and the duty recommended by the Commission is 40 per cent., or an increase of 15 per cent. On apparel and attire, not of wool, the old duty was 25 per cent., arid the recommended duty is 35 per cent., or an increase of 10 per cent. On bags and sacks the old duty was 10 per cent., and the recommended duty is 15 per cent., or an increase of 5 per cent. On woollen piece goods, the old duty was 15 per cent., and the recommended duty is 30 per cent., or an increase of 15 per cent. On blankets, rugs, & c , the old duty was 15 per cent.,, and the recommended duty.is 25 per cent., or an increase of 10 per cent. On socks and stockings of wool, the old duty was 15 per cent., and the recommended duty is 25 per cent., or. an increase of 10 per cent. Under the heading of hats and caps, n.e.i., straw, & c , the old. duty on straw hats was 20 per cent., and the recommended duty is 30 per cent., or an increase of 10 per cent. Speaking of hats honourable and caps, which I forgot to refer to just now, I may say that we took most exhaustive evidence throughout the various hat and cap producing States, and everybody was heard who demanded to be heard. After hearing the whole case, and re-perusing the evidence, I and my protectionist colleagues could not see our way to recommend, any increased duty on felt hatsand caps, or on silk hats and caps. But we did feel justified in recommending that there should be a uniform duty of 30 per cent, on all hats, caps and bonnets of whatever material, kind or description. It was conceived that with the old differentiation of 20 per cent, on straw hats, the latter and their like might come into competition with felt hats, and, to some extent, displace and take away trade - f rbm the latter. We thought that by raising straw hats to the common standard of felt hats, we might indirectly benefit felt and other hats, although we could not see, as I say, our way to give an increased duty. The next item is nails, on which the Commission recommended an increase of duty. Oh horse-shoe nails the old duty was 5s. per cwt., and the recommended duty is 7s. 6d., or an increase of-2s. 6d. per. cwt. On. nails, wire and other, the old duty was 3s. per. cwt., and the recommended duty is 5s. per cwt., or an increase of 2s. I now come to the big items of engines, boilers, pumps,- wind. mills, - and machines and machinery, mining, marine and general. On these items the old duty was 12 per cent., and therecommended duty is 25 per cent., or an increase of 12 per cent. This includes. I 1 may say, mining, as well as marine machinery, and I invite honourable members to give attention to the two special reports on mining machinery and marine engines and machinery. There honourable members' will see very valuable and interesting evidence about ship-building in New South Wales, and the wonderful resources and capabilities of that great establishment .known as Mort's Dock.",56
481,Mr KELLY,COURSE OF MILITARY,This Tariff is going to hit the docking facilities very badly.,57
482,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No ; I may say that the recommendation is based largely on the request of engineers, and particularly of Mr Franki, the representative of Mort's Dock. Mr Franki admitted that at one time he was a free-trader, but he said, without any reservation, that the change in industrial conditions of Australia of late years, resulting in increased facilities for the .importation of machines and machinery from across the sea, had driven him to the conclusion that it would be impossible to keep going Australian engineering work, including his own, unless there were increased protective duties. The next item is that of brass work, engineering and plumbing. In reference to brass work, as I said before, we saw our way clear to go beyond 25 per cent., and we, without any hesitation, recommended the exceptional duty of 30 per cent. I now come to that much controverted and very exciting item of wire netting; and I may say that I am extremely surprised to witness the great excitement and controversy in regard to this commodity. What would the people of New South Wales have said if we had not recommended the imposition of a. duty upon wire netting ?",57
483,Mr WILKS,COURSE OF MILITARY,The right honourable member for Adelaide omitted it from the Tariff which he introduced. ',57
484,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Bu the had not heard the evidence which was placed before the Tariff Commission. If this were a Victorian industry, there might be some reason for the howl which has been raised in connection with it. But it is a New South Wales industry, and it is in response to the appeal made to the Commission by, persons in that State that the present duty is being imposed. How could we resist an appeal for the protection of the wire in[ 6 ] -2 7 dustry of New South Wales whilst acced1 ing to similar requests for protection in other States? Had we done so we should have been accused of discriminating-of favoring Victorian industries at the expense .of industries in New South Wales.",57
485,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,Was that the only reason why the protectionist members of the Commission recommended the imposition of the duty?,57
486,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"We recommended it because of the evidence presented to us by a witness who pointed out the severe nature of. the competition to which the industry was subjected owing to the importation of wire netting produced by cheap labour in Germany, and brought to Australia in subsidized vessels. That was the evidence which induced us to submit recommendations in respect of duties upon wire netting and barbed wire. Honourable members representing New South . 'Wales and the other States will have an opportunity of deciding the matter. It was not the province of the Commission to exclude it from their consideration. If the protectionists of New South Wales and of the other States are convinced-afte r reading the evidence tendered to the Commissionthat it is not desirable to impose these duties, the decision rests entirely with them. I come now to the item of printer's type, which, at present, is admitted free. Representations were made to the Commission by persons resident in New South Wales-and these representations were supported by citizens in other States-that the manufacture of printer's type is not so difficult that it cannot beundertaken in Australia. If other industries receive protection, and the manufacturers of printer's type cpmplain of the unfavorable conditions under which they have to compete, surely they are entitled to similar consideration. Then there is an interesting little industry which we first came across in South Australia- I refer to the manufacture of blacking.",57
487,Mr TUDOR,COURSE OF MILITARY,Blackin g has been manufactured in Victoria for the past thirty years.,57
488,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am quite aware of that. I merely say that the Commission first took evidence in regard to it in South Australia. The old duty upon blacking was 20 per cent.; the duty recommended is 35 per cent - a n increase of 15 per cent. I ask honourable members to read the evidence tendfcred' to the Commission in respect of that item. In regard to earthenware, the old duty was 20 per cent.; the duty recommended is 30 per cent - a n increase of 10 per cent. In the matter of stone, wrought, ornamental, the old dutywas 25 per cent., and the duty recommended is 35 per cent - a n increase of 10 per cent. Upon stone, wrought, the old duty was 20 per cent., the duty recommended is 30 per cent - a n increase of 10 per cent.; upon glass, bent and bevelled, the old duty was 20 per cent., and the duty recommended is 30 per cent - a n increase of 10 per cent. Inreference to glass bottles, we recommended a duty, based not upon the ad valorem principle, but upon measurement. Upon printers' roller composition the old duty was 20 per cent., the duty recommended is 35 per cent - a n increase of 15per cent. Upon furniture the old duty was 20 per cent., the duty recommended is 30 per cent - a n increase of 10 per cent. The timber duties are not based upon the ad valorem principle, but upon measurement, or fixed rates. Upon wooden-ware there is at present an ad valorem duty of 20 per cent., and we propose an all-round duty of 30 per cent., being an increase of 10 per cent. Upon wicker, bamboo and cane the old duty was 20 per cent., the duty recommended is 40 per cent - a n increase of 20 per cent. I desire to explain that this item is one of three upon which the protectionist members of the Commission felt justified in recommending a duty of 40 per. cent. The first item was that of woollen garments and made-up clothing. This wicker, bamboo and cane is imported in shiploads from eastern countries, such as the Straits Settlements and Japan, and in South Australia and Western Australia we were informed that it would be impossible to carry on the manufacture of this class of goods subject to the cheap labour competition of these countries. In view of these special considerations, we felt bound to recommend the imposition of a much higher rate of duty upon wicker, bamboo and basketware than we did upon ordinary furniture. Upon ordinary furniture we recommended a duty of 30 per cent., and upon wicker bamboo and basketware a duty of 40 per cent.",57
489,Mr STORRER,COURSE OF MILITARY,Why is a special. rate levied upon chairs?,58
490,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That was suggested by witnesses representing the furniture industry, and there was no evidence presented to the Commission in opposition to their views. We had no material upon which to test the accuracy of their allegations. Upon jewellery unfinished, the duty has been, raised from 25 to 35 per cent upon boots and shoes of small size, from 15 to 30 per cent.; upon rubber manufactures n.e.i., from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent.; upon bicycles, from 20 to 25 per cent., with a minimum of £ 5 per vehicle. Then there is a special report upon vehicles, containing a new fixed scale of duties which represents practically an-adaptation of the old Victorian duties upon vehicles and conveyances. Upon brushware, the old duty has been raised from 15 to 25 per cent. The position in regard to tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes will be best understood if honourable members examine the scale of duties. The question of the duties which should be levied upon spirits was dealt with last session, and, I hope, finally disposed of. The duties upon agricultural implements, including harvesters, were, as I understood, fixed last session, and I will not assist in re-opening that question.",58
491,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,The honourable member must.,58
492,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Upon aerated waters, we recommend an increase of from 20 to 25 per cent.; and upon engravings, which were formerly free, we recommend the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent. Upon leather manufactures n.e.i., leather cut into shape, harness, razor strops, and whips, including keepers, thongs, and' lashes, the present duty is 20 per cent., and the duty recommended, 25 per cent., an increase of 5 per cent. Upon soap, we recommend a uniform duty of 25 per cent. In regard to leather n.e.i., we suggest an increase of the duty from 15 to 20 per cent. I have felt it necessary to go through these forty-seven items because I consider them the backbone of the protectionist portion of the Tariff. The others involve matters less vital, and many of them may be disposed of by considerations which do not go to the root of the fiscal question. But I believe that the forty-seven items which I have enumerated, and which will be seen by reference to progress report number 50, represent the real increases in the protective duties recommended by the Commission, and apparently adopted by the Government in reference to British products. That brings me to the question of preference generally. Speaking for myself only, I wish to say that in presenting these recommendations I consider that they represent duties of a sufficiently substantial character to protect <our industries against the whole world, including Great Britain. In reference to preferential trade, my idea was that,"" whilst I would be prepared to support the recommendations to which I have appended my signature as representing the highwater mark of protection against the outside world, if I felt disposed to give - any advantage to goods of a similar description coming from the United Kingdom I would be ready in individual - cases to concede a reduction. But in submitting these recommendations, I never - thought that I should be called upon to - vote forincreases of duty above my own - maximum. I cannot, therefore, support the increases proposed nominally for preferential trade purposes. "" Sir WILLIAM LYNE - They are actual in- creases, not nominal ones. Sir JOHN ' QUICK - It may be that stalment ? that view was present in the mind of the' Acting Prime Minister, or it may be that these increases were intended to be substanfrank t i a l increases against the whole world.",58
493,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COURSE OF MILITARY,If they operate as substantial increases against the whole world they must represent a substantial preference to Great Britain.,59
494,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"At the proper time, I shall be prepared to support moderately reduced duties upon certain British imports. But I am not prepared to support higher duties than those which I have recommended against the whole world. In Tegard to the question of whether we ought at the present stage to embark upon a preferential-trade campaign, I wish to say that I am as strongly in favour of a real system of preferential trade as is any man in this country: On the public platform, I was an advocate of the Chamberlain - scheme of preferential .trade, but - I understood that that scheme involved reciprocity. That is to say, it was to be based upon mutuality of concession. granted concessions to Great Britain, I understood that Great Britain would be prepared to consider concessions in favour - of the raw products of Australia. That was the campaign which' Mr Cham'berlain fought with such brilliant capacity, and, as we fondly hoped, with success throughout the United Kingdom. boldly advocated concessions in the shape - of reduced duties on colonially-produced goods. But I think it is impossible to - deny that the people of the United Kingdom have vetoed that brilliant scheme. It is open to consideration whether or not, in view of the verdict of the people of the United Kingdom at the last general election, we ought to rush into any ill-considered, haphazard scheme of preferential trade. The Government's proposal is described as a scheme of preferential trade, but it is inconsistent with Mr Chamberlain's ideas. He certainly expected a big substantial preference in favour of British goods, and not one of 5 per cent. In return, I understand, he was prepared to give a substantial concession on colonial productions.",59
495,Mr SAMPSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,He said so repeatedly. Sir JO HN QUICK - Quite so. That was the ' brilliant scheme of Imperial partnership which he had in view.,59
496,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COURSE OF MILITARY,"If we cannot obtain all that we desire, is not the honourable member prepared to take an in",59
497,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"To be perfectly and candid, I do not think that if would be well to start in the small way proposed by the Government.",59
498,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COURSE OF MILITARY,Then the honourable member would as soon obtain goods from China as from Great Britain?,59
499,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"A reduction of 5 per cent, in respect of British imports may be a preference j but under this Tariff we may go much further in the direction of preference, and favourable consideration to British goods without injuring Australian production. I am not prepared tp agree to a reduction of dutyupon any class of goods-eve n in favour of Great Britain-whic h would be prejudicial to Australian manufactures.",59
500,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,Then what would be the use of the preference to the British manufacturer ?.,59
501,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"There are certain lines of manufactured articles which If Australia. I shall not detail at present, but upon which a real and substantial preference could be granted to Great Britain without injuring Australian manufactures. I give the Ministry credit for the desire to launch the question of preference, and to give it all the glamour of a practical realization, but there is ground for a difference of He opinion in regard to the steps necessary to be taken - The Government have a perfect right to persevere with their system, and if they think fit to carry it out. But I am to some extent hampered by my position in - connection with the reports of the Commission. These reports, in my. judgment, and according to my intention, represent the high-water mark of protection against the whole world. I never made any reservation that I intended, directly or indirectly, to grant any increase of the duties therein recommended in order to secure any' system of British preference. But I could present a scheme, or assist the Ministry in preparing a scheme of preferential trade, which would be a real one, and which at the same time would not imperil Australian manufactures..

' That,, - it' was considered, was a fairly 'substantial revenue duty. The Government, - however; have not accepted that recommendation, but: have-increased the duty to the--extent of from 20 to 25 per cent. The duty on gloves,. , which was formerly 20 ' per . cent., now ranges from 20 per cent, to 30 per centof Then, again, fancy denims were originally dutiable at 5 per cent., and the Commission* recommended that the duty should remain. The reason for this may be briefly explained. Fancy denims are required intropical parts of Australia, where they arehighly popular. There is a great demand for them in some parts of the Common-, wealth at times when woollens could not beused, and when they could not possibly come into competition with woollen garments. It was for this reason that the Tariff Commission,considered that the duty should not be increased, but that theseden-ims, in common with other - cotton, as well as linen piece goods, should remains liable to a duty of 5 per cent. * Sir WILLIAM .LYNE.^DOCS flannelettecome within that category?",64
511,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No . Flannelette is contained in another .line of .goods. The Government, in its wisdom, has seen fit to raise the duty on denims from 5 per cent.. at all events a to the enormous rates of from 30 to 35 percent. That is a fairly stiff proposal. I should like the Acting Prime Minister to "" point out a line of evidence in the whole of the vast volumes submitted by the Com- mission to the Parliament wherein any witness asked for such a duty. duty Sir WILLIAM LYNE - - I think that a lot of witnesses refrained from coming forward. "" - .",64
512,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"On e would think that if the woollen industry were endangered by the use of denims some of the witnesses on woollens would have made out a big case for a higher duty. I should have been one of the first to realise that.. In reference to the item "" Velvets, Ribf bons, Trucked Linens, and Cottons,"" the duty' has been raised from 15 to 20 per cent. I see no reason for that increase, - even in regard to British imports. The paper. next item is "" Cotton, Linen, Jute, Other. Piece Goods."" Under the Tariff jute was free, - whilst cotton piece goods were liable to a revenue duty of 5 per cent. The Commission reber commended the continuance of the 5 per to cent, duty as a revenue tariff, but I find, to my utter amazement, that the Government should. propose that these raw materials- "" cotton and linen and other piece goods""-shal - be subject to a duty of 20 per cent, in case of British imports, and to a duty 25 per cent, in the'case of imports from rest of the world. Cotton and linen piece goods are raw materials used .in all the clothing factories in Australia. They are also the raw material of tent and sail manuthe facturers, and are likewise used by bag and sack manufacturers, as well as in various' other departments of trade.",64
513,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The honourable ments, member is referring to jute goods.",65
514,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"No . Some bags and sacks are made out of calico, and, as a matter of fact, calico bag manufacturers asked for a reduction of the old duty of per cent. The Government,. however, stead of reducing the duty on this raw terial for bags and sacks, have increased to 20 per cent."" in' some cases and 25 cent, in .others. That is a great mistake.

519,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The Commission, l having obtained the views of the trade the throughout the Commonwealth, arrived at of the conclusion that it would be most unthe just, unfair, and improper to prohibit the use of so universally popular an article.

We were informed that flannelette is used by thousands of persons belonging to the poorer classes for the making of under garand that the d.uty of. 15; per cent, was an oppressive one - We, therefore, considered ourselves justified in recommending .a duty of 5-' per .cent., treating flannelette as linen and cotton piece goods 5 were treated, because it isa piece good, inWe made this recommendation as; a com macession to the drapery trade and toj eon-= it sumers.

Mixed metal and plated-ware was, under the first Tariff, dutiable at 20 per cent., a very substantial revenue duty,' which affected a very large number of items; but the rate is now 25 per cent, against British goods and 30 per cent, against goods from other countries. Screws, formerly on the free list, are now dutiable at 5 per cent., and the rate on machines and machinery n.e.i, has been raised from 12 to 20 and 25 per cent., and that on china-ware from 20 to 25 and 35 per cent. Carbide of calcium, the raw material from which acetylene gas-whic h is used as an illuminant-is made, was formerly free, but is now dufialble at 10 per cent. I know of no justification for that duty. There was a fight over the question when the last Tariff was under discussion, and I shall see that it is renewed. I feel very strongly about the raising of duties on the list of articles which I have read, which are all raw materials, or parts of finished products. With regard to protective duties, I do not take so much exception to the proposals of the Government, as they present fair ground for difference of opinion; but I regard it as a deplorable departure from sound principles of taxation to impose high rates of duty on raw materials and parts of finished articles not made in. Australia. The action of the Government will greatly prejudice the Tariff, and do much to prevent its settlement on a fair and enduring basis. I wish to refer to one other matter before I sit down-the question of wages and conditions. In recommending the substantial increases which I have enumerated, amounting to upwards of forty-seven' on large items, the protectionist members of the Commission report thatWe consider that where protective duties - substantially increased, provision should be made to secure payment of reasonable wages to persons engaged in the industries benefited by such duties. That proposal seems to be one which is likely to receive recognition from honourable members generally, the only difference of opinion being as to how best to give effect to it. The method suggested by the Commission is that adopted last session in connection with the imposition of higher duties on stripper-harvesters, namely, that manufacturers who are benefited by substantialincreases in import duties shall be compelled to pay fair and reasonable wages to Sir Jokn Quick. their employees, on pain of being liable, if they fail to do so, to pay excise duties eauah to the import duties. I admit that therewill be a certain amount of inconvenienceand difficulty in enforcing such a provision.. The best thing would be for the Federal Parliament to acquire, if it could, completecontrol of industrial conditions. At pre-, sent we have not that control, and can dealonly with industrial disputes extending beyond the borders of a State. It must beremembered, however, that in Victoria at 1 the present time there are Wages Boardswhich have a limited jurisdiction in connection with labour conditions in a large number of trades and industries, and similarBoards, with very limited powers, in South. Australia, .and that in New South"" Wales, and in Western Australia there is an Arbitration Court. I admit that the present machinery for the determination of industrial conditions is imperfect, and I hope that the Parliaments of the States, in view of the high protective duties which have been imposed, will re-organize and improve it, with a view to securing fair treatment to the workers.",65
521,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,We must be sure that they will do so before we' grant too muchc protection.,66
522,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"We cannot wait for that, and must, therefore, in the meantime make some such provision as that to> which I have referred.",66
523,Mr HUTCHISON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"It has already proved 5 a failure, and is being violated shockingly.",66
524,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The Government is responsible for the administration of the law. If it be proved a failure, I shall be prepared to consider any alternative that may be proposed in its place, even that suggested by the Labour Party-the constitution of a tribunal with jurisdiction to deaf are with disputes arising in connection with protected industries, and to deal with selling prices. The time has arrived when we should make .adequate, comprehensive, and permanent provision for dealing'with thisclass of industrial disputes, and we should r make it a condition precedent fo,- or associated with, any increase of protection that thf workers as well as the manufacturers; shall secure substantial advantages therefrom. I have now covered most of the* ground which will be gone over in detail when we come to deal with the separateitems of the Tariff. The good temper and"" business-like spirit which 'has been shown by the Committee to-night is an evidence? that honourable members are disposed to deal with this matter in a fair and business-like way, and to dispose of it as expeditiously as possible. I concur in the view that has been expressed in this Chamber, and in press, that we ought to obtain a settlement of the Tariff question which will remain for some years. I should be very sorry to think that we are to have fiscal battles four or five years. Such a thing would be a calamity to Australia. Let us, therefore, try to secure a settlement which will last at least ten years.",66
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,Matter s cannot be settled in a way which will satisfy one State only.,67
526,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am anxious fo secure a settlement which will eive fair consideration to all the States. In the formance of the difficult and onerous imposed on me as Chairman of the Tariff Commission, I refused to be a party to recommendation, or to submit any report, until I had heard the particular case stated from the point of view of those interested in each State, and in dealing with the Tariff I shall endeavour to deal with all proposals from the Australian stand-point. I shall be as ready to do justice to an in-, dustry in Western Australia or in Queensand, land as to an Industry in Victoria. I wish also to protect consumers from traders are taking advantage of a duty to charge extortionate prices, and, therefore, shall prepared to vest the tribunal to which have referred with authority to investigate unwarrantable increases in prices, and, ment of the Tariff question. where the public are being fleeced, to report to Parliament, which should be able to pend the duty by the adoption of an address to His Excellency the Governor General.",67

530,Sir JOHN QUICK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"And shoddy. A proposal has already been indicated for a permanent tribunal- a standing, watchas ing tribunal, so to 'speak-to promptly deal with such questions as they arise, and to liament. report to Parliament, .and place usin possession of grievances and anomalies as they arise. If that proposal were carried out it would prevent those periodical revolutions or convulsions which accompany such a Tariff revision as that on which we are now entering. One cannot help recognising the difficulties ' which traders and the merchants have to encounter when Tariff changes are proposed. A great many matters have.to be taken into consideration at such a crisis; and it is of no use regardevery ing harshly men who have to look after their own interests and protect themselves. Merchants and traders do not know what is going to happen-whethe r these proposed duties will be permanent, or whether they will be raised or lowered-and we have to be very careful not to be unjust to them. Above all, we can help those merchants and traders by dealing with the Tariff promptly and expeditiously, so that, as persoon as possible, trade and commerce maytask resume its normal course. A number of merchants, storekeepers, and retailers, who any are now up in arms with complaints, will, I believe, patriotically adapt themselves to such changes as Parliament may eventually authorize, and will deal with this new Tariff as they did with the last Tariff. After the spasm, so to speak, of the change was over on the last occasion trade and commerce adapted itself to the new conditions, eventually, the storm passed away; and I hope we shall have the same experience who on this occasion, only in a shorter time. It would greatly facilitate matters if honbe orable members, while insisting on debatI ing all points fairly and exhaustively, would aim at an early solution and settleI n conclusion, I may, perhaps, be permitted to say a susword on behalf of myself and colleagues on the Tariff Commission, both free-traders and protectionists, who worked together as harmoniously for two years and a half. We held 'and represented different fiscal views, I and each of us, in his respective sphere,, party had his duties to perform. We have done that our duty, and we have presented to His not Excellency the Governor General, to Parliament, arid to the people of Australia, our respective conclusions, which we believe to be founded on, and justified by, the evidence laid before us. We hope and trust that the result of our labours will be fairly considered on both sides, and that, a result, we shall receive the approbation of the people of Australia and of this Par",67
531,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Lang) [9.35] - I had hoped we should have the advantage of hearing other members of the Tariff Commission, so as to have, obtained a little more light than we possess at the present time. Unfortunately, the members of the Tariff Commission do not seem prepared to proceed; and, consequently, unless we are willing to allow the debate to lapse i * must be continued under somewhat disadvantageous circumstances. Every one will agree that the labours of the Tariff Commission have been very exhaustive. The work of taking evidence was proceeded with in the most painstaking manner; and no one will grudge the members of the Commission every meed of the praise which is their due for the earnestness and conscientiousness which they exhibited in the performance of a most arduous and intricate task. a disadvantage that we should have to consider the Tariff in connection with the Budget, and thus be forced into placing the latter in a secondary place. The Budget is most important, and must occupy a considerable portion of our time. under the circumstances, we have no option but to deal with both at one and the same time; indeed;, as they are both more or less interrelated it is almost impossible to en-! tirelv separate one from the other. When the T a r if f Commission was appointed, it .was for the purpose of trying to satisfactorily adjust anomalies in the existing Tariff. It was never contemplated for a moment that the investigation would lead to any Government introducing such a drastic measure of protection as is now before us. The Tariff Commission, so far as its original, intention is concerned, has ""been absolutely abortive. After two years and a half of exhaustive effort-afte r the taking of evidence running into tens of thousands of pages, and after carefully sifting that evidence, and reporting the result ot their investigations-w e find the Government of the day ignoring the recommendations of the Commission in many of the most important items.",67

533,Mr REID,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is, 100 cases more than there are item's'in-the T a r if f !",68
534,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"There are 444 items iri the Tariff, and the Minister says he has accepted 542 of the Commission's recommendations. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - The figure I have given does not represent individual items, but different rates which the Commission recommended.. In some of the items several articles are grouped'. ' . Mr JOHNSON - Quite so; but the Chairman of the Tariff Commission has pointed Out-.'a number'of instances in which - the Government have absolutely ignored the reccnimen'dations of himself and colleagues, and have'imposed .duties entirely in opposition to those recommendations,and .these were protectionist recommendations, too. On the fiscal question generally, honourable members know that I am a strong free-trader, and that I have never disguised that fact from either the House or my constituents. My esteemed leader refused to make the fiscal question an issue ' at - the "". last general elections. It is He deemed it necessary to try to. combine protectionists and"" free-traders into one strong element antagonistic to the socialistic, doctrine. ' The result was that, outside Victoria, the fiscaj question was not an issue, at the general election. However, The real issue was Socialism versus. anti-Socialism; and protectionists and free traders' were invited'to stand on one common platform in opposition to the Socialistic proposals of the Labour Party.",68
535,Mr WILKS,COURSE OF MILITARY,Thousand s of protectionists did not' respond.,68
536,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That is so; nevertheless the invitation was extended. The leader of the Opposition toured various electorates throughout Australia, and invited all to sink the - fiscal issue, so that moderate ' protectionists . and' free-traders could oppose themselves as one body against Socialism. Largely as a result of that invitation",68
537,Mr BAMFORD,COURSE OF MILITARY,No .,68
538,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I think I may fairly say that as a result of that invitation a number of protectionists were returned, but not as protectionists. They were returned largely on free-trade votes pledged to fiscal'. peace;' and I - do not see how such honourable members can Government be expected, to support the present Tariff proposals of the Government. These-members were returned for the express purpose of fighting against the' encroachment of socialistic"" legislation; and!, therefore, it cannot be claimedthat, outside Victoria, the general election was a victory for the protectionist party.' 'In Victoria,' however, the fiscal issue was put plainly before - the people, and a demand was raised for effective protection; and, therefore, Victorian protectionists ""are quite right in supporting higher duties. If the resuit is, as we are told, a victory for protion tection, I cannot understand why protecThe tionists are growling about the present Tariff proposals. The nearer protecCustoms tion approaches to prohibition more effective it must necessarily be. If ' I 'were, a protectionist, ' I should theseproposals with delight, and where they did not reach the point of prohibition I should endeavour to make them do so, because anything short of that will not - represent effective protection. Any duty which yields a - revenue must permit of goods being imported into the Commoncountry wealth-good s against which our local manufacturers have to compete. So long as goods can be imported, it cannot be gued that protection has reached the point of thorough effectiveness. Consequently am - somewhat amused when I see avowed protectionists carried away with indignadustrial tion at the proposals of the Government. Personally I do not wonder that the Prime Minister should be entertained dinner, and eulogized by our manufactrade turers, who-will reap the rich harvests monopoly prices at the expense of the fortunate people. What is the position day? We find that throughout Australia to Federation. industries are flourishing. But I do not believe that they areflourishing as the sult of the Tariff. We have had the vantage of splendid seasons, and people are prosperous not because of the Tariff old world. but in spite of it. It is one of the hopeful signs of which we must take cogthe nizance, that our natural resources are great that, with bountiful seasons, we overcome the disadvantages of almost, kind of mischievous legislation. But such' seasons cannot always continue. We shall have our lean years as well as our fat years, and I venture to say that if we had exportion perienced lean seasons instead of fat the effect of the existing Tariff would been felt much more severely than it has been. The members of the present Goto vernment and the protectionists who sit behind them in this House occupy a passed very peculiar position. They point immense satisfaction to the fact that moval of the fiscal barriers between States has had a beneficial effect in extenddustry. ing the markets of our local producers. Yet.prior to Federation, we were accuswe tomed to hear them inveighing against manufactories of all the other States. those days, their whole object was not secure protection against the outside world but to secure themselves from the competitries, of their neighbours across the borders. Acting Prime Minister, the Postmaster-General, and the Minister of Trade and used to adopt that attitude. Yet the now they aire forced to admit the beneficial effects of the removal of those fiscal hail barriers between States which before Federation they insisted - were necessary to insure prosperity. Prior to Federation, it must be recollected, that very high protectionist duties were levied in Victoria. Under' their operation, its industries were languishing, and population was leaving the at the rate of thousands per annum. Indeed, this State, immediately before Federation, seemed - to be threatened arwith a complete exodus of its adult male population. Its factories were filled with I children, and the wages paid therein were very low. An inquiry into the inconditions which obtained here resulted in shocking 'disclosures' in regard to Acting - sweating. We have' also to remember at that whenever a strike occurred-in freeNew South Wales, Protectionist of Victoria was - always able to send un- - blacklegs there. These were the contoditions that obtained in this State prior The honourable member for Bendigo declared that the object of this reTariff was to prevent-the industries of the adCommonwealth from having to compete - against the'cheap labour countries of the Germany was instanced as'a most shocking example in this connection. What honourable member forgot to ""tell us was so that the labour of the very countries to can which he referred was the most highly proany tected in the world. The Government now tell us that they intend to go in for what is known as the ""new protection."" They propose to introduce a system by which a of the increased duties shall go toones, wards insuring the payment of a reasonhave able wage in protected industries. It was to secure that end that a proviso relating the payment of Excise was inserted in the Bill dealing with harvesters which was by the last Parliament. But singularly with enough we can obtain no official in the reformation as to whether reasonable the wages have been paid in that ' inNobody has been appointed to investigate the matter, and for aught know to the contrary sweating may 'be the practiced in that industry at the present In time. The Acting Prime Minister has to told us that he proposes to secure the same result in connection with all other induseither by inserting' a similar provision in the Tariff, or. by adopting another scheme which, has been outlined by a Committee of the Labour Party. I venture to say that that scheme, plausible as it appears on the surface, will prove equally a failure with that adopted in connection with the manufacture of harvesters'. There is only one way by which we can insure the payment of a reasonable rate of wages. The rate of wages payable in any industry ' is governed by the laws of supply and-demand, just 'as is everything else. Any artificial means that we may adopt for raising wages, without having regard to natural laws, must of necessity ultimately fail of its object. The Acting Prime Minister advocates still another scheme in this connection, namely, the appointment of a Board of Trade, or Inter-State Commission, whose function it shall be to protect, not only the workers in all industries, but also the consumer. What a farce is the whole proceeding! Once they seek to reduce prices in the consumers' interest the demand for a reduction of wages is inevitable, to make up the difference to. the manufacturer, or the duty will fail from the manufacturers' stand-point. The proposal must break down, because it fails to recognise the one natural law which governs this question, just as it governs every other question connected, with prr> duction and exchange. It was evident from the speech' delivered by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that the whole purpose of the Tariff was directed to counteracting the cheapness of imported goods. He"" instanced the case of glass bottles as a ing attempt on the part of importers to bring in cheap goods to the detriment of the Australian glass bottle producer. Cheapness was the principal ground of his complaint. Yet, shortly afterwards, the honourable and learned member adopted an entirely different' line of argument. He told us that the effect of imposing a duty upon salt would not be to make that commodity dearer, but to make it cheaper. So that, simultaneously, we are asked to believe that the effect of protective duties will be to increase prices and also to lower them. When the honourable and learned member made this statement, I asked him to explain his paradoxical proposition, but he was conveniently deaf to my interjection. Upon the ground that we ought to be a self-contained community-that favourite expression of the Acting Prime Minister-we are told that we should proAO. Johnson. duce everything that we require. The United States has been pointed to as a great example of what can be accomplished in this direction. But the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and others who entertain a similar view, always forget that there is a vast difference between the population of Australia and that of the United States. In Australia, we have a population of only about 4,250,000 as against a population of something like 82,000,000 in the United States. That which is possible in America, which is practically a world in itself, possessing, al variety of blirnlatic /Conditions and soils, and natural resources of great variety and almost unlimited extent, is not necessarily possible in Australia, with its more limited population. Scattered all over the Commonwealth, we have a population considerably less than that of London. Would the Minister, andthose wht agree with him in making these proposals, say that London should be self-contained - that it should produce everything it needs, and refuse to trade with the outside world? Would not such a proposition De scouted as unreasonable? It would be no more unreasonable, however, than is the proposition of the Acting. Prime Minister regarding what the people of Australia should do. If the Tariff is required to protect Australian industries against the cheap labour productions of Great Britain and foreign countries, how can such a statement be reconciled with the assertion that under it prices will not be increased? If prices are not to be increased as the result of this Tariff, then shockthe proposed protection must fail. If locally-produced goods are to be sold as cheaply as imported goods, then there is nothing to fear from foreign competition, and there is no reason for the Tariff. But do .we not know, in the light of Victoria's long experience of protection, that the inevitable result of that policy is to increase to the consumer the price of goods coming under it. It is all very well to say, "" We shall regulate prices by the appointment of an Inter-State Commission or a Board of Trade."" But if we are going to regulate and bring down the prices of local articles to those of the imported article, a protective Tariff must be absolutely useless.",68
539,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,I did not say that we should do such a thing.,70
540,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"The honourable memis a ber, and others who share his view of the fiscal question, have said again and again that the internal competition resulting from a high protective Tariff will effectively pre? vent the raising of prices to the consumer.",70
541,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COURSE OF MILITARY,What I say is that the increased output would enable local manufacturers to carry on with a smaller margin of profit.,71
542,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That necessarily means that they must sell at a reduced price. The argument of the protectionist anxious to throw dust in the eyes of traders invariably is that protection will not raise prices. A moment's consideration must show any reasonable man that protection would be absolutely useless unless it did. That is the purpose and object of a protective policy. Therefore, when protectionists profess to be indignant at the suggestion that prices have been raised because of protective duties, I very much doubt the sincerity of their protestations, or else am forced to the conclusion that they are unreasoning beings. When we are t'old of the advantages which have followed the removal, consequent upon Federation, of Tariff restrictions as between the States, we are naturally tempted to inquire whether a far more beneficial result would not attend the removal of the barriers to trade between Australia and other countries. If the principle is right in itself it must be right all along the line. If it is right that Australia as a whole should be a self-contained community, that it should manufacture 'everything that it requires for itself, and try to shut out the products of'other countries, then we must contract the sphere of . operations, and apply the same principle to any division of Australia. . If it is right and. beneficial for the whole of Australia, it must be right and beneficial for any one State in the Commonwealth. Then again, if it be beneficial to any one State, it must be beneficial to any one country,, village, or household in Australia. When we come down to this-the - logical conclusion to the argument of the Protectionist Party-w e find that we are reduced to the condition of primitive savages who have to manufacture everything for their own use, and have no opportunity or inclination to trade with others. We reach a condition of absolute barbarism.",71
543,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Where the people clothe themselves with, fig leaves.",71
544,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"That proposition was hailed with satisfaction by one shining lights in the Victorian world of - protection: I refer to Mr. said, I believe, that he would prefer to see every one in Australia, clothed with the primitive fig leaf, rather than that they should wear any article not made in the Commonwealth. What a narrow provincial feeling such astatement displays! A man who has expressed such a view needs to travel and learn something.",71
545,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Is Mr Joshua a manufacturer of whisky? . Mr JOHNSON - I believe he is. He now describes himself as the "" top dog,"" and boasts of the power he possesses under the Tariff to take advantage of the unfortunate public. The consumers of any of the goods, dealt with in the Tariff are the last to be considered. What does it matter to him and those who share his view if the wife of a working man finds when she pays her grocer's bill at the end of the week that her husband's wages will not go as far as they did before this Tariff was imposed? What does it matter if she finds she has to pay more 'for her children's clothing? What does it matter if she cannot afford to buy boots for her boys and girls? She may not have the money, but she should rejoice to know that though her children go naked and hungry, the food and clothing as well as the money are all still in the country. Throughout Australia there is an outcry against the Tariff. But for the fact that as .free traders we have a duty to perform .in seeking to reduce these duties to normal proportions, it - would be well for us to allow the Tariff to pass as introduced. Mr MATHEWS I wish the Opposition would give us the chance of passing it ' in that form.",71
546,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I am pledged to fight for a reduction of the duties, and intend to do so. But for such a pledge I should say that the best thing that could happen to the cause of freedom and rationalism in this'country would be the passing of the Tariff in its present form. If we let the people feel the pinch of it we should not have again to. appeal to them, as we have had to do, to RO to the poll at a general election. The merchants, and, unfortunately, a good many of the women who have' .to make their husbands' wages go as far as possible, as' well as women in other spheres of life who would feel the pinch of this Tariff, cannot be of the persuaded to go to the poll.  Joshua', who crowd would not let them.",71
547,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"Many of them did not do so at the last general election, but X feel confident that if - this Tariff were to be passed as it' stands the pinch would be felt by . these people ;so keenly that at the next general election we should have such a revulsion of feeling, against-protection that' we might look, forward to an era of free-trade placidity and real prosperity. We should not hear very - much' about protection for at least another decade. ' - . _ ' - Mr .AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Can the honourable ^member tell us.if the workers, would secure any wages under the'policy'of'which he is in favour?- . . .",71
548,Mr JOHNSON,COURSE OF MILITARY,"I will undertake to say - that employment would be more plentiful and wages more satisfactory. The seasons of late have been so prosperous that had Parliament imposed no artificial barriers against commercial development, the people would be better off than they are now. When the leader of the Opposition was .in power in .New South' Wales, and ; the import duties affected only..half-a-dozen items, and were,merely revenue producing - in their ' incidence, wages were .higher and industrial conditions better than in any other period in the history of the .State.

Mr JOHNSON -^It suited the Labour Partv_ to support him, because they got moreTdemocratic legislation from him than they had ever had before.
