1,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Ms AE Burke) took the chair at 09:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA Afghanistan Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:01): by leave-The government is committed to providing regular reports and updates on Afghanistan, including to the parliament. This year, I have reported to the parliament on three previous occasions. In February, I provided an update to parliament on progress in Afghanistan. In May, I reported to parliament twice, once on Australia's detainee management arrangements and, on my return from Chicago, on the outcomes of the NATO/International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Leaders' Summit, which I attended with the Prime Minister. Since my last statement, there have been three significant developments in relation to Australia's mission in Afghanistan. On 17 July, transition formally commenced in Uruzgan province, where the majority of Australian forces are based. This follows the province's inclusion in the third tranche of provinces and districts to enter the transition process, as announced by President Karzai on 16 May. The start of transition in Uruzgan reflects the progress made by Australia and ISAF in training and mentoring the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and strengthening security and development. It is a welcome sign that transition in Uruzgan is on track completion over the next 12 to 18 months. The commencement of transition in Uruzgan is in line with the strategy agreed by the international community at Lisbon, and reaffirmed at Chicago, namely to transition the security lead from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces by the end of December 2014. On 31 May, I announced that Australia will take on the leadership role of Combined Team-Uruzgan (CT-U) later this year. Combined Team-Uruzgan was established in August 2010 under United States command following the withdrawal of the Dutch, with the role of commanding ISAF operations in Uruzgan province. The United States has had the leadership of Combined Team-Uruzgan since that time. Australia sees leadership of the Combined Team-Uruzgan as part of the transition process through which security responsibility will be transferred from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces. Australia sees this as the appropriate time to take the leadership role in Uruzgan province, to help ensure that transition in Uruzgan is effected in a seamless way. The United States has committed to continuing to provide enabling support in the province, which it has done since August 2010. Assuming leadership of Combined TeamUruzgan will not require an increase in the overall average size of Australia's presence in Uruzgan. Australia looks forward to continuing to work with our Combined Team-Uruzgan partners-the United States, Singapore and Slovakia-to progress transition in Uruzgan to the Afghan authorities. Following the 4 August vote of no confidence by the Afghan parliament in the Afghan Defence Minister Wardak and Interior Minister, Bismullah Mohammadi Khan, Minister Wardak announced his for resignation on 7 August. I congratulate Minister Wardak on his successes as defence minister. I have worked closely with him and wish him well in his new role as Senior Presidential Adviser to President Karzai on army reform. Deputy Defence Minister Nazari has been appointed Acting Defence Minister. The appointment of Afghan ministers is of course a matter for the Afghan government and I am committed to working with my new Afghan counterpart when appointed to ensure the transition process in Uruzgan is effected seamlessly. Australian casualties Tragically, since my last Ministerial Statement, Australia has also lost another soldier in Afghanistan. Sergeant Blaine Diddams from the Special Air Service Regiment, the SAS, was killed on 2 July during a small arms engagement with insurgents. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Shadow Minister for Defence Science and I all spoke on the condolence motion for Sergeant Diddams on Tuesday. I again offer my condolences to the family, friends and mates of Sergeant Diddams. High profile attacks Despite progress being made, Afghanistan remains a dangerous environment, as evidenced by the recent series of bombings in Nimroz and Kunduz provinces earlier this week on 14 August. Nearly 50 people were killed and more than 130 wounded as a result of these appalling attacks, with Afghan civilians the majority of victims. These attacks are aimed at achieving a propaganda effect and undermining Afghan and international confidence in the progress that is being made on transition. Green on blue incidents Members are only too well aware of the dangers our personnel face in Afghanistan and the potential for so called 'green on blue' incidents or 'insider attacks'. The causes are complex and range from Taliban infiltrators to real or perceived grievances affecting Afghan soldiers, policemen or locally engaged staff. There are more numerous so-called 'green on green' incidents, involving members of the Afghan National Security Forces carrying out attacks against their fellow ANSF colleagues. There have been no 'green on blue' incidents involving ADF personnel this year, but there has been an unfortunate rise in the number of these incidents involving our international partners. Earlier this month, ISAF implemented force protection enhancements across Afghanistan as a result of an increase in these insider incidents. Australian force protection measures are robust and were already in line with these adjusted ISAF measures. Our overall relationship with our Afghan partners is positive and productive, with its members equally horrified by such incidents as we are. We should not judge an entire organisation based on the terrible actions of a few and it is vital that we, along with our ISAF colleagues, continue to partner the ANSF closely in the field. Detainee management update In keeping with my commitment to provide regular updates to the Australian people on detainee management, and to be open and transparent on these matters, I now update on detainee management issues in Afghanistan. Australia approaches its responsibility for ensuring detainees are treated with dignity and respect with the utmost seriousness and is committed to conducting its detention operations in accordance with our domestic and international legal obligations. Australia's detainee management framework for operations in Afghanistan has two priorities: first, removing insurgents from the battlefield, where they endanger Australian, ISAF and Afghan lives; and, second, ensuring humane treatment of detainees, consistent with Australian values and our domestic and international legal obligations. Since the introduction of Australia's detainee management framework Afghanistan on 1 August 2010, following the Dutch withdrawal from Uruzgan, three comprehensive audits of the detainee management framework have undertaken, with one more comprehensive audit planned for this year. The last comprehensive audit undertaken in May this year included a review of the interrogation capability, which commenced in February this year; a review of the CCTV systems at the ADF's Initial Screening Area in Tarin Kowt; and consideration of practices and processes at the point of capture. The audit found that all detention activities conducted at the ADF Initial Screening Area over the period of the audit were in full compliance with Australian policy, Australia's international and domestic legal obligations and ISAF requirements. These audits are essential to verify that a strong governance framework remains in place and that we are able to address any issues that might arise. Monitoring As part of our detainee management framework, Australian officials monitor the welfare of all detainees transferred from ADF custody to Afghan or US custody. This is to ensure that detainees continue to be treated humanely following transfer from Australian custody. Australia's monitoring regime includes a Detainee Monitoring Team, led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Detainee Monitoring Team visits each detainee shortly after transfer and approximately every four weeks after the initial visit. We continue to monitor detainees up until they are sentenced, after a criminal prosecution or released. This reflects the practice of our ISAF partners. Between August 2010 and 11 August 2012, the monitoring team conducted 106 monitoring visits. This included 51 visits to in the National Directorate of Security facility in Tarin Kowt, 16 visits to the Tarin Kowt Central Prison and 39 visits to the detention facility in Parwan. These visits are an been essential mechanism to ensure detainees apprehended by the ADF are treated appropriately. To date, our monitoring of ADFapprehended detainees in Uruzgan and Parwan has not identified serious issues of concern that would warrant consideration of the suspension of transfers to these facilities. Separate from and in addition to the comprehensive audits of the detainee management framework, the first audit of Australia's detainee monitoring processes is currently underway. An audit team of officials from the Department of Defence and from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is reviewing Australia's detainee monitoring regime in Afghanistan. The audit team will report on the adequacy of current training provided to personnel involved in detainee monitoring and on the effectiveness of current practices and procedures and will, where necessary, make recommendations on possible improvements. I will provide an update to the House on the findings of this audit in due course. Capture/recapture Over the period between August 2010 and 11 August this year the ADF has detained 1,653 suspected insurgents. Of these, 115 detainees have been transferred to the Afghan authorities at the National Directorate of Security in Tarin Kowt and 83 detainees have been transferred to US authorities at the detention facility in Parwan. Between August 2010 and 11 August this year the ADF captured 12 people who were subsequently released then recaptured. Six of the individuals in question were released as there was insufficient evidence to warrant their continued detention. Of the remaining six detainees, there was sufficient evidence to warrant their transfer and prosecution. Three were subsequently transferred to US custody at the detention facility in Parwan, and three were transferred to Afghan custody at the National Directorate of Security detention facility in Uruzgan. Interrogation In February this year, I announced the deployment of trained ADF interrogators to Afghanistan to question apprehended by the ADF. Interrogation expands the ADF's ability to obtain information of operational and tactical value to help protect Australian personnel, the ANSF and the local Afghan population. Interrogation is conducted by ADF personnel who are qualified in interrogation-that is, only those personnel who have received specialised training undertake interrogation activities. In February I also advised that the government had agreed to extend the time selected detainees could be held in Australian custody at the initial screening area, prior to their release or transfer, purpose of comprehensive screening. Any interrogation is undertaken during the approved period of extension comprehensive screening. Comprehensive screening enables the ADF to determine whether a detainee has knowledge which could assist in the force protection of the ADF, ISAF and our Afghan partners. As at 11 August this year approximately 28 per cent of detainees apprehended by the ADF while on operations in Afghanistan have undergone interrogation within the initial screening area since interrogation operations commenced in February. The length of time for which detainees can be held in the initial screening area may be extended beyond the standard 96 hours, or four days, for an additional three days, and a possible further extension of three days. Since the introduction of interrogation in February, on the advice of the Chief of Defence Force, I have authorised the extension of detention for one detainee for a further period of 20 days. That detainee was assessed as having valuable information that would directly assist the force protection of Australian, ISAF and Afghan personnel. The detainee was treated humanely and with dignity and respect at all times while in detainees Australian custody. A review of the detention was conducted after every five-day period to ascertain a continuing requirement to detain for interrogation. The CDF and I were advised of the outcomes of each review, including the detainee's fitness for further detention. ISAF, Afghan authorities and Afghan human rights organisations were advised of the extension of detention. At the end of the further extension of detention, the detainee was transferred from ADF custody. The detainee was assessed on transfer as being in a fit and sound state. Incidents and allegations for the Allegations of mistreatment Australia takes all allegations of detainee mistreatment seriously. I have provided for regular updates on complaints and allegations of mistreatment the ADF has received since August 2010. During the period August 2010 to 11 August 2012, there have been 141 allegations of mistreatment against Australian forces. Of these, 125 relate to treatment or an incident at the point of capture. To date, 123 of these allegations have been considered and have been assessed as unsubstantiated, while 18 allegations remain under investigation. In Australia's detention operations, the term 'allegation of mistreatment' is used to describe any perceived or alleged incident involving an individual who is in Australian custody. When a detainee is brought into our initial screening area, each detainee is specifically asked if they have any complaints about their treatment. Any complaint is treated as an allegation. This terminology does not imply any wrongdoing on the part of the ADF or its personnel but simply that a person has made a complaint or an allegation about the treatment they, or another individual, has received or witnessed during the course of their interaction with the ADF or the Afghan National Security Forces. Every allegation of detainee mistreatment received or observed by the ADF is required to be reported through the Australian military chain of command. Once reported, such allegations are promptly assessed or investigated. This process may include taking witness statements, examining any medical evidence as well as reviewing records and CCTV footage. Allegations and the outcomes of any assessments are reported to ISAF and key human rights and humanitarian organisations. Treatment of detainees by ANSF Not only is Australia committed to holding our own personnel to the highest standards on detainee management, but, if ADF personnel become aware of concerns regarding the treatment of detainees by our ISAF or Afghan partners, this is treated with the same utmost seriousness. If a detainee consents, the specific allegation is brought the attention of the Afghan authorities for investigation. During the period August 2010 to 11 August this year, 46 allegations of detainee mistreatment have been made against the ANSF at the point of capture. These allegations have been referred to the ANSF for investigation. During operations with the ANSF in Uruzgan, Australian forces promote adherence to human rights standards and other international legal obligations relevant to the treatment of detainees and the protection of the local civilian population. As part of the ADF's role in training and mentoring the ANSF, Australia provides human rights training to Afghan personnel and advises Afghan personnel on the correct procedures for handling detainees under applicable international law. As well as the training provided by Australia to the ANSF, the ANSF in Uruzgan receives specific human rights training which covers detention operations from the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. The ADF also provides Afghan personnel practical advice on these issues in the field. Allegations of procedural misconduct On occasion, issues arise with respect to the implementation of our detainee operations. I now update the House on those issues. In February 2011 I advised the House that in late January 2011 the ADF Investigative Service (ADFIS) initiated an investigation into allegations made by a Defence member that previous members of the Detention Management Team in Afghanistan, responsible for managing the ADF Initial Screening Area at Tarin Kowt, may not have complied with procedures relating to the management and administrative processing to of detainees. In my last statement to the House in May, I provided an update on these allegations, noting that three members of the previous Detainee Management Team had been charged with disciplinary offences relating to falsification of service documents. I can now advise the House that in June this year, a fourth member of the previous Detainee Management Team was also charged. I also advise the House that the of the hearings for these disciplinary offences occurred on 27 July this year. The accused ADF member was initially charged with 'falsification of a service document' but this charge was substituted at trial with a charge of 'prejudicial conduct'. The accused entered a plea of guilty to the charge and received a 'severe reprimand'. Further hearings are expected to occur later this There continue to be no allegations or evidence to suggest that any detainees were mistreated by the Detainee Management Team. As this matter is subject to continuing disciplinary proceedings, I do not propose to comment further but will provide the House a further update as appropriate when these proceedings are complete. Review of questioning techniques In May this year I advised the House that the ADF is conducting a review into aspects of the questioning techniques used during the initial screening of detainees in Afghanistan during 2010 and 2011. During 2010 and 2011, the ADF was limited to conducting the tactical questioning, intelligence interviewing and debriefing of detainees apprehended in Afghanistan. The Chief of Defence Force has advised that a review of records from this period found potential irregularities in written reports stemming from initial questioning of detainees. This review is still underway and I will provide a further update to the House in due course. Again, none of the issues suggests any alleged physical mistreatment of detainees in the Initial Screening Area by ADF personnel. Civilian casualties Australia remains committed to transparency and providing information on civilian casualties in Afghanistan. The ADF takes the question of civilian casualties very seriously. The ADF operates under strict first rules of engagement intended to minimise civilian casualties and deeply regrets any loss of innocent life. In my 24 May statement to parliament I provided information on inquiries into four suspected civilian casualty incidents. Defence has finalised consideration of the inquiry into a possible civilian casualty incident during a partnered mentoring task year. force and Afghan National Army patrol in the Baluchi Valley region of Uruzgan province on 2 November 2010. Defence expects to be able to make public shortly the findings of the inquiry officer report following consultation with Afghan and ISAF partners. The inquiries into the incident on 27 March 2011, when a small Afghan boy and an Afghan man were killed, and the incident on 29 October 2011, when Australian soldiers engaged and killed a man who approached their site at speed and failed to adhere to directions to stop, remain under consideration. I will advise the House of the outcomes of this consideration in due course. An inquiry is also underway in relation to an incident on 1 May this year, when an Afghan boy was injured during an engagement between insurgents and Australian Special Forces and elements of the Afghan National Security Forces undertaking a partnered security operation. When complete, the inquiry will be considered, and I will advise of the outcome in due course. Defence has acknowledged the delay in the public release of such reports of inquiries into civilian casualty incidents, and the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) has instituted improved governance arrangements for the future management of such inquiries comparable to those instituted in relation to combat fatality reports. I will continue to update the House on these issues and Afghanistan more broadly as appropriate. I table a paper in conjunction with my ministerial statement and ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the honourable member for Fadden to speak for a period of 19 minutes. Leave granted. Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:20): I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Fadden speaking in reply to my statement for a period not exceeding 19 minutes. Question agreed to.",17
2,Mr ROBERT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I thank the minister for his update to the House and for his three previous updates this year, building on the work he did last year in keeping the House informed. I join the minister, as we did on the sitting of parliament this week, in acknowledging the tragic loss of Sergeant Blaine Diddams, a patrol commander with the Special Air Service Regiment who had done 10 tours of duty across Australia's conflict zones, including seven in Afghanistan. He was, tragically, the 33rd soldier to be killed in action on combat operations in Afghanistan and the 16th SOTG soldier killed in action. Since the beginning of this year, 21 further Australian soldiers have been wounded in action, 14 from strikes from improvised explosive devices. A total of 234 Australians have been wounded in action serving their country since the start combat operations in Afghanistan. We will not forget them. We will not leave a stone unturned to assist them. I note that, a few weeks ago on Channel 10, Matt Moran aired a story of Private H, from the 2nd Commando Regiment, who was shot in the neck during the engagement that tragically saw the death of Sergeant Todd Langley. What was disturbing about what Channel 10 aired was that Private H was having to pay for alternative treatment to address some of his disability or, indeed, using unit trusts. This should not be. The Chief of Army has quite rightly noted that the system is not perfect and that there are some delays and perhaps too much red tape. This should not be. I simply commit this morning that the coalition will ensure that every wounded soldier is cared for and provided every support, including alternative therapies if needed. I know that the minister is a man of great compassion and will be working towards this end as well. I note that on 24 June MTF4 handed over its mission to my battalion, the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, now known as the 3RAR Task Group. I commend the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, a classmate of mine from the academy and first from RMC Duntroon, Lieutenant Colonel Trent 'Wobbler' Scott. I wish him and his boys and girls-there are many women serving with the 3rd Battalion-all the very best as they seek to do their duty within a very difficult environment. It is an outstanding battalion. They performed exceptionally well during the mission rehearsal exercises. They are well prepared. They are well trained. They are well configured. They have the right gear and the right support. They are mentoring 4,000 soldiers of the ANA 4th Brigade through numerous valleys, hills, mountains and ravines. Be under no doubt: this is a tough gig. They fight a tough of and resilient enemy. They are training the Afghan 4th Brigade from a base that is good, thanks to the great work that the previous battalions at MTF have done. It is still a difficult task. Recently, members of this House from both sides came back from the Australian Defence Force parliamentary program. Some in Afghanistan spoke very highly, not only of our command elements but of our men and women and the work they were doinghigh praise indeed from a bipartisan group that went over to Afghanistan. I note the minister's comments on 17 July: Uruzgan province has started the third tranche of handing over. Command of the CT-U is now with an Australian command element, noting significant US logistics are still in place. That transition is all in line with the Lisbon and Chicago summits and has been agreed with the Afghan government. I note the CDF's recent comments that that most ADF personnel will probably be out of Afghanistan by Christmas 2013, in line with the minister's statement that drawdown from 12 to 18 months will be predominantly complete for most of our force. I again posit the coalition's contention-it has been consistent for the last two years-that this should be, and it has been stated by the government that this will be, a metrics based, commander'sjudgment-led drawdown. We will come home-we should come home-when the training work is done. I am pleased that from 1 July this year the 205th Hero Corps, of which the 4th ANA brigade is part, assumed lead command for security operations in Regional Command South, which includes four southern provinces, Uruzgan among them. I note that the post-transition work is being done. Again, the coalition agrees with the minister that a kinetic element based on the SOTG will remain. We contend again that Australian forces-I believe the minister has made this statement previously-will join our US colleagues for what they call 'Sandhurst in the sand,' and what I call 'Duntroon in the desert'. I still contend that we should let our gunners continue to train in the school of gunnery. Gunners like doing that and they do it well. Clearly, as we are now 12 months out from an election and 18 months out from transition, the minister will need more and more information as the time gets closer as to how the transitions will look and how it will be done in reality. I thank the minister for his update on detainee management. I thank him for the work that the detainee monitoring team has been doing-106 visits since August 2010 well assures us that the issue of detainee management is being well monitored and well supervised. I note the minister's statement that in the last two years 1,653 suspected insurgents have been detained. That is a reasonably large number considering the logistic challenges of, post-capture, detaining someone and bringing them back for tactical questioning and interrogation if needed. I thank the minister, as I have previously, for moving our detention, in line with ISAF partners, to 10 days. I also commend the minister on taking action to extend the detention in one case by a further 20 days. As a former military interrogator I understand the challenges of interrogating. The Afghan soldiers are tough men. It was a good decision to extend the time period out to 20 days. It was a difficult decision. I am sure it would have been the right decision. I note that our enemy continues to use our open and fair processes against us, with 141 still allegations of mistreatment in the last two years-90 per cent complaining about treatment at the point of capture. I remind the House that, at the point of capture, taking a suspected insurgent who does not want to be taken involves a modicum of force! It is not surprising that our enemy would complain about that modicum of force being used to detain them, when that is not what they want. I note that no findings have been substantiated and that every issue of complaint has been investigated. I can only conclude, using the language of the Australian outback, that our enemy at times are 'a pack of whingers'. I note that we have seen what the enemy do to ISAF soldiers: when they capture ISAF soldiers they are brutally tortured and That does not stop us from being fair minded, open, democratic and accountable. The minister has certainly shown that to be the case, to the government's and ISAF's credit. Minister, I note that it is still taking inordinate amount of time to investigate tragic killed-in-actions in theatre. The green on blue incident of 29 October has still not been finalised. I note that the US routinely does this in 60 days. Previously, the minister has said that he would expedite this through extra resources. Minister, it would appear, with this incident still being seven, eight or nine months from being completed, that those resourced are not yielding the result that the parliament would like to see. I think it is fair to say that these investigations need to happen more quickly. If the US can conclude them in 60 days there is no reason why Australia should still be taking nine months. Minister, I also note that the government has 10 sitting days for the Minister for Defence Personnel to respond to my disallowance motion in the House seeking to disallow the cutting of single leave entitlement travel for single members-22,000 single soldiers, sailors and airmen and airwomen. Indeed, the disallowance stops on Monday, 17 September. It is important to state the coalition will not allow the pay, travel or leave entitlements of our soldiers, sailors airmen and airwomen to be cut in search of a vain surplus. We have seen the impact of pride in terms of the disaster on our borders. We will not allow that to permeate into our ADF, resulting in the loss of entitlements. So, Minister, I say to you respectfully: please instruct your Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to schedule a vote on the floor of the House on the cuts to single travel leave entitlements on or by 17 killed. September. We cannot hide behind the CDF's coat-tails on this issue. It is time to vote. Frankly, I am keen to see how the member for Eden-Monaro will vote. He is a man I have great respect for, sitting at the front bench across from me. I want to see an how he will vote when it comes to the leave entitlement for single men and women-of whom I believe you have a lot, Sir, in your electorate. I am keen to see how the member for Canberra will vote, considering she has much of the Defence establishment in Canberra. I am very keen to see how the member for Wakefield will vote, considering he has the base at Edinburgh-on or before, Minister, 17 September. Minister, it will come as no surprise that today I will be moving an amendment to the veterans bill to seek to stop any further debate until DFRDB has been fairly indexed. I have been reliably told, Member for Eden Monaro, and I am happy to be corrected, Parliamentary Secretary, that you told a veterans forum recently that you may be looking to introduce a private member's bill to index DFRDB pensions CSS and PSS. If that is not the case, the coalition will provide leave as soon as I finish speaking to allow you to correct the record. If it is the case, I say to the member for Eden-Monaro: bring on the private member's bill now-or, more importantly, support the coalition as we seek to stop debate on the minor amendments to and the veterans bill coming before the House and support us as we seek to index DFRDB. Either way, the choice is yours. Respond to my contention here. The coalition will provide leave-I am looking at the Manager for Opposition Business-for the member for Eden-Monaro to point out that I am wrong, that he is not intending to bring it in, or to support the coalition. Sir, the choice this morning is yours. Minister, thank you again for providing an opportunity to update the House on Afghanistan. You have been true to your word in terms of keeping the House informed. We look forward to further updates, especially now we are 12 months from an election and 18 months from the full drawdown. We look forward to further advice and information as to how the drawdown will continue. NA Orders of the Day",23

Motorcycle Safety Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) motorcycling is an environmentally friendly and fuel efficient mode of transport which is rapidly increasing in popularity in Australia; (b) motorcyclists make up about 1 per cent of traffic but account for 16 per cent of deaths in road accidents; (c) most motorcycle casualties involve speed and hitting a fixed object; and (d) motorcycle groups are concerned about the safety implications of the design and location of wire rope barriers; and (2) calls on the Government to work with the States and Territories to ensure motorcyclist safety assumes increased importance in road design. Question agreed to. International Aviation and Emissions Trading Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) international civil aviation has been included in the European Union Emissions Trading System (ETS) with effect from 1 January 2012; (b) in September 2011, 23 countries signed a declaration opposing the European Union's plan to include all flights by non-European Union carriers to and from the European Union in its ETS; (c) in November 2011, 26 countries supported an International Civil Aviation Organisation Working Paper which is critical of the European Union ETS and urges the European Union to refrain from including flights by nonEuropean Union members in its scheme; (d) in February 2012, 23 countries concluded a 2 day meeting in Russia on the inclusion of aviation in the European Union ETS by signing a declaration which states that they have a 'unanimous position that the EU and its Member States must cease application of the Directive 2008/101/EC [the European Union ETS] to airlines/aircraft operators registered in third States'; (e) the United States Congress has called on the United States Government to take all possible action to ensure that the European Union ETS is not applied to aircraft registered by the United States or the operators of those aircraft; and (f) China has banned its airlines from participating in the European Union ETS; and (2) calls on the Australian Government to: (a) use all political, diplomatic, and legal at its disposal to ensure that the European Union's ETS is not applied to aircraft registered by Australia or the operators of those aircraft; (b) should the European Union maintain the application of the European Union ETS to flight sectors outside Europe, immediately assess whether the European Union ETS is consistent with the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements and join any WTO challenge; and (c) join any international action to prevent the application of the European Union ETS to non‑European Union airspace.",26
5,Mr TRUSS,BUSINESS," by leave-I move: That the motion be amended by omitting paragraph 2(c), and replacing it with: '(c) join in other appropriate international action to prevent the application of the European Union ETS to non-European Union airspace' The proposed change omits paragraph 2(c) and inserts a new paragraph, which, I understand, will meet the favour of the House. I will not therefore speak at length about it. It calls on the government to join in appropriate international action to prevent the application of the European Union ETS to non-European airspace. It recognises that the original motion may have called upon the government to take some actions which were unwise. This gives it some freedom to ensure that actions are always wise. But it does still include the very key of the proposal, namely, that Australia should do something about the outrageous imposition by the European Union on other countries of what is essentially a tax for flying into their part of global airspace. The reality is that the way the tax is situated, it can be collected on foreign airlines flying over their own airspace. This is clearly an affront to all of the international principles that have been espoused by the international aviation community and, indeed, by the United Nations. It seeks to assert sovereignty over tools areas where clearly they do not have that right. I think it is important for government to speak out and to act strongly to resist these sorts of initiatives.",29
6,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS, Is the amendment seconded?,29
7,Mr HARTSUYKER,BUSINESS, I second the amendment.,29
8,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (09:39): The government supports the amendment moved by the Leader of the Nationals. The government has been extremely active in expressing Australia's concerns and in opposing the measures that have been imposed in the European ETS system as it would apply to aviation. The government's position has been very clear with regard to aviation and shipping. As a global industry, they need to take action to address emissions, but the appropriate forums through which to do that are the global bodies-the International Maritime Organisation with regard to shipping and ICAO with regard to aviation. I had a meeting with the European Commissioner for Transport in Leipzig in May, while I was attending the International Transport Forum, at which I reiterated Australia's position, which has been consistent in all forums, including transport forums, the UNFCCC and other bodies. Australia will continue to put our position extremely strongly. It has the support of the Australian aviation industry. I thank the shadow minister for amending his original proposition to recognise that it would have created issues which were not intended when the Leader of the Nationals moved that initial resolution. With the support of this amendment, the resolution will, I believe, now receive the unanimous support of the House. It is very important, as Australia participates in international affairs, that wherever possible we ensure there is bipartisanship, because that strengthens our negotiations at the international forums in which we participate. Question agreed to. Original question, as amended, agreed to. Accountability and Transparency of Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) serious allegations have been made surrounding the misappropriation of union members' funds by union leaders; (b) Australian Council of Trade Unions Secretary, Dave Oliver, has said that every union Southcott, AJ member has the right to know that their money is going to be subject to good governance and good regulation; and (c) Australian Workers Union National Secretary, Paul Howes, has said he supports bringing unions' accountability and transparency in line with the Corporations Act 2001; and (2) calls on the Government to implement a plan that will expect the same standards of accountability and transparency of union leaders as are expected of Company Directors under the Corporations Act 2001.",29

15,Mr SHORTEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (10:05): by leaveOn 14 March this year, in my first ministerial statement on workplace health and safety in this place, I said that every Australian who goes to work should return home safely. I know both sides of the House endorse this universal human right and today I reaffirm our commitment to this principle. And, just as in the workplace, Australians of course deserve to be safe once they are at home too. Safety of our citizens is a fundamental role of government. But there is a clear and present danger to our workplace and domestic safety, and I speak of asbestos. The International Labour Organisation has reported that about every five minutes NOES someone around the world dies of an asbestos related disease. Nearly 80 per cent of worldwide asbestos production between 1900 and 2004 has occurred since 1960constituting somewhere between 143 million and 182 million tonnes. This is despite the fact that medical information about the hazards of asbestos was at a knowledge peak by this time half a century ago. I have been hearing this all my life in the Labor movement, as I am sure many others of my colleagues have, the following words: 'what we could learn from, what we're going to do, what we're going to set up'. And, to be fair, much has been achieved, including various bans on asbestos. Much of the progress was achieved by the hard and continuing struggle by Australian trade unions. I would like to acknowledge the late Bernie Banton, my ministerial colleague Greg Combet and Senator Lisa Singh amongst a range of campaigners. It was an inevitable development of these strong and impassioned efforts that a Labor government, under my ministerial predecessor Senator Chris Evans, commissioned the Asbestos Management Review on 29 October 2010. I will come to the details of this review shortly. The compelling reasons for commissioning the report, however, twist through our long workplace health and safety story as a tragic fibre in a deathly web. Asbestos was widely used throughout Australia for much of the 20th century. This nation had one of the highest rates of usage of asbestos during that period in public buildings and residential properties. As a consequence, today Australia has the highest reported per capita incidence of asbestos related disease in the world. More Australians will die of asbestos related diseases than were killed in the First World War. Due to extensive asbestos use throughout the country, and incubation periods of up to 50 years or more between exposure and the manifestation of disease, the sad reality is that Australians will continue to contract and die from asbestos related diseases for many years to come. Despite the Australia-wide ban on the production, importation or use of asbestos or asbestos products that was introduced in 2003, asbestos can still be found in older public buildings and residences. This is usually in the form of asbestos cement (fibro) walls, both internal and external, corrugated roofing and pipes and many other products such as vinyl floor tiles, lagging on pipes and insulation in wood heaters. It would surprise many people just how widely used asbestos has been. In addition to walls and corrugated roofing, asbestos can be present in fire blankets and curtains; pipes and tubes; shingles or tiles; asbestos tape rope; putties, adhesives and sealants; textured paints and coatings; brake pads and clutch facings; and even in the material that lines pot plants. Even though the mining and industrial use of asbestos has all but been banished from Australia, asbestos can potentially appear across almost all of our daily activities. Asbestos remains one of the most serious issues in our workplaces. But it is increasingly clear that it is much more than this. In 2010, 642 people died of mesothelioma, perhaps the most insidious form of asbestos related disease. This equates to over 45 per cent-almost half-of the national road toll in 2010, which was 1,352 deaths. Mesothelioma has a latency period of between 20 and 50 or more years after exposure, meaning that workers exposed to asbestos a generation ago might still contract the disease, which is almost always fatal and for which there is no cure. The average life expectancy of a person diagnosed with this deadly disease is between 10 and 12 months. More than 650 Australians are diagnosed with mesothelioma most years, and experts predict that this rate will not taper off until 2022. This means that, as a country, we face another 10 years of increasing asbestos deaths before we begin to see the numbers start to reduce, and many more years until those diseases no longer kill large numbers of Australians. Sadly for those Australians who have been exposed to asbestos, in whatever setting, there is nothing that can be done to turn back time and protect them from asbestos exposure. But this government is committed to protecting the health of Australians who might still yet be exposed to asbestos unless actions are taken immediately. There are huge amount of asbestos in the and built environment, and the greatest risk to Australians is the risk of exposure to home renovators, tradespeople, demolition workers and people who are living in homes that are being renovated. Every weekend around our great country, thousands of Australians undertake projects to enhance and improve their No. 1 investment-their castle, their home. But the hidden truth is that this can also pose a serious danger to their health. Amid the obvious DIY dangers of power tools, ladders and hammers hitting thumbs lurks asbestos, that malevolent building material so widely used in Australia until the 1990s and not fully banned until 2003. Asbestos poses a danger in our own homes, so we must take care. An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Australians will be diagnosed with asbestos related disease over the next 20 years, and researchers, policymakers and we in the Gillard government fear the third wave of asbestos deaths from people exposed in the home. This third wave includes men and women who have already built, renovated or demolished a house, garage or fence containing asbestos; those wives who have innocently washed asbestos laden clothes; and those children who watched their dad fix or take down the old fibro shed and many years later may have an asbestos fibre lurking in their lungs. About a third of homes built between 1945 and the late 1980s contain some asbestos products-in walls, ceilings, eaves, kitchens, bathrooms, vinyl floor tiles, sheds and garages. In late June in Melbourne, I joined with hosts from the television renovation show The Block and the major hardware retailer Mitre 10 to help raise awareness for DIY renovators about the dangers of asbestos. We launched a new brochure called 'Identifying Asbestos in your Home', a pamphlet specifically designed to help alert DIY renovators where asbestos might be found in homes and what it may look like. It has been adapted from a book by Brian Sketcher, from Asbestos Audits Queensland, and funded through the federal government's Asbestos Innovation Fund. The Asbestos Innovation Fund is designed to develop practical programs to raise awareness of asbestos and improve its management and removal. We know that Australians love getting in and having a go-renovating and fixing things around the home is one of our great national pastimes. But we all do need to take care not to expose ourselves and our families and children to asbestos. All home renovators should get advice before renovating. Just as we are encouraged to 'dial before we dig', I would urge everyone to take their time to ensure the appropriate steps are taken to protect themselves and their families. If anyone has any doubt at all, there are qualified asbestos removalists in every state and territory. Home renovation is a national passion and preoccupation in Australia, but we do need to protect ourselves and those we love from accidental exposure to this silent killer. It is important to recognise that, far away from the family home, asbestos exposure is also possible through asbestos tailings, old mines and mills, landfill and illegally dumped asbestos. The Asbestos Management Review It is for all of these reasons that this Labor government prioritised the need for an asbestos management review, the report and findings of which we release today. This review was tasked with making recommendations for the development of a national strategic plan to improve asbestos awareness and management and was undertaken over the past 18 months. It has been headed by Geoff Fary who was assisted by an advisory group comprised of experts across a range of professions. The members of the advisory group were:  Mr Jim Barrett-Executive Director of the Australian Constructors Association  the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union  Mr Lindsay Fraser AM-Assistant Secretary of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union  Dr Robert Guthrie-Adjunct Professor of Workers' Compensation and Workplace Laws at Curtin University  Mr Tim Hammond-Barrister at Francis Burt Chambers, Perth  Ms Sylvia Kidziak AM-Managing Director of SL Engineering  Professor Bruce Robinson-Director of the National Centre for Asbestos Related Diseases  Ms Tanya Segelov-Partner, Turner Freeman Lawyers  Professor Nico van Zandwijk-Director of the Asbestos Diseases Research Institute. I thank each of these people for their important contribution. In addition I would like to acknowledge Dr Daniel Mulino in my office, and Dr Yossi Berger of the Australian Workers' Union, each of whom have helped guide my thinking on these matters. While different levels of government have individually and at times together agreed on asbestos related measures, the sad truth is that until this review commissioned by the Gillard government Australia has never genuinely contemplated a comprehensive national strategy to manage asbestos and raise awareness about it. Understanding the review At the rudimentary 'do not miss this point' level, the review confirms that action must result in a substantial increase in the number of people breathing less asbestos fibres. Despite all the hopeful discussions about durations of exposure or exposure levels, more asbestos fibres resident in the lungs is never better than less. Cladding, encapsulation and supervision of such materials have in the past condemned some people to inhaling more not less asbestos fibres. And some of them too will be killed by such exposure. As a union organiser I remember anxious workers asking me if the small amount of asbestos fibres they had inhaled was likely to kill them. 'Probably not,' I told them, 'probably not.' That's the best I could tell them-'probably not'. I knew at the time that there is no known minimum safe level for asbestos fibres. Show me the scientist who is prepared to say which small group of asbestos fibres I am inhaling now is the one that will not harm me. The New York medical researcher Dr Irving J. Selikoff, renowned for his life's work on asbestos, concluded that the asbestos catastrophe resulted in part from human failure to anticipate its scale. The situation he described in a paper published after his death refers to the industrial nations where asbestos companies and their insurers have had to bear substantial financial responsibility for the toll of asbestos disease. Dr Selikoff observed: 'The asbestos disaster did not result from superficial miscalculations. Rather, it resulted from very careful calculations, many of which were wrong. They were made not only by scientists but by individuals who were skilled in making estimates (e.g., auditors and actuaries for insurance companies that provided policies to companies making asbestos products). They were wrong in their predictions and are now liable for huge sums of money. These are troubling reflections, particularly when we remember that ""statistics are human beings with the tears wiped away.""' The toll in human suffering is increased where the responsible parties escape, with impunity, liability for the tragic human consequences of their actions. This is the case still in countries where they still have thriving asbestos industries. Key recommendations For the benefit of the House let me walk members through some of the key recommendations arising from the report. The review recommends:  That the Australian government lead and advocate for all jurisdictions to agree to the development of a National Strategic Plan for Asbestos Awareness and Management in Australia. o This is an issue that cuts across state boundaries and across industry demarcations. o The review has observed that: 'Current work health and safety laws provide some framework management of asbestos issues within the workplace but there is no coordinated framework in place in relation to non-employment-related exposure. This needs to be addressed at the national level.' o The report argues that dealing with Australia's asbestos legacy requires a national and systematic approach. The report also recommends that:  the Australian government support and legislate for the establishment of a new national agency to have responsibility for the implementation, review, refinement and further development of the plan;  the National Strategic Plan provide for the investigation of the prioritised removal of asbestos-containing materials government and commercial buildings by 2030;  the National Strategic Plan provide for a requirement that an asbestos content report (ACR) be undertaken by a competent assessor to determine and disclose the existence of ACMs in residential properties constructed prior to 1987 at the point of sale or lease, and prior to renovation, together with a property labelling system to alert workers and potential purchasers and tenants to the presence of asbestos. When we announced the review nearly two years ago, Professor Bruce Robinson, the director of the National Centre for Asbestos Related Diseases, said he believed the national review was a major step forward. To quote Professor Robinson: … a successful strategy involves more than just one ministry, one area. It needs the best people the country to put their minds together to work out how to stop people being exposed in the future … for the With this review we have brought good people together. And we shall listen to them with forensic passion. Those who have suffered and died from mesothelioma and other asbestos related diseases had lives with unfulfilled potential-from community sports stars, to fitters and turners, to country town chippies, to mums and dads. But we will never know what they might have achieved because they are lost to us. And we will lose more of them to this implacable grim reaper, just as their wives and husbands, sons and daughters, workmates and cousins, mothers and fathers will lose them. So we must act, to protect. The full report will be available online shortly, and I table the recommendations with this statement. Be assured this government will consider the from recommendations carefully and speedily. This report demonstrates how critical and urgent the issue is. It is an issue for all levels of government. It is an issue affecting people at work, in schools, in hospitals and at home. I am going to consult with all jurisdictions and all of the groups that have campaigned for action on asbestos to develop a quick response to the review. This is a once in a generation report. I expect that the changes that come from our response to it will be substantial. Many lives are counting on it. I thank the House. I present the copy of the ministerial statement. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Farrer to speak for 17 minutes. Leave granted.",35
16,Mr SHORTEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional in orders be suspended as would prevent Ms Ley speaking for a period not exceeding 17 minutes. Question agreed to.,39
17,Ms LEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I thank the minister for bringing the review and his initial response to the parliament this morning. All members of the House support the need to ensure that when a mum or dad waves goodbye to their children in the morning they come home from work safely to still be there in the afternoon. As the mother of a newly graduated electrician who spends a large part of his days crawling through roofs and therefore encountering asbestos on a daily basis, I, like many other Australians, have worried about this issue. I have sought reassurance that the best possible workplace practices are there for my son in his workplace. We in Australia have the highest reported per capita incidence of asbestos related disease in the world. It is estimated that by 2020 there will be 13,000 cases of mesothelioma in Australia. A further 40,000 Australians will contract asbestos related cancer. Mesothelioma and asbestos related cancer are different in the way that they affect families. These cancers do not affect you today or tomorrow but in 10, 20 or 30 years or even longer after exposure. As a local member in a large rural electorate in western New South Wales, there are many communities with old houses and people on low and fixed incomes, people who you would say are on the fringes of society. Over the years I have seen and heard of too many who have passed away because of exposure to asbestos. These are the stories that not only cripple the families and friends but impact entire communities. While Australia has had a nationwide ban on the production, importation and use of asbestos since 2003, many buildings in Australia still have asbestos or asbestos products within them which put at risk in particular do-ityourself home builders and renovators. This review and its response arguably deal with the conventional, but we may need to broaden our response to a whole-ofgovernment one. Thousands of cheap Chinese cars are coming into this country with asbestos in their exhaust gaskets. The authorities are grappling with the realities of what a recall would involve, because in the case of an exhaust gasket you may never need to touch it, but if you decide you have to remove it the gasket could perhaps break down and you would have to scrape it out of the exhaust. That is where the problem arises. You may in fact be creating a problem by issuing a recall. This highlights the complexity of what we are dealing with. The coalition supported the establishment of the asbestos management review in 2010 and we support action to stop the continued exposure of Australians to asbestos. We have not had the opportunity to examine this review in detail. However, on the face of it, most if not all of the recommendations seem reasonable and we are of course prepared to work with the government to advance this to the next stage. I do agree with the minister that this is a critical and urgent issue that requires all tiers of government to work together to provide a positive outcome. I urge the minister to broaden his consultation on how the strategy is implemented. The government needs to involve the builders, the tradesmen and the small business contractors-the people who are working at the sharp end. I ask the minister to expand the consultation to these practitioners who are working at the coalface, the people who contend with the health concerns, the physical realities and the cost of the potential removal and amelioration of asbestos hazards on a day-today basis. As yet in this broad, high-level strategy we have not heard their voices and we do need to seek their advice. I note the minister's comment on the recommendation that, as part of the Australian government leading jurisdictions to develop a national plan for asbestos management, a new national agency be created to have the responsibility for implementing such a plan. The coalition will not stand in the way of sound public policy initiatives issuing from this parliament to reduce the scourge of asbestos. But I make the point that since Labor came to office in 2007 we have had so many new national partnerships, national approaches, national agencies and new bureaucracies and I am not convinced that they always achieve what they set out to do, although they are very good at spending public money here in Canberra. Perhaps the actions that we need to take could be taken within existing structures at state level, allowing the funds to flow to communities, to awareness raising and to the actual task of identifying asbestos related risks. In conclusion, may I say that we do believe it is important to address this in a bipartisan manner so that we can ensure that Australians are not struck down by this disease and can live to see not just their children grow up but their grandchildren and even their great-grandchildren. I appreciate the minister's swift action in returning, I understand, to the House within not too many more weeks with the next stage of the process. NA Electoral Matters Committee",40
18,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's advisory report on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Procedure) Bill 2012. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper. all Mr MELHAM: by leave-The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Procedure) Bill 2012 amends postal voting arrangements, increases nomination deposits for Senate and House of Representatives candidates, increases the nominators required for unendorsed candidates and Senate groups, changes the unsound mind exemption from enrolment and voting, and makes minor technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The committee supports the changes in schedules 1 and 2 of the bill. However, it has some concerns about the schedule 3 changes to the unsound mind provisions and has recommended certain amendments. Schedule 3 proposes changes to the unsound mind provision in subsection 93(8) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That section exempts a person from enrolling and voting if they are incapable of understanding the nature and significance of enrolment and voting. That is the proposed section. Thousands of people are using the provision each year. They may be facing temporary or ongoing mental health challenges that compromise their capacity to cast a vote. It is generally someone close to the affected person who will seek to have that person exempted under subsection 93(8). The Australian Electoral Commission cannot initiate a removal from the roll on these grounds. The committee is sensitive to community Report concerns that the phrase 'unsound mind' is offensive and that the provision prevents some people from voting. Given Australia's system of compulsory enrolment and voting, it is useful to have a mechanism to address this to protect the integrity of elections and assist those who are unable to meet their enrolment and voting obligations. Based on the evidence received, the committee is not satisfied that there is any pressing need to remove or substitute the phrase 'unsound mind'. It is an established phrase with meaning in the law. The committee has recommended retaining the phrase 'unsound mind' in subsection 93(8). To remove it risks broadening the exemption and potentially disenfranchising more electors. The committee also supports the current requirement for a certificate from a medical practitioner. With other professions, such as psychiatrists and social workers, making these determinations it could unfairly disenfranchise people if these additional qualified people are less stringent in judging a person's capacity to understand the significance of enrolment and voting. I now turn to schedules 1 and 2 of the bill, which relate to postal voting and nomination requirements. In referring the bill, the Selection Committee noted that the bill was ambiguous in relation to the specific changes being made to processing postal vote applications. In its review of the bill the committee found that a number of the changes relating to postal voting largely reflect existing AEC practices. These changes will simply ensure that the Electoral Act correctly outlines the processes that have evolved to help ensure the efficient processing of postal vote applications and distribution of postal vote packages. Most PVAs are already processed centrally from PVPs distributed through the AEC's central print system-93 per cent for the 2010 federal election. At the next election there also will be the option to apply online. These online applications will be centrally processed. The Divisional Returning Officer is no longer the main conduit for postal voting activities. However, the Electoral Commissioner will continue to delegate his powers in relation to postal votes to Divisional Returning Officers and other AEC officers. This change will not affect the way in which individuals and political parties interact with their DROs on postal voting matters. As is the current practice, political parties will still be able to distribute PVAs with campaigning material, receive completed PVAs and forward them to the relevant DRO. In the case of issuing PVPs to a person rather than specifically to an elector, the AEC indicated that it already issues PVPs to unmatched applicants who are not found on the electoral roll. The return ballot papers are then subject to further scrutiny and admitted to the count only if the person is verified to be an elector. This is in keeping with the approach taken with declaration voters. While having a variety of candidates is a feature of Australia's democracy, large numbers of candidates means an expanded ballot paper and it increases the complexity of the voting task for electors. Setting appropriate nomination requirements is one way to help ensure that prospective candidates appreciate the seriousness of their participation in the electoral process, if they can demonstrate some community support for their candidacy. Increasing the nomination deposit from $1,000 to $2,000 for Senate candidates and from $500 to $1,000 for House of Representatives candidates is reasonable and appropriate. The increase from 50 to 100 nominators required for candidates not endorsed by a political party is reasonable. It is important that unendorsed candidates be able to demonstrate community support for their candidacy. Similarly, if unendorsed candidates wish to be grouped on the Senate ballot paper it is appropriate that each member of a Senate group be able to demonstrate community support for the grouping. The bill will increase the nominators from 50 for the whole group to 100 per candidate. As the proposed new requirement is for unendorsed candidates to have 100 nominators, they should be able to draw on this support base to secure their Senate group box. On behalf of the committee I thank the organisations and individuals who assisted the committee during the inquiry through submissions or by participating in the round table discussion in Canberra. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their work and contribution to this report and I thank the secretariat for their work on this inquiry. I commend the report to the House. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (10:35): by leave-In rising to speak to this report from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters I would like to point out to the chamber that this is in fact a most unusual report coming from this committee, because it is unanimous. I think it is the only one to be so since this committee was formed after the last election, because normally the issues are extremely partisan and the committee report usually reflects only the views of the government and Greens members. However, on this occasion, because it sought to implement recommendations 12, 31 and 32 of the joint standing committee's report on the last election, these were provisions that the opposition did not dissent from, so we were able to look at the bill in a different way. Normally we have differing points of view from the beginning. I think it is important to point out second reading speech of the minister did initially cause me, and others, to think that this bill was doing something quite radical with regard to the way that, in particular, postal vote applications are dealt with. The minister said in his speech that 'Schedule 1 to the bill will simplify the postal vote arrangements by directing all applications to either the electoral commissioner or an assistant returning officer.' He went on to say: Directing the majority of postal vote applications to the electoral commissioner will enable the centralised processing by computers and the centralised dispatch of postal vote packages. When we in fact took evidence from the Australian Electoral Commission, we found that that is precisely what is happening now, and that these provisions of the bill will make not any difference whatsoever to the way in which the Electoral Commission deals with postal vote applications. In 1999 they had sought legal advice as to whether or not the existing legislation would enable them to deal with the sending out of packages in a centralised manner and they have been doing it since then. So we were somewhat mystified about the real intent of the provisions. However, it is sensible to tidy up language in the bill, and we agree to that. But there was a most concerning part, so far as I was concerned-and that dealt with the delegation of the powers of the Electoral Commissioner. The way the system works is that political parties take the postal vote applications which are returned to them to the DRO, the divisional returning officer, and they are then sent into the centralised system. But we did not want to see the system changed such that we had to go to some central point. That would make the system unworkable. And there is no provision in the legislation for that power to that the be delegated to DROs. So I sought an undertaking from the Electoral Commissioner, in whom all power is now vested, and asked him: So you are giving me an undertaking today that you will in fact delegate to DROs? Mr Killesteyn answered, 'Indeed.' I then said: Good. So there will be no attempt to not delegate to them? I accept your word that you will delegate to DROs. Mr Killesteyn said: The process that you see as a member of parliament or, rather, will see as a candidate, where you would take your postal vote applications to your local office, will still there. I then added that that was fine by me because, as the chair had pointed out, this was evidence under oath. So I accepted that the practice will continue. I think it is important that we received that undertaking, because it is on that basis that the opposition members can agree to a unanimous report on this occasion. I and the coalition do, however, believe that it would be best in some form of legislation, be it primary or subordinate legislation. I think it is important that we see that that power does in fact remain delegated to the DROs. It is important to note that another commissioner may take a different point of view and, for that reason, I would like to see it in legislative form. The other provisions of the bill were outlined by the chairman of the committee, dealing with the increase in nomination fees to be paid when candidates nominate for either the House or the Senate. They also dealt with the fact that the 500 people who are shown as members of a political party will now have to be electors, not simply entitled to vote, and that we will also see the required number of supporters for unaligned candidates rise from 50 to 100. We concurred with those recommendations. I now want to turn, however, to the question of the use of the term 'unsound mind'. The coalition parties have always been concerned that the major task of the Australian Electoral Commission is to keep the integrity of the roll. That is why we have voted against, and disagreed with, automatic enrolment and certain other provisions. We believe that 'unsound mind' remains a term which does have a legal meaning, because it has been interpreted. It is interesting that there have been attempts to change the provision in the act allowing for the removal be of someone of unsound mind from the roll. The provision allows for that to be done at the initiation of family-but requires a medical certificate. With respect to that provision, in the belief of all committee members-indeed, from certain evidence that was given to us, including the supplementary submission from people with a disability who believed that having a provision in there at all to remove anyone from the roll in this area was a discrimination-the wording which is included in the bill would in fact result in an expansion of the number of people who could be removed from the roll. I went back through the history of this term. After the 1996 election it was considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and they accepted the advice of the then Australian Electoral Commission that the wording not be changed. Although the Electoral Commission seems to have a different view at this stage, we believe that the earlier view they held is the correct one. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the bill should be passed, but only after deleting the changes proposed in schedule 3 in relation to the unsound mind provision and consequential amendments. The term 'unsound mind' and the current requirements for a certificate from a medical practitioner should be retained. I do sincerely hope that the government will pay heed to this recommendation that the committee has made because, as I said, it is quite unusual in that it is unanimously supported by all members of the committee, and indeed was supported by evidence given to us and is in accord with a decision made in Victoria to maintain similar wording. It is also consistent, as I said, with what was decided after the 1996 election, when the then Electoral Commission held that view and the then committee supported that those words should remain as the safest way to protect the integrity of the roll and protect those who wish to vote. So I am pleased to support the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters concerning the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Procedure) Bill 2012, which thereby means that there would be support for schedules 1 and 2, but we would seek for the government to heed the recommendations and alter or amend schedule 3 to let the words 'unsound mind', for all the reasons we have both spoken about, remain. Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (10:45): Yesterday the National Secretary of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, Michael O'Connor, put out a press release on behalf of his union urging the House to pass the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 without delay. He said: Workers, their families and their communities are holding on for grim life in the face of imports unfairly undercut them. They expect urgent action from their representatives. He went on to say: The cost advantage that imported manufactured illegally logged wood products unfairly enjoy over manufactured products that utilise legal timber is conservatively estimated to be 20 per cent of the total cost of production. Wood products represent the second largest sector in Australia's manufacturing industry and cheap, imported products are costing workers their jobs and killing their communities. We had bipartisan support for taking action on preventing imports of illegally logged timber and imported wood products that utilise it. We have had three separate inquiries, each of which has recommended action. Further delays are not acceptable and not feasible for timber processing and wood products manufacturing workers, their families and their communities. Their livelihoods are on the line. That is very powerful stuff. But as well as support from the CFMEU, there are additional reasons for the House to pass this bill without further delay. Australian timber imports of the order of $400 million a year come from illegally logged timber, and it has been estimated that Australia's share of the social and environmental costs of illegal logging BILLS amounts to $23 million a year. According to the Australian Conservation Foundation, about 22 per cent of the wooden furniture imported into Australia every year-more than one in every five pieces of wooden furniture-is believed to be made from illegal timber. Australia is the largest importer of processed timber from Papua New Guinea, where the World Bank estimates 70 per cent of the logging is illegally conducted. Indonesia is losing more than two million hectares of forest per year to logging and burning. In 2006 the Indonesian government lost more than US$2 that billion from untaxed illegal logging, artificially low forest royalties and illegal transfer pricing. A 2006 World Bank report estimated the financial losses to the global timber market at US$10 billion a year and the revenue losses to producer countries at US$5 billion a year. Another study estimated that trade in illegally produced logs reduced global timber prices by between seven and 16 per cent. Modelling of the financial consequences of illegal logging for the study gave the following results. Producers of legal forest products in non-risk and high-cost countries, like the United States, Europe and New Zealand, are worse off by around US$15 billion a year due to reduced production, lower prices and lost trade opportunities caused by illegal logging. High-cost legal producers in risk countries, such as China, Indonesia, Russia and Malaysia, receive profits and income that are around US$31 billion lower than they would be without illegal logging. Illegal logging causes the displacement forest dependent communities from their livelihoods, cultural identity and spiritual values and the removal of important carbon sinks. Illegal logging undermines good governance and development efforts in several of Australia's closest neighbours, especially Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. A 2010 Centre for International Economics report for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry estimated that the global trade in illegally logged timber products was $15 billion a year, with the social and environmental costs of such illegal logging being US$60 billion a year. Around 10 per cent of the sawn wood imports into Australia come from what are deemed to be high-risk nations, or nations where a large proportion of timber production is illegal-notably Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. 1 believe we need to ensure that Australian imports of forestry products are consistent with the goals of Australian aid programs and our stated commitments to reduce greenhouse gases. According to the Australia Institute report Rough trade: how Australia's trade policies contribute to illegal logging in the Pacific region, Australian aid includes programs and projects to help Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Island nations to better manage their forestry resources for long-term sustainability, for maximum socio-economic benefit for their citizens and to participate in the REDD-reduced emissions from deforestation and forest destruction, the innovative program rewarding carbon sequestration. Illegal logging in these countries is more extensive than generally understood and is a serious impediment to achieving the goals of Australian aid programs. Continued illegal logging demonstrates that governments of cannot protect their forest resources and it undermines their credibility for participation in the REDD mechanism. Aid program managers and policymakers must be aware of the pitfalls in implementing REDD and programs must be coordinated with a clampdown on illegal logging, or they will not work. According to TEAR Australia, an estimated 10 per cent of all imported wood in Australia has been illegally logged. Illegal logging in neighbouring countries like PNG and Indonesia is a criminal offence-for good reason. It wreaks environmental destruction and displaces indigenous peoples and animal species who live in the forests. Illegal logging flouts the law for profit, cheating already impoverished communities out of a fair price for their timber. This product of this lucrative trade of corruption and crime ends up in Australian households, which unknowingly buy this cheap imported wood. As Australian consumers, we do not want to be implicated in the destruction of someone else's home to build our own homes. James Cook University rainforest ecologist Professor William Laurance has called for tighter laws to halt illegal timber imports, insisting on stricter labelling of timber products to track the country of origin. Vague labels such as 'made in China' are not helpful to consumers, according to Professor Laurance, and are likely to be misleading, given China's dominant role in the global illegal timber trade. Although manufactured in China, the products could be made from timber harvested illegally in Africa, South America, Asia or Papua New Guinea. Less than five per cent of tropical timber is currently eco-certified as being obtained from a sustainably harvested source. According to Professor Laurance: The current eco-labelling accreditation schemes are a long way from perfect, and need to be improved. Then you have countries like Indonesia and Malaysia that have developed their own accreditation schemes, but in several instances, these have been shown to be fairly lax. Professor Laurance said that China had developed an immense export market for wood and paper products, driving large-scale clearing of tropical forests in Sumatra and Borneo. He said: During a recent visit to Sumatra, I witnessed felling of large expanses of native rainforests, which are being chopped up and fed into the world's largest wood-pulp plant, located nearby, and replaced by monocultures of exotic acacia trees. He said that China had done 'little to combat the scourge of illegal logging' and is estimated to have imported between 16 million and 24 million cubic metres of illegal timber every year over the past decade. Professor Laurance said: That is an incredible figure, twice the amount imported annually by leading industrial nations. Professor Laurance has said that, while Chinese government agencies commissioned an analysis of China's role in the illegal timber trade, there was no national plan or laws to prevent the import of illegal timber. According to a report by Interpol and the World Bank, illegal or 'predatory' logging is estimated to defraud developing nations of about $15 million each year in tax and timber royalty evasions. Last year, Greenpeace exposed an illegal timber scandal in Sydney city, which originated in the Malaysian rainforests of Borneo. Greenpeace exposed the use of illegal timber on the development site, Central Park. The developers took action. Frasers Property Australia promised to audit and remove any illegally logged timber from the worksite. Even better, it committed to using only the FSC certified timber thereafter. The fact that a company who wanted to do the right thing was using illegal timber highlights the need for the legislation that is before the House to introduce effective laws to stop illegal timber ending up in Australia. Greenpeace investigations in Australia, coupled with on-the-ground investigations by British organisation Earthsight, have revealed that illegal timber stolen from rainforests in poor communities is presently the bought and sold across Australia by Australian companies. The plywood found at the Central Park development in Sydney's CBD came from timber concessions in Sarawak, where systematic and widespread incidents of illegal logging have been documented. One of the world's largest and most notorious logging companies, Samling, was found to be logging protected species, encroaching on areas designated as national parks, destroying rivers and fraudulently tagging logs. According to a Greenpeace report: Samling is the largest Malaysian logging company operating in the state of Sarawak, on the had island of Borneo in Malaysia, where it is logging in an area two-thirds the size of Wales. Samling has a history of illegal logging and abuse of indigenous people's rights in Malaysia, Guyana, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea. In 2009, the Norwegian Government published a report documenting illegal logging by Samling and instructed its state-owned pension fund to divest its significant shareholdings. The people of Bongu Village in Madang, Papua New Guinea, have been locked in a bitter fight to keep their timber in the ground. Their forests are being illegally felled by a timber contractor to be exported to another country. The people of Bongu Village have been watching their livelihoods disappear. They are seeing the opportunities for their children to go to school and for their families to make a better life for themselves simply being turned into cheap furniture for our homes, paper for our offices and coverings for our floors. We have been robbing one of our closest neighbours of their livelihoods simply to satisfy our demand for cheap timber. Bongu Village is just one of thousands of communities devastated by illegal logging. This bill seeks to restrict the flow of illegal timber into Australia. In essence, this bill seeks to stop the theft of community resources like those which have been stolen from Bongu Village. This bill is Australia doing its duty as a responsible consumer of timber products. It is the right thing to do for Australia and it is the right thing to do for communities in our neighbouring countries. I also believe we need to address the issue of palm oil plantations if we are genuinely committed to stopping the theft of resources from communities within our neighbouring countries. I support the campaign of Zoos Victoria and others on this matter. I want to read a quote from an article by Father Ed Meli, a Catholic priest from Divine Word University in Papua New Guinea. He said: I see people's livelihood destroyed in terms of their life's sustenance. Huge parts of the virgin forest cleared used to be where people do their gardening, hunting, and collecting of different food stuff and materials for building their local traditional houses and homes. Father Meli is describing watching hectares of virgin forest cleared to make way for oil palm plantations in Silovuti, Papua New Guinea. Just like the people of Bongu Village watching their livelihoods being destroyed by illegal logging, the people of Silovuti are watching their livelihoods disappear to satisfy Australia's demand for cheap palm oil. Just as we should be responsible consumers of timber, we should also be responsible consumers of palm oil. Palm oil is found in almost half the products on our supermarket shelves, yet it is not labelled. Without the labelling of palm oil we have no idea if we are fuelling the kind of destruction happening right now in places like Silovuti. Labelling will help us create a consumer driven market for certified sustainable palm oil-a form of palm oil that is produced in a more environmentally, socially and economically responsible way. I support the mandatory labelling of palm oil in Australia and for Australia be one of the nations in the world that focuses on importing certified sustainable palm oil. I welcome this bill to the parliament. It honours the government's 2010 election commitment to combat illegal logging by restricting the importation and sale of illegally logged timber in Australia. The bill creates greater business certainty for Australia's domestic timber producers and suppliers, and provides an assurance to consumers that the products they purchase are legally sourced. The bill will put Australia at the forefront of global action to combat illegal logging and associated trade, which, as I have pointed out, is responsible for significant environmental, social and economic impacts. The Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 will make it an offence to import timber and process domestic raw logs that have been illegally harvested. The aim of the prohibition is to restrict timber that has been illegally harvested from entering the Australian market. It will provide consumers with confidence that the timber they buy, whether it is furniture or product off the shelf from the local hardware store, does not contain illegally logged timber. The government recognises that these measures are an essential first step towards a longer term goal of Australia sourcing timber products from sustainably managed forests, wherever they are in the world. I congratulate the Labor government for implementing its election commitment to restrict the importation of illegally logged timber through this bill. This bill is an important piece of legislation, and somewhat historic-I understand that only the United States has a similar piece of law in force. I commend the bill to the House.",41
19,Mr HUNT,COMMITTEES," I support many of the words set down by the member for Wills in relation to the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011. I congratulate him on the fact that he is possibly the expert in the House on this issue and on the problem of criminal activity resulting in deforestation, destruction of community lives and unfair advantage in the Australian market. Against that background, we support the principle of this bill very strongly. It is an issue in which I have been engaged for many years. I want to see an end to illegal logging, whether it is in Australia or overseas, for very simple reasons. Firstly, it is about criminal activity. Secondly, it is about destruction of community lives, where in many cases communities are up against not just well-funded but well-armed adversaries. Thirdly, it causes wholesale environmental devastation. The level of emissions can be high and the degree of destruction and the impact on vulnerable species can be total; it can be complete. I note that the member for Wentworth is at the table. Deforestation is something that he and I have been working on for some time. Deforestation accounts for up to 20 per cent of global emissions. So this is an area in which we can have a profound and significant impact. For those reasons, we give deep, genuine and strong support to the principle behind the bill. The problem, as I have mentioned, is threefold. Firstly, there is criminal activity involved. Secondly, the impact on specific communities can be almost complete devastation. Communities in different parts of our region have been effectively destroyed, with no recourse because they have had not just finance but the application of, effectively, armed force against them. What is left is nothing. There is no benefit for them; it is a straight pillage of not just their resources but the entire community lifestyle. The third element is about responsible treatment and a fair go for Australian producers and importers who act in the right way. During preparation for this bill I met with Bunnings. They are the largest importer of timber in Australia, as I understand it-I stand to be corrected, but that was the advice they gave me. They strongly support this bill. They are the ones who could, arguably, be the most adversely affected by it, but they strongly support it out of concern for a level playing field, for doing the right thing and for acting responsibly in custodianship of our products. The difficulty with this legislation is not the intent but the construction. Unfortunately, it contains a blank cheque in terms of the fact that the regulations have not been released and will not be released. We have called for and would like to see the regulations in conjunction with the bill. Providing those would be the reasonable thing to do. If this bill proceeds in its current form, we will not be able to give support until such time as the regulations are available. There is reasonable and appropriate concern that we work with, not against, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia and other countries within our region. But, if the bill does pass, we will not repeal it; we will simply seek to amend and improve it. This is exactly the same set of conditions I set out on behalf of the coalition in relation to the Carbon Farming Initiative. We were concerned about the inadequate amount of information and the failure to publish all the regulations. We did not believe it was ready to proceed until those elements were in place. But, if passed, we will maintain the bill and simply seek to improve it. So we agree with the principle, although we have concerns as to the lack of consultation with our neighbours and therefore the ability to implement it effectively. We certainly have concerns about the blank cheque nature arising from the absence of regulations. We support the principle but we respectfully say to the government that, if they want complete unanimity about the passage of this bill, our requests are reasonable, fair, appropriate and prudent.",49
20,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES," It is good that the opposition have in-principle consideration, after three reports have called for action-but they still find ways of not supporting a very good bill. They always find something to do with process or whatever that is not quite up to their standard. I find that very disappointing, as will most timber workers and the timber industry generally, I believe. The object of the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 is to reduce the harmful environmental, social and economic impact of illegal logging by restricting the importation and sale of illegally logged timber products in Australia. The bill represents a major step by Australia to prevent the trade in illegal timber products both nationally and internationally. It will create greater certainty for Australia's domestic timber producers and suppliers and provide an assurance to consumers that the products they purchase are legally sourced. We have to get our own industry back into some sort of economically sustainable condition so that we have enough local timber to supply our markets, put our foresters back to work and grow that industry. We should ask ourselves why we need such a bill. Australia has been under pressure for years now to ensure that our product is legal and certified to the highest world standard, which it is. But by certifying all export timber, it adds considerable cost to the processes. If we allow the import of timber that does not have that certification, we are doing damage to our own businesses and markets. Australia imports approximately $4.4 billion per annum of timber products-excluding furniture-or 0.034 per cent of global production. Of these imports, the proportion of illegally logged timber is estimated at nine per cent or around $400 million, so the damage to our industry will be quite significant if we keep allowing this to continue. With the passing of this bill, it will be an offence to import timber products containing illegally logged timber, with a penalty of five years imprisonment for breaching the prohibition. Australia's share of the social and environmental costs of illegal logging, therefore, can be estimated to be about $23 million per annum. For many years illegal logging has been recognised as a significant global problem due to its impacts on forest degradation, climate change, habitat loss and community livelihoods in developing timberproducing countries. Deforestation and degradation of tropical forests in the Asia Pacific through illegal logging also constitutes a threat to Australia promoting legal and sustainable forest management in the countries of this region. The problem is exacerbated through lack of measures in timber consumer countries to restrict or prohibit the importation of illegally logged timber and wood products. In response, major timber consumer countries such as the United States and the European Union are implementing measures to prevent trade in illegally logged timber and wood products. Timber producing countries such as Indonesia are also developing timber legality verification schemes to reduce illegal logging and demonstrate the legality of their timber products to their trading partners. We have the idiotic situation in Australia where we are developing a highly sustainable and certified industry and our biggest critics, the Greens, are paying scant attention to the illegal logging going on overseas and driving our potential customers to go to places like Indonesia and Papua New Guinea for their supply. It makes no sense at all. While we are highly regulated Australia, both for harvesting and for our exports, the local industry relies on selfregulation to verify the legal origins of imported timber and wood products. This is undertaken through a mix of voluntary procurement policies and procedures. In some cases, importers assess the risk of products being sourced illegally and put in place arrangements to verify that the products come from legally logged sources. The definition of 'illegally logged' in this instance means harvested in contravention of the law in force in the place, whether or not in Australia, where the timber was harvested. The challenge of prescribing individual requirements in a definition is complicated by the range of legislation, given the number of countries-85 in total-from which Australia imports timber products. An unintended consequence of the prescriptive definition of 'illegally logged' is that it may result in some elements of applicable legislation being overlooked or excluded through omission. The current arrangements are considered by industry to be inefficient because not all businesses undertake any form of due diligence or legality verification and may obtain an unfair cost advantage by sourcing and selling cheap illegal timber. Legitimate operators are also uncertain what constitutes an adequate level of due diligence under the voluntary arrangements. This situation has led to inefficient, highly variable, potentially inadequate legality verification practices, with industry having a limited capacity to resolve this matter through self-regulation. A more structured approach is therefore required. The Australian government's policy objective is 'to combat illegal logging and associated trade by establishing systems that will promote trade in legally logged timber and, in the long term, trade in timber and in wood products from sustainably managed forests'. The government is seeking to meet this objective by identifying illegally logged timber, restricting its import into Australia and requiring disclosure of species, country of harvest and certification at the point of sale. Any regulation to identify and restrict the importation of illegal timber into Australia would similarly apply to the domestic industry. The idea is to identify the multiple elements described in this government's election commitment for what would be defined as illegally sourced timber. To provide a workable definition that can be assessed using legality verification systems, it is proposed that legally sourced timber products are defined as those where timber suppliers have right of access to the forest, complied with the legal right to the harvest and paid all taxes and royalties. Establishing a framework for promoting trade in legally logged timber is an important step towards achieving the government's ultimate goal of promoting trade in timber and wood products from sustainably managed forests. The illegal logging policy objective provides a further demonstration of the government's commitment to the principle of environmentally protected and sustainable forest management. Each country is different and standards vary depending on the degree of development. That is why this bill is important: we need to have a certification process that has world acceptance, not the lowest common denominator of assessment. We want to pull the standards up to ours, not diminish them to Third World standards. That way, we can not only ensure that any timber product that comes into Australia has the highest standard of sustainable timber verification in the world but also work towards assisting other countries to improve their standards of forestry to a properly sustainable level. Why should Australian workers lose their jobs because we import wood from countries with unsustainable, unsafe practices and questionable workplaces, as can be seen in developing countries? These countries need to know that there are big gains to be made by replanting after harvesting, caring for soil and training their workforce on safety issues, and who better than Australian timber workers to help them? In a press release yesterday, the National Secretary of the CFMEU, Mr Michael O'Connor, stated: Workers, their families and their communities are holding on for grim life in the face of imports that unfairly undercut them. They expect urgent action from their representatives. The cost advantage that imported manufactured illegally logged wood products unfairly enjoy over manufactured products that utilise legal timber is conservatively estimated to be 20 per cent of the total cost of production. Wood products represent the second largest sector in Australia's manufacturing industry and cheap, imported products are costing workers their jobs and killing their communities. We had bipartisan support for taking action on preventing imports of illegally logged timber and imported wood products that utilise it. We have had three separate inquiries, each of which has recommended action. Further delays are not acceptable and not feasible for timber processing and wood products manufacturing workers, their families and their communities. Their livelihoods are on the line. Mr O'Connor from the CFMEU is exactly right: Australia is certainly losing out. Australia has to compete on costs now, but if there is similar certification across the region then it evens out the competition so that all timber products from South-East Asia, and including ours, will compete on the quality of the wood and its use rather than its method or legality of harvest. At a time when forestry and its products are being very carefully scrutinised, especially in Tasmania, this bill is important to ensure the standards we expect in Australia can be extended to all products that come into the country. As everyone well knows by now, Tasmania is going through the massive structural change in the forest industry, brought on by some terrible practices of the Greens, who have brought disrepute on our state and our markets for completely selfish reasons. In fact the Greens have a lot to answer for in Tasmania, with the slump in the economy. So it is even more important that we get certification right. I believe we already have more than world's best practice, but if we have to turn more somersaults, spell out more clearly what we do and how we do it then so be it. But under no circumstances can we see workers lose their jobs because Australia is importing illegally logged timber with slack or lower standards of assessment of harvesting practices. Our neighbours to our north can and must come to a world-accepted standard; we need an accreditation process acceptable to all so that we can all go forward. Timber is a renewable product with a very small carbon footprint. It has much advantage over many other products that we use in day-today activities. I fully support the intent of this bill and hope that it passes quickly so that it can give a lift to those who work in this very sustainable industry not only in Tasmania but right throughout Australia. If we allow proper process and make this bill work properly it will be of advantage to this great industry, the timber industry of Australia. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (11:20): I rise to speak on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 and note that the coalition has circulated an amendment to this bill which, in effect, is to delay the start-up of the proposed legislation and the penalties and regulations under it until such time as adequate consultation with industry and with our trading partners has occurred. I regret to say that a hallmark of this government has been the spectacular inadequacy of its consultation processes with relevant parties before it acts, and then it to our country's detriment. The live cattle export ban is a signature example of this government's failure to consult, and then to act to our country's detriment. During the last parliamentary sittings the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade delivered a report on this bill. A principal recommendation of the majority report, recommendation 3, states: The Committee recommends that the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 be passed. I was a member of that committee and I was led to believe that there would be a caveat adding, 'subject to the penalties under the act and the regulations having effect from 1 January 2013'. This was in order to give recognition to the idea that the legislation be aligned with the regulations. However, this caveat did not make it into the report as delivered to the parliament. The coalition members of the subcommittee recommended that the bill not be passed until the draft subordinate legislation had been finalised and had been the subject of further, extensive, community and international consultation. There was evidence to the committee of a lack of consultation, and that was recognised in part by the committee in recommendation 1, which said: The Committee recommends that the Government continues to consult closely with the Governments of Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea and other relevant stakeholders on implementation of the bill and the development of subordinate legislation. This was just a diplomatic way for the Labor members of the committee to reflect the evidence that the government had not consulted properly, let alone closely. The second recommendation was: acts The Committee recommends that the Government facilitate Malaysia and Papua New Guinea's representation on the Illegal Logging Working Group convened by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This was again a polite way to acknowledge the concerns of those countries that had been left out of the consultation process. Considering all this, it was our view that the bill should not be brought on for second reading debate until the first parliamentary session of calendar year 2014 at the earliest. Given the evidence as to how long it would take-it was estimated that it would take between 18 and 24 months-to properly carry out the necessary consultations and draft the regulations, the coalition now seeks that the amendment as circulated, which has an implementation date of July 2015, be adopted. Obviously we cannot expect this to be agreed to, and that is why we are raising our concerns today. We have raised our concerns with the minister and with the government on numerous occasions, so they have been discussed extensively with the government. The coalition took to the last election a promise that we would support satisfactory legislation to prohibit illegal logging. However, given the shortcomings and failings of the bill, we are seeking this amendment. If there is the opportunity to bring into effect the legislation and the regulations, the end result will be a better based on extensive stakeholder consultation and the necessary alignment of the legislation and regulations. The coalition has major reservations about the policy process that has been conducted and about the government's failure to consult adequatelyor, in some instances, at all-with those most affected by the legislation. The critical reason that we insist on our amendment is that it will delay the coming into effect of the legislation until the regulations associated with the bill have been drafted and released for consultation at home and abroad. We are of the view that the legislation, while supportable in principle, demonstrates further the chaotic policy processes that typify this government-in particular, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who is sponsoring the bill. It is no coincidence that this minister, who failed so spectacularly to consult adequately and follow due process during the live cattle export fiasco with Indonesia, is the same minister who has his fingerprints all over this bill. To explain the problems with the government's policy process, I turn to the purpose of the bill. The coalition supports the purpose of the bill, which is to stop the importation to Australia of illegally logged wood from other countries; the problems have to do with how this is to be done and the lack of adequate consultation. According to the government, the bill provides for: - a prohibition on illegally logged and timber and wood products (with an additional prohibition on the processing of illegally processed raw logs) and - a requirement for industry to carry out due diligence to mitigate the risk of importing illegal logged timber into Australia. That is all well and good. However, there are major questions about the compatibility of this legislation with World Trade bill Organization rules. This in turn raises questions about adequate consultation with our foreign neighbours such as Indonesia, with whom Senator Ludwig, the minister for agriculture, has already done his utmost to destroy a relationship that successive governments have dedicated decades of work and effort to establish. I am surprised to find that the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, who is always quick out of the blocks to condemn even the merest sniff of contravention of WTO rules, has not uttered a peep about this legislation. This legislation also went before an inquiry of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The Indonesian government's submission to that inquiry was quite alarming. The Indonesian minister of trade personally wrote to the committee on 25 January this year, prefacing his remarks by stating that the government of Indonesia: … fully supports the bill's overall objective to reduce the harmful environmental, social and economic impacts of illegal logging as well as to impose penalties on those who import illegal logged timber into Australia. However, the minister then stated critically that the Indonesian government 'regrets that our cooperation has not been sought to date on the best means to address the aims set out.' The Indonesian government is right to be concerned by the cavalier attitude of the Labor government to our bilateral relationship with Indonesia. I well recall the Oceanic Viking debacle, which fatally undermined the cooperative relationship that the Howard government had established with the Indonesian government. As the Indonesian foreign ministry's director of diplomatic security, Dr Sujatmiko, said in a press in statement in late 2009: This will be the last time we are helping deal with its foreign refugee influx problem. So the Labor government was put on notice. The Indonesian trade minister in his submission to the trade subcommittee criticises the Australian government for not listing which timber products the bill applies to. This is an obviously important omission, and it indicates why the coalition is seeking a deferral of the starting date of the legislation. Offences are contained in the legislation, yet the basis of the offence-including which timber products the bill applies to; and these offences carry penalties-is all to be left to the regulations. So the evidence that came before the trade subcommittee was deeply concerning; parties could be prosecuted under the legislation, but the details of the offences would not be available until regulations were drafted. It was admitted in evidence to the committee that prosecutions could occur, but people would not know the basis of those prosecutions-of the offences. The Australian Financial Review, reporting on 6 March 2012, referred to the chaotic approach and the impact this was having on our relationships with our neighbours. It said: Australia's relationship with Indonesia is under new strain, with Jakarta frustrated by the federal government's “dysfunction” and neglect of its relationship with its near neighbour. And that: Indonesia's Trade Minister, Gita Wirjawan, has blasted the Gillard government's lack of consultation over an illegal logging bill which he says threatens the future of Indonesia's $5 billion export forestry industry. He is threatening to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organisation if it proceeds. The Indonesian minister maintained that they have a low cost alternative to the heavy regulation proposed in the Labor government's bill. He maintained the Indonesian Australia timber legality and assurance system provides adequate protections. If the Australian government were to consult over this proposed course of action, there would be an opportunity to massively reduce the red tape and regulation. The Indonesians are not alone in their observations. In their submission to the Senate inquiry of 20 December 2011, the Canadian government noted their concerns: The implementation of the bill and subordinate legislation may impose unnecessary burdens on trade in forest products from countries with effective legislation supervision and discourage imports of timber products into Australia. And that: As a result of the imposition of greater burdens on imported timber products the implementation of the bill could favour processing of timber products in Australia to the detriment of Australian consumers. The New Zealand government also made a submission to the Senate inquiry, stating that: The implementation of the bill has the potential to have a significant negative impact on New Zealand's forestry industry, an industry almost entirely based on privately owned plantation forests that are established specifically to be harvested. Further, well-known authority on WTO matters and former ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Alan Oxley made a submission to the Senate inquiry, stating that the bill: Fails to meet Australia's obligation under I.1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 not to create advantage for the like products from some parties to the Agreement and not others and is not covered by other provisions in the Agreement. He went on in his submission of 10 January 2012: It breaches Australia's obligations under Article XI.1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 not to use restrictions of any kind other than duties, taxes or other charges on the importation of any product and cannot be justified under other provisions of the Agreement. He went on to say: It fails to meet Australia's obligations under Article 7(1) of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement which mirrors the terms of GATT 1994 XI.1. Mr Oxley regards the bill as containing: … particularly onerous and costly obligations on Australian producers to demonstrate product in Australia is legally produced. And Mr Oxley notes that this is a critical issue for our trade not only with Indonesia and New Zealand but also with Canada. And, according to his submission, 'timber products are imported from Canada, members of the EU, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vietnam'. So Australia does not simply face potential action under the WTO from Indonesia and Canada but from a whole range of other countries. There are a number of other legal opinions that have discussed the possible international trade implications of this legislation. Associate Professor Andrew Mitchell and Glyn Ayres of the Melbourne University Law School have recorded a number of reservations about the bill in their opinion of 10 January 2012. Another legal opinion has been supplied by well-respected Melbourne barrister Gavin Griffith QC and his colleague Benjamin Jellis, dated 22 December 2011. They state: The scheme and content of the Bill is so deeply flawed in its conceptual approach, based as it is upon the use of Australian courts to enforce the laws of foreign trading partners, that it should be abandoned. Finally, there is another joint legal opinion from Associate Professor Tim Stephens and Professor Ben Saul at the University of Sydney. It has to be said that these two academics are more relaxed with the general provisions of the bill. However, they note the bill has problems in international law: Australia may need to demonstrate that it negotiated in good faith with affected countries to secure its conservation objectives before resorting to unilateral restrictive measures. The Australian timber industry are rightfully concerned about the red tape burden of this legislation. In the 12 March 2012 edition of Timber and Forestry E News, it states that: Thousands of containers of wood products shipped for consumers and landing on wharves around Australia every month are likely to be impounded under regulations in the Illegal Logging Bill. The bottom line is that there are many flaws to the legislation put forward by the government. Our dissenting report to the trade sub-committee said that: The Government has also indicated that the regulations will come into force two years after the Bill receives Royal Assent and also indicated that the regulations will be tabled in the Parliament within six months of Royal Assent to give exporters and importers time to establish due diligence. However, the Government also made it clear that parties could be open to prosecution during this two year stand-off. This lag between the Bill and the regulations is of genuine concern. And the government: …should not introduce the legislation until the enabling subordinate legislation is finalised, released for public comment and a satisfactory consultation period has taken place on both the legislation and the regulations. For that reason the coalition has been reluctant to support the bill in these circumstances. We have done so because of our strong support for the principle- (Time expired)",50
21,Mr BANDT,COMMITTEES," Illegal logging and the international trade in illegally logged timber is a major driver of environmental damage. It costs governments-especially developing governments-billions of dollars in lost revenue, promotes corruption and undermines the rule of law and good governance. Overall, it retards sustainable development in some of the poorest countries of the world. By definition, the scale of illegal logging is difficult to estimate, but it is believed that more than half of all logging activities in the most vulnerable forest regions-South-East Asia, Central Africa, South America and Russia-may be conducted illegally. Worldwide, estimates suggest that illegal activities may account for over a tenth of the total global timber trade, representing products worth at least $15 billion a year. For too long, consumer countries, including Australia, have contributed to these problems by importing timber and wood products without ensuring that they are legally sourced. The breaking of laws on harvesting, processing and transporting timber or wood products is widespread in many timber-producing countries. By logging in protected areas, such as national parks, or having over allowed quotas, processing the logs without acquiring licences and exporting the products without paying export duties, companies may be able to generate much greater profits for themselves than by adhering to national laws and regulations. The extent of illegal logging in some countries is so large, and law enforcement so poor, that the chances of detection and punishment are often very small and the incentives to operate illegally are correspondingly large. The impacts of these illegal activities are multiple. Environmentally, illegal logging depletes forests, destroys wildlife habitats and impairs the ability of land to absorb carbon dioxide emissions, with resultant impacts on climate change. country Physically, the destruction of forest cover can often have knock-on effects. For example, in December 2004 flash floods and landslides in the north-eastern Philippines killed over a thousand people. The government blamed illegal logging, which had denuded the mountain slopes. In a budgetary sense, illegal logging loses governments revenue. A Chatham House briefing paper reports estimates from Indonesia that the government there is losing more than $1 billion a year in unpaid taxes and charges-and that is out of a total budget of about $40 billion in 2003. Developmentally, future generations will suffer even more. World Bank studies in Cambodia in 1997 suggested that illegal extraction, worth between $0.5 billion and $1 billion, was over four million cubic metres a year-at least 10 times the size of the legal harvest, and a level of harvesting that is unsustainable. Socially, illegal logging undermines respect for the rule of law and of government, and is frequently associated with corruption, particularly in the allocation of timber concessions. From a trade related perspective, as illegally logged timber is invariably cheaper than legitimate products, it distorts global markets and undermines incentives for sustainable forest management. A study published by the American Forest and Paper Association in 2004 estimated that world prices were depressed by between seven and 16 per cent-depending on the product-by the prevalence of illegal products in the market. This explains why the Australian forestry industry is largely supportive of this bill. Politically, revenues from illegal logging have been known to fund national and regional conflict, most recently in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Cambodia, for several years Khmer Rouge forces were sustained primarily by the revenue from logging areas under their control. When, under donor pressure, Thailand and the Cambodian government cooperated to close their joint border to log exports at the end of 1996, the insurgents opened peace negotiations. That is a summary of the bad news about illegal logging. But the better news is that, in recent years, producer and consumer countries alike have paid increasing attention to illegal logging. One of the main initiatives includes measures to exclude illegal timber from international markets-notably the EU's Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Action Plan. This initiative centres on the exclusion of illegal products from EU markets. The major problem with this approach, of course, is that there are currently no means of distinguishing legal from illegal products at the border. The EU's solution is, therefore, a new timber licensing system designed to identify the legality of production and relying on credibleprobably independent-verification of legal behaviour at every stage of the chain of custody of the products. This is similar in effect to systems already in place in several international agreements, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and the Kimberley Process on conflict diamonds, which feature licence or permit systems and tracking mechanisms designed to exclude particular categories of products from international markets. This bill is similar in its intent. It is important to first emphasise that that the Greens are strongly of the view that much of the legal native forest logging in Australia is clearly contrary to the national and global interest. Further, while this logging is supposed to be controlled by a suite of laws, regulations and policies, compliance with these laws is uneven across the various states, and assertions about failures to comply are frequent. However, today we are discussing the importation of illegally logged timber, and it is the case that, compared to the domestic situation, the extent of illegal logging in developing nations is far worse and our ability to prevent its import is severely limited. The only regulation that exists at the moment in Australia to control importation of illegally logged timber is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. This convention targets only a limited number of timber products that have been derived from endangered species and, therefore, large amounts of timber continue to be imported into Australia without any requirement for verifying its legality, than through voluntary industry measures. At the 2010 election the government committed to encouraging the sourcing of timber products from sustainable forest practices and to seek to ban the sale of illegally logged timber products through five identified measures. This bill represents the also regulatory elements of the government's illegal logging policy, focusing on measures 3 and 4 of the policy. The government says that these regulatory controls will be complemented by investment in capacitybuilding and bilateral and multilateral engagement. That is appropriate and follows the European approach and, of course, the Greens will be scrutinising this investment. In order to determine the most effective policy approach to implementing the regulatory aspects of this election commitment, a regulation impact statement was undertaken by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The regulation impact statement outlined three options that may achieve the objective of changing the behaviour of timber producers by directly limiting opportunities for the production and trading of illegal timber. These options were: quasi-regulation with codes of conduct enforced by industry; coregulation, using a prohibition element and requirement for due diligence; and explicit regulation requiring a minimum standard for verification of legality. The bill reflects the due diligence coregulation approach identified in option 2 of the regulation impact statement. The key regulatory elements of the bill are a prohibition on illegally logged timber and wood products, with an additional prohibition on the processing of illegally processed raw logs and a requirement for industry to carry out due diligence to mitigate the risk of importing illegally other logged timber into Australia. We acknowledge that this represents a significant step by Australia to prevent the trade of illegal timber products both nationally and internationally and although it has been a long time coming we welcome the effort, although I do flag some concerns. Further we acknowledge that stakeholder consultation during the course of developing this bill has been broad. As described in our additional comments in the recent Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report, the Greens are generally supportive of this bill but believe that, in a number of areas, the balance between providing clarity in the legislation and allowing for flexibility in drafting regulations has not been well struck. Greater clarity will be important in the following areas. Firstly, it will be important in the definition of 'illegal logging'. Numerous stakeholders, including the timber industry, timber retailers, and environmental and social organisations agree that the definition of illegal logging should be expanded. The Greens are not persuaded by the government's reasoning that an unintended consequence of a prescriptive definition of 'illegally logged' may be that a some elements of the applicable legislation are overlooked or excluded through omission, and we retain the view that the Australian definition should be consistent with the EU definition. Secondly, as far as due diligence is concerned, the Greens can find no reason why the due diligence provisions relating to the declaration form should remain unclear. The bill should specify that the declaration form must include detailed information critical to satisfying due diligence. There would be a range of information from name of importer and name of supplier through to vessel name, voyage number and, of course, quantity of timber. We emphasise, in particular, that the due diligence requirements must provide for traceability to coupe level and an assessment of the risk of illegality due to corruption. There is evidence around the world of companies paying bribes to officials to secure the 'legal' allocation of logging rights. Corruption criteria must allow for scrutiny of the logging permit application process. Thirdly, as to assessing and reporting compliance, the Greens agree with Greenpeace that, in order to determine the levels of compliance and assist in assessing the standards used in due diligence documentation on an ongoing basis, the bill would benefit from a requirement for regular, preferably quarterly, compliance audits and aggregate data reports. As noted by the committee report, having annual compliance audits was a measure proposed by DAFF following the legislation committee's report, and the minister's office did not appear opposed to its inclusion. I flag that my Senate colleagues may move amendments in the other place reflecting these concerns but, subject to those comments, I commend the bill to the House.",57
22,Mr BRIGGS,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 before the House and the amendment circulated by the coalition in this respect. I begin by saying that I have a great concern about this bill passing the House and the Senate. I support the move by the coalition with its amendment but, in any event, I do not support the thrust of this bill and the direction it is taking.",60
23,Mr Jenkins,COMMITTEES,But you'll do the right thing.,60
24,Mr BRIGGS,COMMITTEES,"I will take this opportunity to congratulate the former Speaker, the member for Scullin, on his announcement and on a fine career. I do not support the direction of this bill. I think it is another example of the Green crusade, through trade policy, that we are increasingly seeing. We are seeing it through this bill. We saw it do most damage, of course, 12 months ago when the government shut down the live cattle export industry overnight because of a Green push, through a TV show. It damaged much of the important relationship between Australia and Indonesia, an extremely important trading partner. So much damage was done through that action, by government policy, because of the pursuit by the Greens of this industry. That is simply what it is-they are pursuing this industry, and now they are pursuing this industry through trade policy. It has all the worse elements of a step back to before the 1980s. There are many on the Labor side who believe, as I do, in the Hawke-Keating action to unburden Australia of its trade protections. This is a new step-a new use, and an increasing use, of trade protections, through Green activism, to damage our trading relationships with extremely important trading partners. I thought the speech of the deputy leader, the shadow minister for foreign affairs and trade, was a terrific enunciation of the problems with this bill, in that it creates problems with extremely important trading partners such as Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand-you name it. This puts at risk our reputation, and puts us at risk of challenge under the WTO and its provisions. We hear much from the trade minister about the coalition's supposed questions in some of these issues, and we have heard in the last few weeks from the trade minister on foreign investment; he has been out there writing op eds and what have you about the coalition's position. Yet the trade minister is strangely silent when it comes to inserting quite outrageous provisions in bills such as this which puts on, in effect, a trade protection against very important trading partners. And I think it shows up the trade minister for a singing and dancing sideshow of a trade minister, when he should be fighting-as, in fairness, the minister for regional development has been-against this play by the Greens to insert their activism through trade policy. This has undoubtedly done further damage to an already damaged relationship with Indonesia. We have seen this week this House dealing with a bill to try to undo the damage of the Labor government's changes to border protection laws four years ago. Obviously, and importantly, the Indonesian relationship is vital in ensuring that our border protection is looked after and is competently managed. It can only be competently managed if the Indonesians are cooperating. Now, of course, if we continue to use legislative instruments, and we continue to take action such as shutting down the supply of food overnight, we will bear the consequences of those actions, quite obviously. Another sovereign state is entitled to react if Australian domestic law tries to manage or govern the actions of another government, and that is exactly what this bill is seeking to do with developing countries. If the truth be told, the biggest illegal logging is that it is occurring in developing nations; it is a challenge for developing nations. Rather than act like some sort of-dare I say it-Green deputy sheriff in the region, maybe we should be trying to work with these nations to ensure that they can continue to develop so that they have stronger internal, domestic structures, so they can themselves take action where appropriate, rather than trying to use Australian domestic law, through trade policies, to insert these Green purist pursuits, when the truth is that the real intention of the Greens is to shut these industries down. We have seen it in Tasmania. I heard the honourable member from Tasmania speak on this bill just before and he made the point that the green activism and the forestry debate in Tasmania has done so much damage to his state. Of course it has, and now we are seeing it through our trade policy. It is shameful that the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness in this Labor government, who claims to be an inheritor of the Hawke and Keating legacy, would stand by while this action is being taken. The minister for trade realistically should explain to this House why and how he thinks it is in Australia's trading interests to be pursuing these Greens policies through this bill and others. It is another example of the most insidious part of this Green-Labor coalition. On the second anniversary of the 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' announcement, we have another example where the Labor government has completely lost its way in ensuring that good, open and free trading arrangements are put in place to the benefit of our country, not policies which damage our relationships with such important allies and trading partners in our region, such important countries to issue with Australia's future. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know very well that the Indonesians in particular will provide such a great opportunity for our country in the coming years. Why would we consistently and continually poke them in the eye when it comes to our trading arrangements with them by using Australian domestic actions and law to try to force change in their own sovereign country? It is a terrible, terrible piece of legislation and I cannot support it in the form in which it is drafted and as it appears before the House. I am not alone in that. There are other members on this side who hold grave concerns in relation to this bill. The Indonesians themselves have made it very clear that they think this is a disastrous bill. As the deputy leader said earlier, on 6 March this year there was a story in the Financial Review which said: Indonesia's Trade Minister … blasted the Gillard governnment's lack of consultation over an illegal logging bill which he says threatens the future of Indonesia's $5 billion export forestry industry. is threatening to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organisation if it proceeds. Similarly, submissions from Canada, New Zealand, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea to the Senate inquiry have also expressed concerns with the bill. There have been a range of legal experts in Australia and international trade experts who have said similar things and expressed similar concerns. Yet the trade minister stays unusually silent over there when it comes to these concerns. It is a real shame that the trade minister will not come in and express his concern along with us and have this bill changed or amended enormously before it goes ahead. We make the point through our amendment that these concerns that have been raised by important trading partners, by neighbours and by developing countries in our region have not been the subject of the full consultation that is required at the very least before this bill proceeds. At the very least, the amendment that we put forward seeks to address that to some degree, giving the government additional time. But, as I say, I am still extremely reluctant and I am against the thrust of this bill because I think it ultimately does little if anything to reduce illegal logging in developing countries in our region. But, at the same time, because it is purely a protection measure in its nature, it will inevitably increase the cost of timber for consumers in Australia. We know that that is an open policy position of the Greens, in fairness, to protect the Australian industry, and we heard the member for Melbourne outlining that just then. But we see the Labor Party completely split when it comes to these issues and whether to continue down the path that Hawke and Keating pursued in the 1980s and 1990s or whether to go back to the good old He ways that the Secretary of the AWU, Mr Paul Howes, and the new Secretary of the ACTU, Mr David Oliver, would like the Labor Party to pursue. That is the old fashioned protectionist economy, the settlement economy that existed in Australia prior to the 1980s. This is another reason that this bill should offend those of good economic conscience on the other side who believe that Australia's future best lies with an open and trading economy, because this bill completely offends those principles. Thus I cannot in good conscience support it. It also has to be remembered that this is another example of Australia using its diplomatic power in the wrong way. I would have thought we want more than anything to develop better relations in the Pacific region. I know the government has put effort into that through the member for Corio, the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs. That is an important step, an important issue for us to pursue. It is very important that Papua New Guinea, Fiji and other countries in our region continue to develop as we wish them to and that their populations continue to enjoy a better standard of living, more opportunities and all the great things that Australians get. We can and do play a very important role in that, but what we should not do with our role is misuse that power with bills such as this. We should not use domestic law to in effect threaten other countries-developing countries-or tell them what to do with their sovereign nations, how they should run their sovereign nations and how they should enforce good law in their own sovereign nations. There is indeed a better way to pursue this issue. There are questions raised about the amount of illegal logging going on and how big a problem this is. The member for Melbourne asserts that it is an enormous problem, that it is causing great carnage. There are others who say that is not the case. In any event, this is clearly a development issue. It is not an issue of criminality; it is an issue of development in those regions. The more and the quicker we can encourage and assist by good economic development measures and good governance measures our developing neighbours to ensure they have very strong operational domestic laws and strong domestic economies, the better and quicker we will be able to address-or they will be able to address, more importantlysome of these concerns. We can assist through that, and indeed we do. We do good work, and I think the member for Corio has done some good work in his efforts to ensure that in our region we are working for a way to have faster and better development in those countries. But this is not the way to do it. This is wrong-headed, bad policy. This legislation will cause damage to our reputation with the World Trade Organisation. It runs counter to the pursuit of an open and trading economy that the Australian government has held to, in a bipartisan manner, for the last 30 years, as you well know, Deputy Speaker Leigh. There are of course always people who are concerned about open and trading economies and the pursuit of free trade mechanisms and agreements and so forth. But, ultimately, we know from the evidence and from the benefits of the rise in living standards Australians have enjoyed since those policies have been pursued in a bipartisan manner that they have led to far better outcomes in our country and in developing and developed countries around the world. This bill runs counter to that, and that is why it is such a bad bill. It will not stop the practice of illegal logging. It will increase the cost of timber in Australia and it will damage our international relationships with very important trading partners at the wrong time, when they are already under pressure. It is a bad bill and it should not be supported.",60
25,Ms MARINO,COMMITTEES," The Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill is intended to do a number of things: prohibit the importation and sale of all timber products containing illegally logged timber; prohibit the processing of illegally harvested domestically grown raw logs; require importers of regulated timber products and processors of raw logs to comply with due diligence requirements; require the accurate description of legally logged timber products for sale in Australia; establish enforcement powers and offences; impose penalties; and provide for a review after five years. However, none of the regulations are available to us at this time to consider. What the government has not done, however, is give our trading partners, our domestic timber industry and timber importers the time they were promised to design and implement appropriate systems to go with this particular bill. There are many flaws with this bill, as we have heard throughout this debate. A number of them were outlined by the member for Curtin. That is why our support for this bill is contingent on the government accepting our amendment, which sets the commencement date of the legislation and regulations at July 2015. This has to be a managed process, one that gives our partners, our domestic timber industry and our timber importers the time they were promised to design and implement the appropriate systems. It is no wonder that Australia's six major timber trading partners are so concerned, and we have heard the reasons for those concerns outlined today. There are not only those concerns but also those of our domestic timber industry and our domestic timber importers. There are no regulations attached to the bill. We know from experience in this place that you cannot trust this government to get it right. We know that the devil is always in the detail. We have not even seen the regulations. We have seen disastrous pieces of legislation, disastrous processes and disastrous programs one after the other through the life of this government. The list is endless. I have heard today references, particularly in relation to this bill, to the cattle fiasco. And we know that the same minister is involved. We can have very little confidence that the regulations will do what they are intended to do or will in fact be able to address any of the issues contained in this bill. We know that the government has failed to consult and, as a farmer and beef farmer, I know first-hand the damage that was done to Indonesia through the overnight decision on live cattle exports. We know how Indonesia views that. I also know of the increase in the price of protein in Indonesia, for people who can ill afford it, as a result of that decision. The member for Curtin outlined very succinctly the WTO implications and the diplomatic and international law issues in relation to this bill. The parliament and our trading partners really do need to consider the regulations, their impact and their implications before they take effect. It will take time to implement traceability and compliance, the basic things that will have to be done to meet the requirements-which we do not even know about. Equally, Australian importers themselves will have to design and put in place traceability and due diligence processes as a result of this, particularly as current timber certification programs do not yet provide due diligence elements to their traceability certifications. This will be a completely new process. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade minority report confirms two major issues previously raised through the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. These relate to concerns with regard to the detail-the devil in the detail-and that is why we have taken the position we have. There has been inadequate consultation. There are concerns regarding the ability of the government to develop the regulations in a timely manner. Will they be ready on times? We heard the member for Curtin say that they would not live be-you can be prosecuted, but, no, we are not really sure what the terms and conditions of that are. The inadequate consultation was raised in the minority report. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry estimates that they can produce the regulations within six months, but evidence submitted to the inquiry indicates that little progress had been made on the contents, and fundamental issues remain unresolved. We on this side of the House are committed to addressing the trade of illegally sourced timber and timber products. It was in fact part of our 2010 forestry policy. But we do not underestimate the issues in managing and adapting to any changes facing industry and stakeholders, which is why our policy provided for a two-year transition period. We also understood that all impacted stakeholders, many of whom we have heard from today, need to be consulted closely on the drafting of the legislation, the regulations-the things we are discussing today-and other related measures, which is exactly what this government has not done, yet again. It is just a pattern of behaviour: always finding the wrong answer to whatever the question is before us. That is the reason for our amendment. Recommendations 1 and 2 of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report acknowledged the flawed and inadequate consultation process associated with the development of this bill. And they made a recommendation that the government should continue to consult closely with the governments of Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and other relevant stakeholders on the implementation of the bill and the development of the subordinate legislation. That is very important: what are the requirements; how will they work; what are the obligations; what are the penalties. The joint standing committee also recommended that the government facilitate Malaysia and Papua New Guinea's representation on the Illegal Logging Working Group, convened by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. As I said, we are committed to addressing the trade in illegally sourced timber and timber products. But I just want to refer to the WA situation. In Western Australia we have largely led the way in dealing with deforestation issues. In fact, it was led by Charles Court, who imposed some clearing restrictions in the sixties and seventies. Large-scale clearing is generally a thing of the past. But what we did see, which is another example of where the actions of a Labor government cannot be trusted, was that in 2001 the WA timber industry, and timber communities-it comes right down to the ground level, as it will in the nations we are dealing with on this issue-were thrown to the wolves by the Gallop Labor government. Change came dramatically, a bit like the live cattle export situation, and it was full of deception. That concerns me with this bill as well. The state Labor government told the wider community they would end oldgrowth logging but told the timber industry that this would have a minimal impact on their lives and the communities. What a deception. Timber companies were told that, despite most of the larger logs being excluded from harvest, the quality of sawn logs they would receive would not changeand, sadly, at the time many actually believed the Labor government in WA. The truth has now been brought home: there was a major impact in some of these communities, with job losses and impacts on the whole community, especially in the Manjimup region-and that was part of my electorate when I was first elected. That is what happened in Western Australia. So if this bill is progressed, and these issues are not well managed, what will it do in developing nations? What will it do to people on extremely limited incomes? We do know that, under the current legislative regime, the Australian industry is very well managed. But for my electorate, again, I will place on the record that many in the south-west retain about 80 per cent of native forests. But members should note well that the areas that have an active timber industry over many years tend to retain Sir significant areas of native forest, whereas in regions where the native forest is not valued, and is harvested for timber, little forest was left intact. It is this value placed on timber and forests that in many areas has resulted in its salvation. It is a source of constant irritation, and I would say anger, to the timber industry that, despite being vilified by the Greens, and in recent times the Labor Party, they are in part actually responsible for the continued existence of so many of our remaining forests. We do know there has been a recent decline in deforestation in Australia. Compared to other nations around the world, our forests are relatively well managed. As a result of this bill I have to raise the issue of developing nations and how they will be able to sustain not only their populations but also some of their forests into the future. For the billions of people living in or near poverty, the use of timber is often as a fuel source and a building material-it is not because of want but because of need. This is something we need to consider in this whole process. Poverty may be the reason the person is harvesting remaining forests. It may be to warm and shelter their family. They may have to harvest their last remaining forests to provide income for food or other necessities. It is going to be a pretty basic decision for some, and it is on a daily basis. So, until the standards of the populations and the standard of governance rise significantly, it is clear that those forests in developing nations will remain under threat. The threats are significant, but I ask the House to remember that this bill only applies to illegal logging, and does not address the threat of unsustainable legal deforestation. Our concerns with this bill are very valid. When I listen to the matter articulated by the member for Curtin, the shadow minister for foreign affairs and trade, this really does absolutely need to have scrutiny. The regulations do need to be provided. We do need to see the devil that could well be in the detail, and that is why I fully support the coalition amendments.",63
26,Mr TEHAN,COMMITTEES," As I have written publicly in two opinion pieces, one in the Herald Sun titled 'Greens can't see the wood from the trees' and the other in the Australian, 'Policy tainted by Greens agenda', I believe this is bad legislation, supported by bad policy, and should be opposed. There are five main reasons I think this bill should be opposed, but there are many more I could go into detail on. The first is that it sets a dangerous precedent. The second is that it will increase costs for Australian business and achieve nothing. The third is that it is already damaging our trade relations, in particular our trade relations with our near neighbours. Fourth, it is the Gillard government's way of further embedding Bob Brown's legacy in Canberra. We have seen the damage that has done to Tasmania. Well, this is Bob Brown coming to Canberra and coming to our trade policy. And the last reason is that there is a better way to deal with this issue. There is an alternative which would not cause the damage to our trading relationships that this bill will, which would not cause our living businesses to have extra costs and which would not embed Bob Brown's legacy here in Canberra. And that is the approach we should take. As we would with any crime, all of us in this place would like to see illegal logging stopped. But this is the wrong way to go about it. This legislation embeds the principle that the Australian government will restrict imports if other countries do not apply our environmental standards. It is unilateral in nature. I warn all members of this House that once we head down this path other countries will be emboldened to use such laws against Australia. And who stands to lose the most if that occurs? It is our agricultural exporters. I call on the member for Lyne and the member for New England and say to them that this is an issue that you should look extremely closely at and on which you should stand up for your electorates. In the longer term this bill, while it may make us feel a little bit better, will harm especially our rural industries. I hope they are looking at this closely-looking at all the arguments for and against, looking at all the evidence that has been presented to the committees that have looked into this bill-and are thinking about whether they should support it or not. If they did that, I would find it very hard indeed to see how they could support this piece of legislation. I would point them in particular to the last hearing held into this bill, which was of the trade subcommittee. Three compelling arguments were presented to that subcommittee as to why this bill should be opposed. As soon as it enters into law, the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill will cause uncertainty in Australia's timber trade, because importers will not know what the precise impact of the legislation will be until the regulations are enacted. It will basically chill timber trade between Australia and its regional partners, and that will cause those countries to look at their trading relationship with Australia. We heard evidence that the Gillard government's consultation process throughout its development implementation of this bill has been flawed. One of the key criteria for implementing this legislation was to do the consultation properly. If the consultation had been done properly, we would not be here today; this legislation would not be before the House. But the government itself admitted that it has been making up its consultative approach as it goes along. It said: As the more detailed process of developing the regulations is now underway, more in-depth consultation with stakeholders is being and will be undertaken to assist their development and to ensure they operate as intended. So the evidence to the trade subcommittee from the government itself is that its consultation has been nothing short of a debacle and that it is still trying to work out how it is going to go about it, who it is going to include and what the basis for doing that consultation will be. The second thing that became very clear from the trade subcommittee was that the content of the bill and the way it has been handled has already caused harm to our trading relationships and, if passed, the bill will lead to more harm occurring. The Indonesian government, already irritated by the way Australia placed a temporary ban on live cattle exports, made clear in its submission: The implementation of the Bill is also likely to undermine the development of trade between Indonesia and Australia based on our respective mutual interests. In this respect, reference is made to the recent efforts of the government of Indonesia to accommodate and resolve the problem faced by Australia during the self-imposed ban on beef exports to Indonesia. As someone who was previously a diplomat, I know that you need to read this language and see what the Indonesians are saying. They are saying to us: 'Australia, we are your and largest beef export market. We are your largest wheat export market. And what you are doing by introducing this piece of legislation is jeopardising that.' That is what the Indonesians are saying, and we should respect them for saying it-for having the courage to tell us what this bill is all aboutand we should heed that warning. We have already done irreparable damage to our trading relationship with Indonesia with the live cattle fiasco and we are trying to repair that damage. Yet, here we are, only months down the track from that decision, and we are going to do something which is going to irritate-this is putting it mildly-the Indonesians again. Have we not listened and learned from what the live cattle debacle did to the domestic industry in Australia? Do we want to do worse again to our beef and wheat exporters and our other agricultural industries? We need to learn, and we are not learning by this piece of legislation. The third issue about this piece of legislation-once gain, there was evidence presented on this-is that it is unsound in international law. Given that there were divided legal opinions on the bill surviving legal challenge in the WTO, why would we be looking to go down this path? As a country with credentials as an upholder of the rules and regulations of the World Trade Organisation, why would we jeopardise that reputation by heading down this path when there is divided legal opinion on this? In its submission to the trade subcommittee the government of Canada noted this and made it very clear to Australia that we should think again about heading down this path. The government of Canada said: While Canada has concerns related to some of the potential trade implications of the Bill, Canada pleased that the Government of Australia is committed to ensuring that the Bill and associated regulations are consistent with international trade obligations, that they treat importers and domestic processors of timber equally, and that they are trade distortive. So, once again in diplomatic language, the Canadian government is telling us: 'You have serious WTO commitments which you need to honour. And you need to look at this closely with regards to those commitments.' 'And if there is divided legal opinion on whether you are doing the right thing,' the Canadian government is very politely telling us, 'you should think again.' This is something which Papua New Guinea made clear in that same subcommittee hearing. The Papua New Guinea Forest Industries Association pointed out that the government of Indonesia has already foreshadowed the possibility that the bill will not meet WTO requirements and will remain challengeable under the WTO. Expert legal opinion by Professor Andrew Mitchell of Melbourne University indicated that the agreement would pose problems with WTO compliance as well as compliance with the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement. The evidence is there as to why we should pull back from this bill. When it comes to our domestic industry we have to remember that this bill makes it a criminal offence to import illegal timber. I draw the House's attention to the recent hearings in the US Congress on the Lacey Act, which, in 2008, included illegal logging under its remit, and to what that Lacey Act has done to small businesses in the US who have unwittingly imported illegal products into that country. In particular there was testimony from a small US businessman who ended up in jail as a result of, through no fault of his own, is importing illegal product into the US. The testimony is compelling. His business was destroyed. His marriage was destroyed. He is now on a campaign to point out the absolute not dangers of unilateral pieces of legislation like the Lacey Act-and like this Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill-and the impacts that they can unwittingly have, especially on small business people in countries like the US and Australia. I would hope that the trade minister would see the damage that this piece of legislation is going to do to our trading relations, especially in Asia. I would hope that he would see the principle that has been embedded in our trade policy because of this bill. I would appeal to him to remember his time with the Hawke and Keating governments and his boasting of what that period of Labor government did to improving our trade principles and our trade record, and say to him, 'Pull this legislation before it's too late.' I also appeal to the member for Lyne and the member for New England to look very closely at this bill and think about their electorates and oppose it. It is bad policy. It is bad legislation. There is a much better way. We can liaise and cooperate with the countries where illegal logging is taking place. We can provide them with assistance. We can put the certification processes in place to help them. We can encourage them. And we can do that in a way which will fix illegal logging and will remain true to our trade principles.",66
27,Mr RAMSEY,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill. Saying we are against illegal logging is really making a motherhood statement. Virtually all of us are against illegal logging. We are opposed to poverty, we are in favour of world peace and we are against illegal logging. There are no arguments with attempts to halt illegal logging. There are lots of good reasons to do so: loss of biodiversity, loss of income to the country of origin and the fact that illegal logging is of itself a theft it entrenches corruption and it causes land management issues with degradation of soils unless, of course, they are replanted and managed correctly. If they are not, it becomes a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. So we are agreed that most if not all Australians are against illegal logging, so the question is not about our intent but what we do about the problem. Well, one thing we should not do is play the role of colonial master by issuing edicts from Canberra or from Australia on the way other countries should run their affairs. We should strive at every opportunity to make sure we work in partnership with our near neighbours. It has been decreed by the government that this is the Asian century. In fact, the government have appointed Ken Henry to author a white paper on Australia's future in Asia in this century. We need a mature relationship with Asia. That is why any changes we make to our relationship with Asia must be made with understanding and preferably with the support of the nations affected. None of the nations targeted with this bill seeking to outlaw the importation of illegally logged timber support illegal logging, so it should be easy for us to reach a common position with them. We cannot do that without consultation of course. So what do we have? We have Canada, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia and PNG, along with others, all expressing reservations before a Senate inquiry about the bill. Indonesia and Canada are strongly concerned and are not happy with the negotiations thus far. I quote from the Financial Review of 6 March 2012: Indonesia's Trade Minister, Gita Wirjawan, has blasted the Gillard governnment's lack of consultation over an illegal logging bill which he says threatens the future of Indonesia's $5 billion export forestry industry. He is threatening to lodge a complaint with the World Trade and that Organisation if it proceeds. It is worthwhile remembering that Indonesia is our second closest neighbour, it is the biggest Muslim nation in the world, it has a population approaching 240 million and, most importantly from my point of view, it is a functioning democracy. Indonesia should be one of our highest foreign policy priorities. Good relations with Indonesia are not just desirable; they are in fact essential. I have mentioned the dangers of acting like colonial masters. When you look at our recent past it is not hard to see some stages when we have done that. Most notably, wethat is, Australia-made the live cattle decisions, we have issued intentions to pass legislation affecting palm oil production, we have been crashing around like a drunken elephant in the area when it comes to peoplesmuggling and we have been making declarations which affect other countries without actually firstly consulting with those countries and taking them with us on the journey. If we look at the live cattle exports decision we see it has been a shameful exercise, given the way we have treated this most important neighbour of Australia. We have managed to offend them at every turn and we-I mean Australia, and in that case it was driven if not by government policies then by the ministers at least-have effectively halved the live cattle industry exports from Australia to Indonesia. It was all because of a television program and, against departmental advice, a unilateral decision to stop the trade immediately. It disrupted meat supplies and offended national pride, it was a religious insult and, as I have said, it smacked of colonialism. All the years of careful nurturing of one of our most important relationships and it was all trashed overnight! The tremendous goodwill that we as Australians bought with our biggest ever single foreign aid project directed to rebuilding after the tsunami disaster was washed away in an instant. So let us not be led by the same minister down the same path again-consultation and cooperation are paramount. We should be able to achieve something good in this space, but we must do it with cooperation. We run the risk of doing exactly the same here again, as it is not the only area where this government has got ambition confused with capability. We have seen it with the NBN, the South-East Asian Economic Community, the East Timor solution, the green loans and pink batts fiascos, cash for clunkers and, right now, we have just seen the latest policy reversal, on the use of as a processing centre. The modus operandi of this government is to make the big announcement and then try and work out what it means afterwards. There is a very grave danger that once again we are heading down that path. It is worthwhile noting that a number of key producer countries, including Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, are developing legality verification, chain of custody and forest certification schemes as we speak. It is far better to be inside their tent helping them than to be throwing rocks from outside it. We need to be friends and to cooperate. But what these countries have asked for is time and consultation, to give them a chance to have a serious input and time to develop systems to comply. You would be aware, Deputy Speaker Thomson, that the coalition took to the last election a policy of outlawing the importation of illegal timbers. We will continue to support that policy. That policy also asked for a two-year consultation period while the regulations were developed. Once again, we are being asked to push through parliament this bill before the regulations are complete and before those countries know how they are likely to be affected. There is also the chance that our local industries will be quite significantly affected, and this revolves around certification. The affected countries are developing certification processes, but the proposed legislation places the onus of proof on the retailers here in Australia to be able to provide evidence. It makes it an offence to import illegally logged timber. It should make it an offence to knowingly import illegally logged timber-and therein lies a very real danger for our businesses. Some of these countries are developing economies and we would be fools to think there is not some level of corruption in those economies. That means that, as these Nauru protocols are developed, if somebody were to illegally obtain a certification process that they offered to an Australian business, the Australian business could well be in contravention of our laws and not have any idea that they were in possession of illegally logged timber. You can imagine the case of a small piece of finely crafted timber with different inlays; it may be a product that is 95 per cent legal product and five per cent illegally logged product. Then, of course, the business becomes totally liable. All we will need are a couple of highly public infringements to shut down the entire trade. This would have an effect on our businesses but it would also undermine the exports of countries from where we are sourcing our timber legally. That scenario could mean that the price of timber would reduce because markets would be reduced for these countries. If the price of timber reduces you can be sure that, as night follows day, it will lead to increased illegal logging because, as income falls, people tend to increase production. So that would be totally counterproductive, and I know that is not what the Australian government would like to see happen. We in the coalition are urging the government to show a bit of caution, to show a bit of consideration and to think through what can go wrong for once rather than just thinking through what can go right. Trust me, things that can go wrong are always out there and we should prepare ourselves for that possibility. So we in the coalition urge caution. We are pushing the government to delay implementation of this bill and to go back to the consideration and consultation process with the countries involved so that we can come up with a common purpose approach that they too can support and that they will know will be of benefit to their countries rather than a hindrance.",69
28,Mr HAWKE,COMMITTEES," It is a privilege to follow the members for Mayo, Wannon and Grey in putting some of the coalition's concerns in relation to the Illegal Prohibition on Logging Bill 2011. The name of the bill suggests it would be something we could all agree on in this place. But it is typical of the pattern of this government in developing legislation. Whatever sector the government are seeking to regulate or legislate, they rush in a piece of legislation with little to no consultation, are stunned by a set of factual and well-developed points on why the legislation will not work and are then caught in this scramble to somehow amend or deal with the problem they have created by not being thorough in the first place in developing their legislative response. There is no doubt that, in relation to the illegal logging prohibition bill before us, that that is exactly the approach the government has adopted yet again. But, this time, there are more serious consequences that are not just of a domestic nature; there are also trade and international diplomatic relations consequences-another set of serious consequences from a poor government with a poor legislative program and an inability to get the settings right before they bring a bill into this chamber. Most seriously, Australia being a trading nation and relying so heavily on trade both in the past and in the foreseeable future, it is of grave concern to have some of our closest trading partners and nearest neighbours, including Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, expressing concern about this bill in such vocal and strident ways in evidence to the committee that considered these matters. The coalition has, of course, sought to address some of the deficiencies here by moving amendments to delay and to allow sufficient time for parliamentary scrutiny of any regulations. But it is impossible to understand what the government is actually intending without having regulations to examine. We simply do not know. Of course we want to prevent illegal logging-that is the concern of lawmakers and legislators. As federal members of parliament, we as legislators are of course concerned with illegality but, to be concerned with illegality, we have to define what is legal behaviour and what is illegal behaviour. We cannot possibly know what the government intends, as our trading partners cannot possibly know what the government intends, will be legal or illegal behaviour. So why are we moving to pass such a bill today? Why are we not having a thorough consultation and scrutiny process about the regulations so that everybody can understand what is legal and illegal and how they ought to operate and how they can make their business and investment decisions to enable sustained economic activity in this space. I think there is an answer to that question, but, inevitably with this government, it comes back to a political question. The member for Melbourne belled the cat, because the real agenda of this bill is, of course, the Australian Greens and the fact that this government is absolutely and utterly beholden for its political power to the Australian Greens. The member for Melbourne is one member in this place. The entire government is beholden to the one, the member for Melbourne, who in his speech sought to say that he would like to see the definition of illegal logging expanded in the legislation. So the real drivers of the government, the member for Melbourne here and the Australian Greens in the Senate, have belled the cat. Their agenda is to expand the definition of illegality; therefore, the government will have to listen to them in order to stay in power. That may be one reason why we are not seeing the regulations before us today. That is a serious question that I think the minister and the government must address before this bill is accepted by either the House or the Senate. The government is in this constant arm wrestle with the Australian Greens. It is well known; it is in the public domain. We also heard the member for Melbourne call for the expansion of the due diligence requirements, so we can see that there is a real program and intention in the development of this legislation from the coalition allies and drivers of the government, the Australian Greens, to expand the terms of what is illegal logging and to make it more difficult for people to log. We know that the Australian Greens have an agenda to stop logging completely, whether it be plantation logging or any kind of forestry industry. We know that is their real agenda and we know that they want to make it more difficult. So the government has brought us in this chamber to a point where nobody can tell us what the real agenda of this bill is. I think this is an entirely unsatisfactory situation, particularly when we have important trading partners like the Indonesians expressing their very clear concern, and I think it is worthwhile to repeat for people in the House who have not heard it yet, what this bill will do. The Indonesians-in reporting in submissions to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-said quite clearly that they were very concerned about this bill. The deferral of the legislation until 2015 to provide time to ensure the legislation will not have unintended consequences will unnecessarily harm the mutual trade between our two nations. The member for Wannon was exactly right: that is diplomatic speak for, 'Please do not do this because you are going to create a major trading problem between our nations.' We have heard from members of this House about the debacle that was created with the live export knee-jerk reaction of a minister and a government seeking to deal with television programs and play with our diplomatic relations as a consequence. That had serious consequences for the people in the live cattle industry. It had serious consequences for the diplomatic efforts between our two nations. It had serious ongoing consequences for our relationship with Indonesia and managing so many vital issues in the world today. This bill will have consequences. The passage of any legislation in this regard will have consequences as well. So I think it is right for members of this placeespecially those concerned with our trade relationships and trade policy and goodquality legislative outcomes of the chamber-to get up and express concern. Not only do I support that this must be deferred until the regulations are in place-a reasonable and practical response that our partners are seeking; I also express my grave concern about using trade policy in this manner to pursue the real objectives of the Australian Greens and the green movement in Australia and worldwide today. We know there are many international green groups and green groups within Australia who are seeking to use our trade policy as leverage in their ongoing environmental and social pursuit of their causes. That is what we are all being dragooned into here today. It would be interesting to see if the government would bring in such a bill if they were not in coalition with the Australian Greens, if they did not have pressure from the member for Melbourne who wants to expand definitions and see greater definition of illegality in relation to logging all the world. Remember that this is intricately connected with our diplomatic efforts in foreign aid. Papua New Guinea and Indonesia receive Australian taxpayers' dollars in the form of foreign aid. I support that in most cases. We also have to consider that they are developing nations with vastly different legal and other frameworks. It is inappropriate for the Australian parliament to dictate what Papua New Guinea or Indonesia should be doing when trying to develop and sustain their economies. We do not want them to be the recipient of our aid dollars forever into the future. We want to help them develop strong self-sustaining economies that allow them to produce the best wealth for their citizens. It is in our interests to have strong trading partners and regional neighbours that can sustain themselves and a strong economy. The bill says we are prohibiting illegal logging. That is a fantastic objective that everybody supports, but there are no regulations and there is no design that our trading partners understand about how the bill will work on the ground. That has serious consequences for our relationships. That is why I am here to raise these concerns about this bill, along with so many of my colleagues. This is not an area that should be toyed with by the government. If they want to pursue a green agenda or placate the Australian Greens, surely the Clean Energy Finance Corporation $10 billion was enough. Why do we have to further damage our trade relationships with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and other very important trading partners in our region simply for that objective? There are ways of dealing with the problem of illegal logging but they are not defined in this bill before us today. There are things that we ought to do to restrict illegal logging and to ensure that Australian businesses are not having to compete with around illegal timber products flooding into Australia. There is a lot of speculation about the quantity and the nature of this problem. We cannot-and I do not think we ever will-achieve legislation in this place which mandates what happens in countries like Indonesia in a way that is meaningful. Through partnership we can do what is already happening, and that is see the development of certification programs and improvements in the circumstances of locking in many of these countries. Australia is already pursuing those objectives, but this bill is obviously ill timed. It is completely and utterly without form or without any real ability for our trading partners or any member of this place to articulate what will happen in the regulation. We do not know. The department says it might take six months but we understand how slow the process of developing any regulation has been. We estimate it will take 18 to 24 months at a minimum if consultation is done properly and-to be frank-when we are dealing with trade matters, consultation ought to be done properly. It ought not to be a luxury or something that we discard so easily in so many pieces of legislation. Consultation matters with trading partners. Consultation with the industry matters. To see yet another piece of legislation which really will achieve no effective end, no real definition and no form places Australian importers and Australian businesses at risk of illegal behaviour without any real benefit to Australia and without doing anything about the problems related to illegal logging. I have spent my time expressing the concerns about this bill. I thoroughly support the coalition's amendment, without which there is no way that I could support this legislation in the House today. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (12:51): I rise to speak on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011, a very important piece of legislation which we are debating today. This bill will seek to prohibit the importation and sale of all timber products which contain illegally logged timber, implement due diligence requirements for importers, ensure that there is a consistent definition of legally logged products on sale in Australia and establish enforcement powers and associated penalties for non-compliance with regulations. Illegal logging poses a significant challenge to the goal of sustainable management of the world's forests. Out of the approximately $4 billion of total timber products that Australia imports annually, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry estimates that about $400 million or 10 per cent of imported forest products are at risk of being sourced from illegal logging projects. The OECD, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, estimates that in some developing countries the rate of illegal logging can be as high as 70 per cent. In places such as the Amazon River and Madagascar, there is global concern that we may see the destruction of tropical rainforests in these environmentally sensitive areas. Every member of this House wants to ensure that we do what we can to protect the environment. We must recognise, however, that there are substantial trade-offs involved between, on the one hand, the protection of global forestry and, on the other, the employment prospects and quality of life concerns in developing countries. It is important for this House to constantly keep in mind on decisions made today their ramifications on the future global environment and future generations. But we must also not ignore the fact that there are hundreds of millions of impoverished people in countries around the world, many millions of whom undertake illegal logging just so they can live. This is not a desirable situation, but it is a situation that we must all accept. It is therefore paramount that any move to address illegal logging in foreign countries is fully considered by the parliament, that all possible regulations be scrutinised by the parliament and not just by departmental bureaucrats. I am not confident that this bill has been scrutinised as thoroughly as possible and, as the member for Forrest outlined, the government followed a flawed process to develop this bill. They did not consult widely and we do not know what the actual regulations will be. Therefore, I do not support this bill in its current form. The coalition will seek to move an amendment to defer the commencement date of the legislation such that the regulations imposed on the importation of timber products can be appropriately put into practice by local industry. My main concern with this bill is in its timing and the rushing through of burdensome regulations without properly consulting with all stakeholders, including foreign and local industry and other trade partners. It is quite concerning to me that the three recommendations of the trade subcommittee's majority report essentially contradict each other, and I will explain why. The first recommendation urges that the government: … continues to consult closely with the Governments of Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea and other relevant stakeholders on implementation of the bill and the development of subordinate legislation. The second recommendation urged the government to: … facilitate Malaysia and Papua New Guinea's representation on the Illegal Logging Working Group convened by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. These two recommendations are extremely important to the ultimate consequences of any regulations. The third recommendation states: … that the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 be passed. There is no guarantee that recommendations 1 and 2 will be followed, so to me to recommend the passage of this bill seems disingenuous. This is why, in the coalition's minority report, we agreed with the first and second recommendations, but further proposed: … that the Bill not be passed until the draft subordinate legislation has been finalised and has been the subject of extensive community … consultationand that the second reading debate be delayed. The coalition has been very open about its concerns, with the Leader of the Opposition writing to the Prime Minister on 15 March 2012 requesting the government defer the onset of the legislation to ensure that the regulations can be further scrutinised through the committee process. This Gillard government is notorious for its ability to alienate foreign countries, and the Labor government is doing so yet again. I am not surprised that comprehensive consultation has not occurred, because the responsible minister for this bill is none other than Senator Ludwig. In his capacity as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig ignored the advice from his own department and ignored the issues in Australia's live animal exports industry and subsequently risked Australia's very important bilateral trade relationship with Indonesia when he, in an ill-thoughtthrough knee-jerk reaction, imposed an immediate ban on all live animal exports to that country. That blunder by Senator Ludwig devastated the industry and cost the government millions of dollars. I would loathe for that situation to happen again, where the government does not consult properly leading to regrettable unintended consequences. Today's bill threatens to harm our bilateral trade relationships with not just Indonesia but also Canada, Papua New Guinea and Malaysia, among many others. In their submissions to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's inquiry into this legislation, these countries were very clear. The Indonesian government's submission expressly said: The implementation of the Bill is … likely to undermine the development of trade between Indonesia and Australia based on our respective mutual interests. Indonesia noted the importance of forestry and the forest sector, and noted that the industry employs close to: … four million Indonesians often in rural where other forms of employment do not exist. Clearly Indonesia is willing to fight on this issue because it affects so many of its citizens. If Australia believed that another country was planning to impose deleterious unilateral trade restrictions on our exports, we would fight just as strongly. Malaysia advised the committee that while they understand: … that the objective of the Bill is laudable, Malaysia would like to see that the implementation of the Bill will not in any way hamper the good bilateral trade relationship particularly in timber products. The Canadian government's submission warned that any third-party certification scheme and the reliance on strict chain-ofcustody certification could lead to a 'barrier to trade' for exporters of timber products. These are some of our most important trading partners. Indonesia is certainly Australia's largest neighbour and the single most important export market for our wheat and beef industries. We do not want to harm this important bilateral trade relationship more than has already been achieved by the Gillard Labor government. The concern I have is that this unilateral effort and blanket policy will damage our bilateral relationships. As the member for Curtin mentioned earlier this morning, New Zealand, in their submission, noted: The implementation of the Bill has the potential to have a significant negative impact on New Zealand's forestry industry: an industry almost entirely based on privately-owned plantation forests that are established specifically to be harvested. Australia is our second largest market for forestry products and imported NZ$824 million of these products in the year to December 2010. As Judith Sloan commented in an article in the Australian on 15 May 2012 the point of trade policy, insofar as it actually relates to areas actual trade policy, should be used to promote international trade, and should not be used 'to pursue other objectives, such as environmental aims'. In the case of New Zealand, we could be following a policy of bilateral engagement so that their concerns are acknowledged and respected. Instead, this prescriptive legislation has the possibility to damage our relationship with New Zealand and ultimately impose unnecessary costs on lowrisk importers and low-risk countries. We can look to examples such as the FLEGT-Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade-Action Plan in the European Union. Countries wishing to export timber to the European Union enter into and negotiate processes and standards through bilateral voluntary partnership agreements. This ensures that only legally produced timber arrives into the European Union without being overly prescriptive, and to date six countries are implementing systems agreed to in their VPAs, another six countries are negotiating their VPAs, and any approximately 15 countries from all corners of the globe have expressed interest with the European Union. If you want to talk about real action, clearly the FLEGT Action Plan is achieving some success. If this government is worried about illegal logging in Indonesia, they should look at the voluntary partner agreement that Indonesia has already concluded with the European Union. It was one the first countries in the world to be involved with the FLEGT Action Plan process. The coalition went to the 2010 election with a clear policy of real action for the prevention of illegal logging because we understand that illegal logging is a significant challenge to the global environment. However, we believe in deferring the time frame in which illegal logging measures will be fully rolled out to allow industry to adapt to any new measures. The coalition believes that all impacted stakeholders should be consulted closely in the drafting of any legislation and regulations, which to date is still a major concern. Therefore, coalition support for this bill contingent on acceptance by the government of our amendment to defer the onset of the legislation until 1 July 2013, with regulations not taking effect until 2015. I urge the government to address my concerns and those of the coalition and support our amendments.",71
29,Mr FLETCHER,COMMITTEES," I am pleased to speak on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011. The stated aim of this bill is to reduce the harmful impacts of illegal logging by restricting the importation and sale of illegally logged timber products in Australia. As ever with legislation proposed by this government, it is one thing to ask whether the objective is a desirable one; it is quite another to ask whether the method of achieving the objective has been well thought through and carefully planned. This bill has a worthy title but it is dangerously lacking in detail about key aspects of implementation of the measures in the bill and as a consequence many parties in the timber industry, including people and companies in our major trading partner countries, will be left unsure about their legal obligations and unsure what they are required to do to comply with those obligations. In the time available to me today I would like to make three points in relation to this bill: first, that the coalition is opposed to illegal logging and supports effective measures to prevent it; second, because key aspects of the proposed regulatory regime for illegal logging are not set out in this bill but instead will be left to the regulations, this is not a bill in a form which should be supported by this parliament at this time; and, thirdly, the government's woeful mishandling of this bill continues to damage our international trade relationships. Let me turn firstly to the proposition that is the coalition certainly supports effective measures to prevent illegal logging. We join with all reasonable people in believing that illegal logging is a significant challenge to the goal of sustainably managing the world's forests and that it damages both the environment and trade by legitimate businesses in timber based markets. It is a large market internationally. The World Bank estimates that illegal logging generates revenues of some US$10 billion to US$15 billion a year. This was why in 2010 the coalition gave a commitment that we would legislate to make it an offence to import any timber product which had not been verified as being legally harvested. So the dispute here is not one about the question of principle; it is about the implementation as reflected in two critical conditions that we attached to the commitment we made in 2010. Firstly, we said that a transition period of two years would be provided to allow industry to adapt to the new measures and that the coalition would ensure that all impacted stakeholders were consulted in the drafting of the legislation and the regulations and other related measures. In the typically chaotic and shambolic processes adopted by the Gillard government, neither of these critical requirements has been met and therefore the legislation in the form that it appears before the House today is not a form which we could support. I want to turn to the second issue which is of acute concern: that key aspects of the regulatory regime are not yet before the House. They are not contained in this bill; instead, we are told, they will be left to the regulations. The explanatory memorandum says that the bill: ... provides a high-level legislative framework to implement the government's policy to combat illegal logging. It goes on to say that there will be subordinate legislative instruments to realise the government's policy objective. What is left to be dealt with in the regulations is extremely broad. It includes which timber products are to be regulated. It includes what will be the due diligence requirements that citizens and companies must meet if they are to mitigate the risk of being subject to civil or criminal penalties for importing or processing illegally logged timber. In other words, absolutely fundamental aspects of the regime are not dealt with in the bill and will be solely a matter for regulation. This is very, very troubling, particularly when you understand the legislative scheme that is laid out here, the core of which is section 8 of the bill, which establishes an offence for importing a thing which 'is made from, or includes' illegally logged timber. If you commit that offence, you will be liable for imprisonment of up to five years, so the stakes are very, very high for citizens seeking to work out what they need to do to comply with the law. The definition of illegally logged timber is timber 'harvested in contravention of laws in force in the place, whether or not in Australia, where the timber was harvested'. What this means, on the basis of the legislation in front of the House today, if passed into law, is that everybody in Australia who is involved in the business of selling furniture, knick-knacks and souvenirs or garden implements-everybody in that category-will be at risk of finding themselves going to jail for five years because they happened not to keep up with the change in the law in Indonesia, Burma, Malaysia or any other country around the world from which they happen to have imported products. I emphasise 'products', not 'timber', because they might very well be products which are primarily made up of other materials but happen to include some timber. On the definition, on the wording of section 8, on the face of this legislation, anybody in that position is potentially at risk of going to jail for five years in circumstances where they really have very little prospect of finding out whether or not the timber which is contained in the product they have imported is in fact in breach of the law in the country where it was harvested. We are assured that there will be regulations which will make this all much clearer, but the effect of the way the bill is drafted and the scheme that the government is proposing is that the parliament today is being asked to approve a law which will have the effect that I have just described, which will put people in the business of importing products which happen to contain any timber at risk of going to jail for five years. This is a very troubling case of the full apparatus of state coercive power being applied in a way which could very easily trap people who have made an innocent mistake. This piece of legislation runs for 61 pages. Between pages 7 and 14 the key offences are set out, along with the statement of broad principle that the parties will be required to carry out due diligence to protect themselves against committing these offences. But of course the bill does not tell us-and, when the legislation is passed in this form and takes effect, the legislation will not tell us- section 74. what you need to do to meet those due diligence requirements. You can read the bill from cover to cover and it does not tell you what you need to do to take advantage of the due diligence defence. But what we do get between pages 17 and 61 of this bill is provision after provision after provision establishing all of the detailed obligations, provisions and powers that the government and its apparatus of inspectors will now have. There are monitoring powers. There will be new inspectors to be appointed. These inspectors will have powers under section 22 to enter premises to determine whether there has been compliance. I point out that those powers exist without the inspector being required to form any belief or suspicion as to non-compliance. The inspector simply has the power under section 22 to enter if he or she gets a warrant or if he or she gets the permission of the occupier of the premises. The pages and pages of powers which are granted to these inspectors include the power to operate electronic equipment on the premises that they enter and the power to secure evidential material, and all of this is just in division 2, which deals with monitoring. Then we have division 3, which deals with investigation, where these powers are not merely repeated but increased. And, of course, there is another little provision in this bill that is of the kind that this government is very fond of, and that is a strict liability provision. That is to say that under section 74 it is clear that in prosecuting for a breach of this act the government, the prosecutor, does not need to demonstrate that the person before the court had any particular state of mind. You might have made an innocent mistake. That will not help you if you are facing a strict liability provision, and that is made clear under All of this would be troubling enough if the regulations were to come into effect on the same date as the act takes effect and, of course, if we had the regulations in front of us to know what they say and to know what the due diligence defence actually involves, but that is not the case. Extraordinarily enough, these regulations will not come into effect until at least six months after the bill has taken effect and potentially longer. That will create enormous uncertainty for Australian citizens, for Australian businesses and for international businesses in knowing what you have to do to comply with this draconian piece of Australian legislation. This was a point well made in a submission by Mr Thorry Gunnersen, who had this to say: The Bill creates a crime without adequately defining that crime: There is no list of products to be regulated, the definition of ""illegal logging"" is broad and the regulations do not yet exist. And here is something I found quite remarkable in the joint committee inquiry report. Even Greenpeace thought these arrangements were unsatisfactory. Even Greenpeace, according to the committee report, had this to say: … 'too much information and detail is being left to the regulations resulting in uncertainty for business (and countries).' When Greenpeace is saying that this is a set of regulatory provisions which is putting businesses at risk, which is putting commerce at risk, which is leaving citizens unsure of how to comply with their regulatory obligations, you know there is a serious problem with this set of provisions. All of this, of course, is predicated government's ludicrous claim that it can get all this sorted out and get the regulations in place in six months. Anybody who has watched this government operate would be deeply sceptical of this claim. Let's just go through how this is going to work, and it is made very clear in the report of the Senate inquiry. First of all, the provisions in the bill establishing a criminal offence to import timber which has been illegally logged will take effect from the date of royal assent. Secondly, at that point there will be no detail as to how the due diligence defence operates; in fact, it will not exist. Therefore, as a matter of law, if it can be shown that you have 'recklessly imported illegal timber'-that is to say, if you are aware of a substantial risk that the thing is made from or includes illegally logged timber-you are up for jail time of up to five years. So if you import a chair which happens to have wooden feet and it turns out that these wooden feet come from timber which has been illegally logged then you are at risk of going to jail for five years. The bureaucrats, when they appeared before the Senate inquiry, grandly conceded that when the regulations are finally available there may 'be a subset that may exclude those sorts of products'. Every citizen can be relieved at this gracious concession from government! The reality is that the bill before the House today is creating a regime under which anybody who is in business in Australia importing any material which contains any wood at all ought to be terrified, because if that wood happens to have been logged in breach of the law of another country-something which in practical terms they have no way of finding out-they could find a government inspector knocking at their door and dragging away the product for analysis, a few weeks later they on the could find themselves charged, and a few months after that they could find themselves locked up in jail for five years. These are disturbingly draconian provisions, and, without the coalition's amendment that the onset of the legislation and the regulations not occur before 1 July 2015, we cannot support them. The third point I want to make briefly, which has been aptly and ably pointed out by many of my colleagues, is that the government has comprehensively mishandled its relationship on this legislation with major trading partners, including countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, and countries like Canada and Papua New Guinea have made the point that there might well need to be a challenge under World Trade Organization procedures to what is in substance a unilateral trade measure. This was terrible execution, very badly thought through. The objective we can support in principle, but this is a terrible bill in the way it is implemented. (Time expired)",77
30,Dr EMERSON,COMMITTEES," The member for Bradfield has joined in the passing parade of coalition MPs who have alleged, based in part on a story in the Financial Review, that the relationship between Australia and Indonesia has been severely strained and damaged over this matter. I want to take this opportunity to set the record straight on that. In terms of heritage, I have had a long association with the logging industry and also with conservation issues, going back to the days of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. I was involved during the Tasmanian forest issue-a very vexed issue at that time-the issue of the wet tropics of north Queensland and, subsequently, as the director-general of the environment department, the logging issue in Queensland. I can say, against that background, that the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill will support trade in legitimate forestry products. The government is developing the policy in accordance with our international obligations under the World Trade Organization-of course we would do that. The policy will be applied to imports from all countries equally and will also apply to illegally obtained Australian timber. In that sense it is nondiscriminatory. The policy makes a distinction between illegal and legal timber rather than between the countries of origin of the timber. The bill will prevent the importation and sale of illegally logged timber and timber products in Australia. It is designed to support similar measures implemented by the European Union and the United States. So, far from it being a socialist plot and draconian legislation, this is part of a global effort to deal with the problem of illegal logging. It is part of the broader international effort to boost trade in legally logged timber and address the serious economic, social and environmental impacts of illegal logging. The Indonesian government and other governments in the region have expressed their support for the eradication of the illegally logged timber trade, and obviously we are at one on that. There was extensive consultation with our counterparts in Indonesia, and that will continue. We have made the commitment in personal meetings-Senator Ludwig with his counterparts and I with my counterpart in Indonesia, the trade minister, Gita Wirjawan-that we will consult very closely on the development of the regulations. That is a source of great reassurance to them. During this debate, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gleefully read from a piece that was written in the Australian Financial Review titled 'Indonesia fed up with Canberra ""dysfunction""'. The quoting from that piece has led me to come into the chamber to clarify the true situation. I would have let the water flow under the bridge, as we have done, having sought ourselves a clarification or retraction in respect of that particular piece. But, given that it has been invoked in the debate to seek to influence the way people vote in this chamber on that matter, I think everyone in this chamber and outside listening deserves a clarification. That clarification is provided in two documents. One is a press release from Gita Wirjawan, my counterpart, the trade minister of Indonesia. I will read some of that. It says: Related to a news article published today by the Australian Financial Review titled 'Indonesia fed up with Canberra 'dysfunction'' the Ministry of Trade, Republic of Indonesia, would like to clarify that the statement in the news report quoting Indonesian Trade Minister Gita Wirjawan in the published article was not sourced, originated from the minister, nor the ministry. The ministry was never contacted with regard to the issue. There was never an interview that took place with the Indonesian Trade Minister in relation to the issue with the Australian Financial Review. The Ministry of Trade has communicated with the Australian Ambassador in Jakarta in clarifying factual information that no such comment has ever taken place in view of the Australian government in Canberra. This was followed up by correspondence from the trade minister, Gita Wirjawan, to Michael Stutchbury, the editor of the Financial Review. I sought, on behalf of Gita Wirjawan, a retraction. I was told there would be no retraction, that they stood by their story. The letter to Michael Stutchbury about the article written by John Kerin includes the following: I would like to raise your attention to news article published by the Australian Financial Review entitled Indonesia fed up with Canberra 'dysfunction', published in its 6 March 2012 print edition. For your kind information, I was subsequently informed that the lead author of the above article, John Kerin, has interviewed sources in the ministry but insisted on keeping them confidential. Nonetheless, I believe the article along with my photograph as shown is slander and misleading to the readers. We would highly appreciate a retraction of the article. It could not be clearer. You have the Indonesian trade minister protesting strongly in the Financial Review. As I said, we could get neither a clarification nor a retraction initiated not by this government but by the government of Indonesia. That is a decision that the Financial Review made. But to have that piece brought into this chamber and used as evidence against the illegal logging bill is obviously highly misleading. I am not saying it was wilfully misleading. Obviously, if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had bothered to contact the Indonesian embassy in Australia or the Australian embassy in Indonesia, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have known that the trade minister of Indonesia was completely put out by this, that he had given no interview and that he was very upset that his photograph was in this story as if to give the impression that such an interview took place. Speaker after speaker on the coalition side said how important it is that we must not do anything to damage the relationship with Indonesia. In this chamber yesterday every one of them voted in favour of a policy towing back boats into Indonesian waters with no agreement from Indonesia. It has been made abundantly clear time and time again that the Indonesian government would not accept such a policy. They have said it publicly; they have said it privately. So let us forget the cant hypocrisy from the coalition. The coalition talks about the importance of a recent maintaining a good relationship with Indonesia, which this government has, and then walks into the chamber, every one of them, to vote for a policy that would destroy the relationship between the government of Australia and the government of Indonesia. We want some truth to come out in these deliberations in this parliament. There has been a highly misleading article and an attempt by the trade minister himself personally to get a retraction. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition came into this chamber and read it out gleefully saying that it is a wonderful thing from their point of view that there is a bad relationship between this government and the Indonesian government. There is not; there is an excellent relationship, and we will continue to consult on the regulations in the bill. That is the undertaking we have given and that is the undertaking that has been accepted by the government of Indonesia. I would think that there might be an opportunity at some stage for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition herself to recant and to say that she is sorry for the embarrassment she has caused by quoting from an article for which the Indonesian trade minister unsuccessfully sought a retraction from the Australian Financial Review.",80
31,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,COMMITTEES,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (13:26): I thank all the honourable members for their contributions to this important debate. I wish to start by addressing the comments of those opposite. They relied heavily on an article published in the Financial Review earlier this year to support a perception that Indonesia is aggrieved at the level of consultation on this bill. As the Minister for Trade has already reported in this House, the Indonesian trade minister in fact issued a press release dismissing the veracity of the quotes attributed to him. The press release went further to say that neither he nor the Ministry of Trade were contacted by the journalist writing the article. It needs to be clear that the comments are inaccurate. The Gillard government would take the counsel of the Liberals more seriously if their foreign affairs spokesperson had not been characterised as both sleep inducing and arrogant by the Indonesians themselves. They are all over the shop on this issue. The member for Flinders will support the legislation if it is delayed. The member for Mayo would like the bill tremendously amended but will support its passage if the member for Flinders' delays are agreed to by the parliament. At least the member for Forrest had the gumption to tell the parliament that the bill will implement their policy to provide a two-year window for the development and implementation of regulations. This bill will implement their policy. But it seems they are a divided lot over there, sending mixed messages about their commitment to this issue. I would like to make it clear what their policy is. We will require Australian timber importers and domestic processing mills to undertake a process of due diligence to verify the legal origins timber product and to disclose species, country of harvest and any certification. So they need to explain in this House and outside this House why they have abandoned this policy. The member for Lyne, who has not spoken today, has made representations on behalf of furniture manufacturers. The contribution of the Australian furniture association and other Australian business groups are taken seriously by the Gillard government. The Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill imposes strict penalties on the importation and processing of illegally harvested timber and timber products. I understand the department has distributed a list of products for consultation purposes to its illegal logging working group. Since the department distributed that list, there has been constructive feedback from the members of the group to the department and to the minister's office. Furniture, including furniture manufactured from particle board, will be regulated, as will pulp and paper. The bill contains significant penalties. Individuals convicted under one of the two main offences in this bill can face up to five years in prison and/or a fine of $55,000, or $275,000 for a corporation. Importers and processors will be required to complete an annual statement of compliance and the department will audit compliance on a targeted risk basis and conduct random audits. While there will not be 'illegal timber enforcement officers' at the border, Australian law enforcement authorities frequently cooperate with governments in the region and beyond to combat serious international crime. The government is confident that this bill and the efforts of Australian importers will contribute substantially to those activities. The Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 represents a major step by Australia to support the legal trade of timber products. The bill fulfils the of the government's commitment to restrict the trade in illegally harvested timber and timber products. On 22 March 2012, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade held a third inquiry relating to possible international implications of the bill. The joint standing committee came to the same conclusion as the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry, and that was that this bill be passed. The joint committee report recommended that the government continue to consult with the governments of Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, which the government is already doing. The government has agreed to all of its recommendations and is implementing them. Regional workshops have been held in Port Moresby, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Wellington. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has held a workshop via web link with the government of Canada and their key industry representatives. The joint committee report recommends that the government facilitates Malaysia and Papua New Guinea's representation on the Illegal Logging Stakeholder Working Group. The government has done just that. The government does not pretend that there are not some sensitivities amongst our trading partners. Can I say that Malaysian, Canadian, New Zealand, Papua New Guinean and Indonesian leaders each agreed with their APEC counterparts to 'work to implement appropriate measures to prohibit trade in illegally harvested forest products and undertake additional activities in APEC to combat illegal logging and associated trade'. We will continue that work and commitment. There are roughly 50 members of the government's Illegal Logging Working Group. The government has consulted widely on this matter and will continue to so, as we committed to do. Preliminary drafts of two regulations have been distributed for comment to these key trading partners and other members of a stakeholder working group. These draft regulations are also available on the department's website. The distribution of these draft documents demonstrates that the claims of those opposite that the government is not consulting are hollow. Australia commends the commitment of trading partners to protect their forests by combating illegal logging and the associated trade. Of note is the work being undertaken in Indonesia on their Timber Legality Assurance System, known as SVLK, and in busy Malaysia on the Malaysian Timber Certification Scheme. Canada, the US, New Zealand, Indonesia, the EU and Malaysia have expressed their support for the bill's overall objectives to reduce the harmful environmental, social and economic impact of illegal logging. Support for the bill has come from nongovernment organisations, such as the Uniting Church, Greenpeace, Transparency International and World Vision. The government has also received additional support from a number of timber product importing businesses including Bunnings, Kimberly-Clark and IKEA. The government has worked towards alignment with measures being implemented by the US and EU to minimise the impact of the legislation on exporting businesses. This bill aligns Australia's efforts to combat illegal logging with international initiatives, including legislation already implemented in the United States and developments in the European Union. In May 2008, the United States made amendments to the Lacey Actits act that regulates the trade of flora and fauna-to include the illegal trade of plants do and plant products, including timber, to combat illegal logging. The US has included a requirement for a declaration at the border, similar to measures being implemented within Australia. The European Union Timber Regulation requires importers to undertake due diligence when first placing timber or timber products on the market. The European Commission is scheduled to apply its Timber Regulation in March 2013. Individual member states will be responsible for developing penalties under the EU regulations. An APEC Experts Group on Illegal Logging and Associated Trade has recently been established, pursuant to a proposal from Chile, Indonesia and the United States, supported by Australia. participated in meetings in February and May 2012. Australia also presented details of its proposed legislation to the Committee on Trade and Environment of the World Trade Organization on 14 November 2011. The time to act on illegal logging is now, as committed to by both parties at the last election and before-not in three years time but now. The Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 delivers on the government's commitment to restrict the importation and sale of illegally logged timber in Australia. The bill is consistent with Australia's international trade obligations under the World Trade Organization and relevant free trade agreements. It provides for evenhanded treatment of suppliers of timber irrespective of their nationality. The bill will remove unfair competition posed by illegally logged timber for Australia's domestic timber producers and suppliers, establishing an even economic playing field for the purchase and sale of legally logged timber products. I would like to conclude by citing the latest media release from the CFMEU, whose members and their jobs rely so much on the timber and fibre industry of Australia: The amendment to the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill tabled by the Coalition, if accepted by Parliament, could cost thousands of jobs in vulnerable timber communities, according to the CFMEU. ""Make no mistake about it, this amendment would cost Australian jobs, hurt Australian families and kill off Australian timber communities,"" CFMEU National Secretary Michael O'Connor said today. ""It is a clear case of the Coalition succumbing to pressure from those who benefit from illegal logging. ""Their amendment would delay the ban on illegal logging imports from coming into effect for at least two to three years. Australia ""Workers in the timber and wood products manufacturing industry simply cannot afford such a delay. They would rightly view support for this amendment as a kick in the guts at a time when timber and manufacturing workers desperately need those in Canberra to stand up for them. ""Wood products represent the second largest sector in Australia's manufacturing industry and cheap, illegally-sourced imported products are strangling it. ""This amendment takes the interests of illegal loggers and their criminal syndicates overseas - as well as unscrupulous importers of timber and timber product - and places them above the interests of Australian workers. ""The Coalition needs to be clear: Do they want to look after the livelihoods of Australian workers who are getting unfairly undercut or not? ""Any supporters of this amendment should, quite frankly, be ashamed of themselves."" It was our commitment to introduce this legislation. It was the commitment of those opposite to introduce this legislation. Their amendment is now aimed at delaying it. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",82
32,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,COMMITTEES,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (13:39): I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and ask leave of the House to move government amendments (1) to (9), as circulated, together. Leave granted.",85
33,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,COMMITTEES,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (13:39): by leave-I move: (1) Clause 8, page 7 (line 8), after “prescribed”, insert “as exempt”. (2) Clause 9, page 7 (line 17), after “prescribed”, insert “as exempt”. (3) Clause 12, page 9 (line 7), at the end of the clause, add: ; and (d) the thing is not prescribed as exempt by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph. (4) Clause 13, page 9 (line 16), at the end of the clause, add: ; and (d) the thing is not prescribed as exempt by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph. (5) Clause 15, page 11 (line 21), after “prescribed”, insert “as exempt”. (6) Clause 15, page 11 (line 23), after “prescribed”, insert “as exempt”. (7) Clause 15, page 11 (line 24), at the end of subclause (1), add: ; and (f) the raw log is not of a kind prescribed as exempt by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph. (8) Clause 17, page 13 (line 20), at the end of subclause (1), add: ; and (d) the raw log is not of a kind prescribed as exempt by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph. (9) Clause 18, page 14 (line 24), after “industry”, insert “or certifying”. The government is proposing a small number of minor drafting amendments to ensure clarity and consistency in the bill. These amendments do not affect the policy intent or objective of the bill but are necessary to ensure that clauses in the bill are interpreted correctly once it becomes law. The purpose of the proposed amendments is to provide clarity on how timber products can be exempt from the prohibitions in clauses 8, 9, 12, 13, 15 and 17 and to ensure that such exemption provisions are throughout the bill. The proposed amendments also rectify a drafting inconsistency in the due diligence requirements for processors of domestic logs in clause 18 to make them consistent with the due diligence requirements for importers of regulated timber products in clause 14. Question agreed to. Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (13:41): I move opposition amendment: (1) Clause 2, page 1 (line 8) to page 2 (line 9), omit the clause, substitute: 2 Commencement This Act commences on 1 July 2015. It is not reasonable for the government to bring the measures in the bill into law without giving our trading partners and our domestic timber industry and timber importers the time they were promised to design and implement appropriate systems. As a result of the government's incompetence, I am forced to move an amendment. There has been a lack of consultation with our trading partners and domestic industry. This amendment will delay the commencement date of the legislation and regulation-making power to 1 July 2015. The additional time is needed to satisfy the concern of six of Australia's major timber trading partners-particularly Indonesia, which is our biggest, nearest and most important neighbour-about the subordinate regulations not being available now, at the time that the legislation is being debated, in order to allow sufficient time for scrutiny of the regulations before they take effect by either the parliament or the parties I mentioned previously. Our trading partners have not been given sufficient time to implement systems to allow traceability and achieve compliance within the regulations and legislation. Australian importers have not been given sufficient time to design and consistent implement processes on traceability and demonstrate due diligence. I cannot emphasise enough-particularly given recent events with Indonesia, apart from anybody else-the importance of our managing the transition envisaged in the legislation through working closely with our trading partners. The government plans to impose the consequences of this legislation pretty arrogantly on our trading partners in the same way as they imposed the live export ban on Indonesia without adequate-or, indeed, any-consultation. It is important to note that the current timber certification programs do not yet provide due diligence elements in their traceability certifications. Current systems simply cannot be put in place to meet the requirements of the legislation and regulations at this time.",85
34,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,COMMITTEES,"BraddonParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (13:43): mentioned earlier-and as is well known publicly-the coalition promised the Australian electorate that they would implement legislation to prohibit the trade and processing of illegally harvested timber and timber products. Now they are being given the opportunity to join with us in a bipartisan fashion to implement one of their own policies. But, having been given that opportunity, they-on very hollow and shallow grounds-have moved amendment to delay the commencement of the legislation by some three years. The trade in illegally logged materials would continue if the coalition's amendment were accepted. We will not accept this amendment. Using estimates published by, for example, the World Bank a further 236,520 square kilometres of forest will be harvested illegally with the approval of the Australian parliament if we agree to this amendmentnearly 250,000 square kilometres of forest wiped out, illegally logged. Looking at the data in the explanatory memorandum for the bill, the coalition's amendments will give the green light to a further $180 billion",87
35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Brain Injury Awareness Week,87
36,Mr ALEXANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This week is Brain Injury Awareness Week, which highlights the hidden disability and the impact of brain injury on our society. Over half a million Australians have acquired a brain injury, most commonly from car accidents, falls, strokes, violence, work and sporting incidents. Brain injuries As I can cause mobility problems, sensory loss, fatigue, speech difficulties and problems with thinking skills and behavioural changes. The Royal Rehabilitation Centre in my electorate of Bennelong provides top-level services through its Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit. Last week I was delighted to visit the centre to donate two table tennis tables to its Return2Sport program through the generosity of Hyundai. Tomorrow the unit will be inducting seven an new heroes to the Brain Injury Wall of Fame. These are inspiring individuals who have returned to the workforce after crippling injuries and who offer great motivation to other patients at the unit. I congratulate Mario Bianco, Kate Boyd, Jason Donnelly, Jason Farrawell, Tish Peiris, Matthew Powney and David Todd on their strength and drive. Congratulations also go to their families and friends for their endless support. I also commend Dr Clayton King and all the staff at the Royal Rehabilitation Centre for their dedication to improving the lives of their patients. Basketball ACT",87
37,Dr LEIGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last Saturday night it was my pleasure to attend the Gunners versus Bandits game at the ACT Basketball Centre, part of the South East Australian Basketball League competition. I was invited there as a guest of Tony Jackson, the CEO of Basketball ACT, because it was a special evening with all proceeds going to the Big Bang Ballers campaign to use basketball to fight youth poverty and social disadvantage around the world. In Afghanistan the Big Bang Ballers are currently providing basketball courts to young Afghani girls who until recently could not even consider sport, let alone play it. I was speaking there at the game with Mark White, the coach of the Gunners, and he talked about the concept of shorter basketball players needing to play above their height. To me it is a great metaphor for the way in which all of us should be trying to play a little above our height. Pierre Johannessen, the CEO of the Big Bang Ballers, for all that he has done not just in developing countries but also in Australia. Natalie Porter, the former Olympian, was assisting a group of young Canberrans in Night Hoops. Night Hoops is aimed at at-risk Canberrans, some of them recent migrants from Sudan, providing them with an opportunity to learn valuable basketball skills and leadership skills and to get a good meal at the same time. (Time expired) Vietnam Veterans Day",87
38,Mr MATHESON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to pay tribute to Australia's Vietnam Veterans in the lead-up to Vietnam Veteran's Day on 18 August. This Saturday I will join thousands of Australians across the nation who will attend a memorial service to remember those who fought in one of this country's most unpopular wars. Australia's military involvement in the Vietnam War was the longest in duration of any other war in our country's history. My father, Reg Matheson, was one of the 60,000 Australian soldiers deployed to Vietnam between May 1962 and April 1975. Sadly, 521 men died as a result of this war and more than 3,000 were wounded. The Vietnam War caused one of the greatest anti-war movements in Australia's history and, sadly, our soldiers met a hostile reception on their return home. I pray that no Australian soldier ever has to return home from war to such little support from their country. I know that my dad experienced the horrors of war in Vietnam and those memories remain with him today. That is why every year I attend a Vietnam Veteran's Day service and memorial dinner in Macarthur to pay my respects to those soldiers who fought so gallantly and suffered with very little support for many years after I pay tribute to they returned home. The Vietnam Veterans Association Macarthur Branch are committed to the ongoing support of our local veterans and their families. It is with great pride that I stand here today to thank them for their dedication and commitment to these men who deserve all the help and support we can give them. I hope that everyone in this place has the opportunity to attend a Vietnam Veteran's Day service this weekend to remember those who fought in one of the most horrific wars in Australia's history. News Limited",88
39,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I have been informed that entrepreneur Dick Smith is with us today in this building. I congratulate him for being, in his own words, 'game to stand up to the Murdoch press and others in big business and actually admit that perpetual growth in the use of resources and energy is not sustainable in a finite world and we must start planning now before the limits are reached'. Dick Smith has correctly branded News Limited's campaign against proposed media reforms as hypocritical. He said News Limited's claim that proposed media regulations would curtail freedom of speech was claptrap because News Limited regularly censored any criticism of itself. Dick Smith said that it is in News Limited's commercial interests to censor the idea that people are responsible for global warming. As we have seen so graphically in Britain, News Corporation has one standard for itself and another for everyone else. Its hypocrisy is breathtaking. I urge members to read Dial M for Murdoch: News Corporation and the Corruption of Britain, written by the great Tom Watson and Martin Hickman, to see how News Corporation's criminal activities have corrupted democracy in Britain. In Australia, we have seen some of those same double standards and hypocrisy in the attempt to censor Dick Smith. News Limited feels free to criticise everyone but refuses to accept criticism of itself. Why isn't Rupert Murdoch intervening to address Dick Smith's grave concerns for our democracy? We all know why and that is why we need a public interest test and a fit and proper- (Time expired) Australian Taxation Office",88
40,Mr SOMLYAY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Community service and the tax office-who would have thought that these phrases could be used in the same sentence? Let me say it is not such a real paradox. The ATO is simply one of those agencies we love to loath but today I am sharing the love of the wonderful service the ATO provides through their free Tax Help program. Tax Help is an incredible network of community volunteers who provide free service to people to complete their tax returns. So it is not all way with the tax office; it really does give back to the community and help those who need it most. For a few months each year, in my own electorate office, we provide space for Tax Help. We are booked solidly for the duration and it is a real example of the success of the ATO working at grassroots level. I want to pay tribute to Sue Bailey, our own tireless tax helper, a volunteer. She is a local lady, well into her retirement years, who has stepped up year in year out to provide much-needed professional guidance to so many. She gives her time and her wisdom freely and for free. People come for tax help the first time because there is no cost, but they return again because of Sue. Sue Bailey is a wonderful ambassador for tax help and the ATO, and a wonderful role model for our volunteers. Thank you for allowing me to wax lyrical about tax. Throsby Electorate: Warilla Public School Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:52): I take this opportunity to praise the good work of Warilla Public School in my electorate of Throsby. Students speak highly of the commitment and hard work of their teachers. They also speak highly of the funding that this Labor government has made available to assist in improving their school environment, resources and learning. In the Illawarra Mercury on 14 August, year 6 students editorialised and offered their view on the funding that was directed to Warilla Public School to 'Build the Education Revolution'. They say that teachers used the opportunity during the construction phase of their new library and computer lab to teach and learn about mathematical concepts such as volume and area. They say that the new library and computer lab have become hubs of learning one in their school-a tangible and lasting legacy of this government placing education at its core. They say that the government's Smarter Schools National Partnerships have supported teachers in improving their own skills and the students' literacy and numeracy. They say that they 'give a Gonski' and they are eagerly awaiting news of the Gonski review of funding of schools. They hope Gonski will mean more funding for their school. I say that great schools like Warilla School deserve the additional funding that would be available through the Gonski recommendations. I would like to thank and congratulate all those who make Warilla Public School a great school-teachers, staff, students and parents. Kooyong Electorate: Raoul Wallenberg",89
41,Mr FRYDENBERG,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," In the heart of my electorate of Kooyong, on the corner of Princess and High Streets in Kew, stands a memorial to Raoul Wallenberg. It was the initiative of Frank Vajda, a Kooyong resident, who, with his late mother, Maria, was saved by Wallenberg in October 1944. Few of the thousands of people who walk or drive past this statue every week would truly appreciate what a giant among men Wallenberg was. Born on 4 August 1912, Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who served in Budapest during the Second World War. His efforts in issuing ‘protective passports' and providing shelter to Jews in Nazi occupied Hungary is credited with saving the lives of a remarkable 100,000 people. Threatened by the fascist Arrow Cross, he moved house every night, knowing that every day for him was a test of survival, just as it was for those he sought protect. Tragically, on 17 January 1945, when the Red Army entered Budapest, he was taken by the Soviets, never to be seen again. Just a few weeks ago I was privileged to attend a special commemorative service for Raoul Wallenberg at the Swedish Church in Melbourne. It truly was a moving occasion, with people coming together to recognise this remarkable man. This year marks his 100th birthday. He was a man who was ‘a righteous among nations' and whose courage and deeds will always represent a beam of light in what was one of the darkest periods Public in the history of mankind. World Humanitarian Day",90
42,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," In 2008 the United Nations General Assembly designated 19 August as World Humanitarian Day. This was done in memory of the 22 United Nations and NGO workers who were killed on 19 August 2003 when a bomb was detonated at the UN headquarters in Baghdad. Those killed included UN Envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello, along with my close friend Jean-Selim Kanaan and other colleagues I had known in Kosovo. Jean-Selim-to whom I dedicated my first speech in this place-had worked in Africa, the Balkans and the Middle East. He spoke seven languages and wrote a book called My War Against Indifference. His wife, Laura, had just given birth to their first and only child, Mattia-Selim, three weeks before Jean-Selim died at the age of 33. His story is just one of many. Disturbingly, there has been a significant increase in the number of attacks specifically targeting aid workers in recent years. However, humanitarian workers do not only face risks from violence and war. In January 2010 the Haiti earthquake took the lives of a great many Haitian people and also around to 100 UN staff. Four of those staff were close friends with whom I had worked in Kosovo, Gaza and New York. This morning a wonderful breakfast was held in advance of World Humanitarian Day. It was co-hosted by the UN Parliamentary Group and the UN Association of Australia and sponsored by AusAID. Guest speakers included Foreign Minister Bob Carr. This Sunday, 19 August, on World Humanitarian Day, it is appropriate that we spare some time to remember those who spend their lives-and sometimes lose their liveshelping the world's most vulnerable people on behalf of all of us. Coal Industry Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (13:57): I would like to bring to the House's attention that the boom period for our coal industry is about to burst. Mr Champion interjecting Mr O'DOWD: Yes, it is. Haven't you been reading the papers? Haven't you been taking notice? Commodity prices have been falling for some months now, and they could fall even further. The break-even price for our thermal coal is $80 per tonne-and that is what it is now. There are some predictions that this could even drop to $50 a tonne. Let us hope that this is not correct. Coking coal, at $180 a tonne, is a little bit stronger, is also down from $230 a tonne. Some Central Queensland mines have closed already and some have undergone shift rearrangements-contractors have been stood down and permanent jobs are under threat. The MRRT, the carbon tax, high fuel prices and the high Australian dollar are not helping our fiscal budgets, and any windfall this government thinks it is going to make out of the mining tax is going to be sadly missed. A lot of new mines and proposed developments of new mines are now on hold. Tobacco Plain Packaging",90
43,Ms ROWLAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to mention the federal government's historic plain packaging legislation and thank the Attorney-General and the Minister for Health for their commitment to this important piece of public policy. This legislation is of great importance to the community I represent in Western Sydney, which experiences an extremely high rate of preventable illness, including lung cancer. As a former director of the Western Sydney Area Health Service and a former smoker, I am well aware of the challenges facing my constituents with regard to preventable illness and the damage smoking does to your health. According to the New South Wales Ministry of Health, lung cancer incidence rates were 43.9 per 100,000 people in the Western Sydney local health district in 2008, with the rate for males being considerably higher than for females. Western Sydney experiences higher rates of lung cancer than the New South Wales average, so we must do everything we can to ensure rates of lung cancer and preventable illness fallespecially, we must discourage young people from taking up the habit. Yesterday's decision by the High Court to uphold the government's legislation is a victory for all those families I represent who but it have lost someone to a tobacco related illness. It is also a victory for the public health advocacy movement generally. I commend advocacy groups, the Cancer Council, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Health for standing up to big tobacco and winning for all those people out there who have been touched by tobacco related deaths.",91

NA Diddams, Sergeant Blaine Flower Report from Federation Chamber Order of the day returned from Federation Chamber for further consideration; certified copy presented.

46,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business will be absent from question time today for personal reasons. The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will answer questions in relation to housing and homelessness and on behalf of the Minister for Human Services. The Assistant Treasurer will answer questions in relation to small business on his behalf. NA Carbon Pricing",92
47,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her promise, made precisely two years ago today, that: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Will the Prime Minister now apologise to Australia's forgotten families for this breach of faith?",92
48,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I must admit I am not surprised by the Leader of the Opposition's question and I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he wants to talk about anniversaries then it is six weeks from 1 July when all of the reckless claims he has made about the Australian economy and the impact of carbon pricing have been proved to be wrong. On 1 July profound on a point of order. It is about direct relevance. The Prime Minister was asked about her promise two years ago, and that is what she has to answer.",92
49,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The Manager of Opposition Business is warned. Abusing points of order throughout question time is inappropriate. The Prime Minister has the call. She has just commenced her answer.,92
50,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, since carbon pricing started on 1 July, according to the TD Securities Melbourne Institute price index inflation has been at 0.2 per cent. That is one-fifth of 1c for every dollar spent. The Leader of the Opposition promised astronomical price rises. Since 1 July, in July we saw 14,000 new jobs created. The Leader of the Opposition promised a wrecking ball through the economy. The Leader of the Opposition predicted the death of the coal industry. Our industry is strong and expanding. He predicted that Whyalla would be wiped off the map and of course the town of Whyalla is still there, despite the Leader of the Opposition's false and wild claims. Australia needs a price on carbon in order to reduce carbon pollution, tackle climate change and seize a clean energy future. Prime Minister John Howard understood that because it is basically five years since he said he would put a price on carbon. When Brendan Nelson was Leader of the Opposition, he was committed to a price on carbon. When the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, was Leader of the Opposition, he was committed to a price on carbon. And the truth is: the Leader of the Opposition has been committed to a price on carbon in the past and has engaged in this scare campaign for political purposes. Our economy needs a price on carbon. We need a price on carbon for a clean energy future. We need it to reduce carbon pollution. And the Leader of the Opposition should come clean and acknowledge to Australians that, if he were ever Prime Minister, he would keep carbon pricing. He has been in favour of it in times. the past. Every living Liberal leader is in favour of carbon pricing, and the Leader of the Opposition should be clear with the Australian people that, whether or not he is Prime Minister, carbon pricing is here to stay. Mr Abbott interjecting",92
51,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw, unreservedly. The Leader of the Opposition has been in this parliament long enough to know that that is unparliamentary language and he will withdraw.",93

62,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The member for Deakin has the call. I will not continue this debate. Manufacturing,93
63,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the outlook for manufacturing as part of a clean energy future?,93
64,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Deakin for his question. The member for Deakin, I am sure, as someone very interested in jobs for Australians in manufacturing today and jobs in manufacturing tomorrow, would be pleased to hear that the report of the nongovernment members on my manufacturing task force was released today. I thank all of the people who have worked so hardcan people from businesses, people from trade unions and people from industry associations like the Australian Industry Group. I particularly thank Innes Willox and Dave Oliver for accompanying me and the Minister for Industry and Innovation at the release today. This is an important report about the jobs of one million Australians. One million Australians work in manufacturing. These are good jobs for Australian working people-blue-collar jobs that families have relied on sometimes for generations. I can assure the House that during this time of change in manufacturing we will be working with our manufacturing sector. I want to see strength in manufacturing today and I want us to have a strong manufacturing industry the future and past the days of the resources boom. The people who know about manufacturing know that the pressure on manufacturing today is the strength of the Australian dollar. That point was made very graphically by Innes Willox from the Australian Industry Group at the press conference today, where he said it was the single biggest factor for manufacturing. A strong Australian dollar is there because of the strength of our economy, the strength of our resources sector, the fact that many around the world view us as a safe haven. So our economy is a world leader, but it is putting pressure on manufacturing, and so we want to keep working with manufacturing. We already have a range of policies to support the jobs of manufacturing workers: our work with the car industry-to which, of course, the opposition is opposed-and our work on skills, our work on a clean energy future, our work on the National Broadband Network, our work on traditional infrastructure, our work on Australian industry participation, our work on encouraging people to buy Australian, and our work with our great scientific organisations like the CSIRO. But we believe that more can and should be done. I thank the members of the Prime Minister's manufacturing task force, my task force, for their quality work and for their powerful vision of Australia's manufacturing future. Electricity Prices",93

68,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, A question has been asked. I would have thought people would like to hear the answer. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting,94
69,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned!,94
70,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The carbon price is designed to reduce carbon pollution, just as when Prime Minister Howard announced that if he was re-elected in 2007 he would legislate an emissions trading scheme. The purpose of that price on carbon was to reduce carbon pollution, just as when Brendan Nelson was Leader of the Opposition and he was in favour of putting a price on carbon. The purpose of it was to reduce carbon pollution, just as when the member for Wentworth was the Leader of the Opposition and he advocated on a point of order. The question could not have been any more straightforward and tight. The Prime Minister only needs to say whether it would increase or decrease electricity prices. That is the question she has to answer.",94

I am also explaining that former Prime Minister Howard, Brendan Nelson, the member for Wentworth and, for much of the time that he has been in the Australian parliament, the Leader of the Opposition fulsomely agreed with that proposition.

74,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. In terms of the impact on electricity prices, the government has always been crystal clear about this. We said Australian households and Australian families should expect to see a 10 per cent increase in their electricity prices. They are seeing a 10 per cent increase in electricity prices, and because of that we have provided them with tax cuts, with family payment increasesMrs Bronwyn Bishop: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order",95

Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: I refer you to page 555 of the Practice, which points out that not all areas are covered by the standing orders relating to answers, including one of verballing the opposition.

It is 10 per cent, and because we knew that there would be that price flow-through we have provided tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. What that means is that on average families will see assistance of $10.10. The costs that they will see for electricity are $3.30 a week, the average assistance $10.10 a week. Of course, people have struggled with electricity price rises-the 50, 60 or 70 per cent that have proceeded because of the nature of the current electricity market and decisions taken by state governments. I am very concerned about the impact of that on Australian families, pensioners and people with fixed incomes and we intend to act on that. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has described that as a furphy, in stark contrast to what is being said by his state colleagues. So we will act on electricity price rises that have come without any real assistance for people. The Leader of the Opposition well knows that carbon pricing has a flowthrough impact for electricity-heavens above, he used to be in favour of it.",95

The Leader of the Opposition then ran around the country and said, 'Oh, it won't be 10 per it will be 20. It will be unimaginable. You just wait and see.' And of course the jury is in now and it is 10 per cent, which means the majority of Australian households will come out of carbon pricing either square or in front.

I also say to the Leader of the Opposition, who is obviously very interested in these questions today, that he may want to reflect on some of the material from the emissions trading scheme, the carbon price he was in favour of. He may want to reflect on how he stood for election in 2007 with the coalition's climate change policy saying that its scheme will lead to higher fuel and energy costs for households, which is something he was very much in favour of then.

In the year to March our economy has grown by 4.3 per cent. That is more than twice that experienced by other major advanced economies. So far this year 100,000 jobs have been created in Australia-800,000 jobs during the period of the government. And over the year to March, private business investment has grown by 20 per cent, to be at its highest level of GDP in 40 years. And in the past year the advance stage of the investment pipeline in resources has grown by nearly $90 billion. Consider that: over the past year, investment in resources at the Is advanced stage has grown by $90 billion. All of this has happened in the full knowledge that a carbon price was starting on 1 July. All of these facts about economic growth, about the performance of our economy over the past year, absolutely torpedo all of the lies that have been told by the Leader of the Opposition-absolutely torpedo the scare campaign that he has been mounting over the past year.",97

101,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker. Over the past year the Leader of the Opposition has been running around like Chicken Little, saying the sky is going to fall in. And, of course, in that time, our economy has gone from strength to strength to strength. So when you look at that data, and see the performance of the Australian economy, and you reflect on all of the distortions that the Leader of the Opposition has been putting in place, you can see that he is unfit for high officebecause he is constantly at war with the facts; he does not have the temperament and he does not have the ability to understand what is happening in our national economy. He would rather see the country and the economy fail than this government succeed, because he can never take a position in the national interest. For our part, we are focusing on policies which will grow our economy and spread the opportunities right around the whole of Australia. We understand how important it is to help households, and to help small businesses, that are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. We had a motion in the House this morning that celebrated our strong economy, moved by the member for Fraser, and the Leader of the Opposition could not even bring himself to vote for that. This just shows how unfit for high office the Leader of the Opposition is. (Time expired)",97
102,Dr LEIGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. The Treasurer has spoken about the strong performance, in the full knowledge of carbon pricing, of the Australian economy. Is there more recent data that supports this?",98
103,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Fraser, because the recent data puts a wrecking ball right through the Leader of the Opposition's aggressively negative campaign talking down our economy. He was saying the price rises would go through the roof, that jobs would be destroyed-well, we have seen 14,000 jobs created in July alone; 100,000 jobs over the past year. We have seen the TD Securities inflation gauge record its lowest annual point in nearly three years. All of these are facts. But we have a Leader of the Opposition who is at war with the facts and with reality. He will say anything and do anything to achieve his political objective, including trying to talk down our economy. And in that he has been joined by the Premier of QueenslandMr Ewen Jones interjecting Opposition Business) (14:26): Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

This was one of the most deeply irresponsible statements that has ever been made by a political leader in this country-and it has been endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition.

What it shows is that he is unfit for high office and not fit to run a $1.5 trillion economy. Carbon Pricing",98
108,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister confirm that the government's own modelling says that at least three million Australian households will be worse off under her carbon tax?,98
109,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the Leader of the Nationals question: we have always said we were providing assistance to nine out of 10 households. As a Labor government, in the provision of assistance, we of course have sought to benefit middleand low-income families. We have sought to benefit people in Australia on fixed incomes, like pensioners; we have sought to benefit those who need that assistance the most. That is what Labor governments do. That is why we have provided a tax cut by tripling the tax-free threshold-because I believe that working Australians who earn less than $80,000 a year should see a benefit, and I believe that part-time working Australians, many of them working women returning after the birth of their children, should see the biggest benefit, and many of them will go from paying tax to paying absolutely no tax at all. Many of them will see themselves $500 or $600 better off. Then, of course, we are concerned about those on lowto middle-income families raising kids. It can obviously be a struggle. That is why we have done things separate to pricing carbon, like the schoolkids bonus and like increasing the amount of money for childcare costs. But, as we have put a price on carbon, we have increased family payments and we are intending to do it again, through the minerals resource rent tax, so those families too can get a share of the resources boom. Then, being the government that provided an historic increase to pensioners who had waited far too long for that increase-and who certainly had not seen it considered by the former government-we determined to provide pensioners with 20 per cent more than the average impact of carbon pricing on them, because we wanted to make them better off.",99

111,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know the circumstances of working Australians, pensioners and people raising kids might be a matter of comedy for the opposition, but for the government it is deadly serious business. We will continue to do everything we can to work with those Australians to ensure that we keep the economy strong, to ensure that we manage it in their interest and to ensure that we work with them on the cost-of-living pressures they face-like the big escalations in electricity prices that the Leader of the Opposition is pretending do not exist, because he is worried about offending his Liberal mates in states around the country.

113,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. The government is relying on the Australian Fisheries Management Authority in the super trawler Margiris matter. But AFMA has admitted that it did not take the Fisheries Administration Act literally when it decided the quota relevant to the vessel, meaning the quota was unlawfully determined and is now invalid. As the Commonwealth Ombudsman is looking into these matters, will the government hold off registering the super trawler until the ombudsman has finalised her inquiries?",99
114,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Denison for his question. The member for Denison is raising with me, effectively, a legal issue about the operation of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. As I am advised, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority has acted in a lawful way. What he is referring to is the work of the advisory committee. It is not the advisory committee that makes the relevant decisions and industry members do not make the relevant decisions; the Australian Fisheries Management Authority does that independently. But perhaps I can say to the member for Denison more broadly that I certainly do understand that there is aMrs Bronwyn Bishop: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister, in answering the question, said she was being asked for a legal opinion. A question that asks for a legal opinion is out of order, and therefore the question remains out of order on the admission of the Prime Minister.",99

121,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was just about to say to the member for Denison that I am well aware of concerns about this vessel, this super trawler, because they have been raised with me by Tasmanian members of the government, and raised with me very clearly. They have heard community concern about this matter, and they have relayed that community concern to me. And I understand that the member for Denison is concerned about the matter too. I would just say to the House that the size of a fishing catch is not determined by the size of the vessel; it is determined by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority on what it believes to be the available science on sustainability of the fishing stock. Having said that, there are issues with vessel size in the sense that the bigger the vessel the more fish it can take from a localised areaand I know that is causing some concerns for the community of Tasmania. Because we have heard those concerns, the fisheries minister, Senator Ludwig, and the parliamentary secretary, the member for Braddon-who is a Tasmanian himselfhave established a special working group to facilitate discussion between the company and interested parties, including recreational fishers. The potential for that localised depletion of fish stocks is one of the areas of discussion and one of the matters under consideration because of these concerns.",100

Prime Minister, it is a fact that the Ombudsman is making inquiries into the conduct of AFMA, as it should. My question, and I would be very grateful-in fact, Tasmania would be grateful-for a direct answer, is: will the government delay making any decision about the registration of the super trawler until the Ombudsman has completed her inquiries?",101
125,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I do understand the concerns; I have heard them loud and clear. But the approach the government is going to take is that we will have this work process: the minister for fishing and the parliamentary secretary-a person from Tasmania who is right in this chamber-will work these issues through. That is the approach we are taking, because we do understand that there are issues for the community in Tasmania and that other Australians are also very concerned about the potential for localised depletion of fish in our oceans. Carbon Pricing",101
126,Ms ROWLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation. Will the minister outline the significant action being taken here and overseas to reduce pollution? Why is it important that the debate around carbon pricing be driven by facts, not fear?",101
127,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:36): I thank the member for Greenway for her question. Last year, acting on the scientific advice, countries around the world, including all the major emitters and including Australia-committed to take on legal obligations from 2020 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions-and of course that is further to the pledges they have made to reduce emissions up to 2020. As part of this mendacious and deceitful campaign that the coalition and the Leader of the Opposition have run, the Leader of the Opposition has been claiming that Australia is somehow acting alone: that we are on our own; the rest of the world is doing nothing; nothing is going on; there are no agreements to cut emissions. In fact, last year the Leader of the Opposition had this to say: 'There is no sign, no sign whatsoever, that the rest of the world is going to do things like introduce carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes.' At the time that statement was made, New Zealand had an emissions trading scheme and more than 20 countries had had emissions trading for six years. The Kyoto Protocol had been place for quite some period of time. But in that context the Leader of the Opposition's take on international affairs is that the US is not a foreign country. It has all the credibility and quality of his foreign policy observations. In this context I was very surprised to read this morning that the member for Flinders, the shadow minister, has in fact committed the coalition to sign up to the international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These are the same agreements that the opposition leader says do not exist-that no-one is committed to. No-one is doing anything! But the fact of the matter is that, try as he might to deny it, many countries are taking action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. All 27 European Union member countries, including the UK under the conservative government, are cutting emissions. China, Korea, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, New Zealand and South Africa, are all introducing moves to carbon pricing arrangements to cut their emissions. Those countries know it is the most efficient way to go about all of this. The coalition knows it, and that is why their campaign is a massive fraud-a complete litany of lies; a completely mendacious campaign.",101

Twelve months ago the Leader of the Opposition said that upon introduction of the carbon price, food prices would go up five per cent. What did we indicate yesterday?

139,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Western Suburbs Leagues Club in my Hinkler electorate, which has just received its July electricity account, showing that carbon tax almost doubled the off-peak power charge, hitting the club with an additional power cost of $7,500 a year. Will the Prime Minister apologise to the club and its treasurer Ray Haylock for promising two years ago, 'There will not be a carbon tax under a government I lead.'",102
140,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Thank you very much. To the member for Hinkler I say that this is a bit like the discussion we had about the Belair Hotel and the claims that were made in this parliament yesterday. The fact, of course, is that that hotel has experienced an increase in its power price of less than 10 per cent, and that is what we predicted as the price impact on power for Australian households. We made predictions through the modelling and those predictions have come true. To the member for Hinkler: I say to himonce again looking at the power price impacts-that we know what the power price impacts are. They are the same as what we said they would be when we announced carbon pricing. And, because of those impacts, we have put more money in people's pockets, including the people who go to the club that he refers to. There is more money through tax cuts. A million Australians are not paying tax any longer, or keeping $18,200 before they pay a cent of tax on a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked whether she would apologise for her broken promise to the members of the Western Suburbs Leagues Club.",103
141,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat.,103
142,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And members of that leagues club would be benefiting from those tax cuts. Members of that leagues club would be benefiting from the family payment increases. Members of that leagues club would be benefiting from the arrangements that we have made for pensioners. We have deliberately calculated the amount of assistance because we wanted to see pensioners come out in front, and so they were given 20 per cent more than the average impact of carbon pricing upon them as it flows through. So, to the member who has raised the question with me, I would say the following. He would acknowledge, I believe, that the government's modelling has accurately predicted the effects we have seen in the community. They are nowhere near the same as the scare campaign that has been run predicted. People in his electorate would have those tax cuts, family payment and pension increases. The member who asked the question, as a member of long standing in this House, would recall that he stood in the 2007 election campaign promising to put a price on carbon, exactly as the Leader of the Opposition did-promising to put a price on carbon.

Of course, the member for Reid will be able to inform his electors that if the member for North Sydney gets his way they will claw back every single cent of the money that the member for Reid made sure they get. This government has introduced a price on carbon and we have done it, as the Prime Minister has indicated today, because we do want to build a strong, clean economy, not just for today but for the future. I want to acknowledge the students from Loyola College in my electorate that are in the gallery today. This is all about making sure that young people, in the future, have the opportunity to live in a clean economy. We are of course also delivering to millions of My other Australians. We have made sure that 6.7 million households receive extra assistance, whether it is pensioners, students, self-funded retirees or other people on low incomes. They are all able to use this money to help with everyday costs, whether for groceries or electricity. One of the other major changes that this government has delivered is to make sure that seven million Australians have received a tax cut. People earning up to $80,000 have received a tax cut from this government. So, six weeks in from the introduction of the carbon price, we see that the sky has in fact not fallen in. Families are still getting every day, making sure their children go to school and going off to work themselves, and they have been getting the extra help from this government. What we know from the Leader of the Opposition is that he has a very, very clear plan to claw this money back from those families and those pensioners. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",104

I refer to the latest electricity bill of the Lakes Resort Hotel in South Australia, which shows that the carbon tax is costing them an additional $3,500 a month-and you think that it is pretty funny.

164,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member for Boothby's question, the member for Boothby yesterday raised an issue about electricity pricing and the Belair Hotel. When that matter was looked at, what was clearly found was the increase in the price paid by the Belair hotel, when they paid their power bill, was less than 10 per cent. That is as the government had predicted. The member for Boothby ought to acknowledge that fact. The member for Boothby is now referring to another business in his electorate. Let me say after yesterday's experience, one would want to check the facts. The member for Boothby is also of long standing in this House. In 2007 when the member for Boothby's sought re-election, he did it on a platform of pricing carbon. The policy up document that he stood on at that election said that the coalition's plan to price carbon would lead to higher fuel and energy costs for households, community facilities and small businesses. Dr Southcott: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question is about a carbon tax bill of $3,500 for the Lakes Resort Hotel and the Prime Minister apologising for what she said five days before the election.",105
165,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am talking about carbon pricing and the facility that the member for Boothby refers to.

He would have seen all of the documents. What of course the coalition did not talk about then, which this government has ensured has occurred, is that households have benefited from tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. We wanted them to have that money because we knew that there would be a flow-through impact of carbon pricing. Talking about electricity, the average assistance is $10.10 per household while the average impact is $3.30. To the member for Boothby, to the Leader of the Opposition, to coalition members opposite, it is about time they actually acknowledged that their plan the past was carbon pricing, their leader has been in favour of carbon pricing and, if were ever in government, they would keep the price on carbon.

For that small proportion of businesses that have been making false and misleading claims, the ACCC has been taking prompt action. So far we have seen enforcement action taken against a gym in Melbourne for using claims about the carbon price to try and lock its customers into long-term contracts.

190,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (15:04): I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He, along with many other members on this side of the House, has campaigned hard for this reform and, as a reformed smoker himself, I know that he has had a particular interest in it. think many people would have been surprised about the enthusiastic response that was received around the world for this measure that Australia is taking as a world leader. I thought the House might be interested to know that organisations like the World Health Organization, along with the US based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the South African health minister, the New Zealand health minister, and reporters from the BBC, CNN, the Bangkok Post and the Pretoria News all have welcomed this decision of the High Court because they see that there is an opportunity for them to follow Australia and introduce harsher tobacco control measures themselves. It is obviously good news for those who have been fighting for many years for this change. I am asked about both the international response and the local response. I fear I do have to report an error that was made yesterday in the House. I need to make an apology to the opposition because I said yesterday that there were some members opposite who welcomed this measure but they were all on the backbench. I have to tell you that following yesterday's decision I received many calls from people on the front-bench and the backbench of the opposition, and they were very welcome. I wanted particularly to share a note with you; I checked that the member for Fairfax was comfortable with me saying this. He sent a lovely note which said that, when he first joined the Public Service nearly 50 years ago, he turned up for his first day of work and presented at the office that issued material for your office. He said: 'I was given three things. I was given an in-tray, I was given an out-tray and I was given an ashtray.' Not many of us can imagine a world where that was the norm for every public servant. I am delighted that there are so many people I across both sides of this House who can see that this is an important change. However, there are three members-the member for Indi, the member for Sturt and the member for Goldstein-whom I have not heard anything from, and I wonder whether this is because each of them has received thousands of dollars in donations from the tobacco companies since this was reported. They have shown no interest in being prepared to support this important public health measure. Donations keep flowing in, and, since we are particularly talking about two-year anniversaries, I thought that people might like to know that today is the two year anniversary of the Leader of the Opposition telling a Q&A audience that he intended to keep on taking those donations for as long as tobacco was legal. NA Carbon Pricing",108
191,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS," I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately: That this House calls on the Prime Minister speak for ten minutes and to apologise for misleading the Australian people five days before the last election when she said ""there will be carbon tax under the government I lead."" Standing orders must be suspended because this is the second anniversary of the big lie.",109
192,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS, The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw.,109
193,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"I withdraw. This is this second anniversary of that massive betrayal, that complete breach of faith with the Australian people. Since then, we have had 731 days of deceit-731 days of deceptionfrom this Prime Minister. We had the Prime Minister in the House today trying to pretend that the carbon tax was not going to do any real harm to anyone-that there would not even be a real increase in the price of power. But if the carbon tax was so harmless, why wasn't she honest enough to be up-front with the Australian people before the last election? That is why standing orders must be suspended. What we have seen in the House today from the Prime Minister is all this talk about what the coalition said in 2007. Has she noticed that we did not win the election in 2007? Has the Prime Minister noticed that the coalition went into the election in 2007 saying 'subject to the world taking similar action'? In fact, what we have had from this government-and this is why standing orders should be suspended-is a double deception. We have had a double betrayal. They went to the 2007 election promising an emissions trading scheme, and they did not deliver it. They went to the 2010 election promising that there would be no carbon tax, and they did deliver it. There has been a double deception from this Prime Minister. The phrase, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' echoes around this chamber and rings around this country-and to doesn't it haunt this Prime Minister! This is a Prime Minister who is too frightened to stay in the chamber and hear the deception that no she uttered mentioned again in this chamber. Every time prices rise in this country, the consumers of this country think 'carbon tax', and every time this Prime Minister makes a statement on any subject at all the voters of this country are reminded of her fundamental betrayal and deception before the last election. We can have all the brazen bluster that this parliament sees so often from the Prime Minister, we can have all the shameless effrontery that this parliament sees from the Prime Minister, but one thing we never hear from this Prime Minister is that little word 'sorry'-the apology that is the least she owes the Australian people after the deception that she practised on them before the last election. She says today, 'If the coalition wins the election, they'll keep the carbon tax.' Then we have the minister for families saying, 'We'll claw it back.' They cannot even get their talking points right. That is how deceptive this government is. Just imagine-and this is why standing orders should be suspended-that the Prime Minister had been honest. Just imagine that the Prime Minister had gone to the Australian people and said straight up-front, five days before the election, 'Yes, there will be a carbon tax under the government I lead.' Does anybody imagine that she would still be the Prime Minister of this country? What this Prime Minister did was say one thing before the election to win votes and then do the opposite in a squalid, shameful deal with the Greens to stay in the Lodge. Shame, Prime Minister, shame! The least you could do is have the guts to sit in this parliament and listen to this debate rather than scurry off yet again to seek refuge in the whip's office as you do time and time again. This is not just a broken promise; this is a fundamental breach of trust. This is not just a failure to deliver on the part of the government; this is a failure to understand. It is proof that the Prime Minister and the government just do not get it. We had the Prime Minister stand up in this parliament in 2006 and say in very simple language, 'Labor is the party of truth-telling.' But it is more, if it ever was-and it certainly cannot be the party of truth-telling as long as this person leads it. As long as the current Prime Minister leads the Labor Party, they can never be the party of truth-telling. We had the Treasurer up there auditioning in the Prime Minister's week off-he was even singing to us about 'this gun's for hire'because he knows that this government is doomed as long as it is led by someone whose very word cannot be trusted by the Australian people. Let's just examine what this Prime Minister did when it came to being truthful about the carbon tax. First of all, she forced the former Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, to abandon his campaign for an emissions trading scheme. We know that the current Prime Minister along with the current Treasurer forced the former Prime Minister to betray his own words and to dump the emissions trading scheme. Then, during the election campaign, the Prime Minister said not only would there not be an emissions trading scheme; there would be a people's convention. Remember that-the people's convention? Nothing at all would happen until this citizens' assembly, this people's convention, had achieved a deep and lasting consensus. Finally, after I had said on at least 15 separate occasions that as sure as night follows day if this government were re-elected there would be a carbon tax, the Treasurer came out and said, 'That's a hysterical allegation,' and that obviously was not enough to persuade the public. So there was the Prime Minister five days before the election, in all her glory, saying: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' This was a cold-blooded, deliberate deception of the Australian people. This is a Prime Minister who has form when it comes to betrayal. She betrayed the not any former Prime Minister over the prime ministership; she betrayed the member for Denison over poker machine reform; she betrayed the member for Scullin over the speakership; and then there was the ultimate betrayal of the Australian people over a carbon tax. This is the deception that haunts this Prime Minister. This is the deception that will haunt her to a political grave. This is the deception that will dog this government to the next election. Make no mistake-the next election will be not only a referendum on the carbon tax; it will also be a referendum on prime ministers who do not tell the truth. When I say, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' I can be believed. On day 1 of an incoming government, the public servants will get their instruction. On day 1 of a new parliament, the legislation to repeal the carbon tax will be introduced. We will keep our commitments. Just because we have a Prime Minister now who does not keep her commitments-who has truth deficit disorder-she should never assume other people are like that. I am different. When I say something, I mean it. I do not sell my soul to minor parties the way this Prime Minister has. (Time expired)",109
194,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS," I second the motion. Standing orders should be suspended and the Prime Minister given 10 minutes to come into the House and apologise to the people of Australia. If she does not and if the Labor Party does not support this motion then they will be confirming that we have the most brazen Prime Minister in Australia's history. This Prime Minister brazenly said before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Having been elected, she brazenly broke that promise in order to grasp at power to get the Greens to support the Labor Party to be in government. She then brazenly said at the time that she was doing just what John Howard had done with the goods and services tax. She brazenly forgot in fact that John Howard took the GST to an election and got a mandate from the Australian people to introduce the goods and services tax. At the time she broke her promise not to introduce a carbon tax, she brazenly said that it was not a tax. It took Laurie Oakes to tease out of her finally, for her finally to admit, that it was in fact what everyone knew it to be-a carbon tax and another broken promise. She brazenly said in question time yesterday that the whole point of the carbon tax was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when in fact she had said on 22 February last year: I want to be very clear with Australians about what pricing carbon does: it has price impacts. is meant to. That is the whole point. So in February last year she was telling the truth about the carbon tax-a nice change. She was at least telling the Australian people that the whole point of the carbon tax was to increase their electricity prices. And aren't we seeing that happen? Brazenly yesterday in question time she said that it was about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Every of day in question time, she uses sophistry of the English language to avoid answering specific questions and she did so again today when asked whether she supported increasing or decreasing electricity prices and whether that was the purpose of the carbon tax. In fact, even the assertion that the whole point of the carbon tax is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is not true, because by 2020 on the government's own modelling greenhouse gas emissions will increase by eight per cent. She also brazenly says that households will be compensatedthat nine out of 10 households will be compensated. What she does not tell people is that three million households in Australia will be worse off. Three million Australian families will struggle even more under costof-living pressures than they already are-on the government's own modelling, on the government's own figures. Worst of all, she says brazenly to the Australian people that if the coalition wins the next election Labor will reject our attempt to repeal the carbon tax. She has already locked the Labor Party into ignoring the will of the Australian people. The next election will be a referendum on the carbon tax and, if the coalition should be fortunate enough to win it, we will immediately introduce legislation to repeal it and the House will sit until it is done. Yet, the Prime Minister has already ruled out the possibility It that Labor will listen to the will of the Australian people. This Prime Minister, leading Labor as she is, is leading a group of Labor MPs who are like docile sheep. Standing orders should be suspended, because the docile sheep of the parliamentary Labor Party are being led by this Prime Minister into the slaughterhouse, abattoir and charnel house that will be the next federal election if they seriously take to the next election this Prime Minister who cannot be trusted and the policy to stop our repeal of the carbon tax. The Australian people simply will not tolerate it. It is time that the parliamentary Labor Party recognised the extraordinary damage that this Prime Minister is doing to the Labor Party brand and the Labor Party tradition and woke up to the fact that none of you can believe anything she says. The Australian people know it. The Australian people have stopped listening. It is time that the Labor Party did the right thing and put the interests of the Australian people first and not the interests of this unworthy Prime Minister.

'I will do anything, anything, The to get this job'-they were the comments, and people know that, and they should know it, because you are an absolute disgrace in the way in which you are wandering around on this issue. You have exactly the same target as the emissions trading scheme pricing arrangements. You have exactly the same target in terms of the 1990 levels by 2020. And you have the audacity to actually say to people that you are going to achieve that target through a much more expensive arrangement than putting a price on carbon-particularly given the history that you have on this issue. John Howard was someone that I had disagreements with from time to time, but at least he recognised that we have to do something about emissions in this world. There are opportunities that exist in regional Australia in terms of the pricing arrangements and the clean energy funds et cetera. I ask the Leader of the Opposition and other members within the chamber to just look at the meat industry in the next few months. Just look at the way in which they are going to address some of these issues. Come back in a few months and tell me if I am wrong. I do not mind that.

226,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I want to remark that today is the last parliamentary sitting day that we will Matthew Franklin appearing in the parliamentary press gallery above us. As many members of parliament would be aware, he has announced that he is taking a redundancy from the Australian and he will file his last story tomorrow. He has worked for News Limited for 25 years in a variety of capacities. He has been in the press gallery for quite a long period of time. I first got know Matthew Franklin when he was working for the Courier-Mail. He took a particular interest in health issues, coming from that Queensland experience, and I at the time was shadow minister for health. Of course, we do not always agree with our friends in the press gallery, but I think we respect that it is a hard job-an increasingly hard job as the media industry changes. It is not an easy time in newspapers, but it is always an important time for people to be out there looking for the stories, looking for the facts, looking the issues that will be in public debate. Matthew Franklin has certainly done more than his fair share of that. NOES He joked with me at one point that he was particularly following our Teach for Australia and Teach Next initiatives because he imagined that perhaps at a later stage of his life he would use something like Teach NA Next or Teach for Australia to move from journalism into teaching. I do not know whether or not that is his plan. I suspect at this stage he does not even know either. But if he was going to move from journalism into an Australian school to teach English or history I think that would be a very welcome addition to our education system. So to Matthew I say a fond farewell.",116
227,Mr ABBOTT,PAIRS," I suppose one good thing to come out of Matthew Franklin's I hope temporary retirement from the Australian is that we finally have the see government saying something nice about a News Limited publication, which is excellent. Matthew Franklin will be much missed from the press gallery, which he has adorned for some 11 years. Prior to coming down to the press gallery in Canberra he was in the press gallery in Brisbane for some nine years. He has brought a grace, a decency, a to balance and a fairness to his reporting of politics, which, I have to say, ought to be an exemplar. The great thing about a good journalist is that a good journalist is the master of analysing an issue quickly and then distilling it succinctly into something that the average person can well understand and appreciate. A good journalist is like a good barrister, only much more affordable, so I am confident that Matthew will not be idle for long, that he will be snapped up by the many people who would love to use the services of someone of for such insight, such gifts of expression and such decency.

240,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," I have received a letter BILLS from the honourable Leader of the Nationals proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The serious price increases now being imposed on Australian consumers and businesses on a daily basis as a result of the Government's failure to honour its commitment not to introduce a carbon tax. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",118
241,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE," Two years ago, the Prime Minister looked down the barrel of a Channel 10 camera and into the eyes of the Australian people and she made an unambiguous and clear promise: There will be no carbon tax under the 2012 government I lead. There was nothing ambiguous about it. There were no nuances. It was a clear, definite promise to the Australian people: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Labor was in electoral trouble at the time. There was a lot of commentary about Labor's proposed carbon tax, and she knew she had to put it to bed if Labor were to have any chance of getting over the line in this election. So she made a clear, unambiguous promise, a key moment in the election campaign: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' And of course, she was not alone in making that commitment. The Treasurer told ABC TV: 'We have made our position very clear: we have ruled it out.' The Treasurer also faithfully promised the Australian people there would be no carbon tax under a government with which he was involved. Indeed, he even ridiculed anybody who would suggest that Labor was likely to do such a thing-and they were the leaders of the Labor Party; they were the people who had the obligation to make a pledge and a commitment to the Australian people about what their policy platforms were. It was abundantly clear. And Labor MPs around the country in 2010 campaigned on that false assertion. I did not hear any one of the members opposite voice dissent-not one. In each of their campaigns, when they were asked, they made it absolutely clear that they would not be supporting a carbon tax. And, I might add, so did all the members on this side of the House. All the members of the government, all the members of the opposition, made commitments that there would be no carbon tax. But, for this Prime Minister, her word was not her bond; it was a betrayal that certainly burnt deep into the mind of every Australian-monumental deceit. Every Labor candidate went to the election promising there would be no carbon tax. But then, only days after the election, came the betrayal. In the hallowed prime ministerial courtyard, flanked by the Greens and Independents and other Labor luminaries, Labor broke its promise to the Australian people and announced we were to get a carbon tax-and not just any carbon tax: the world's biggest carbon tax! And we were going to get it ahead of the rest of the And we were going to do it even if no-one else in the world followed through. Labor broke its promise to the Australian people in a most deceitful and shameful way, and it will hang on the head of every Labor member of parliament and dog this government to its electoral grave. Regardless of what people's political beliefs might be, in a democracy like ours, where we take the electoral process so seriously, we expect our leaders to honour the promises they make. If there is to be trust in this country then elected representatives must say what they mean and mean what they say. So poisonous is the Prime Minister's forked tongue that we hear again about the faceless men coming around looking for somebody to replace her. But the reality is that it does not matter. Labor's legacy and its veracity deficit, its chronic waste and mismanagement, its massive debt and this dysfunctional government make none of those opposite fit to lead this country. There has been treachery and dishonesty. All of that is bad enough, but it is worse when Australian families have to struggle to meet the mounting extra cost-ofliving pressures under a higher Australian dollar and are now forced to meet this extra cost. The government's own modelling says three million Australian families are worse off. And in spite of the compensation that the government may be paying to some, no-one can be compensated for a lost job. No-one can receive adequate compensation for the impact on their lives when a factory closes, when a mine becomes uneconomic or when, because our nation is just so less competitive, we lose whole pieces of our economy. Senator Hanson-Young did not care if whole regional towns closed down. As far as she was concerned, and the government backed her, this carbon tax was world. something that our country was going to have-even though the government had said it would not happen. The news kept coming about what the impact of this carbon tax would be on the local community, and the Labor Party did not care. A hundred councils in May 2009 were told that their emissions would make them liable for Labor's carbon tax. The Hobart City Council will budget an extra $770,000 for the impact of the carbon tax on its budget. The Salvation Army says that the carbon tax will add up to $1.25 million to its annual land-fill bill. There is a $36 carbon tax surcharge on the Spirit of Tasmania journey from Melbourne to Devonport. The Queensland Competition Authority approved a price increase of $52 per household for electricity but said the price would have gone down by $70 had there been no carbon tax. The Department of Climate Change figures show that electricity generators will face a carbon tax bill of $3.9 billion in the first year alone. Anglo American Australia, our second-biggest coal exporter, says the carbon tax reduces the net present value of its assets by 30 per cent. Queensland Rail reports it will add $5 million to its costs, leading to higher rail fares. The biggest abattoir in Australia, at Dinmore, will be slugged $3.3 million. The 14 largest abattoirs will have to pay $60 million to meet the carbon tax requirements. Local government said it will be $200 million more for the cost of garbage. New South Wales Treasury says that public transport fares will rise by $150 year and that electricity bills will go up by $57 a year for students and $100 million a year for hospitals. Queensland's government owned power corporations lost more than $1 billion in write-downs on the value of their assets because of the impact of the carbon tax. And Treasury's modelling of the carbon tax is based on real-wage reductions of 0.8 per cent by 2020. The Australian Trucking Association says the carbon tax will add $500 million to trucking costs from 2014. All of these sorts of things seemingly meant nothing to the government; they went ahead anyhow-$5,000 extra to the cost of an average house of $300,000. The tripling of the fuel excise means that airfares will rise, and some domestic air services will close. None of this means anything to the Labor Party. In fact, in many instances they denied it would even happen-there was not going to be any impact at all. And, if there was a little, they would be providing compensation to help people. Now the bills are starting to come in; people are getting their first bills under the carbon tax. Yesterday we heard about the Belair Hotel in South Australia, in Adelaide, which has faced a 45 per cent jump in the off-peak component of its monthly power bills. Today we heard about the Lakes Resort Hotel. And here is an electricity bill from the Phoenix Hotel, in my own electorate. In the very first month, their emissions and renewable energy charges have gone up by $271.97. These are the kinds of cost increases that every household in this country is facing right now. And that is not the end. Remember, this is just the $23 a tonne on introduction of the carbon tax. It goes up every year. Every year it will be higher. If your bills are not high enough this year, wait until next year; they will be higher again. And what will it be like when we get out to 2050, and the carbon tax is not $23 a tonne but $350 a tonne? What is a that going to do to your household electricity bill? There are no more compensation payments; they are already done. But you should not be surprised by this massive impact on your living standards. The people of Australia should not be surprised that this tax is going to bite so much into their standard of living, because the very intent of this tax-as the Prime Minister has admitted several times over the last couple of days-is to put the cost of living up, to put the cost of electricity up, so that we will use less and therefore emit less CO2. The very purpose of this tax is to hurt people. The very purpose of this tax is to force people not to do the things they have been doing in the past that might emit CO2 into the atmosphere. So the Prime Minister is actually proud that her tax is achieving its intended purposes: putting up the cost of living, making life more miserable for many Australians. That was the very purpose of this tax right from the beginning: to make our cost of living higher so that we keep our car in the shed rather than drive it to visit sick neighbour. Or perhaps we do not go to the football game but watch it on television-although you probably could not put the lights on, or even the TV set, because it would be emitting CO2 gases. The purpose of this tax is to change your behaviour so that there will be less emissions. The Prime Minister deceived the Australian people two years ago. The conventional wisdom, of course, is that she did that to appease the Greens and to cling on to power-that she far preferred to have the favour of the Greens than to be honest with the Australian people. A succession of slippery deals have mired Labor in political intrigue and a quagmire through which every Australian has been dragged. Australia's proud ethos of being fair dinkum with each other has certainly been sullied and stained by this government. Until the people have the chance to have their say and break free of this Labor scourge, there will indeed be a stench about the processes of government in this place. What price integrity? What price honour? What price a Prime Minister's solemn commitment to the people she presumes to lead? Take a look around, Prime Minister: no-one is following, no-one is interested, no-one believes anything you say. Labor MPs hoping for a change for the better under a new leader are a bit like Ingham chickens hoping they will get a better life if there are new managers. The reality is that heads will roll no matter what. What if, in fact, the Prime Minister had stared down the Greens and told the Independents, 'I've listened to what you've got to say, but I made a promise to the Australian people, and I will not break it'? Surely that is the kind of promise you would expect an honourable Prime Minister to make, especially on such a critical issue. You would expect the Prime Minister to faithfully remember her words of only a few days our earlier and to keep her promise to the Australian people. But she did not do it. She preferred to break her word and, as a result, the Australian people continue to suffer the consequences of her decision. And of course that was not the only commitment she blatantly broke in relation to this issue. She promised, for instance, that there would be community consensus before any action. Remember that one? There was going to be community consensus. I have not noticed any community consensus in favour of a carbon tax in my electorate. Then there was that other great initiative: a 150-member citizens' assembly that was going to decide climate change policy. That was a decisive government in action: find 150 people out of the phone book and ring them up and say, 'Come down and decide our climate change policy.' Frankly, that would have been a better outcome than what we have ended up with; 150 people in the phone book would not have voted and would not have commended a Prime Minister for simply breaking her promise. The reality is that this government has been dishonest with the Australian people. It cannot be trusted. Whatever else it may do, this government will be remembered for that dishonesty. And of course the ultimate irony-the ultimate insult-is that this carbon tax will deliver significant economic pain, but for no environmental gain. Even Labor admits that it is not going to make any difference to the climate. Emissions are going to continue to go up. Other countries are not responding to this courageous act of self-harm by the Australian government. They are not responding in that way. This is a lose-lose situation for Australians. Our industry has become less competitive, our cost of living is going up and the environment is not one bit better off. (Time expired)",118
242,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (16:06): I welcome the opportunity to rise today to speak on one more desperate attempt by those opposite to maintain their debunked campaign of fear, their debunked campaign of negativity, their debunked campaign that is crumbling with their crumbling credibility. In fact, it is not crumbling; it has crumbled. And if it had not crumbled before this afternoon, it has crumbled now that we have heard from the member for New England. I hope those opposite listened to what he said the Leader of the Opposition did when he was negotiating for you to form government after the last election. You need to bear in mind that we had, after the last election, a hung parliament in this place. We needed to form a government, as the constitution requires, and all members of this parliament participated in what is called a negotiation. And in that negotiation-as the member for New England has explained; I hope you were all listening-your leader, the man who took the leadership of your party by one vote, was prepared to do anything. He was prepared to do anything, including putting a price on carbon-including introducing a carbon tax. Anything means anything, and it is quite clear to us here-and it should be clear to you-what the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to do. We have rarely seen in Australia's political history a political opportunist character of the present Leader of the Opposition, who ought to be apologising to the Australian people for the deceit. Nearly two years of deceit we have had from him now, where he has raised false claims and made appalling misrepresentations, not just about what happened in that negotiation that he was conducting with the member for New England, but about every single aspect of the price on carbon. This Leader of the Opposition might well have been prepared to agree to put a price on carbon, because he, along with every other living Liberal leader, has supported a price on carbon-has supported an emissions trading scheme. Those opposite who came to the election in 2007 will recall-I know they want to blot it out of their minds-that they supported an emissions trading scheme at the 2007 election. They supported an emissions trading scheme that would by now be in place had John Howard won that election, which of course he did not. That support for an emissions trading scheme continued from those opposite right up to the time when the present Leader of the Opposition, with his campaign of untruths and misrepresentations, become leader at the end of November 2009. And since then this country has had to endure rubbish, day after day. We have had to endure nonsensical statements made about climate science and nonsensical statements made about the effect of an emissions trading scheme that is recognised by economists around the world-by the OECD, the IMF and the 32 countries in western Europe-as the leastcost, most effective means to reduce carbon pollution. Those opposite who have any economic literacy-there are not very many of themknow that the right way to go is to put a price on carbon and to have a range of of the complementary programs. That was the position that the Liberal Party of Australia had in 2007. It remained the position of the Liberal Party of Australia right through to the end of November. It will again be the position of the Liberal Party of Australia, because countries around the world-most notably countries to whom we are very culturally close, like New Zealand or the United Kingdom; part of the Anglosphere that the Leader of the Opposition likes to speak of-have reached a bipartisan agreement on emissions trading. The result of them reaching that bipartisan agreement on emissions trading is that, rightly, it has become a third or fourth order issue, because it is just part of the economic machinery of their countries that has put their countries the trajectory of lowering carbon pollution, which is where we need to go. This Leader of the Opposition has wasted years of Australian political debate on putting forward false claims about the effect of pricing carbon-the effect of this mechanism and the scheme that we announced we were going to introduce on 10 July last year-which we have now legislated for and which came into force, I am very pleased to say, on 1 July. What have we seen since 1 July? We have not seen the wrecking ball going through the Australian economy, as was threatened by the Leader of the Opposition, who probably wishes that there was a wrecking ball. Indeed, we have seen their desperation-we have seen it just now from the Leader of the Nationals-to see price rises. Those opposite are desperate to see economic damage so as to make good the false claims that they have been making now for nearly two years. And they are not going to see them. That is why we published the most detailed economic modelling that the Treasury of our country has ever undertaken. We published that, in conjunction with the details of the scheme, in July last year. That economic modelling showed extraordinary clarity the predicted for electricity, the predicted price rices for gas and the predicted price rises for food and other items in the economy. Now that we have had the carbon price in place, as of 1 July, those predictions have come to pass. We have seen electricity price increases, as predicted, in the order of 10 per centexcept in Tasmania, where they are considerably lower. We have seen gas price rises of about eight per cent, as predicted, and, most importantly, we have seen a rise in the cost of living of less than one cent in the dollar. The prediction by Treasury was 0.7 per cent, and so far, six weeks in, much to on the regret of those opposite, there is nothing that suggests that the modelled outcomes of the carbon price are anything other than accurate. We have the Leader of the Opposition wanting to say that the carbon price would be like a cobra strike. When that tag failed to stick-when he realised that that was going to be nonsense because there was not going to be anything happening-he wanted to say that it was something you cannot really see. He wanted to call it a 'python squeeze'. That is yet another untrue claim. That is the problem that the opposition has: month by month it is going to be seen that these endless claims that they have made, since the Leader of the Opposition became leader at the end of November 2009, are false. They are false; they will not be borne out by what is going to happen in the Australian economy. They are not being borne out now. That is why I will request-I will repeat this request although I have little hope that the Leader of the Opposition is going to meet this request-that the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues, including the member for Flinders, make the Australian people an apology, quite a big apology, for the misleading claims and for scaring people, with particularly needy and vulnerable people in price rises the community. They have been going around and saying, for example, that the carbon price would hurt older people. The fact is, pensioners and self-funded retirees will get an increase in support each year under the government's household assistance package, and that is assistance that this Leader of the Opposition and those opposite would rip away by cutting family payments and pensions if they got elected. We have had the Leader of the Opposition saying that there would be no compensation for small business. In fact, small businesses will benefit from a $6½ thousand instant asset tax write-off, which they will be able to make multiple times, as well as from a $40 million energy efficiency program. Again, that is a benefit for small business that this Leader of the Opposition opposes. He opposes this ability for small business to claim $6½ thousand instant asset tax writeoffs. Here is another good one. The Leader of the Opposition said: We won't be able to get on a bus or a train, ultimately to drive our cars, without being impacted by this tax. I can hardly read it out with a straight face because it is so laughable. I will repeat the facts for what feels like the umpteenth time: there is no carbon price on fuel used by household cars or light commercial vehicles. I do not know what cannot be understood about that. I will repeat it for the benefit of those opposite: there is no carbon price on fuel used by household cars or light commercial vehicles, and buses using less polluting fuels, LPG, LNG and biofuels, will not face a carbon price. We have had similar claims in the transport area about farms. The Leader of the Opposition has said: 'Every farm uses fuel for its trucks and all of that is going to by'-the-'carbon tax.' I will just state some facts for the member for Flinders. Farmers will not pay a cent.",122

It is an apology that is needed because deceiving farmers, deceiving older people and deceiving needy and vulnerable people in our community warrants an apology-the claims have been shown to be false. These claims have gone on and on. We had 12 months ago, and he has repeated this several times, the Leader of the Opposition be hit saying that the carbon price would send grocery prices up five per cent. That is linked to this other claim that we get that it is to go up and up and up. Get this: last month a report by TD Securities, Melbourne Institute, found that food prices were unaffected-not much to not understand about that-by the carbon price. We have members opposite bleating about electricity prices now. The Leader of the Opposition and those opposite wanted to say that the carbon price would lead to massive increases in power prices. We have heard that language, and that is because the opposition, particularly the member for Parkes, who has been misleading the farmers in his electorate about thisMr Coulton interjecting",124
252,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"I will come; I am very happy to go to Parkes. I have been everywhere in the country explaining the misrepresentations made by those opposite. The opposition hope to blame all electricity price rises on the carbon price, knowing that that is not true. It is true that the average electricity bill went up by approximately 50 per cent in the last four years. There has been a massive increase in electricity costs in our country, but it has been caused by other things. It has not been caused by the carbon price and it could not have been caused by the carbon price because the carbon price only came in on 1 July. As the Prime Minister has said, the most important driver of rising electricity prices is investment in network infrastructure, not the carbon price. I will repeat a few more facts. Without taking into account the modest impact of carbon pricing, electricity prices in New South Wales have increased by almost 70 per cent since 2008, while they have increased by over 60 per cent in South Australia and Western Australia. In New South Wales the O'Farrell government is taking 60 per cent larger dividends than did the previous state government. I am not for a moment going suggesting that there were not dividends taken by the previous Labor state government in New South Wales, but the present O'Farrell government, the Liberal government in New South Wales, is taking 60 per cent larger dividends. This government is also taking $587 million in tax equivalent payments from the same businesses, bringing the total money grab of Premier O'Farrell to around $570 for every household in New South Wales. The Leader of the Opposition does put great faith in the unique brand of economics practised by the shadow Treasurer, 'Hockeynomics'-perhaps even more aptly described as 'sloppynomics'-but even he would understand that $570 is larger than zero dollars and represents a massive gouge on the people of New South Wales. (Time expired)",125
253,Mr HUNT,IMPORTANCE," The real question is not whether the Prime Minister breached her word, breached her pledge, breached that which she took to the Australian people not just five days before but the day before the last election, but why she felt she had to make the pledge of no carbon tax under a government she leads in the first place. Today is the second anniversary of the Prime Minister's infamous pledge that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. But why did she feel she had to make that pledge? It is very simple: the reason is that she knew if she were honest with the Australian people they would not have given the Labor Party the votes they needed to form a government. As it was, it was a borderline decision. If this election past had been framed in terms of the carbon tax, as was the debate, as was the context of coalition statements, advertisements and literature making it absolutely clear that a carbon tax was coming, they would have lost. So the Prime Minister deliberately, explicitly, intentionally stated that there would be no carbon tax. It was a direct clear statement made not just once five days before the election but also the day before the election with the statement 'I rule out a carbon tax'. These were two clear statements but there were two more from the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, who famously said that the idea of a carbon tax was 'hysterical' under Labor. Unfortunately, the Australian people are not laughing. But then there were 13 more statements that there would be no carbon price of any form, at any time until such a moment that there was a community consensus-as demonstrated through the citizens' assembly. That was what they took to the election. Today we heard a defence that Labor did not really win the election; they had to negotiate. We heard the member for New England make it clear there was negotiation-except for the fact that the Greens had run up the white flag at 8 pm on election night when the incoming member for Melbourne said that he was going to vote for the ALP. There was no debate. There was no negotiation. There was no question. They had the vote in the bag from 8 pm on election night. So the idea that somehow there had to be, in order to win the Greens support, a surrender of a fundamental pledge of the central issue of the last fortnight of the campaign is simply historic rewriting on a grand scale. It is back to year zero because that is all we see from this government time and time again: a denial of history, a denial of the past because they are, frankly, ashamed of the past. What we see now is, again, two years later, they do not believe that they made the promise. They do not acknowledge that they had the vote in the bag. What occurred after the election was simply the fulfilment of what was always the Prime Minister's intention: to take one thing to the election and to do another thing afterwards. The negotiation with the Greens, which had already been concluded at 8 pm on election night, was merely a front. The Prime Minister expressly, deliberately, consciously pledged one thing before the election and did another thing afterwards. The Australian people will never forget and they certainly will not forgive come election time in some short period from now. Beyond the deception is the consequence. The consequence can be described in two words: higher prices. If you really want to make it specific: higher prices for electricity. Let us go through the reality of what this famously carbon tax means. Let us start with the government's notion that there will be a 10 per cent price rise. Well, guess what? There has been a rise. Their 10 per cent price rise, on which they were congratulating themselves, was meant to occur over five years. It happened in one day. They seem to forget that next year the carbon tax goes up and the year after it goes from $24 to $25. Then, on their own modelling, it heads north to $37 by 2020 and thence to $350 by 2050. So the carbon tax is an electricity price escalator each year, every year, forever. That is its design. That is its intention. Indeed, to paraphrase the Prime Minister, that is the whole point of the carbon tax-to increase electricity prices. What exactly are those price rises? We see in Queensland, where the Premier froze many of the state electricity price impacts, it is between 80 and 100 per cent of electricity price rises. In Queensland, we have price rises up to 13 per cent of which the carbon tax is 11 per cent. In Victoria, 11 per cent out of 15 per cent price rises are attributed to the carbon tax. In Western Australia, it is nine out of 12 per cent. In the Northern Territory, it is a similar figure. In the ACT, in some cases, up to 80 per cent of the price rise in electricity for this coming year is precisely because of the carbon tax. Then we see that in New South Wales the regulator approved of the fact that Integral Energy's price would include an 85 per cent lift because of the carbon tax. In Western Sydney the average component of carbon tax in electricity price rises is 80 per cent. So when you look at your electricity bill and see the price rises this year, no matter where you are in Australia, blame the Prime Minister. The government says we have had price rises in the past. Absolutely-that is the point and that is the problem. These electricity price rises have not brought about some dramatic change in Australian consumption. What we have seen are massive price rises and then you add an escalator for each year on top of that based on a broken promise. And it congratulates itself? Honestly, somewhere between hubris and chutzpah, this government is going to have to take a look at itself in the mirror. It is not just electricity. It is also refrigeration. The Prime Minister tried to say that there was already a refrigerant charge and there was. Let me give you some examples. It has increased slightly. HFC134a has gone from 17c a kilogram to $30.07 a kilogram-a 175-fold increase. That means it is over $30,000 a tonne now under their budgeting. But it is a whole lot worse. PFC5114 has gone from 17c a kilogram to $170 a kilogram or $170,000 per tonne, a more than 1,000-fold increase in the government levy. By the way, these are not our figures. These are from the government's own synthetic greenhouse gas website calculator. Probably the best-known of the gases, R404a, has gone from 17c a kilogram to $75 a kilogram with government levies, which is a 441-fold increase. That, by the way, is a $75,000 charge per tonne of gas. These price rises flow through to butchers, they flow through to cold-store owners and they flow through to trucking operators who carry goods through refrigerated trucking. Anybody involved in refrigeration in Australia is going to have to pay the price of the Prime Minister's betrayal. Debate interrupted. NA",125
254,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Petition: Public Holidays",127
255,Mr SYMON,ADJOURNMENT," Today I would like to present a petition, by 50 petitioners, that I have received and taken to the Standing Committee on Petitions. It has been found to be in order. The petitioners are requesting that the National Employment Standards in the Fair Work Act be amended to provide an additional public holiday rather than a substitute day whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day falls on a Saturday or a Sunday. I spoke about this issue in this place in June last year. It is a particular issue for Victoria and I understand it is also an issue in South Australia and Tasmania, where additional days are not necessarily granted for Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day when they fall on a Saturday or a Sunday. There are differences between the states. There is a bigger issue these days than there used to be because shops are open a lot longer, and many days that were never considered to be trading days in years gone by are now considered to be open slather. I think that everyone deserves to at least have the major public holidays of the year off and, if they do have to work them, that they not only be compensated for the public holiday they work but actually get the time-the time to spend with their family and friends, their loved ones. Many people who work in essential services have had to work these days for years, but quite often their awards or their workplace agreements have contained provisions which have allowed them to have that time. In Victoria we now have a problem with Easter Sunday as well. Easter Sunday is not a public holiday in Victoria but Easter Sunday shop trading has now been legislated for in Victoria by the Baillieu Liberal government, meaning that it can be impossible for someone who works in retail to have a long weekend at Easter. Even though the days surrounding that day are considered to be public holidays, Easter Sunday is not. Whilst that was never a problem when shops legislated against trading on the day, it is now a very big problem for those workers in that industry as legislation allows shops to trade on that day. There is a great deal of history with regard to public holidays in Victoria. have looked at over a number of years. Some of the issues that remain, despite the National Employment Standards, do so for the very reason that, although the state government ceded its industrial relations power to the Commonwealth government back in the years of the state Kennett Liberal government, it kept some parts of those powers, including for public holidays. So, although most of the remainder of the workplace relations system was sent over to the Commonwealth, parts were kept and those parts now directly impact on people who live not only in my electorate of Deakin but right across the state of Victoria. This petition, which has been presented to the petitions committee, means that the issue is still live. It is still most important to so many working people. It is an issue of receiving compensation not only for the day but also for the time. I would hope that many people in this place would recognise that time is the hardest thing to get-time to spend with your family or the people that you want to be with whilst having a short break from work. This petition has been presented by other members right across Australia for different reasons in different states. It is interesting to note that states such as New South Wales and Queensland have both legislated, with cross-party support, for additional public holidays when those days fall on the weekend. In New South Wales in 2010, support from both sides saw that Easter Sunday was declared a public holiday. To me that just means that the other states need to catch up. Whether it is done by state legislation or by a change to the National Employment Standards to ensure that everyone gets that opportunity, it is a great benefit to working people that that comes about. On that note, I present the petition to It is a subject. I the House. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that:  Weekend and shift workers are disadvantaged whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day falls on a weekend and the public holiday substitutes (is moved) to the following Monday or Tuesday.  When substitution occurs workers rostered to work on the actual special day falling on the weekend don't receive a public holiday whilst workers rostered to work on the substitute day do.  This is unfair to weekend and shift workers.  Some States have legislated for Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day to be public holidays when they fall on a weekend plus provide an additional public holiday on the following Monday. or Tuesday.  Weekend and shift workers are also disadvantaged because Good Friday, Easter Saturday (in most states) and Easter Monday are public holidays but Easter Sunday (except in NSW) is not. (The NSW Parliament unanimously legislated for Easter Sunday to be a public holiday.)  This is unfair to weekend and shift workers.  Parliament should legislate a uniform standard across Australia. We therefore ask the House to: Amend the National Employment Standards in the Fair Work Act to include: 1. An additional public holiday (not a substitute day) on the following Monday and/or Tuesday whenever Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day fall on a weekend. 2. Easter Sunday as a public holiday. from 50 citizens Petition received. Northern Territory Election Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (16:35): It is now only nine days till Territorians go to the polls. I am a proud member of the Country Liberals, a party with strong Northern Territory roots, a history-making party that held government for 27 consecutive yearsan achievement unequalled by any government in this nation. The Country Liberals proudly invited my leader-the federal opposition leader, Tony Abbott-to Darwin recently. Unlike Territory Labor, we are not frightened of having our federal leader visit the Territory. This is in stark contrast to the 'united Henderson team', formerly known as Territory Labor, who have not invited their federal leader, Prime Minister Julia Gillard, to the Territory. They have told her to stay away. Her brand is toxic, just like her carbon tax. The united Henderson team, or Hendo's team, formerly known as Territory Labor, are so embarrassed by Labor's branding they have removed it all together. They have changed the colours. They have removed the words 'Labor' and 'ALP' from all of their campaign material. It is like Territory Labor disappeared overnight and became the united Henderson team. Labor's Chief Minister, Paul Henderson, has abandoned his Labor heritage and he will abandon the people of the Northern Territory. He cannot be trusted. The Territory has had 11 years of hard Labor, during which time tourism numbers have sunk to their lowest ever. Housing is unaffordable, our cost of living has skyrocketed and families cannot afford to buy a home. Crime is up. People do not feel safe. Law and order is at its worse. People are leaving the Territory in droves. Territorians have suffered too much and cannot cope under Territory Labor any longer. Now is the time for change. The Territory needs a new direction and a fresh start. The Country Liberals are the right party for government in the Northern Territory. Unlike Territory Labor, a Country Liberals government will stand up for Territorians. Led by my good friend and leader of the Northern Territory opposition Terry Mills MLA, the Country Liberals have a five-point plan to secure a better future for the Territory. The plan involves cutting Labor's waste and reducing debt, strengthening law and order, growing a three-hub economy, better planning for the future for the Northern Territory and-most importantly-being accountable to Territorians. A Country Liberals government is committed to improving access to health services with a new cardiac unit at Royal Darwin Hospital, a fully equipped hospital for Palmerston and better access to elective surgery in Territory hospitals. We all know that Labor is soft on crime, so the Country Liberals will tackle crime at its roots. It will do this by delivering 120 new police on the beat in its first term, taking drunks off our streets and sending them to rehab, sending young offenders to boot camps and-this is close to my heartintroducing one-punch homicide legislation. It is important that Territorians know the Country Liberals are opposed to Labor's toxic carbon tax, which has a significant impact on Territorians and which Paul Henderson and Territory Labor support. A vote for the united Henderson Labor team, aka Territory Labor, is a vote for the carbon tax and a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Julia Gillard-the same Prime Minister who two years ago today said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Paul Henderson, leader of the united Henderson Labor team and Territory Labor, not only supports the carbon tax but also hides from the truth. We have seen in the last couple of days that Paul Henderson would rather send journalists than criminals to boot camp and would rather threaten journalists than threaten criminals. It is clear that Territory Labor, the united Henderson Labor team, has nothing in the tank but deception and censoring of the media. This is one of the fundamental differences between Labor and the Country Liberals. A vote for the united Henderson team is a vote for a Labor wolf disguised in sheep's clothing. Territory Labor supports the toxic carbon tax; I urge Territorians to vote for change by supporting Terry Mills and the Country Liberals team on 25 August. Eleven years on, it is time for this tired, desperate, incompetent Henderson Labor government to go. Youth Suicide",127
256,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to thank everyone who attended a summit on youth suicide which I hosted on Saturday 11 August, 2012 and which was held at the City of Casey council chambers. It was attended by well over 200 people. This summit, which I am pleased to say has been extensively covered by local newspapers led by the Star News Group, was about our youth. It was about giving them a voice to allow them in a that community setting to talk about the challenges they have been facing in our community. It was also about those who had lost loved ones and friends and how we can as a community work together to address the issue of youth suicide and to create awareness of the preventative measures, community awareness and resources that are available to save the lives of young people in our community. The summit came about because some of our young people were approaching me and wanting to tell their stories; it was progressed as a consequence of further discussions with many of the excellent service providers we have in the region in education, mental health and community services. Our first discussion about youth suicide occurred during a meeting in my office in December last year. We met a group of young staff workers who were there on condition of anonymity to talk about the death of a young co-worker and to relate how it happened. From that conversation it was quite clear to me that there was intense anger and a fear of openly talking about what had happened. But they wanted to make sure that I had heard their story, even if it meant meeting in secret. We met again to talk over this issue earlier this year. It was clear they wanted a few solid outcomes: first, for their story be told and, second, for the community to become more engaged. They felt silenced by the community and by their workplace. At roughly the same time, I met some young people: the youth ambassadors from the city of Casey. These city of Casey study tour leaders spoke openly about the challenges and pressures they face. I have always valued the frankness of the feedback I receive from these discussions, and I thank the City of Casey for the program which enables this interaction between our young people and political representatives. At these roundtables I have been fortunate over a number of years to engage with young people in our community to talk about the issues they are dealing with in their lives how they are handling them. Issues mentioned range from school bullying to the immense pressure of being required to define, when they are as young as 16 or 17, who they will be as adults. What has emerged in the past twelve months from many of these conversations is an incredibly serious issue. The young people talked about peers and friends committing self-harm and suicide. This understandably has caused these young people intense distress. But they wanted an engaged community discussion-an informed discussion-about what had been occurring even until recently and what needed to be done to prevent their friends and loved ones from taking their own lives. When I determined to host this summit and my intention became public, what struck me was the number of people who came forward who had been touched by youth suicide and who related story after story of their own loss or the loss suffered by someone they knew and expressed their intense frustration that they were not able to talk publicly about what had happened. They felt confronted by a wall of silence in the community, which was not giving them permission to discuss their loss. But many wanted the opportunity and wanted awareness in the community about youth suicide. It was also of incredibly deep concern to me that young people feel that they have to shoulder the burden of support to those contemplating self-harm and those who have lost loved ones and friends. I am concerned that the understandable silence that surrounds the issue of youth suicide creates a belief that we as a community do not want to hear from young people or to provide support. That results in our young people feeling too ashamed, too guilty and too and stigmatised to put up their hand and ask for help. That belief quite clearly is not correct, but we must do whatever we can do address and correct it. One thing that I am increasingly aware of-and the young people who read or listen to this speech must be aware of it too-is the deep concern on the part of schools, parents, community leaders and service providers about our young people's well-being. I was extremely pleased to be joined at the summit by Professor Patrick MCGorry, a pioneer in the field of adolescent mental health who was Australian of the Year in 2010 and is the Executive Director of Orygen Youth Health. At the summit, Patrick MCGorry made it clear that 'suicide is preventable, but to solve the problem we must first talk about it'. He continued: Unlike the road toll, which has reduced by one third to 1,600 deaths a year and continues to decline, suicide remains a taboo subject and is sidelined in social policy. Our lack of conversation around the topic has only endorsed the silence that surrounds our young people, who often feel too ashamed, too guilty and too stigmatised to put up their hand and ask for help. By asking a young person about these feelings we give them permission to talk and, in most cases, they will feel relieved and better able to deal with the issue. I am proud of the young people in my electorate and I was very proud to host this summit. I believe it will lead to further discussions to prevent a tragedy that has been occurring on our doorstep for some period of time. Murray-Darling Basin  Opposition Business) (16:45): Just briefly, before I talk about the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, I might just endorse the comments of the member for Holt. What the member for Holt might not know is that, when I was fortunate to be responsible for mental health in the Howard government, I appointed Pat MCGorry as the first head of headspace, the youth mental health initiative, because of his work with Orygen Youth Health. Of course, after he had finished with headspace, he went on to be Australian of the Year for his work on mental health. He is a great Australian, and it is an issue that we do need to take terribly seriously in this parliament. The Murray-Darling Basin is an issue that I have been passionate about for all the period I have been in parliament. In 2001 I was one of the very first people to call for a national control of the Murray-Darling Basin. At the time, most political commentators and other politicians, even my own colleagues, said that there would never be national control of the Murray-Darling Basin and that I was flogging a dead horse, so to speak. However, it has to be said that 11, almost 12, years later there is universal support for the need for a national approach to the Murray-Darling Basin-a basin that covers four states. It has an enormous impact on our economy, on communities of people along the Murray and in the Murray-Darling Basin in general, on jobs and on the environment. In June 2011, through the Australian Conservation Foundation, I and all other South Australian members of parliament signed a pledge which said: Too much water has been taken out of the Murray-Darling for too long. The chronic overuse of water has dangerously degraded South Australia's Coorong and Lower Lakes and many other internationally important wetlands and made many communities suffer. of Strong leadership from Australia's political leaders can deliver a Murray-Darling Basin Plan that restores the environment, provides certainty for regional communities and creates jobs. I pledge my support for a Murray-Darling Basin Plan that ends the overuse of water and returns enough flow to the Murray darling to restore its health. I am happy to reiterate that pledge today in this parliament. I say about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan that the Murray-Darling Authority has come up with that it is now the job of the current federal Labor government to get the state governments to agree to this Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It is not the job of the opposition to do that, but it is the job of Tony Burke, the minister for the environment, to do just that. The portents are not good. In my own state of South Australia, Premier Jay Wetherill is trying to show that he is not the weak reed that he has been accused of being in so many areas of policy by pretending that he is tough on the Murray-Darling Basin and South Australia's interests. No one knows more about South Australia's interests than the farmers along the Murray in South Australia, from the border right through to the mouth of the Murray. I am pleased to have the member for Barker in the chamber tonight because he represents almost that entire area, along with the member for Mayo, Jamie Briggs. Both those members know the enormous contribution that irrigators along the Murray have made to investment in good irrigation, good management and good environmental outcomes for not just the last few years, not even the period of the Howard government, but right back to 1970 when South Australia signed the cap agreement on extractions from the Murray-Darling Basin. One of the great failures in the management of the Murray-Darling and the government's plan is that it does not reward and does not take account the extraordinary investment that Riverland farmers and other farmers have made right along the Murray in South Australia over a period of over 40 years, where they have ensured that they are the best irrigators in the country. It would be a travesty if this plan did not reward the good investments and the good work, that has been done by South Australian irrigators for both the environment and the economy in my state. When decisions are being made about investments, water-saving measures and infrastructure along the whole Murray-Darling Basin, it would be wrong if South Australians did not get the full measure of the reward that they should get for the investment that they have made. In planning their response, I hope they take that into account. (Time expired) Sustainability Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (16:50): At lunchtime I was one of a number of MPs from both sides of the parliament who took up Dick Smith's invitation to MPs and senators to support his view that perpetual growth in the use of resources and energy is not sustainable in a finite world. want to take this opportunity to set out why I arrangement. think he is right and why I was, and am, pleased to be associated with him. Our obsession with economic growth, using GDP as a performance indicator, sucks us into a number of traps, most notably inevitably luring us into policies to promote population growth. It is a quick and easy way to boost the GDP number. Of course, it is dodgy. If more people come to live in your street, an economist will do the sums and say your street is wealthier. However, it does make you any better off. Indeed, population growth makes people's lives harder. There is more competition for jobs, more competition into for housing, more competition for space on the roads and a spot on the bus et cetera. It brings with it rising costs of living, more people out of work, traffic congestion, declining housing affordability and environmental damage. Joseph Stiglitz and his fellow Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen said in 2009 that the shortcomings of GDP as a measurement were one of the causes of the global financial crisis. The deficiencies helped portray the US economy and the global economy as being in better shape than they actually were before the credit crisis hit. Stiglitz said: In a performance oriented society, what you measure affects what you do. If you have the wrong measures, you can wind up doing the wrong thing. GDP does not take into account anything where money is not involved. Accordingly, it does not say anything about the contribution made by households or community volunteers. This leads to transparent anomalies. If we paid our neighbours to do our housework and they paid us to do theirs, the GDP would boom and politicians and economists would be delighted. It is hard to see, however, precisely how we I would all be better off under such an More seriously, a whole realm of essential work caring for our children and caring for our older people goes uncounted. But just because this work does not have a dollar value does not mean it has no value at all. On the contrary, it is and always has been an essential part of the richness of our society. If you take out the volunteer work, the community work and the work we do maintaining our houses, our society would not soon fall over. Moreover, it can hardly be right that work such as child care or housekeeping has value if money changes hands but no value if it does not. I believe we should ditch GDP as a key performance indicator. We certainly need to continue to have measures of economic performance, but we need to give equal billing to environmental indicators, health indicators, education indicators and social justice indicators. We should treat GDP and economic growth as a by-product, not as an objective. The important economic indicators are employment, inflation, interest rates and a balanced budget. These things really do matter. We want full employment or as close to it as we can possibly get. We want low inflation, keeping prices as stable as we possibly can. We want low interest rates; we do not want people in debt and going broke. And we want balanced budgets; we do not want countries in debt and going broke. Full employment, low inflation, low interest rates and balanced budgets-these are the important economic indicators. There are, of course, many possible different environmental indicators of performance, but I think that some need special attention. The first is stopping the decline in the number of birds, plants and animals and stopping the habitat destruction, which is the biggest driver of this. The second is cutting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, preferably globally by 60 per cent over the next 40 years, to head off dangerous climate change. And, because of the numerous adverse environmental impacts of population growth, the third important indicator is how countries are going in stabilising their populations. We need health indicators such as life expectancy and how our rates of obesity and diabetes are moving. We need education indicators such as English literacy standards and post-secondary education outcomes. And we need social justice indicators. What is happening to the gap between rich and poor? What about fairness in the workplace? How are we treating our students, our older people, our people with a disability and our Indigenous people? These are the things that really matter. These are the things that we should be putting real effort into measuring, and even more effort into achieving. Gippsland Electorate: Sale Specialist School",130
257,Mr CHESTER,ADJOURNMENT," I appreciate the opportunity to bring to the attention of the House the appalling conditions which are currently being endured by students, staff and parents associated with the Sale Specialist School. The Sale Specialist School is in desperate need of a new site and a purpose-built facility to meet both current needs and future expansion opportunities for students with special needs in my community. The students at the Sale Specialist School are enduring the worse conditions of any school in my electorate. I challenge others in this place to find worse conditions anywhere in Australia for students with special needs. When the school was built, it was to cater for 15 students; there are now 77 students studying across the two campuses, one of them being a temporary campus. The classrooms are small, cramped and inadequate, and they would not be tolerated by any mainstream school. I have had the chance to visit the school twice this year and meet with parents, teachers and the students themselves. I must say I am appalled by the conditions that the students are enduring. There is no therapy room for speech or physio work or specialist allied health services; they are all conducted in the corner of a storage room at the moment. Outside playtime for the students has to be rostered because not all the students can fit in the playground at the same time. The situation is worse for the middle year students, who have been moved to a temporary site. The previous Labor state government promised the school that they would be at the temporary site for three to five years. Well, it has been five years and we still have not secured any land to build a new facility. This temporary facility is really a collection of old portable buildings on the back of the Sale High School. These are old portable buildings which other schools have discarded, and they have been cobbled together in something that we are referring to as a temporary campus for these students. While most other schools have a school gymnasium, the Sale Specialist School kids have a shipping container in which to store their sporting equipment; and on days of inclement weather there is no area for them to play anyway because there has been no landscaping on the grounds around the temporary facility. This school community has been patient for too long. They have been waiting their turn for funding for many, many years now. They were failed by the previous state Labor government, which promised to secure some land for the Sale Specialist School. That never came to fruition. Unfortunately, under the Building the Education Revolution program, this school was failed again by the federal government-because they did not have any land available for expansion, they missed out on their money. Their share of BER funding was about $800,000-that money was absorbed into other schools in the Gippsland region. So the Sale Specialist School has missed out twice, and has no reason to trust either state or federal governments when you see the conditions the students are enduring at the moment. I despair that we have got ourselves into a position where we have 77 students in a facility which does not even meet the basic needs of students with disabilities in any way, shape or form. I also despair because, across my electorate, under the BER program we got a lot of new halls, basketball stadiums and everything else, but we have this school with the greatest needs and it got nothing at all. That, I think, is the greatest failing of the BER: it did not actually address needs; it was a one-size-fits-all approach. That has been very disappointing for the parents and staff associated with the Sale Specialist School. On a slightly positive note, I can report to the House that the local state member, Peter Ryan, who is the Deputy Premier of Victoria, and I have met with a delegation from the school. In conjunction with some local real estate people, Peter has taken steps to locate a potential site for a new development. I would hope that the acquisition of the land is not that far away at all. We will then have something to move forward with so the community can lobby both state and federal governments to get on with the job of actually providing these kids, staff and their parents with the type of facility they deserve-particularly because in the 21st century we know much more about the educational needs of kids with disabilities. It could be that in the next six months we will have to turn away some new enrolments from the Sale Specialist School because we cannot cope with current demand. That would be a tragedy for those students and their parents. In closing, I echo the words of the Principal of the Sale Specialist School, Shelagh Donegan. She wrote to me and said, 'It is a disgrace that we have reached this stage without intervention.' I can only say in this place here this evening that I stand ready to work with the school community and the state government-and the federal minister if at all possible-in partnership with the local community to make sure this project is a priority in the future. We need to secure the land and get on with the design work and actually get these kids into a decent facility because the students at the school have waited too long. Gwyther, Mr Barry",134
258,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Today is Barry Gwyther's last day as the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms. He will retire from his position tomorrow, which I am very sad to see. We all know that Barry is not one to seek the limelight, and that is why I am doing this now when he is in the chamber. It would be remiss of me not to thank Barry on behalf of all members of the parliament for his important and very long contribution to the parliament. Barry joined the department in October 1998 after a 27year career in the Army-one need only look at Barry's shoes to be aware of that! He has been a highly valued member of the Serjeant-at-Arms' office, providing wonderful support and service to members and departmental colleagues. He is very highly respected by all who have worked with him-I agree entirely with that. Thank you, Barry. We wish you all the very best for the future.

Rather than data, they listen to extremist organisations from the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill support. This bill essentially does two comprehensive electronic monitoring of fisheries is that it offers the potential (a) for better for decreased costs for the fisheries community. It is because of the cost of observers who will passed through to individual fishers. That an observer, we can, in relatively short order, in the e-monitoring capability. Therefore there medium term at the very least and certainly in thing. So we have better, faster information and which should be good for fishers. The second thing the bill does is to give under certain circumstances. That is a good thing. of individual fishers. I have dealt with AFMA Remo over a number of years. There have been say that I think there has been a great degree circumstances on the ground. In particular, the fishing community at San Remo and occasions it has been a little bit like The Castle-he and on most occasions he has won.
