1,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General if the statement in today's Age, that no funds are available for the proposed trunk telephone line from Melbourne to Sale unless special provision is made, is correct. When the Estimates were before the House, the honourable gentleman laid on the table a memorandum showing that he had provided funds for the first section.",14
2,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Fund s are available for the first section. I cannot understand the report in the Age, and will make inquiries about it.",14
3,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"for Mr CHANTER) asked the Attorney-General, upon notice I. Has his attention been directed to an issue of the Transmitter of 18th November, IQOQ,' in which it is stated that the Public Service Commissioner declined to submit to him for his opinion as to the correct interpretation of Statutory Rule No. 83, which reads as follows :"" ioo8 :-Schedule-Grad e (2); maximum salary of grade, ^ l to ; office-letter-carrier , mail driver, post assistant, & a , to be advanced to the next higher grade after three years' service at maximum "" ? 2. Does not that provide for an advance in grade and service after the thTee-year period? 3. Will he ask for the papers to be submitted to him, and give his opinion as to the correct interpretation of Rule 83?",14
4,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are:1. Yes,'by the honourable member.' 2 and 3. These are matters which relate to the Department of Home Affairs. It is not usual to advise on such matters except at the request of the Department concerned. Sir JOHN QUICK laid upon the table the following paperPost and Telegraph Act, Regulation amended, Transmission of telegrams by telephone. Statutory Rule 1909, No. 115. NAVAL LOAN BILL.

5,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"(Wentworth) [ n . 3 ] - I could not help contrasting the appeal to "" our Christian principles,"" made by the. honourable member for Darwin last night, with the closing - periods of a speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition a few days ago, in which he said that this was the last action, in a dying Parliament, of what he hoped was a dying Government. What a difference is there between the sentiment underlying the utterance of the Leader of the Opposition in reference to a measure which should be regarded as non-party, and the appeal to our broad Christian feeling, made by the honourable member for Darwin! The more responsible members of the Labour party have already admitted that the proposed fleet unit is needed, and have assented to the ratification of the agreement concerning it. Some of them have even had the teraeritv to claim credit' for initiating the proposal, even while they now say that the matter is "" not urgent"" ! If it is not urgent, why is a fleet unit required at all ? Is the proposal merely a peg on which to hang land-tax oratory? Is it merely an adjunct to the party propaganda, or is it required for a practical national purposethe defence of Australia? If this fleet unit is necessary for the safety of our country, the urgency of this proposal must be gauged, not by our individual exigencies, or those of - the - parties to which we belong, but by the preparations of foreign powers-ou r possible foes. Applying that test, --'-an honourable members opposite deny that the position is urgent, and that Australia has no time to lose. Do honourable gentlemen opposite believe that the earth-hungry nations of the world will cease their preparations while they do nothing but mouth their patriotic protestations ? - The time has gone by for' speechifying; the time-has come for action. If they admit, as in their odd moments of sober reflection they must, the zeal of foreign powers in unceasingly .preparing for the Armageddon that is to come, they must PAPER. admit that there is no immediate way of providing funds for an Australianfleetunit but that now proposed. They know that, until the end of the next financial year, the Commonwealth will not have any surplus revenue at its disposal,- and that, even if extra taxation were imposed, it could not he realized until then. Consequently, if we wish to have the keels of this unit laid down at once, we must raise a loan, which I hope will be redeemed at the earliest possible moment. I agree with my honourable friends that borrowing for defence is, generally speaking, a bad thing. But this is a time of crisis, ancl such times are occasions, not for generalizing, but for action. If honourable members opposite are sincere in 'their patriotic protestations, they must help the Government to raise the necessary money, just as a few weeks ago they seemed ready to endorse a borrowing policy for any unprofitable railway programme that might be put before Parliament.",14
6,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In time of crisis, is the borrowing of mone'y the only thing to be done?",15
7,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If my honourable friend can propose any other way of obtaining the necessary funds, let him place it before the House, but let him not do nothing but carp at the Government for its policy. What the Government says, and what we must all admit, is that we have no time to lose, and that, apparently, the only means of obtaining the necessary funds immediately is to borrow.",15
8,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member says "" apparently.""",15
9,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"My honourable friends have done nothing but sneer since they left the Treasury bench. I ask them to say what other means can be employed? Whilst on this subject, I should like to say that I think that sufficient safeguards have not been provided in the measure to prevent the repetition of borrowing for defence preparations. The proposed loan is to be redeemed in sixteen years by the establishment of a 5 per cent, sinking fund. But, at the end of that time, the fleet will be practically valueless as a fighting unit, and we shall have to replace it, probably with a much larger one, which will mean more borrowing, unless we have made other special provision out of revenue in the meantime. I put this business suggestion before the Government that we should decide, in the first place, what the actual fighting life of the unit will probably be. For the sake of argument, let us take it at ten years.",15
10,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Treasurer said twenty years.,15
11,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not put myself' in opposition to the Admiralty authorities; but in my opinion, these ships will be practically out of date, though not obsolete, in ten years' time. For the purposes of argument, let us assume that they will have a life of ten years. We ought, then, every year to put aside out of revenue one-tenth of the total capital value of the fleet, arid thus provide automatically for the construction, out of revenue, of the fleet which will have to succeed that now proposed. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That provision will have to be made in addition to the proposed sinking fund and payment of interest on the proposed loan.",15
12,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Exactly . The sinking fund is only for the redemption of the proposed loan. But long before the end of sixteen years the fleet upon which the money will have been spent will be practically useless, and new ships will have to be provided out of new funds. I propose the establishment of a trust fund, into which money must be paid out of revenue every year. If necessary, we should impose further taxation, to raise the revenue required to do this. Then, when the time comes, we can renew, I hope increase, our fleet without borrowing. Probably the best thing to do would be to open a special trust fund account, crediting to it so much every year. Personally, I should like to see not less than one-tenth of the probable capital value of the new fleet unit paid to the credit of such a fund, automatically every year, in such a manner that the Treasurer of the day could not deal with it. The money should be taken automatically out of the Consolidated Revenue account and paid into the trust fund. I think that a Trust Fund Act will be required, and I hope that although the session is rapidly drawing to a close, the Government will see its way to immediatelv bring down a Bill in order that this Parliament may do something which will show the electors how baseless is the charge that we mean for all time to meet defence expenditure out of .borrowed funds. I believe that every Minister and every honourable member on this side will unite in an effort to demonstrate that we believe that there could be no more suicidal policy than that of paying for national insurance with borrowed money. We only consent to adopt this course at the present juncture because we realise that a great crisis will face our Empire in T9H, that it is essentially necessary to make a start, and that six weeks, let alone six months, may make all the difference between safetv and disaster for Australia and the Empire to which we belong. I am afraid that some of my honourable friends on the other side-and I am minded of it by the honourable member Boothby appearing in the chamber-ar e - almost too angry to do themselves justice. Last night, he began his speech by saying that he believed in the patriotism of the Australian people, and that he wished test that feeling by meeting this expenditheir ture by increased taxation. Some later lie said that he would not impose that taxation upon everybody, but would impose it upon the backs of those who were best able to bear it ! In the course of his remarks I interjected that in that case he only wished to test the patriotism of the well-to-do classes. His a singular one, which I commend to the close attention of all honourable members. He said that he wished to do nothing of correct. the kind, that although he was prepared to place a tax on the shoulders of those who were best able to bear it, any tax which was imposed on any section must eventually be borne by the wage earners. I tried hard to get in another interiection, but mv honourable friend scampered awav from the delightful circle in which he had been arguing. I remind him House. that first he Proposed to test the patriotism of the Australian people, that next he prowith it, sir. posed to test only the patriotism of a few of the Australian people, and that wound up by showing that his statement was only at the best an idle pretext, a piece of hvpocrisv which might deceive persons who were not immediatelv taxed into believthat, ing: that because they were not immediately taxed, therefore they were not going to bear t>e brunt of the taxation. Mv honoraim able^ friend also claimed credit to his party for initiating this scheme, which tell us there is no urpencv to bring into effect. He tried to claim that it was idenought tical- I mean in spirit, not in theirs. He sought to make out that underlying this proposal was the unrWhiv the nronosal of the Fisher Government. T think that it would baffle the man average political student to discover if angryhas he really were so innocent as to believe in Treasury bench. his assumption. I remember my honourable friends' programme of a few months me ago. I remember their violent opposition be to the Na«nl .Agreement, which was really remind the initiation of this scheme.",15
13,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Oh , rubbish !",16
14,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Naval Agreement, as I understand it, aimed at the training of Australians and New Zealanders refinest school of seamanship which the for world affords-the Imperial Navy. That training of seamen was to cost the Australian Government less than a third of what it was to cost the British Government. In other words, we were to train Australians to and New Zealanders, as seamen, to take place in a great unit such as this time one is to be, interchangeable, ships and men, with the Royal navy. My honourable friends objected to that agreement. They objected to it in a frenzied way, with the same unanimity as compelled the Orangemen in that party to vote for Home Rule.",16
15,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What does the honor'reply was able member mean by that?,16
16,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Exactly what I said.,16
17,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is-well , in",16
18,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I understand that the Orangemen in the honourable gentleman's party were persuaded by some mysterious or class means to vote for Home Rule. Mr KING O'MALLEY - B y the just spirit of godliness and liberty.,16
19,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I do not see what this has to do with the question before the,16
20,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It has a great deal to do,16
21,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Will the honourable he member point out the connection to me?,16
22,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to show, sir, that the difference between the Labour party's proposal and the Government's proposal is whereas we on this side aim at considering largely the safety of the whole Imperial structure, they on the other side purely at dissociating themselves in organization and general common action from they now the Empire's naval policy.",16
23,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is incorrect. It to be characterized more strongly. ships-wit h Mr KELLY - Ough t it?,16
24,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes ; it is stupid, as same ideal as well as incorrect.",16
25,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable gentlebeen intemperate, vehement, and ever since he was torn from the I hope that he will allow to proceed. He says that my statement is incorrect and stupid, and that it ought to characterized more strongly. I would honourable members that, not only did the Labour party want to have a fleet owned, manned, and managed exclusively by Australians, but they also wanted to procure such a diminutive type of vessel that, if wanted, it would be unable to leave in the the coast of Australia. *",16
26,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is not correct.,17
27,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"They reserved the statement of their programme for Gympie, while the whole world waited to hear what wonderful structure of statesmanship was to be evolved. They told us then that they were going to put all their eggs into one basket; that we were to have a large torpedo flotilla, the main value of which, I have no doubt, would be that if any very serious crisis came they would be able to seek safety in shallow creeks. If my honourable friends really believe, as the honourable gentleman now protests, as their past vote* on a number of questions, including also the proposal for a Queen Victoria memorial, seem to disprove, I would suggest to them that they help the Government to make this a truly Imperialistic proposal, to see that interchangeability of officers and men is a real thine.",17
28,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Was the Queen Victoria memorial for the national defence also?,17
29,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It helped to show one of the tendencies of the Labour party.,17
30,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It showed an absence of humbug.,17
31,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They voted against that proposal.,17
32,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes , they voted solidly against it, with one exception. They voted just as solidly against the naval agreement. They voted just as solidly, Orangemen and all, in favour of Home Rule for Ireland. And now they will vote just as solidly against anything that, would make this a truly Imperial proposal.",17
33,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,To borrow money makes it Imperial.,17
34,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"My honourable friend is positively ludicrous in .his efforts to discount this proposal. He says that he is in favour of i l , but he is going to block it on the ground that the method adopted to bring it into effect is not the right one, though it is the only one available.",17
35,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Nonsense ; that is the whole question.,17
36,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable gentleman now tells us that we on this side are doing some injustice to the Mother Country in proposing to go to the world's money market to raise this loan. Does he suggest that you do an injustice to any man who has money to lend by offering him good security for a loan of it?,17
37,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Who suggested that?,17
38,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Does the honourable gentleman suggest that the Commonwealth cannot offer good security for a loan of £>3-. 500,000. One might well think that he was the phonograph of the sort of economic nonsense which is turned out week by week by the Sydney Bulletin. Let the honourable gentleman put his shoulder to the wheel if he will, and help the Government to carry this proposal with such modifications and safeguards, if need be, as he and the House think necessary. But do not let him throw himself across the path of progress as a sort of carping critic, pleased with nothing, willing to help in nothing, now that he has lost the opportunity of getting credit for what is done. I cannot help saying that the policy of my Opposition friends is a policy of small ideas and small ships; and that the policy, of the Ministerial party is a policy which offers a large ideal and hard-hitting fleet.",17
39,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wit h the assistance of "" uncle.""",17
40,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I sincerely hope that my honourable friends will be able to set aside all questions of a party nature, and address themselves seriously and soberly to the consideration of how best to make this great unit efficient. What does it matter to us who gets the credit for bringing the thing into existence? Surely there is a sufficient number of honourable members who have come here .to get things done, not to get the credit for doing them. Surely we might well allow those to seek greedily for credit who find it most difficult to get credit. Let us consider solely the safety of the people committed to our charge, and the building up in Australia of a buttress of that great arch of Empire under which we live, and without which we would have no pledge of permanent security, and the Empire's civilization no guarantee of peaceful progress.  an old saying that, when a man has a bad case, one of the most handy, if not effective, weapons to use is abuse of the other side. The last' speech has furnished an instance of that. The honourable member insinuated a want of loyalty on the part of those who oppose this measure. Fortunately, the history of the past proves that there is not a scintilla of truth in his allegation. The sons of many men on this side went to South Africa to fight for the Empire. It was the agitation of the - Labour party which brought about compulsory service in connection with the new defence scheme. I venture to say that but for the efforts of the honourable member for West Sydney, who for years had battled in that direction, it would have been impossible in this House to pass a measure for the institution of compulsory service. The best which can be said for the last speech is that it was an apology for an extremely bad precedent which is being created, because the speaker admitted that it is a bad thing to have a loan policy for defence purposes. If any one had suggested a few years ago that the first loin Bill of the Commonwealth would be for the purpose of defence, the suggestion would have (been scouted on all sides of the Chamber. Of course, there is much to be said in justification for a loan policy for carrying out reproductive works. Some years ago, when a loan policy was proposed for certain reproductive works, I was one of very few who voted in its favour, believing then, as I do now, that there are large national undertakings which can never be entered upon if we have to depend solely on revenue. But to initiate a loan policy for defence is with a vengeance! If this measure be passed, and we enter upon, a loan policy for any such purpose, it will be regarded by future historians as a blot on our progress. I cannot believe that the patriotism we hear so much about is mere lip service. I may be wrong, but .1 believe that the property owners and wealthy members of the community generallv have no desire to shirk their responsibility in the matter of defence. If this country has to be defended, it must be by the blood and bone and sinew of the masses. When we have submitted to compulsory service, which has always been regarded with abhorrence by English-speaking people, and thus thrown the bulk of the work on the masses, surely the well-to-do will willingly contribute a fair proportion?",17
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The well-to-do, as well as others, will be compelled lo servethere will be no distinction.  to that matter.",18
42,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member said that the masses would have to bear the whole burden of defence.  the masses would have to bear by far the larger share of the burden.,18
43,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member said lhat the masses would have to bear all.  torn away from their work in order to serve; and if there were war tomorrow, the greater number of the defenders would be obtained from the masses. Not only do we ask the masses to contribute the greater proportion, of men, but by this Bill we compel them, through the Customs House, to bear the greater part of the cost. Do honourable members say that the burden will not fall more heavily on the masses than on the wealthy ?",18
44,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is a pity the honourable member did not find that out before he voted for the Tariff !  ber, when the Tariff was before us, was a Free Trader, excepting when some item affected his own district, and then he became a Protectionist.",18
45,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is not correct.,18
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The point is that we have the requisite funds now. Why should we impose further taxation?  name of Heaven, is this Bill introduced?",18
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,In order to get the to write history capital at once.  shall have to pay interest for all time.,18
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Not for all timeonly for sixteen years.  terest and sinking fund will have to be met out of Customs and Excise revenue ; and, under other circumstances, the Minister of Defence would have opposed a proposal of the kind with all the vehemence of his nature. We are led to believe that the primary reason for the introduction of the Bill is a danger which is closer at hand than some probably imagine. But panic legislation is always bad, and should be avoided. There is not the slightest difference of opinion as to the necessity for preparing for an emergency; honourable members, by their support of the Defence Bill, show that they realise that we have for years been living in a fool's parad'se, and neglecting our duty in not establishing a permanent and efficient system of defence. The only difference of opinion now is as to the method by which the necessary money is to be raised. We are told that we cannot afford to wait, but must rush into the London market, and borrow £3,500,000. We must not forget, however, that under the financial agreement with the States, the Commonwealth will be something like £2,500,000 per annum better off than we were under the Braddon section; and as the proposal now before us cannot be given effect to in less than two or three years, I think we ought to be able to meet the cost out of our savings.",18
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It will be two years and a half at the outside.  Commonwealth will receive between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 under the financial agreement with the States; and out of that I think we could well provide for defence.",19
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That money is already required for other services, including old-age pensions already provided for.",19
51,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Ou t of the £2,500,000. ",19
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Yes .  cost of 'old-age pensions was provided for out of our original surplus.,19

55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I assure the honourable member that we are spending that money now.  dence of the fact. The amount spent, if any, under the new defence scheme, is very small.",19
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am speaking of equipment for the present forces, which has nothing to do with the new scheme.  posal now before us is rotten, to say the least; and honourable members opposite are mere apologists for the scheme, for no one can justify it. It is cruel to pay the whole cost of our naval defence out of Customs and Excise revenue. Why should property escape its share of the burden? The honourable member for Fawkner, (some time ago, said he was quite satisfied that the wealthy and well-to-do would readily contribute towards the cost of the defence of the country; but I ask him whether, under the scheme proposed, they do contribute fair proportion ?",19
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable so. member does not see that the money has already been levied and obtained-that are not proposing to levy afresh on the masses.  mean to say that the £3,500,000 will not have to be paid?",19
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It will have to be paid, of course.  paid?",19
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Ou t of the moneys we have already levied.  toms House?,19
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Yes .  than the Minister that the incidence of Customs taxation is very unfair.,19
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is an entirely different question.  the Government went to the country and proposed some other method of taxation in order to provide defence, the people would readily respond. The iniquity of the present proposal lies in the fact that it is made on the eve of a general election, when there is no pressing necessity, and when the character of the Commonwealth can only be besmirched by the initiation of a defence policy on the strength ot a loan. This country is a wealthy one, and I have too high an opinion of the people to think that they would not respond readily to an invitation to contribute their quota. The objection I have is that 75 per cent, of the burden must fall on the masses. This Government, with their majority of ten to fourteen, and practically the whole of the press and other great influences behind them, have not the backbone to introduce some other method of taxation in order to meet this cost. There is nothing to justify the borrowing of money for this purpose. Ministers cannot point to any country that has adopted such a policy. No State in Australia before Federation borrowed for defence. Every loan we have had in Australia has been raised for some class of reproductive work.",19
62,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,On one occasion Victoria borrowed half-a-million for defence.  that. I did not think that any Australian State had ever borrowed for that purpose.,19
63,Mr MCDONALD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Chamber of a Commerce has decided that the Government must borrow, and, therefore, they are doing  we thing in that. Recently the Chamber of Commerce decided that certain proposed legislation then before the Senate was not to be proceeded with. Up to that stage, the Bill in question had been debated. 'I'he day after the decision of the Chamber of Commerce was arrived at, the measure was put on one side, and it is a singular fact that it has not been brought up again from that day to this. It may be that the Chamber of Commerce has influenced the policy of the Government on this occasion. I do not profess to know. What I do know is that this Parliament has hitherto prided itself on the fact that it has existed for nearly ten years, and has not borrowed one penny. What a sad falling off ! We have now to tell the electors, "" It is quite true that for years we have taken credit for showing an example to the States by setting our faces against a loan policy. We have constructed works out of. revenue. But now we are inaugurating a change."",",19
64,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Does not the honourable member think that we have done well in constructing works out of revenue?  Commonwealth had used the money to which it was entitled, instead of handing back nearly £7,000,000 to the States, it would have been very much better. But it is cer^ tainly a good thing for the country that we have paid for several million pounds worth of works out of revenue. We have not increased the interest bill of Australia by farthing. There are, I admit, many purposes for which loans are justified, but I cannot bring myself to believe that any honourable member can justify the Commonwealth in launching out dn a loan policy for defence purposes. Can we claim that this is a reproductive work? Has any organization in Australia issued a programme or political manifesto expressing the view .'that it is desirable to borrow defence? I have never noticed that any honourable member who has advocated borrowing for reproductive works has said a word in favour of borrowing for th's purpose. We are now starting on very unsound lines. But that is not the worse of We are establishing a precedent. A spendthrift, whether individual or corporate, always finds it much more congenial to live on borrowed money than to pay his way out of current revenue.",20
65,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There is not only construction, but maintenance, to be provided for.  the Navy will have to be maintained out of loans. The warships will have to be replaced in a few years.",20
66,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We are providing for construction, and nothing else.  but I venture to predict that there will be another loan policy when the ships become obsolete; and it will be just as justifiable as the present one. It cannot be argued by the Minister that it will not be necessary, in ten or twelve years, to replace the vessels by - up-to-date ships, nor can he argue that it will not then be quite'as justifiable to borrow as on the present occasion.",20
67,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes , I can.  markable line of reasoning. If it be justifiable to borrow for this purpose today, it will be equally justifiable then.",20
68,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Not necessarily.  tleman may be able to convince himself, but were it not for party reasons, as the result of the Fusion, I venture to say that not twenty honourable members on the Ministerial side would support this policy. They can only defend it on grounds of panic. Why cannot they wait until the electors have been consulted, and until we ascertain whether they are patriotic in pocket as well as in sentiment? The cry behind this policy is that the enemy is one practically at our gates, and that we cannot wait until the electors have been consulted. We must plunge into the money market, and besmirch the reputation of this Parliament as a non-borrower. We are to start our career of borrowing on the worse line we could have selected. History will say who is right and who is wrong on this occasion. To-daythe Government have the numbers. Having spine enough for to go to the country on this policy, they will probably win. But when the subject is looked into a few years hence, I venture to say that the unanimous verdict from every right-thinking person will be that this is one of the greatest blunders ever comit. mitted by the Commonwealth Parliament. Not an honourable member who has spoken from the Ministerial side has attempted to justify the policy. Why did the honourable member for Wentworth ask for different 'reservations? Because he has to admit that the policy of borrowing for defence is unsound. Only on account of the urgency and the panic created can he justif v it. Later on, I am convinced it will be admitted that this policy is a serious mistake. I am very sorrv, because I do not believe there is a scintilla of difference between the Ministry and the Opposition with regard to defence itself. We are just as patriotic, just as loyal, just as earnest in this matter, as are those who sometimes twit us with being disloyal. But we differ as to the means ot financing our policy of - defence. My regret is that we could not come to a unanimous decision in favour of a scheme financed on sound lines. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane-Honorar y Minister) [11.57] - Honourable members will naturally expect to hear something from me on this question. I should have risen earlier except that I have been suffering from a severe cold. It was quite impossible for me to speak yesterday, and it may not be possible for me to speak at length this morning. But I feel that it is necessary that I should endeavour, at least, to place before the House my views as having represented Australia at the recent Imperial Conference. Before proceeding to the real question, I should like to make a passing reference to matters which occurred just prior to, and immediately succeeding, my departure to the Old Country. One can easily understand that there appeared to some persons to be an opportunity afforded by my being thousands of miles away to make remarks to my detriment. I was alluded to on more than one occasion in a less than complimentary way  who the honourable gentleman was.",20
69,Mr MCDONALD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The inquiry was made from the Minister's own side of the House. It is just as well that he should know where the attack came from.,21
70,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I think I know where it came from. I can also well understand that some honourable members were unable to resist the temptation offered by so favourable an opportunity,21
71,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member might explain who he is, in answer to the inquiry",21
72,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I hope that honourable members opposite will assist me as much as possible by refraining from interjections, because I cannot raise my voice. In some extraordinary way, my personal views in regard to naval defence have been wonderfully distorted. I have not looked up any of my speeches on this subject, delivered in the Parliament of Queensland or elsewhere, prior to Fedeiation. But if any one takes the trouble to do so, he will find that I have from the first consistently supported the payment of a cash subsidy to the Mother Country, but only as a tentative expedient, to be abandoned as soon as it was possible for us to do something in the nature of what is now proposed. That is the full extent of the support which I gave to the subsidy. I also thought that, according both to population and to the proportional amount of our trade as a part of the Empire, we were not paying sufficient, but I always regarded the subsidy as being merely a makeshift. I am glad to think that I have had some hand in bringing about what I hope will prove to be a better state of things. During the whole course of the Conference, the consideration which was shown by the Imperial authorities, especially by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr MCKenna, and by every official at the Admiralty, was most gratifying. The offers of Dreadnoughts by New Zealand and Australia had' naturally had a very marked effect not only on members of the Imperial Government and officials, but also on the public at large. No matter how we may disagree as to whether those offers should or should not have been .made, every one will admit .that the spirit-in which they were made was, from our point of view, correct, and that spirit prompted a reciprocal attitude on the part of the people in the Old Country. This rendered the whole Conference most pleasant in every way, and from beginning to end it was really not a question of bargaining, but a. question on either side of, "" How much can we do for you?"" It is unnecessary for me to go over the ground which has already been so ablv traversed by the Prime Minister. I could not do it half as well as he did it.",21
73,Mr MCDONALD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member could put it so that we could understand it better, at any rate.",21
74,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think not. At all events, it is unnecessary for me to go over the ground which has to be traversed in advocating this scheme, because, judging by the speeches delivered on both sides, there is practical unanimity as to the ad visableness of carrying out the agreement.",21
75,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It was adopted by a large majority-practicall y unanimously.,21
76,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I was saying that it was accepted practically unanimously as a very excellent scheme. It is therefore necessary to deal only, as a matter of controversy, with the method by which it is proposed to carry it into effect. Our position at this moment with regard to naval defence is that we pay a subsidy of £200,000 a year, and in return it is stipulated that certain vessels shall always be stationed in Australian waters. pay for local naval defence, in addition, between £70,000 and £80,000 a year, making our total naval expenditure about £270,000 or £280,000 a year. Treasurer spoke of our local naval expenditure as £80,000, but I have it in my mind that it is about £70,000, and at the Conference our total expenditure for naval purposes was ' mentioned as £270,000. Prior to the Conference, and during the early stages of the main Conference, it became evident, as it did at the Conference of 1907, that it would benecessary, in considering any scheme of Imperial navai defence, to deal on separate lines with the various Dominions, which were anxious to come in and contribute more largely to the naval defence of the Empire, on account of their different geographical positions, their varying degrees of advancement, their differing populations, and other varying circumstances. At about the third meeting of the Conference, therefore, it became evident that Canada, Australia, and New Zealand would have to be dealt with on different lines, and matters of detail were then referred to the Admiralty, who were requested to deal separately and privately with the representatives of the three Dominions. I have now, of course, to deal, except in a very casual, way, only with those arrangements as they affect Australia. The offer of a Dreadnought by Australia had certainly this advantage in"" the negotiations, that it gave a clue or indication, to the Admiralty as to the extent to which the Commonwealth was prepared to go in augmentation of its existing contribution to Imperial, naval defence. Dreadnought would cost £2,000,000 or so, and that was an indication to the Admiralty that a considerable advance was rontemDlated and desired by us. On the strength of that, and possibly also on the strength of conversations which I had with various members of the Board of Admiralty before the Conference and during the first sittings, the Admiraltv prepared suggestions for proposals. They very naturally desired that the proposals should come from the Commonwealth, because they would mean greater burdens to the Commonwealth. But they did not hesitate, on the strength of the offer of a Dreadnought. and the indication thereby conveyed of the extent to which Australia was prepared to Colonel Foxton. go, to make practical suggestions as to the best .means of putting the desire of AusWe tralia into effect. On those suggestions, and after discussion and alteration of them, the final arrangement, which has been made public,' was come to. I need not further The allude to it except to say that, instead of a Dreadnought, it is proposed that we ; should provide an improved Indomitable, known as the Indefatigable type, which will cast about the same, and is practically a cruising Dreadnought. That ship is regarded quite unanimously by the leading officials of the. Admiralty, from the First Lord downwards, as the head and front and principal portion of the unit which it is proposed that Australia should provide for itself. The other vessels, in due proportion as to numbers, are the attributes of that vessel. They are necessary, as being complementary to it, to make up what is understood as the fleet unit, which is to form one-third of the great Eastern fleet of the Empire in the Pacific, consisting of thirty-nine vessels. The great object attained, from our point of view, by the establishment of such a unit, is that we shall have within it practically every hranch of specialized work which is to be found in the British Navy itself. It will be, so to speak, a segment of the British Navy, and it will not be necessary to go outside of it to obtain every class of training which is to be found in the Royal Navy itself. In it we shall have the training which is to be obtained on the Indomitable, exactly similar to that on the Dreadnought or any other battleship; we shall have the Bristol cruisers, the destroyers, the submarines, and, of course, our torpedo boats, as we have them here at present, and as they may be improved. We A shall have every type of vessel and class of training, and the unit will be, in the opinion of the Admiralty, large enough to afford sufficient attraction to men to go into it and adopt the naval profession as a life's career. This would not be the case if we had only a small number of vessels, or even a large number of small vessels. Tn the negotiations t.nd conversations which I had with the First Lord of the Admiralty, it very soon became a question of ways and means. He realised that it would he scarcely reasonable, at. all events for the present, to ask that Australia should take upon - itself thp whole additional burden which would be incurred in the construction, maintenance, management, and direction of the whole of the fleet unit in peace time, amounting, including sinking fund and interest on cost of constructhe tion, to about £750,000 a year, or a con- . interest and sinking fund. siderable advance on our present, annual commitment of £270,000 for naval defence purposes. One honourable member the other side spoke during this debate though we had gone cap-in-hand to the Admiralty to ask for aid to the extent of or thereabouts). £250,000 per annum, as though we had, in fact, demanded it, but let me say at once that, while the nnancial aspect the scheme was being discussed, the gestion that that payment should be made vessels. by the Imperial Government was made voluntarily by Mr .MCKenna, who re have a renewal fund. garded it as necessary in our existing circumstances and present financial position in order to launch the scheme properly, but he did not"" hesitate to say that sidered it very problematical that we desire to continue to receive that assistance for any lengthened period. There are orable members who believe that from beginning we should endeavour to carry by ourselves, and should refuse any such assistance. I do not agree with that. Each person is entitled to his own opinion in a matter of this sort. It is suggested in some quarters that it will be scarcely dignified for us to accept the assistance proffered. But I hold that if it was not beneath the dignity of the Imperial vernment to accept our subsidy of £200,000 a year for many years, it is beneath our dignity to accept from the Imperial authorities a voluntary offer £250,000 for just so long as we may sire to avail ourselves of it. Financial considerations apart, I think it would unwise for us to refuse such assistance, offered in so excellent a spirit. Though, me, having had the opportunity of and seeing how this matter was' approached by the Admiralty, it was scarcely necessary, still, the offer was made and may cumstances, be regarded as a pledge of the inbefore tense desire on the part of the Adfor miralty to make this new development of naval defence, not only for Australia, but all the outlying Dominions, a success of in every sense. I am quite sure that noing thing will be wanting, in the later negotia-> tions which must ensue between the two Governments in the consideration of minor details, to realise that intention. We can rely upon the most hearty co-operation every possible way of the officials of Admiralty. What was suggested and what Defence, in another debate. the agreement actually provides for [242] this: That an estimate should be made of annual cost of this fleet unit, including Honourable members should always bear in mind that *be £750,000 a year includes interest and on sinking fund. It is customary with the as Admiralty to allow for depreciation 4 per cent., covering a period of eighteen years That is the principle adopted by the Admiralty, and if we do here not go beyond that we shall be on safe of lines. That is the principle on which they sugwrite off depreciation of all their war Mr KING O'MALLEY - We should also",21
77,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall deal with that later. The life of a battleship is he conpresumed to be eighteen years. Let me should say, in this connection, that some authorities put it as low as five honyears, and others think it should be the stated at fifteen years; but it is on quite impossible to do more than merely estimate what the life of a battleship is likely to be. The reason is that so much depends upon the progress that may be made in regard to new developments in naval construction. It is satisfactory for us to know that a new departure in naval construction has only quite recently been Gomade. I refer to the construction of Dreadnoughts, and we shall have a vessel not which will practically be a Dreadnought. It is unlikely that any very important new of departure in naval construction will be demade within a few years, at all events. We are therefore entering upon this underbe taking at a very favourable time; that is to-say, at a period immediately succeeding to great developments in naval construction, we shall have the advantage of securing vessels built upon the most up-to-date lines. It will be agreed that, in the cir- ' the period which, must elapse those vessels can be considered fit the scrap-heap is likely to be much longer than might otherwise be the case. I have said that the estimated annual cost the fleet unit, including interest and sinkfund, is £750,000 a year. That is a good deal less than the annual cost of the present Australian Squadron, although the fleet unit will be infinitely stronger in every way than the present Australian Squadron. This in is shown by the figures quoted by mv the honourable colleague, the Minister of The is personnel of the fleet unit will be less than that of the Australian Squadron, and this will involve a lower expenditure for pay. The actual cost, so far as I could gather, of the present Australian Squadron is something £800,000 a year. I was first informed that it was £900,000 a year, but that statecolleges. ment was modified. It is only fair to say that included in the £800,000 or £900,000 a year, which the present Australian access Squadron costs, is a proportional amount the cost of the central administration of Admiralty in London and elsewhere. It is the practice of the Admiralty, ancl a very proper practice, to debit every squadron, and, indeed, every ship, in estimating annual cost of their upkeep, with a proporcarried tional share of the cost of the administratechnical tion of the Admiralty. It is, therefore, right that I should remind honourable members that this charge adds a somewhat fictitious additional amount to the cost of the Ausis tralian Squadron. But, in any case, new fleet unit will cost less per annum does the Australian Squadron. I should add that the estimate I have given the annual cost of the present Australian Squadron includes interest and sinking fund for all the vessels. It was agreed that the difference between £500,000 and the estimated annual cost of the fleet unit, whatever it may be, should be borne by the Imperial Government. It was considered by Mr MCKenna that a jump from £200,000, or, including our local expenditure, £270,000, to £500,000 a year would be quite sufficient for Australia to take at the present time. Hence the offer of £250^000 a year from the Imsuch perial Government. The difference between ,£270,000 a year' and £500,000 . is £230,000, and that will be the whole ditional annual cost to Australia for this Country. fleet unit, and the comparatively complete protection which it will afford, until time as we are prepared to say to the perial authorities,"" We will go on our own, j.nd do not require your subsidy any longer."" Honourable members will, theremain fore, see that the fleet unit will only us £230,000 a year more than we are * ing at the present time, because our local expenditure will be merged in the complete expenditure on the fleet unit. £750,000 a year was estimated by the miralty, and one necessarily had to rely upon them and to accept their estimate. It is stated to be a liberal estimate, cludes, as I said before, a. sinking fund the rate of 4 per cent, and interest, Colonel Foxton. tinguished from 5 per cent, which we now propose in this Bill, which would increase it by £35,000 a year. It also, includes the auxiliary services, over such as store ships and hospital ships, and a liberal allowance for training Some considerable interest centred in the question of training colleges. Canada was desirous of having continued to the colleges at Osborne and Dartof mouth. Honourable members will underthe stand that a lad goes through a four-years' course before he goes on board a ship. The first two years is put in at the Osborne College, which may be regarded as a prethe paratory school. At Dartmouth the lad is 011 further in his professional and duties for another two years. Australia is entitled to make_ certain nominations for these colleges. But the distance of Australia from the Old Country so great that mothers are loth to part the with their boys at the age of twelve, than and to send them so far away. It will be admitted that at twelve years of of age a boy is too young to be sent to the other end of the world, unless there are friends or relatives to whom he can be sent. I did not, therefore, press any request that we should continue to send boys to Osborne and Dartmouth. If some parents prefer to send their boys to those colleges, well and good, but it was clear that it is necessary that we should establish colleges of the same kind here, and undertake the training of lads from the beginning. We should probably secure a much larger choice of boys for the f!ei;t unit by having colleges established in Australia. Onr. position in the matter is, of course, very different from that of Canada, which is adonly five or six days distant from the Old The new proposal is a complete reversal of the present position. The such fleet unit will be our own, entirely under Imour control. We can please ourselves as to the rates of pay we shall offer. It will be - under our complete direction, and reso until the Government of the day cost decides to place it at the disposal of the payAdmiralty, in which case it will be immediately under the command of the Naval Commander-in-Chief. I stated by way of The interjection, while the Treasurer was speakAding yesterday, and was mentioning that our fleet unit will co-operate with the other two fleet units that will go to form the Eastern and 'inFleet of the Empire, that whenever these at fleet units, or any of the ships composing as disthem, come together, the senior naval officer will command. It may not happen during the first ten or fifteen can quite conceive that should this agreement continue in force, we may yet have an Australian Admiral in command of the Eastern Fleet of the Empire.",23

79,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am obliged to pose. the honourable member for the interjection, because it reminds me that I omitted mention that it is a part of the agreement that, so far as possible, in view of varying conditions, our regulations shall exactly assimilated to those of the Royal Navy.

It would probably depend upon the place where the vessels were assembled together. I have said that we can always rely upon the heartiest possible co-operation on the part of unit. the Admiralty in making the scheme work smoothly. It is clearly their intense nised. desire that it should do so.

I thought that, although possibly ing ground which had already been be renewing and adding to ourWe trodden, I might be able to add something which would be of interest to honourable members. I have now a few observations to make with regard to the question of financing the naval scheme. . It has been be said by honourable members that this is the only occasion on which it has been prothe 1913, posed to borrow for naval purposes. That, abnormal. I think, is not so. New Zealand has made an offer of a Dreadnought to the Mother Country, and must necessarily borrow the money to provide for its construction. - Mr Wise - Sh e has not done so yet.",25
82,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But it is a necesas sary part of the scheme. New Zealand could not raise £2,000,000 for the conpurpose. struction of a Dreadnought within the next two and a-half years without resorting to borrowing, or anticipating revenue in some way. [242]- 2 Mr KING O'MALLEY - At any rate, she years, but I is a plunger.",25
83,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is another matter. I am simply combating the statement that this is something entirely new. I understand that Canada will adopt the,25

88,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Ministry is making no provision for taxation for the future.,25

That ought to dispose of the allegation that the adoption of this proposal will create a dangerous precedent. It has been said that we ought not to charge insurance to capital. Let us take, by way of illustration, the simple case of a man going into business in a small town where risks are not accepted. I know of mining towns where the risks are too great, and will not be undertaken by insurance companies. Starting business town, this man provides a fire engine for himself. Would it not be fair-and I think the analogy is reasonably completefor him to charge the cost of that fire engine to capital account?",25

93,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think that the analogy is complete.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does not the honourable member think that we could borrow this £3,500,000 at a more satisfactory rate from the Imperial Government?",26
94,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have information on the subject - which I am not permitted to communicate now, but I can give it to the honourable member privately.

95,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,And also of who is to pay.,26
96,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not think that is much in dispute.

100,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is unwise to wholly ignore so-called scares. We may ignore one too many, and find ourselves unprepared when the emergency arises. It is all very well for an Australian Government to say to the Imperial Government, "" The whole of the resources of Australia will be at your disposal when the day of trouble comes."" But what is the use of talking like that if we do not convert those resources into that which will enable us to do something when the emergency arises? It is idle to talk up to the last minute. We must make our preparations years in advance if our professions of good-will to the Motherland are to be of any value.",26

103,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Fiftee n years hence we shall owe nothing for it, and if the honourable member for Gwydir happens to be Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, he will be able to put his views into operation in dealing with the next emergency. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable gentleman has said nothing yet about a renewal fund.",26
104,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There is no necessity at present to deal with the question of a renewal fund. All that we have to do is to make provision for the redemption of the loan we are going to float. No renewals will be required, at all events, for ten years. We. may add to our fleet, but we shall be able, I think, to provide out of revenue for additions. When we have to consider the question of renewals, it will be time enough to consider how they shall in be paid for. In any event, we shall not have to simultaneously renew thirteen vessels, unless we leave the whole of the rethe newals untouched for fifteen years. If we exdid that, we should be faced with the posithink tion which now confronts us. We might then have an obsolete fleet, and be faced with the necessity of building within a short time an entirely new fleet unit to take its place. That would be an entirely abnormal expenditure, and the necessity for it would arise only from gross mismanagement on the part of the Australian Admiralty in failing to provide for renewals as they became necessary. In that connection I would point out that renewals will necessarily be required at varying periods, because the lives of the smaller vessels are not as long as those of the larger ones.",26
105,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The only point of difference is as to the source of revenue to meet the interest charges.,27
106,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The money will come out of the consolidated revenue.,27
107,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,And that is obtained today from Customs and Excise taxation.,27
108,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is one point of view, but let me deal with another. I have explained that we are to receive, by the handsome and voluntary offer of the Mother Country, £250,000 a year as long as we choose to accept it.",27
109,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is practically reversing the position of today.,27
110,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes . If - we choose to receive that amount for fifteen years, the money so obtained will approximately cover the interest and sinking fund, and will practically pay for all our vessels. In other words, interest and sinking fund will practically be provided for by the contribution of £250,000 per annum, which the Mother Country is going to make to us.",27
111,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There is no Australian Navy about that.,27
112,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is delightful patriotism.,27
113,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think that there is patriotism in it, because the Mother Country can well afford to pay us that £250,000 a year. Why? Because after paying it she will still be saving £400,000 a year, besides encouraging us to build our own navy, find our own footing, and, a few years hence, become a greater buttress to her than we have ever been.",27
114,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In fifteen years we ought, practically, to have doubled our navy.",27
115,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes . Under this scheme, not only shall we save the Mother Country at least £350,000 or £400,000 a year, but we shall also assume an, additional burden of £230,000 a year ourselves, thus completely reversing the position as it exists today. I think that that is patriotic. At all events, whatever honourable members opposite may think, we are certainly regarded on the other side of the world as doing the handsome thing. There, those who are best able to judge think that in what we propose to do we give evidence that we are not lacking in Imperial spirit. The £250,000 a year contributed by the Mother Country will-takin g 4 per cent, as a basis, instead of the 5 per cent., which we propose-jus t about provide interest and sinking fund on the capital cost of the vessels. Personally, I think that, it would have been a very excellent thing if New Zealand, instead of contributing an increased naval subsidy under the existing agreement, and providing for the gift of an Indomitable, had thrown in her lot with Australia for the establishment of what would have been an Australasian unit, perhaps of' larger size even than that which we now propose to establish. In this connection, it is rather curious to note that New Zealand will, I assume, have to borrow the money with which to pay for the Indomitable which she is presenting to the Mother Country, and which will be the flagship of the China fleet unit. That will cost New Zealand about £150,000 a year for about eighteen years. To ' that £150,000 must be added the £100,000 which she will pay as subsidy to the Imperial Fleet. Assuming that she raises the money and pays it off gradually over a period of fifteen or eighteen years, New Zealand will pay the Mother Country exactly the sum which the Mother Country will pay to Australia by way of subsidy. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We are better business men.",27
116,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On e does not care to comment on what is being done by the Dominion. But that £250,000 annually will, in a sense, be practically applied to pay for our ships. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is bad business for New Zealand - *",27
117,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It may or may not be. The question has been raised as to when it will be necessary for the money to be paid to the contractors in connection with the building of the ships. I think we all recognise that it is necessary to proceed with their construction at once. The Admiralty are prepared to superintend, their construction through contractors in exactly the same way as they would do if the vessels formed part of the British Navy itself. The only additional charge will be for extra supervision. The whole of the work done in connection with the central administration of the Admiralty will be done quite gratuitously. Before I left England, I ' ascertained that it is the practice of the Admiralty, as the building of a battleship proceeds, to make about one hundred separate payments, so that if the construction of a vessel occupied two ancl a-half years, there would be on an average a weekly payment. But I also understand that it is possible to arrange for the payments to be made by five instalments extending over lhat period. If we adopt the latter plan, we shall undoubtedly have to pay an additional price. In my judgment, it is far better for us to face our interest bill in a business-like with a view to making the capital cost of the ships as low as possible. If we follow the practice of the Admiralty we shall require to find, during the first six months that the vessels are building-that is, between February of next year and the following August-somethin g like £500,000, or possibly a sum which would represent one-fifth of the total expenditure. Honourable members will recognise the necessity for having that money if we are going to proceed with the construction of these vessels at all. That is all that I have to say oh the subject. I have not endeavoured to do more than give a business-like exposition of the position as it presented itself to me at the Imperial Conference. I sincerely hope that the results of that Conference will not be barren. From my point of view, this is practically the only way in which we can finance the scheme at the present time. I feel very certain that to the great body of the public it will be a' disappointment if anything is permitted to interfere with the adoption of this scheme.",27

As far as I can see, this is the only practical way in which it can be proceeded with. Further, our failurs to proceed with it will be a grievous disappointment to those in the Mother Country who are looking to its accomplishment, and I think that we owe something to them. They regard it as essential that the scheme should be carried out at once. The Admiralty authorties areabout to proceed immediately with the construction of their two fleet units in connection with the Eastern Fleet, and it will not be to the credit of Australia if we fail 1 to do our share in that great scheme.",28
122,Mr WISE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Gippsland) [12.55] - It is to be regretted that in the closing hours of the session so much time should have been occupied in discussing a proposal which was practically unanimously agreed to a way, week or ten days ago. The greater portion of this debate has been occupied by Ministerial supporters in dealing with the scheme itself, which, as the Prime Minister has already pointed out, was unanimously agreed to some ten days ago. Consequently, there was no need to discuss it at all. Of course, these remarks do not apply to the Honorary Minister. I think that he was fairly entitled, as our representative at the Imperial Conference, to place before us his own views on the subject. I only regret that out of the Ministerial party of forty he was never favoured with the presence of more than a dozen listeners'. It was a very poor compliment to pay him.",28

They paid a similarly poor compliment to members of their own party when the latter were discussing the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill. At one period during that discussion, only ten Ministerial supporters were present. Of course, they have to Jo as ""they are told, but they might have paid the Honorary Minister, who was our representative at the Imperial Conference, the compliment of listening to him. I make no complaint about the Ministers having occupied any time today. He was entitled jto put his views before us. But other honourable members were not entitled to waste time in debating a scheme which has already been approved by the House. It seems to me that the only question which we now have to consider is whether the proper method of raising this money is by loan. Had the debate been confined to that, it would have terminated last night. I regret that when we are about to start to build an Australian Navy we should have recourse to raising the necessary funds by loan. I was glad to hear the Honorary Minister frankly acknowledge that Great Britain was going to pay for this fleet. I think that in accepting their money we are adopting a very extraordinary method of taking upon ourselves our full share of Imperial responsibility in the matter of defence. The Treasurer stated that this proposal to strengthen the Fleet of the Empire was one which recognised to the full our Imperial responsibilities. But how are we recognising them ? We are asking the Mother Country to pay for the vessels of the Australian unit. The Treasurer has himself pointed out that, under this agreement, we shall get £250,000 a year from the Mother Country, in addition to which we shall be relieved of the payment of the naval subsidy of £200,000 annually for the future. That makes a total of £450,000 a year, so that, in reality, we shall be getting from the Imperial authorities more than sufficient to pay interest and provide a sinking fund upon the proposed loan. In, other words, the Mother Country is going to pay for the ships to which we proudly point as our contribution towards Imperial defence",28

131,Unknown,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Sitting suspended from 1 io 2.15 p.m.,29
132,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I call attention to state of the House. [Quorum formed.] Mr Wise,-As I have already said, it cannot be rightly contended that proposal before the House we are recognising to the full our Imperial responsibilities, seeing that, as the Honorary Alinister has pointed out, the British Government is to contribute towards the upkeep of theproposed fleet £250,000 a year, which will more than pay interest and the contribution to thesinking fund. In my opinion, our people, as Australians, and as members of the British Empire, are enthusiastic patriots, and quite ready to provide for a fleet at their own expense. I have arrived at that conclusion from the expressions of opinion which I have heard in travelling through the country. During the last three years, and at the time of the last election, whenever I advocated provision for defence being made solely by direct taxation on all kinds of wealth, no one objected to the suggestion, and on one occasion, to my intense surprise, half-adozen very Conservative land-holders said that they would be prepared to pay a land tax if the proceeds were to be devoted wholly to defence purposes. Personally, I cannot see why other sources of wealth as well as land should not be taxed. I advocate direct taxation on all forms of wealth for defence purposes. The wealth of Australia is estimated at £1,200,000,000, and its oversea trade at from £100,000,000 to '£120,000,000. We should therefore be able to provide by direct taxation on that wealth for its defence, as well as for the defence of Our lives and institutions. There is no need for a loan. Ministers tell us that only £500,000 will be needed next They must have known weeks ago, He by cablegram, what amount would be rehe quired, and surely have enough ability to a scheme of direct taxation to obtain the necessary funds. We were told they came into office to re-establish responsible government, and they are supported by a large majority which, we know, they can compel to do anything, because we have seen their supporters voting for measures to which they had declared themselves opposed. Any proposal which Ministers might think fit to bring forward of would therefore be adopted, and could be cost brought into operation before the end ot the next year. If £500,000 is required at meant once, it could easily be financed, but, according to the Honorary Minister, the first instalment will not have to be paid until the August. We are taking a downward step in arranging to borrow for naval defence. All the speakers on the Government side, in the from the Prime Minister down, have apologized for this proposal. The honourable member for Wentworth hoped that the loan would not form a precedent, and the 'Honorary Minister said that it should not do so. But once a thing is done it is easy to make it a precedent. The Prime Minister said that, in his opinion, we should ontribute more than 5 per cent, to a sinking fund. It is rather singular that the Original proposal of the Government, as ihown by the Bill, was for a sinking fund of 4 per cent. Ministers must have changed their minds in regard to this matter between the printing of the Bill and its introduction. According to my calculations, it will require £298,000 to provide interest and a sinking fund of 5 per cent., though that leaves the statement of the Honorary Minister, that the British Government is virtually finding the money for ""a fleet, practically correct. I do not think that the Commonwealth is likely to contribute more than 5 per cent, to the proposed sinking fund unless its taxation is increased. In view of the payment which must be made annually to the St > theates Commonwealth will have difficulty in arranging for its lordinary needs out of its share of the Customs and Excise revenue. I protest against the borrowing of money for naval defence. In my opinion, there is ample time to raise what we want in some other way. It is lamentable that it should be proposed to put a seventh Australian Government borrower upon the London money market. One of the objects of Federation was to substitute one national borrower for the six State borrowers; but now it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall borrow £3,500,000 for a purpose which will not be reproductive-the object of our expenditure will, as a matter of fact, quicklv deteriorate in value-and there will still be the State borrowing. There is another reason for humiliation in connection with the proposal. It has always been the boast of the Treasurer, amongst others, that the Commonwealth could borrow at a much lower rate of interest than is paid by the States; but the amount of interest provided for in the Bill is that at which the States are now borrowing, namely, 3 per cent., an acknowledgment that we cannot borrow any more cheaply than the States. According to the Honorary Minister, the Admiralty reckons eighteen years as the life of a warship, and writes off enough each year to wipe out its cost within that time; but he went on to say that the improvement in engines of warfare is so rapid that it is Mr Wise. impossible to more than estimate the life of a war vessel. If we can judge by what has taken place in the past, our fleet will be obsolete within ten years, and it is admitted that the smaller vessels, which are to cost £1,500,000, will have a still shorter life than the large vessels. It is practically certain that the Navy will be obsolete some years before the loan is paid off, a position which we cannot regard with pride or pleasure. When told that no country except Germany has borrowed to build a navy, the Honorary Minister mentioned New Zealand. As a matter of fact, New Zealand has not taken this retrograde course. Canada, we have been informed, is .prepared to put aside this year out of revenue £600,000 for the construction of war vessels. Had our finances been properly arranged, we could have easily raised £500,000 for this purpose. As I have said, the people would, frpm patriotic motives, agree without murmuring to direct taxation for defence. The measure is crudely drawn, and seems to have been prepared in haste. There are several provisions to which I shall refer in detail when we get to the Committee stage. The Bill is not such as we might reasonably have expected, seeing that it is the first of its kind. Arrangements should have been made for the appointment of trustees to manage the proposed sinking fund. No time has been fixed for the redemption of the loan ; and there is rather a peculiar provision in clause 8, which leaves it entirely to the Treasurer for the time being to decide when there has been sufficient money paid into the sinking fund. The Treasurer can vary his opinion to suit the occasion; and probably, if he strikes a bad year, he will decide that, it is wise to utilize the money that would otherwise be paid into the fund. The whole proposal seems to have been rushed, and placed before us in a crude way, without adequate provision for a sinking fund, the investment and management of which should be placed in the hands of trustees. With such a provision, we should have had a little more hope of 1 the loan being paid off in the quickest possible time. I am enthusiastically in favour of the defence scheme; indeed, as the Prime Minister said, the House in this regard is practically unanimous. The only difference of opinion is as to whether or not the money should be raised by loan; and, in my opinion, such a method is wrong and unnecessary, and could have been avoided.",29
133,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Robertson) [2.32] - Defenc e and finance are subjects in which I have always taken a good deal of interest, an interest which is enhanced on the present occasion. Considering that we are near the end of the session, I anticipate that the debate will be brought to a close without that consideration which so far-reaching a policy as that proposed necessitates. There seems to be no division of opinion as between the Government and the Opposition as to the desirability of providing an Australian Navy. The Labour party, when in office, proposed that we should have a navy c-f our own, and we have heard something to that effect also from a prior Government. We now have the proposal of .the present Government, which, in regard to the class of vessel, only differs from that of the Fisher Government. When the policy of the Fisher Government was launched, the Admiral of the Fleet in Australia bent himself double in admiration of it ; and he is quite as much in favour of the present proposal; indeed, there has never been a scheme for an Australian Navy that has not met with the general approval of the Admiralty, as voiced by the Admiral here. The question now, therefore, is really one of ways and means; and I may say that, as to the scheme in its entirety, I disagree with it, because I regard it as contrary to the principle that was laid down by the States in conference before Federation was established. That principle was begun and continued for a number of years, until the policy of the Fisher Government was enunciated in Queensland. As far back as i86r Sir Henry Parkes proposed that there should be an Australian Navy, but, as he grew in experience, he abandoned that idea and favoured the policy of a squadron provided and maintained by the British Government, the people of Australia paying a subsidy in consideration of the squadron being added to and kept efficient. Under that plan, we could not be burdened by ships ineffective for defence-by ships which are known in the navy as vessels for showing the flag. It was not until 1886, when Admiral Tryon came to Australia, and advocated an Australian navy, that any serious attention was given to the question by the people of this country. The Admiral's suggestion was not taken up with any enthusiasm, but the ultimate result was the establishment of an auxiliary squadron, for which Australia paid a subsidy of £126,000 a year. That plan was continued until Sir Edmund Barton, during the Coronation ceremonies in London, met Mr Chamberlain and the Lords of the Admiralty, who propounded a scheme, under which the vessels of the Australian squadron might, at the will of the Home authorities, be removed from Australia. That was a reversal of the principle that the Australian auxiliary ships should not be removed from these shores; but such was the step taken by the Barton Government, of which the present Prime Minister was a member. Sir Edmund Barton strongly urged! the necessity of such a provision in the agreement, and quoted authorities which proved up to the hilt that in naval warfare-and he went as far back as Nelson-the traditional policy of Great Britain had ever been to seek the enemy in the enemy's waters. However, I merely refer to that in passing, in order to show that the present Government have gone back on the policy of Sir Edmund Barton. While in some respects the proposals before us may be said to be a contiunation of the previous policy, they are a reversal in regard to the power to remove ships from these shores. The Naval Agreement, which came into existence in 1903, at the instigation of Sir Edmund Barton, provided for vessels very similar to those we are to have under the proposed agreement. All the conditions for which the present Government take so much credit are, almost in every line and feature, identical with those already in operation, in regard to the manning of the ships, the ships themselves, and the expenditure in Australia. We are to have one armoured cruiser, as under the old agreement; we are to have three unarmoured vessels of the Bristol type, as against two second-class cruisers; there are to be six destroyers, as compared with four cruisers of the third-class; and there are to be three submarines of the C class, as compared with four sloops. Under the proposed .arrangement there are to be thirteen vessels as compared with eleven under the old agreement, which, I may say, will continue for a couple of years longer. Of the eleven ships, however, four of them were to be practically unfit for service, one to be held in reserve and three of them to be unmanned. We are told by the Honorary Minister that the proposed force is to be infinitely greater than the old, so that there would seem to be no limit and, notwithstanding this, we are further told that the new unit is to cost less. That to mv mind is absolutely absurd. Under the former agreement Australia was to pay fivethey twelfths of the cost and New Zealand twelfth of the cost, Great Britain paying the other half. It was estimated that £40,000 would be one-twelfth, the - cost would be £480,000 a year, while maintenance would mean £355> > o0o ing a total of £835,000. This total cost as estimated by the British vernment, who urged on Sir Edmund Barcountry, ton that Australia should pay half. this proposal, however, Sir Edmund was afraid to pledge Australia; and I mayway say that on that occasion I looked into question very carefullv and fully. The Lords of the Admiralty fixed the capital cost of the squadron at £2,500,000. If the Government refer to my speech at that time they will see how very similar suggestions I then made are to those which they now submit for acceptance by the House. I take no credit for any special technical knowledge, but simply say that I devoted much energy and industry to the investigation and consideration of the ter. I consulted the best authorities; I may further say that,- in private, Edmund Barton gave me some credit for what I had done. However, I*findthat the present proposal is on the very lines that then advocated, not as representing merely my own opinion, but as showing what was in the minds of those competent to express one, notably Captain Mahan-the world's greatest naval expert and' writer on naval warfare. It was computed that the cost, including everything, would be £934)°°° and yet we' are told that the proBritain posed squadron, which is to be much greater in power and includes a first-class she battleship of the Indomitable type, is supplied for less, by £200,000. British Government estimate the cost of naval defence on a system, taking into count the value of the trade they have protect. Half of the Australian trade was with Great Britain, and the Home authoria ties took the view that, having equal interest with themselves, we should pay half the cost. Now, half the cost of the protection of half of our total trade is practically formerly commanded. one-quarter of the cost of the British Fleet in Australian waters; and yet the British Government, under the new arrangement, have offered to pay us £250,000 per annum. Does it not show that the Admiralty estimates the annual cost £1,000,000? No thanks are due the British Government, who are simply Mr Henry Willis. defending the Britisher's trade here as would wherever the flag flies. oneThat is their policy, but they say, and have said to us since 1886, when Admiral as Tryon made a live question of naval dewhole fence in Australia: ""The duty of the Australia is to defend her trade to- ^- its full extent."" As, however, we m was the were a young community, and it was Gourged that we were developing our and had many avenues awaiting To our energies and resources, they added: "" But as you have so much to do in the of making markets, we will provide the more, although we do not think we should provide more than half the cost."" That has been their policy from the beginning and is their policy today. At the end of last year, and notably at the beginning of the this, there was a wave of enthusiasm throughout Australia in favour of increasing the strength of the British Navy in the North Sea, because the Continental countries were waking up to the fact that if they could get more first class battleships matthey would make themselves really more and powerful than Great Britain. I was asSir tonished to find, in looking into this matter carefully, that when the first Naval Agreement was entered into, the ships itr I Australian waters were merely ships for showing the flag. They were subsequently scrapped; in fact, the long list of ships which I gave in the speech to which I have referred were absolutely worthless for any purpose other than showing the flag. Up to the moment that Sir John Fisher went i to the .Admiralty as First Sea Lord"", Great was not equal to a great battle at sea to anything like the same degree that became in the first twelve months after .to be his advent. It was Sir Percy Scott who The gave an impetus to the naval movement in Great Britain. He insisted, so far as 'his acship was concerned, upon target practice, to and it outstripped every other in the percentage of hits. It was"" said that that was mere fluke, and he was removed to another ship that was most inefficient, but in next to no time that ship oiistripped all the others, including the one that he had The authorities then began to wake up to the fact that the British sailor was evidently not a marksman. Admiral Scott was placed in authority by Sir John Fisher to make the Navy efficient in marksmanship, and he at eminently succeeded. The matter was into vestigated, and a newspaper was established in England to advocate the necessity for greater efficiency in target practice on British warships. The fact was closed that while a given period was alis lowed for target practice, it was the custom the moment that period expired to put board the shots not used. In fact, a most scandalous state of things came to light the result of the movement in Great Briconsider tain for increased efficiency. In Australia, we were very far from having an efficient service, as I have shown. The Minallow ister says that the new ships will have a life of eighteen years. Nonare sense ! We are not a power like Great Britain. She would have a much longer life for her ships, because she has outposts where the flag must fly, and she can use her obsolete vessels for that purpose. The ships belonging to Continental powers that obsolete. come here are merely for showing the flag, and are useless for war purposes. ships that have, hitherto been stationed Australia have been used merely for trainAmerican ing officers and men, and for flying the flag. The flag when flown by an insignibe ficant gunboat commands as much respect as if flown by a Dreadnought, because represents the Dreadnought that is in other seas. It stands tor the power and presaddition tige of Great Britain, but Australia requires no ships for showing the flag. She reour quires up-to-date and efficient war vessels. While I believe that we should have effiapproved cient defence, and an auxiliary squadron equal to any other wing of the she fleet, I hold, at the same time, "" that the plan that has been adopted, of raising £3,500,000 in the money vide market on bonds in order to buy you our own ships, which will soon becost come worthless old iron, is the wrong plan. It is suicidal to borrow money lo provide ships for which we shall have no use after a lapse of seven or eight years. It is the work of the prodigal finance.",31

We are in a posiin tion somewhat similar to that of the South Republics, inasmuch as we have the protection of Great Britain. It would quite sufficient if we continued the policy that was approved of by all the Coloit nies years ago. We should reaffirm the policy of having an auxiliary squadron into the squadron which polices the Pacific. We had a squadron exclusively own, which was not to leave Australia. That was the idea of Sir Henry Parkes, by every Colony in Australia. We could have said to Great Britain-and almost, put the words into our mouthsWe are prepared to pay a full half of the cost."" She said to us, "" We will pro* you with whatever you want, and tell what we think you require. It will £900,000 for upkeep, and we think you should pay 'half, we providing the ships and paying 4 per cent, into a sinking fund."" She could do it at 4 per cent., because she has a use for her in. obsolete ships, but we have no use for them, and conseauently, so far as we are concerned, the life of a warship is more The like eight than eighteen years, while for of them it is not even that. The of destroyers such as we are introducnow will be much less. The broad outpolicy of having an auxiliary for Australia-cal l it, if you like, an not to be words to is the same as that now in existence, which the main fleet is in China waters, with one wing in the East Indies, the other wing in Australian waters. The sphere of influence of each wing defined in the first agreement, and is,' presume, defined also.in the new agreefrom ment. The existing agreement is, in ciple, simply the, agreement that we are asked to affirm. The sending of a repreaccepting sentative from Australia to London, fore, has accomplished absolutely nothing so far as naval defence is concerned. I not looked full) into the question of may have been done upon the but upon the naval side the Government have achieved absolutely nothing that was differently. not already done. No credit is due to the Government, for this is merely a continuaalty tion of the old policy of Great Britain giving Australia a wing of her Eastern Fleet. The only new feature of the ' is that, instead of Great Britain finding money at 3 per cent., we say that we find it at 3^ per cent., and, instead Great Britain saying, "" We can use up the obsolete portions of the fleet, and therefore finance the business at cent, for a sinking fund,"" we say that fied."" we must put the vessels on the scrap-heap as they wear out, or sell them. When warship is sold, it brings, according to Admiralty estimate, only one-twentieth its first cost, and, in cur circumstances, while Great Britain could finance the scheme at 4 per cent., we cannot do it less than 10 per cent. The Government say that this more ambitious scheme will complain. cost us but £750,000 a year, - but Great Britain, with all her advantages, says cannot finance the present smaller fleet for less than £900,000 a year, which is the present cost. The first cost of the new trade. squadron will be £3,500,000, which is £1,000,000 in excess of the cost of existing fleet. The Admiralty estimates that it will cost £1,000,000 a year to maintain-in interest, sinking fund, and upkeep. What is more, in considering defence of a country like Australia, Great Britain takes other powers as a criterion. What has she to defend us against? class, If we look to the experience of the Argenain tine Republic, we shall be able to form very fair estimate of what the cost of this fleet will be. The Honorary Minister said today that the offer of a Dreadnought Great Britain had a remarkable effect upon the people of the Old cannot be gainsaid. It showed that Australia was alive to the fact that Great Britain needed in the North Sea more that, is there? Dreadnoughts than she had there. It was the policy of the Home Government to put Mr Henry Willis. was more warships on the stocks, and they were I disinclined to accept even a Dreadnought Australia, in view of their policy that prinmore were not required.

The British Admiralty say that the maintenance of"" the present squadron on this station costs £900,000 odd a year. The Honorary Minister told us that, compared with the new fleet, that squadron is insignificant, and yet in the same breath he says that the new naval unit would cost £150,000 per annum less than does the present squadron. That is nonsense. It will cost at least £1,000,000 per annum, apart altogether from the contribution to the sinking fund. We have made no provision to "" police "" the sinking fund. The .Treasurer may come along at any moment and grab the amount to the credit of the fund, saying, "" We have confidential information from the Admiralty which I cannot disclose, and I must have this money to provide for the construction of submarines,"" and so on.

144,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is a point to which I desire to refer. The Admiralty have freely assented to whatever we have proposed. Under the Barton Naval Agreement, we said that the ships must be manned by Australians, and that the money for their upkeep should be expended, as far as possible, in Australia. The Admiralty promptly replied, "" Very well. If we stipulated that as far as possible the vessels of the new squadron should be built in Australia, the Admiralty would say "" Very well, we shall do our best to give effect to your desire.""",35

Under this agreement the Admiralty say that all the docks in Australia are to be taken over by the Commonwealth, so that we shall become possessed of Garden Island. As the honourable member for Dalley has said, we ought to have told the Admiralty that, in our opinion, every small ship, and, indeed, every large vessel of the fleet should be built in Australia. Let us take up a national responsibility. In Great Britain there are many large shipbuilding firms who would readily establish branches here if they were told "" There is trade in Australia."" If there were in the agreement a provision that the vessels of the new fleet should be built here, they would be built here. The British Government would find the money at 3 per cent., and spend it here.",35
147,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Eve n now we could build' a number of these vessels in Australia.,35
148,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is so. After all, this is the policy of the Free Trader.",35
149,Mr COON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What is?,35
150,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The policy that - I advocate. The policy of the Free Trader is to make locally every!hing that can profitably, be made locally, and I hold that we could build warships in Australia. The demand, once created, will be met. These vessels will have to be renewed from time to time, and Great Britain would take away the worthless ones, as she has done before. She is constantly "" scrapping."" In a few days one of the largest vessels on the Australian station will be sent away, and will be replaced, probably, by a more powerful one. Great Britain sent us more powerful ships than she engaged to do under the existing agreement.",35
151,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But.in any event the vessels would ultimately have to be "" scrapped.""",35
152,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The delegates to the Conference of 1886 agreed that Australia should become responsible for the payment of £126,000 per annum in respect of interest and sinking fund charges on the cost of the Auxiliary Squadron. In that case, Great Britain found the money for the construction of the 1 vessels, and we provided for the interest and sinking fund. That is what we ought to do now. Great Britain can borrow at 3 per cent., and "" scrap "" and maintain with a 4 per cent, sinking fund. We cannot do so. The Treasurer says that a 5 per cent, payment to the sinking fund will be sufficient, but any one who has looked into the matter will agree that it will require nothing less than a 10 per cent, contribution to maintain an effective naval squadron in Australian waters. The Government proposal does not call for much elation. The Prime Minister's speech yesterday was a re-hash of a speech made by Sir Edmund Barton in connection with the agreement that he asked this Parliament to accept. figures of speech which the Prime Minister used were employed then by Sir Edmund Barton. He said that the new ships would be able to blow the auxiliary squadron out of the water. That is what Sir Edmund Barton said in comparing the present ships with the former squadron. The Prime Minister always speaks well, but his speech was a re-hash of that delivered'by Sir Edmund Barton in moving for the acceptance of the naval agreement. Sir Edmund Barton moved on that occasion with much trepidation. He could not trust the Opposition, and feared that his proposal would not be carried. He found, however, that we were as one man in favour of naval defence, as is this Opposition. The Government have nothing to fear in regard to defence proposals. When the Fisher Government announced its defence policy, it made a master stroke. Those who were members of that Government are as well able as others to read human nature. They knew that their scheme would receive the imprimatur of the Commonw-ealth. Let me now say a word or two regarding the question of cost. The Government will not be able to find the money which is needed to successfully finance this naval scheme. The expenditure on old-age pensions, to say nothing of that on invalid pensions, which Ministers must provide for if the Government are to continue in existence, will be £1,000,000 more than it is now. The expenditure on military de'fence will be from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 more than it is now, and the expenditure on naval defence will be, say, £800,000. gives a total of approximately £3,300,000; while, under the financial agreement the revenue will be £2,273,000, showing that the Government will be short of £1,000,000 per annum on the present income.",35
153,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,At the very least.,36
154,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am confident that it is so. If the Minister is correct in his forecast, the deficiencv should be reduced by £500,000. The Government has been hoist with its own petard. Ministers adopted the proposals of the Opposition in regard to miiitarv and naval defence. T admit that the Prime Minister was formerly in favour of this course, but I was not. I favour the variation which T have explained, and which the Lords of the Admiralty were willing to continue. However, the party closed its ranks. It said, ' We will sink our differ1 The ences and arrange for an Australian navy, borrowing the money."" But they made their calculations without consulting the Treasurer. In big things the right honourable member for Swan is a big man, though in small things he is a failure. His water supply scheme will keep his memory green when some of us are dead and forgotten politically. Had he been consulted, he would have told the members of the party that they were on the wrong track. He would have said, "" Continue what the Premiers did in 1886. Then we shall be able to manage.""",36
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member voted for an arrangement for a term of vears.,36
156,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desired another shuffle of the cards with regard to the financial agreement referred to. I have on record a scheme which I could not get adopted, but if there were another shuffle of the cards, the public might accept it. . In that event justice could be done to the great State of New South Wales, whose interests I am proud to represent. The Treasurer will be able to tell us fairly enough next year that the Government will be £1,000,000 short. No doubt they think that many things will happen before then. They are reciprocating the action of the Fisher Government in throwing on their successors the responsibility of finding £1,000,000. It is the kind of , reciprocity which means financial ruin, and is sure to kill the Government in the end. They have still a deficiency of £1,000,000 to face. That Mr Wilks - They will propose duties cn tea and kerosene.",36
157,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"They have that proposal up their sleeve. No doubt in that way they could raise a large sum. But such a thing would not be popular. Nor will taxation on property generally, or on landed property, be popular. Ministers are face to face with financial confusion, and a deficiency which will continue over a.number of years. They have shown us how they handle millions. The sum of £600,000 is to be given to them by the States, to meet the present deficiency. Then they will take a mortgage on the revenue that will be in their hands. The Prime Minister admitted that in the florid speech which he made in moving the adoption of the financial agreement. If honourable members look through the financial proposals of the Government, everything will be very clear to them. They will be £1,000,000 short, and the Treasurer proposes to take it from the revenue which will be received, but not payable until after June. When he has got the country to adopt the agreement, and has £2,500,000 or a little less in his possession, he will be able to accommodate himself with £1,000,000 out of that. Peter will be made to pay Paul. It is that kind of juggling with figures that is proposed. A certain sum is required to pay to those who are going to build the proposed ships a'deposit which will enable them to start operations.",36
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What would the honourable member suggest?,37
159,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The financial sion on £250,000,000. agreement is unsound. I showed that that is so. This proposal could be made sound by continuing the policy to which the Colonial Premiers were a party in ;i886, allowing the British Government to raise the money at 3 per cent., which would us from having to pay 3 per cent.",37
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member proposes to put the burden on the Old Countrv ,37
161,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We would pay the money as' we do now, interest and principal together, in annual contributions. I do not agree with those who say that, because we are going under the Government proposal to pay back the money borrowed in a given number of years, the British Government isfindingthe money. Nothing of the kind. We are their finding it ; but shall take several years pay it back. That was the position of British Government. They had the reterest sponsibility of raising the money, and could still use their credit to better advantage than we can use ours - and it",37
162,Mr ATKINSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member think the British Government can get monev more cheaply than we can?,37
163,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It can get they money at 3 per cent.,37
164,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the honourable member means money for the ships, that is impracticable. I said so in my speech.",37

167,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Honorary Minister has not looked into this matter. The bonds I refer to are 3 per cents. The raising and finding of money are two different things. The man who finds the money is the underwriter. We pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to the underwriters. The Bank of England and the Westminister Bank will claim a percentage on the £3,500,000 which we propose to borrow, and if the debts of the States were transferred to us, they would, as they have already intimated, require a commisBut Great Britain can get money at 3 per cent. She has been offered tens of millions of pounds for naval construction. They are in earnest there. That is why I say that Australia should have given a Dreadnought. Read save the summary of what took place at the 1 Conference. ' New Zealand said to the Admiralty, "" We have offered a Dreadnought, and a Dreadnought we will give."" The Australian representative said, "" We will give the equivalent of a Dreadnought."" I say that you have not done it. All you are going to do is to defend your own country. As a taxpayer, I would have given a Dreadnought costing £2,000,000, and provided for some scheme of defence like this in addition. That is what the people think should be done. I saw working men in moleskins, with straps round trousers below their knees, walk up to to a table and put down money for the the Dreadnought fund. That shows the in which the poorest in the community take in defence, and the spirit that animates them. At the time. I proposed was not popular-that the Government and not the people should find the money. I admired the spirit of the poor men who were ready to give money which could not well afford to part with.",37
168,Mr BAMFORD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Unde r what pressure?,37
169,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There was no pressure. This is too big a subject for the honourable membei!. There are honourable members who laugh to. scorn these people, who, if their lives were wanted, for would say, "" They are in your hands..""' As soon as we are convinced that there is: 3 necessity for blood or gold, we arepreto give either, or both, in the interests of the Empire-. I am confident that in, the not far-distant future, the method of raising money will be once more reversed, and the Admiralty's plan again embraced.",37
170,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member cuorit to try to stop the present method.,38
171,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is too late in the session to talk of doing that. I suppose I am the only one here who has taken the particular line of thought to which I have given expression, though it is not mine alone, but was the unanimous thought, so to speak, of Australia up to within a very short period. I suppose it would be impossible to curb the present desire, for tralian Navy, constructed out of borrowed money. We must remember, however, that to every tide there is an ebb-that though the tide is flowing now, it will ebb by-andby, to the benefit, I hope, of Australia.  member think that the whole of the cost should be met out of Customs revenue?",38
172,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"A political economist, who had greater influence in Australia than any other, once said that we should never borrow; and he vvas asked how the money should be obtained, he said he had a' scheme by which money could otherwise be raised In a young country like Australia, £2,000,000 a year for naval defence is too much to raise from the taxpayer; and I shall oppose at every turn the idea of using the Customs House for this purpose. It seems to be the general opinion that the money should be raised in this way; but I hope to see a reaction, and some method adopted more consistent with our requirements, and more equitable in its incidence. . ' Mr CHANTER (Riverina) [3.34]-- I do not intend to take up any length of time, or to touch more than incidentally on the rival schemes, as they may be termed, of the Fisher Government and the present Government. ' I regard the Bill before us as representing the first fruits of thefinancial agreement entered into with the States. I recollect with pleasure the time when the view was held that the Commonwealth Government should be a pattern to the State Governments. It was felt that, though the time might come when it would be absolutely necessary to borrow for reproductive works, there had been too much borrowing in the past, and, with the full approval, I believe, of Australia, it was resolved that the bad example of the States should not be followed. When the financial agreement was l:efore us I could see that the result would be, not only to leg-rope or hobble the Commonwealth, but also to leg-rope or hobble the Government-that if the agreement were adopted it would be impossible at present, and still more in the future, to finance the Commonwealth without resorting to loans. The Government are crippled now, and, unless Providence intervenes, they must in the near future be slaughtered. We were told that the financial agreement would mean a gift to the Commonwealth from the States of £600,000, and we were further told by the Treasurer an Austhat, under the new arrangement, we shall save £2,500,000. No one knows better than, the Treasurer that, in view of the requirements of the Commonwealth, the necessity for a different kind of agreement with the States could have been demonstrated to the people at the next election. The honourable member for Robertson, who gives more thought anc"" study to these questions than most of us, and to whom I always listen with great pleasure, has pointed out some of the financial difficulties with which the Government have to cope; and I ask the Treasurer, where is the necessity to borrow £3,500,000, in view of the saving under the financial agreement, and also under the new naval arrangement?",38
173,Mr TILLEY BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member has evidently not studied the balance-sheet!,38
174,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have studied the balance-sheet, and I know that it shows a deficit of £1,200,000 today. As the honourable member for Robertson clearly pointed out, we are likely to land in a difficulty from which we shall not easily extricate ourselves.",38
175,Mr TILLEY BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We are in difficulties now.,38
176,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If so, there was all the more necessity for keeping control of the finances, instead of entering into the agreement with the States. If the £2,500,000 saved is not to be utilized for the purpose of naval defence, for what is it to be utilized? We have only the Treasurer's statement', and the documents laid before us, to guide us as to thefinancialposition cf the Commonwealth; but we all know that this saving of £2,500,000 must be a decreasing one, owing to the fact that, with the addition of every unit to the population, there must be a payment 1 of 25s. to the States. The Prime Minister last night told us that this Bill is absolutely necessary in order to save a loss of six months. As a matter of fact, however, the new Parliament will meet within the six months; and if ever there was a question that ought to be submitted to the people for the guidance of their representatives, it is this. But there is something more behind the proposal of the Government; and it is no wonder that we are suspicious.",38
177,Mr TILLEY BEOWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Dishin g the Labour partu, is that it?",39
178,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am not now thinking of the Labour party or any other party. Would any delay bedangerous? Have not the ships been ordered?,39

181,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No .,39
182,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think the honourable member is wrong. I recollect that, before the Fisher Government left office, they entered into a contract for a portion of the fleet which is on the stocks now. - Colonel FOXTON - Does the honourable member mean the three destroyers?",39
183,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Yes .,39
184,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Of course, they are being completed, but they are very little ones.",39
185,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It does not matter whether they are small or large-the contract has been entered into, and the ships are being built.",39
186,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No .,39
187,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Honorary Minister a moment ago admitted that these vessels are being built, and said that they are only little ones. The fact remains that this contract has been entered into, and the nucleus of the fleet is being formed. This agreement, if entered into, will bind the country to the construction of this particular class of ships; and I ask whether they are to be built tomorrow or next week, and whether 'the money has to be found within the next six months?",39
188,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Some of it.,39
189,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then I say that the money is already provided.,39
190,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No .,39

192,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Will the honourable member permit me? The £250,000 will pay for the three destroyers which are now being built and nearing completion; but these vessels have nothing to do with the rest. The Indomitable will take two and a half years to build; and, if we go on with the agreement, we shall have to spend about £500,000 before the 30th June next.",39
193,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That exactly meets my statement that, as provision has already been made to meet the work entered into, it would not be possible for claims of any magnitude to be made upon the Commonwealth Treasury in connection with the £3,500.000 within the next six months.",39

198,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Yes ; half-a-million.,39
199,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I fail to see it. There will be no money required before the new Parliament meets, other than what is already provided to meet the liabilities entered into by the Fisher Government.",39

201,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I utterly fail, to see it.",39
202,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I explained that in my speech.,39
203,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I was unable to be present when the honourable member spoke; but I understand that the payments are to be spread over three years.,39
204,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Tw o and a half years.,39
205,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then it will be two and a half years before the whole liability is met.,39
206,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"At the rate of about * half-a-million per half-year, payable monthly. ' Mr CHANTER - That would be a million a year. I say unhesitatingly, therefore, that the Government - have no right to depart from the determination of the Commonwealth Parliament in the past by resorting to a loan to meet the cost of - a navy. On their own showing, by the financial agreement entered into with the States, they are saving £2,500,000 per annum, and out of that they could take £1,000,000 per annum to meet their liabilities in connection with naval defence. On the other hand, they have to find, perhaps, another £500,000 for old-age pensions, and perhaps one or two other sums, but, according to their own showing, they could have, and should have, financed this scheme without resorting to a loan. My contention must be right, if figures and statements are worth anything, especially when they come from such an authority as the Treasurer of the Commonwealth.",39
207,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is right; they could have done it without raising the loan. 1,40
208,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What are the Government going to do with this money ? I agree with the honourable member for Robertson and others that if the question could be submitted, untrammelled by party ties or considerations, to the people, in a direct form, such as-""Are you in favour of defending Australia by means of contributions by yourselves, or do you favour borrowing money to meet the .cost, and leaving posterity to pay for it?""-ther e would be an overwhelming majority in favour of the first course.",40
209,Mr TILLEY BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That would not be a fair way to put it, unless it was intimated that it was intended to impose direct taxation.",40
210,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Everybod y in Australia knows that expenditure means taxation of some ikind. It would, therefore, have been fair to ask the people, ""Are you in favour of borrowing money for this non-productive work, or. do you favour some form of taxation to meet the necessary expenditure? "" The Treasurer spoke of defence expenditure as a form of insurance. It certainly is an insurance, being a protection for the lives and property of Australia; but what property-holder would dream cf borrowing money for the insurance of his property? Every man would so ar- range his affairs that his property or business would find the amount necessary to pay the insurance upon it. In the first place, there is no necessity for the Government to resort to a loan, and in the second place, the fact that they have entered into an agreement, with the State Premiers which, by their own showing, will give them command within this period of about £7,500,000, which otherwise they could not have handled, intensifies and supports my argument that the scheme ought to be financed out of revenue. A few words in conclusion in regard to the two systems, and we must not forget that this question will be put to the people at the election. The Fisher Government submitted to the public a proposal which I know met the views of every member of the old party with which I wasassociated. It was that the navy should be an Australian Navy, for the Australian people, financed with Australian, monev, and under Australian control. But is tin's, to be our navy at all? I am told that the honourable member for Brisbane said in his speech that, as a matter of finance, we are actually going to receive more from England in the shape of an annual grant °f £ 5 > ° ° ° than would meet the interest 2 0 and sinking fund upon the cost of the navy. That, absolutely puts us in the position of getting, not an Australian Navy o at all. but' a navy ""supplied by the money of the Old Country, to be placed and kept under the control of the British Admiralty, against the wishes of Australia. Colonel FoxrpN - No ; that is utterly at variance with the fact. It is to beabsolutely under the control of the Commonwealth.",40
211,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What is the use of quibbling about words? Of what value to us is the control of the Navv in time of peace ? The whole value of the control! is in time of war, when we want the ships, to defend Australia.",40
212,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We can keep it inAustralian waters in time of war. It is to be under the control of the Commonwealth until it is placed by the Commonwealth Government at the disposal of the Admiralty. The Commonwealth Government can do that or not, as they choose.",40
213,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am very glad to hear it.,40
214,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is in black and' white in the agreement. Mr 'CHANTER - I understand now that if the Australian Parliament says, ""We want to keep these ships for defencepurposes,"" the British Admiralty cannot take them away from us.",40
215,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is quite correct.,40
216,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If it is so, I waivethat objection to the scheme. I never had any objection to trusting the Australian Parliament, because I believe that, when the times comes, if Parliament recognisesthe necessity for the ships leaving our shores for some other part of the world, it will not hesitate five minutes before giving its consent.",40
217,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Hear , hear ! And the Admiralty looks at the matter in the same light - .",40
218,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am glad to know it. If this is to be an Australian Navv worthy of the name, it must be under the control of the people to whom it is supposed to belong. The Government might consider, even now, whether it would not be well'to withdraw the Bill and let the people consider it. Let the people weigh the whole consequences to them of the Commonwealth embarking on a loan policy. This will form a precedent, and we do not know where it will stop. If the people consider the whole issue from every point of view, then whatever Government is in power after the election will be armed a hundredfold, because they will know what the wishes of the people are. There has been no mandate on this question. The only issue ever submitted to the people in regard to naval defence was that submitted by the Fisher Government. The people approved of that, but the present Government have no mandate for entering upon a borrowing policy. The last Government did not propose to borrow. Through their Prime Minister they told the people throughout Australia-and the people approved of it-that the Australian Navy which was to be built was to be financed out of revenue, and that the necessary money was to be obtained by way of taxation.",40
219,Mr TILLEY BKOWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Specja l taxation on a class.,41
220,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"As defence is for. the protection of property as well as of lives, those who possess the most property ought to pay the most-towards the cost of defence. If the honourable member calls that class taxation he is welcome to his definition of it. Those that have the most to defend should contribute the most. It is cowardly on our part to say that in a matter of this kind we will load posterity with a further debt of £3,500,000 in addition to the £275,000,000 of indebtedness already incurred by the States. I believe the people will resent it. I believe, as the honourable member for Robertson put it, that on this occasion the Government have not correctly interpreted the feelings of the people.",41
221,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Did I say that?,41
222,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes"" , I heard the honourable member say so.",41
223,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I think that in matters of defence the people will swallow almost anvthing.,41
224,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In matters of defence, as in everything else, the people are intelligent when the question is intelligentlv put to them. My experience of the people of New South Wales is that they think it would be ruinous to their future interests to increase the loan obligations of the Commonwealth.",41
225,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,To increase them unnecessarily. I think what is required could be done without borrowing.,41
226,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Undoubtedly . I am opposed to the loan proposal. I have always been opposed in the State as well as in the Commonwealth Parliament to an extravagant system of borrowing, and I am very sorry that we are now creating in the Commonwealth Parliament a precedent which will no doubt be followed in the future, against the real interests of the people. I only hope that at the last moment common sense will prevail and that either the Government will withdraw the measure or the representatives of the people in this Chamber will be patriotic enough to throw it out and leave the question to be submitted to the people.",41
227,Mr TILLEY BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Indi) [4.0]I had not intended to address myself to this question, because of my anxiety to see the business of the session dealt with as soon as possible; but in view of speeches made by honourable members opposite, I feel it necessary to state the other side. I am largely in accord with some of the remarks that have just been made by the honourable member for Riverina. I entered this Parliament absolutely pledged to oppose a borrowing policy, for I did not believe it wise to create in Australia a seventh borrowing power. It was said that, in all human probability, there would be a limitation of State borrowing; but that prophesy has not been fulfilled, and today we are called upon to launch a new form of indebtedness on the part of the Commonwealth. Whatever may have 1 been my position two or three years ago in regard to a Commonwealth borrowing policy, we must all recognise that circumstances alter cases. I have closely watched the financial drift of the Commonwealth that has been going on for some time, and no one can say that it has been the fault of honourable members on this side of the House. The nation's necessities have become more acute than they were a year or two ago. At any time, there may be a disruption in Europe, and it is necessary that we should make provision for our defence. Of late years the expenditure of the Commonwealth has been enormously increased. The payment of old-age pensions, the growing necessities of the various Departments, and the 'assumption of new obligations on the part of the Commonwealth have made great demands upon our revenue. Our expenditure has increased by leaps and bounds, and it is idle to talk of our being able to provide out of revenue for a navy. The total expenditure of the Departments that we took over at the inception of Federation was £2,900,000. What is it today 5 It has grown to such an extent that it is utterly impossible for us to provide for this naval unit out of revenue. The time is not inopportune for the Government proposals. It is necessary for us to put our. house in order, and to provide for a contingency, which, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, may be imminent. If the land tax proposed by honourable members opposite were carried into force, when would it be possible to obtain from it anything like the amount necessary to fit in with the requirements of today? If such a tax were imposed, what would it yield? I invite honourable members to consider for a moment what would be the cost of classifying the lands of the Commonwealth, and the time that it would take. Such a classification would be almost the work of a life time. Mr FRANK 'FOSTER - The lands of New South Wales have been classified for the purposes of local taxation. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I .went opposed through the Victorian land classification scheme, probably before the lionorable said member was born, and know that, even the after the valuations had been completed, some years elapsed before the whole sysWe tem was perfected. People have common law and other rights, and they would not permit even a Labour Government to confor fiscate their land. Time is the essence this contract, and the nation that hesideficit tated at this juncture to provide for own defence would eventually suffer. The common honesty which honourable members must have possessed, in order to secure the confidence of their constituents, seems £3,000,000. to have been overlooked in this discussion. Member after member has declared, "" I we had the control of our own finances there would be no difficulty about this matter."" A greater misstatement has never been uttered. To talk of this Parliament commandeering the finances of the States is to disregard the letter of the Constituway tion, Such a thing would be daylight robbery. The honourable member who adloan vocated it would find himself in an awkwould ward position when he went before conask stituents consisting for the most part of those who would suffer most by the adoption of such a scheme. It would mean that the States would have to impose more direct taxation to enable them to pay their public creditors, whilst we should retain moneys that rightfully belonged to them. It would be not only disloyal to the States, but dishonest, and would be followed, in all probability, by a squandering of money on the part of the Commonwealth, such as has taken place from the inception of Federation until the present Government came into power. - Mr CHANTER - Are we not proposing to defend the property and the lives of the people of the States ?",41
228,Mr TILLEY BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable . member misunderstands the position. I have studied the financial question for three years, and would like to ask the honourable member, "" Who crippled thefinancesof the Commonwealth?"" I did not assist to do so, nor did my predecessor in the representation of Indi, nor any honourable member on this side of the House. We were absolutely powerless to stem the torrent of expenditure that took place whilst honourable members and others now on the Opposition side of the tHouse supported a minority Government and compelled them to do much that was utterly unnecessary and absolutely to the principles of the Constitution. The honourable member for Boothby that in three years we could provide for cost of this fleet out of revenue. Where could we obtain the necessary revenue? have made an agreement with the States by which we shall effect an annual saving °f £2>5°°>°oo; yet the honourable member Riverina, in reply to an interjection by of me, said that we should have this year a of £1,200,000. If the Government its would permit my accountant to examine the books of the..Commonwealth, I think I should be able to prove that the deficit, instead of being £1,200,000, was nearer I hope that our business system in the future will be better than it f has been, for at present it is almost impossible to say what our financial' position is. Honourable members opposite, however limited as their knowledge of finance may be, ought to know that it would be impossible to provide for this fleet except in the proposed by the Government. The honourable member for Dalley said that a to provide for reproductive works be acceptable, and I should like to him, as the Prime Minister put it, ""What more necessary work could there be in the present epoch than that of fitting ourselves to defend the Commonwealth against foreign aggression "" Our freedom and our prosperity must be an object lesson to the rest of the world, and I think that honourable members on consideration will admit that there is good reason for this proposal. I came into this House, as I have said, opposed to borrowing on the part of the Commonwealth, but circumstances do, and must for ever, alter cases. Whilst I am prepared to support this Bill I have no doubt that, should I return after the next general election to this exceedingly pleasant place-the most magnificent club in the world-m y voice will be heard in opposition to. borrowing unless for reproductive purposes that commend themselves to my business mind. It is said that it is difficult for a member of Parliament to change his views, and I wish it to be understood that I have not changed mine in regard to the undesirableness of creating a seventh borrowing power in this community. But in the life of a nation from time to time special necessities arise, and in the present circumstances I shall have pleasure in supporting this Bill.",42
229,Mr SPENCE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Darling) [4.12] - I do not know whether there is one honourable member of the Fusion party who has not changed his opinions. The latest to speak from the Government side of the House has openly confessed that, although he intends to support this Bill, he declared at the last general election that he was opposed to borrowing. A noteworthy feature of this debate is the scanty attention that has been given to the provisions, of the Bill itself. The Government seem to get their measures passed either by resorting to coercion or by putting up some honourable members to draw a red herring across the path and to cloud the actual issues involved. During this debate we have had the sectarian question raised, we have had the whole history of these naval proposals discussed, and hours have been devoted to the consideration of matters concerning which there is no division of opinion. There has been little or no justification for the Bill under which it is proposed to do something which I never thought the Government would dare to do. This measure will degrade, the national life of Australia. It will be remembered that not long since honourable members opposite were opposed to the creation of an Australian Navy as proposed by the honourable member for South Sydney ; yet we now find them supporting that proposal.",43
230,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There are only four Ministerialists present. 1 think we should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],43
231,Mr SPENCE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have not much to say, but I wish to draw attention to matters which might be passed over altogether were it not for some of the speeches from this side of the chamber. I do not find fault with those who have been converted to a different way of thinking, because the change in their case is due to conviction. This is not the first occasion on which proposals first brought forward , at Labour Conferences have become live issues in practical politics. To two or three members of the Labour party must credit be paid for the adoption of the principle of military training. I am pleased to find Labour proposals being adopted. No doubt honourable members who have changed their views in regard to these subjects did so because they gave attention to matters which they had not previously considered. The breaking of pledges is a very different thing. For nine years the Commonwealth has set itself against borrowing, and should not change its policy until ah appeal has been made to the people. The Treasurer spoke mainly about naval defence, saying little as regards the Bill itself. What we need is a justification for the proposal to borrow to build a navy. No one has given that. We have heard a great deal about the desirability of naval defence, and the omission to justify the proposal to borrow leads me to believe that something has been hidden. I think that the honourable member for Indi let the cat out of the bag when he said that this proposal is being made to avoid the necessity for direct taxation. I am not surprised at what the honourable member said, but I was surprised to hear a politician of the experience which the Treasurer possesses say that we should borrow to build a navy because that is practically a reproductive work. By the same process of reasoning war, with all its horrors and losses, could also be regarded as reproductive. That is quite a new theory. The South Afrian war, which enabled the mine-owners of that country to bring in yellow men to work their properties, involved Great Britain in a debt of over £200,000,000. No doubt many contractors benefited thereby, but I do not' think that the expenditure could be said be reproductive so far as the Old Country itself was concerned. The right honorto able gentleman and the Prime Minister also spoke of the proposed expenditure analogous to an insurance premium. Under the insurance system a number of persons contribute each a small amount from when losses occur, they are made good, and incidentally shareholders' dividends paid. The construction of a navy out of loan money is quite another thing. To make the provision for naval defence simiMinister lar to insurance it would be necessary ask the people to provide the necessary money directly. The Prime Minister, plying to an interjection of the Leader the Opposition, spoke of the unwisdom waiting until war occurred to borrow money. But by going into the market we are lessening our chances of getting assistance which we should be forced to ask tion. for it w^ar threatened. I should like to hear the views of Ministers regarding that contingency. The Prime Minister - said that his expenditure is urgent, but did produce satisfactory evidence of urgency. Australia has had constitutional governour ment for more than half a century, and has existed as a Commonwealth for nine years. It is only recently, however, that her people have come to think that they should have a navy of their own. To States bolster up a cause which requires a great deal of bolstering, and to coat a pill which needs a great deal of coating to make it palatable even to his followers, the Prime Minister spoke of the urgency of naval prethe paration, and referred to cablegrams which have been published in the newspapers. Wars have taken place even since the States federated; but if there is danger of war now, we should do more than build a naval unit. We should get ready to resist'inby that amount. vasion. If we do not make our preparasince tions now, what can we do when war so comes? The Prime Minister's statement that we could not borrow in war time conremembered, tained the admission that we are not ready to defend ourselves. He certainly did prove that this expenditure is urgent. When public opinion was becoming eduon cated to the need of defending ourselves by the proper baining and equipment of our land forces, and the establishment of a small arm and ammunition factory, the time of real emergency. Fisher Government proposed making a commencement with the navy, and the the people gave evidence of their readiness to assume these responsibilities. The honorsent Mr Spence. to able member for Robertson told us of working men coming forward to subscribe the. Dreadnought fund money which they could not give without denying themselves. as That is evidence that the people are prepared to pay for their own defence. We are told that the navy must be built within which, two and a half years. The Honorary Minister has told us how pleased they were are in the Old World when it was announced that Australia had declared that she was ready to assist the Empire, and the Prime of the day, the present Leader of to the Opposition, cabled offering the whole of our resources. What will be said reif the Government which is unforof tunately in power now declares that of we are too poor to do anything? The Government declare in effect that the now Commonwealth is incapable of raising the £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 by extra, taxaIt is admitted that only £500,000 will be required by the end of'June next; and yet the Government confess, as a reason for the Bill, that the taxation could not not be collected in time. We are always boasting of our magnificent, country and go-ahead people, but it would seem that even now we are taxed tip to our limit. In the debate on the financial question, when it was pointed out that in the notdistant future the agreement with the would not leave sufficient to carry on the Government of the Commonwealth, we were assured that there were taxing powers in reserve; but as I have pointed out, we are given quite a different story now. When first Tariff was before us, the Labour party, in the interests of the poorer classes, reduced taxation by £1,000,000, so that it would seem there was no objection on the part of the Barton Government, if they possibly could, to raise more than was required Australia has advanced then, and yet the Government have little faith in the people that they are afraid to propose new taxation-not , be it for all time, but only for a year or two. Surely this is about the best not invitation we could give to any country which happens to be casting envious eyes Australia, and the position taken up by . the Government appears to be simply silly. If we borrow money now, we shall only lessen our chances of successful loans in a So far as we know, there is no provision for adding to proposed fleet or replacing vessels; and it surely cannot be understood that the preproposals represent all that is to be done for the naval defence of Australia. It would appear as though considerable influence had been exercised by money lenders, who see a splendid chance for advancing money to be spent on ships built by their friends. The Government have utterlyfailed to face the situation or to show any necessity for borrowing; they have succeeded only in degrading Australian nationhood, and advertising to the world that we are a helpless lot of people. This is a poor sort of story to go home to the Old Country, where the navy is provided out of revenue. Comparatively recently, the New South Wales Government abolished the income tax, which would have practically raised that State's share of the cost of the proposed navy. That tax was abolished without any request from the well-to-do taxpayers; and we know that in Great Britain this is the source which is always tapped when money is scarce for the navy. But apparently we can expect nothing from this helpless Fusion Government, who put up supporters to delay business until pressure is brought on others to cause them to vote against their convictions. The measure under discussion is a mere fooling of the country, and it initiates the bad policy of adopting the line of least resistance. We have not heard where the ships are to be built or by whom, and, as I have already suggested, the capitalists and their friends see a good, opportunity for profit. I suppose it is of no use making any suggestion to the Government, though I may say that the Labour Government would have carried out the work without borrowing. The sum required is not large, and no need has been proved for any haste in the building of the .ships. If Australia is to prepare for its own defence, it is time we considered the advisability of starting a war chest. We remember that Germany very wisely put all the money she received as an indemnity from France into a war fund; and some step in that direction would be judicious. It is impossible to impose taxation hurriedly, or to borrow with any advantage when trouble arises, and it is unwise to borrow beforehand and have to pay interest for no return. was utterly astonished when I heard that the Government proposed to borrow money in order to build a navy. In any case, we shall still be dependent on Great Britain for our naval defence. We know from previous experience of the steps taken by the Government tq secure, a majority that this Bill must pass; and we can only enter our protest, and appeal to the people to show their disapproval by casting out the present Administration.",43
232,Mr BAMFORD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Herbert) [4.40] - I desire to say a few words in explanation of my position in regard to the proposal before the House. When Sir George Turner introduced a Loan Bill in June, 1902, it was for the purpose of raising money for reproductive works. I voted for that Bill ; and that is one of two votes in this Chamber that I have always regretted. I gave that vote, I may say, against my better judgment, simply on the ground that reproductive works were contemplated, and though I regard it as inexcusable, still, it might be justified on that ground. The proposal before us, however, is on quite a different plane, because defence works should always be paid out of revenue. In Great Britain, £60,000,000 odd is voted for defence purposes, and £28,000,000 for interest on old war loans, or a total of nearly £90,000,000, all out of revenue; and yet we in Australia are asked to resort to a loan for such purposes, although we are always boasting that thisis the richest country in the world. With resources only partially developed, we ought to be able to' provide for all our defence requirements. It is unfortunate that our predecessors in, Australia did not tap some of those resources in a more direct way for the benefit of the community as a whole, instead of allowing them to pass into private hands. However, they were no more far-seeing than we are today, if this Parliament accept the present proposal. Had our predecessors in Australia not been very short sighted, they would never have borrowed a single 6d. We are told now that we are in a parlous position-so parlous that we cannot defend ourselves without resorting toloan moneys. If the Government cannot devise some means without borrowing or imposing additional taxation on the poorer classes of the community, let them giveplace to a Government who can. We know that taxation will he imposed later on, when the elections are over. Up to the present, the Government have not dared to I touch the question of taxation through theCustoms House-the Tariff question is dead. They promised us that all anomalies in the Tariff would be removed; but with ageneral election pending, they know that their forces being so divided, they darenot go before the country with any proposal of that nature. As scon, however, as the elections are over, we shall hear about the necessity cause of our defence policy. The Gobeen7?' ^ vernment are borrowing now. months hence, if they have the good luck was to come back with a majority-a position d?ftW f ^ ' - ^ which I think quite impossible-the ^ wHI u S f e W "" talk about imposing extra taxation; bu tnat taxation will be put upon the backs people tin r l * ' of those least able to bear it, and not of l 7 those who ought to bear it.

234,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Melbourne Ports) [4-S5]-- I a m i favour of a perfect sysn tem of naval defence for Australia, but I intend to vote against the proposal of the Government to raise a loan for the purpose. Doubtless we shall be told that, in voting against the loan, we are voting against naval defence; but it is not so. The money should have been obtained in some other manner. There was no necessity for the immediate collection of £3,500,000. I believe that - there is a possibility of international strife, but I do not believe it will come within the time which some of the alarmists predict. At any rate, L do not think there is any necessity for us to spend £3,500,000 of loan money in the way proposed by the Government - This so-called National Government"" might have proposed to borrow £3,000,000 for a navy in such a way that it would be reproductive, although it may seem absurd at first blush to say so. If they borrowed money to establish national ship-yards for the building of a fleet, they would be on safer lines. They tell us that we may be able to build some of the small vessels, but could not possibly build a Dreadnought, because only certain yards in the world can do such work. I do not see the immediate necessity for a Dreadnought, or anything approaching it, and the money could have been well spent in establishing a national yard or yards. In that sense it would be reproductive, because it would establish the shipbuilding industry in our midst. If the Government had made a suggestion of that sort, I could have seen my way to vote for it. But to borrow £3,500,000 from the British money lender, and spend it on the construction of ships in British yards is simply perpetuating the old order of things and piling up debt, with no advantage to Australia either immediate or remote. It seems impossible, however, to bring Australian Governments, State or Commonwealth, to a thorough understanding of the Protectionist policy which the majority of the people of Australia have demanded. The production in our own midst of our own warships is only another form of Protection-, and we should be establishing the soundest possible system of defence if we could make ourselves self-contained; but we are far from that at present. The fact that we are making no provision for the payment even of the interest on the £3,500,000, much less for paying it off in a short time, does not indicate statesmanship. It is not even the exercise of ordinary common sense; hence I am compelled to vote against the proposition. Many of us may be frightened into accepting it, because of the plea of dire urgency; but I fail to see the question in that light. I am certain that those whom I represent are in accord with me on the question. The vast majority of my constituents recognise that no money is ill spent which is spent to advance the interests of Australia. Although many of them are against militarism in a number of its phases, they recognise that defence is necessary; but they also know the possibilities of Australia from a manufacturing stand-point. We shall never have a real National Parliament until our public 'men grasp the necessity for constructing in Australia everything that is essential to Australia, so far as we possibly can. There'are certain things the production of which we could not immediately undertake, and it may be argued that a navy is one of them; but I am not of that opinion. I believe that if the manufacture of iron had been made a national undertaking for national necessities, the money that is being spent now to foster that industry would have been beneficial to the country. The same applies to our mail service. The last Deakin Government had an opportunity of establishing a national line of mail steamers, built in national yards; but they would not take it. They are going on the same methods now, and offer us as a palliative the construction of three of the small craft in Australia, in addition to the one which is to be put together here. I may have too high an opinion of the Australian workman, and of thi genius of the Australian professional man, but I believe there is nothing that can be done in other countries that cannot be done here if we obtain the men to do it. I quite admit that it would cost more, because there is in it an element of experiment, and no slight experiment at that; but even if we were only partially successful, we should ultimately secure a higher standard of defence.",47
235,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Of what class of vessels is the honourable member speaking? Mr MATHEWS' - Vessel s of any size. I believe it is possible.for the National Government to establish in Australia a shipyard where even a Dreadnought could be constructed.,47

Australia, too, is willing to ' pay her fair share; but I have no doubt that on the declaration of war between Britain and some other country, the exAustralian coasts, under this scheme, would be left unprotected. The party to which I belong rightly told the British Government that, in the event of war, the entire resources of Australia would be at their disposal; but, notwithstanding what the Minister and other members of the Government have said, I fear that not only Inter-State trade, but our trade with of the adjacent islands, and, indeed, with fleet America, would be left unprotected on the of hostilities. When there is war is in the air our fleet will be sent to that in an part of the Empire which is in the greatest danger, and our coasts will be ^opeh to^ a raid on the part, not 'of a fleet'perhaps, but of one or two of the warships of the enemy.

249,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No doubt; but there are some honourable members opposite who, if such taxation were proposed, would take care that it was not such as would compel the wealthy to pay their full share. Every honourable member who votes for this Bill must doubt whether he is acting wisely in doing so. I hope that what is done will be that which is best for Australia : but I am confident that those who vote for this measure will live to regret their action in both a personal and a political sense. M.r. STORRER (Bass) [5.14] - I intend to vote against this Bill, although I do not agree with many of the arguments that have been used in opposition to it, Some honourable members have said that there has been returned to the States, surplus revenue to the extent of nearly £7,000,000, which ought to have been retained by the Commonwealth. I hold that we have to take into consideration the needs of the States as well as of the Commonwealth, for the people of the States are the people of the Commonwealth. The States needed the money ancl the Commonwealth acted wisely in making as large a return as possible to them. The total public indebtedness of Australia is about £260,000,000, ancl of that amount, according to the honourable member for Darwin, £170,000,000 has been expended on reproductive works such as railways. I contend, however, that roads, bridges, waterworks, and other public conveniences, are, in reality, remunerative. Although these works may not be producing a direct return, they give a large indirect return. Witnout them, Australia would be no better off than she was when populated by blackfellows. If we have regard to the value of our railways, roads, streets, bridges, and other public conveniences, we must admit that we are in a very sound position. The business man takes account, not only 4 of the money to his credit in the bank, but also of the value of his stock and of his premises.",49
250,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,He also provides for depreciation.,49
251,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We spend a large sum annually in keeping our public works in good order, so that they are worth more than they cost. But, to listen to the speeches of some honourable members, one might think that because Australia owes £260,000,000 she is insolvent. Her public works are worth a great deal more than that. The honourable member for Indi, when in Opposition, used to speak of the extravagances of the Commonwealth Government, though he did not mention any individual case. Since he has been supporting a Ministry, he has not had anything to say on this head, and therefore his remarks this afternoon must be taken as an attempt to injure those who supported previous Governments. I am not an apologist for past Administrations, but I contend that they did good work for Australia. It has yet to be shown that money was spent extravagantly by them. The Commonwealth, if it must borrow at all, should borrow for reproductive works. We have spent a large sum out of revenue on such works, and it is only on such works that borrowed money should be spent. Money should not be raised by loan to pay for maintenance. No business man would ask for an overdraft to pay for keeping up his home. He is able to secure credit only byconvincing his banker that he can employ the money in a manner which will return a profit. So the Commonwealth should apply to the money lenders only for loans for reproductive works. I would support such proposals, did I consider them necessary. But I cannot see my way clear to support this proposal. I think that we are inclined to spend extravagantly on defence, only and may regret it in the future. If we follow the example of the nations of the earth, we shall'impoverish our people by our defence expenditure, as they are impoverishing theirs.",49
252,Mr FRANK FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"New England) [5.2b] - I hope that a division will soon be taken so that this business can be cleared out of the way, because it is almost useless to discuss matters here, in the present state of parties. An appeal to the people needed to clear the atmosphere. The vernment seem too tired to do anything worthwhile, and, propose to borrow, lowing the old easy method of drifting. Ministerialist spoke several times of the did not sympathize. policy of drift. That word - characterizes the policy of this Government. But the are ahead, and Ministers will reach them, perhaps sooner than is expected. I have felt that the Commonwealth may one daspolicv he forced into the money market, but 1 hoped that this Parliament would not allow men to assist Great Britain. it to borrow until the States had ceased do so. Now, however, it is proposed to create a seventh Australian Government borrower. The Commonwealth is asked to occupy a degrading position. No proposal for borrowing should have been put forsafely, ward until the debts of the States had been transferred, making the Commonwealth sole borrower. I cannot say I should be together opposed to borrowing for reproto ductive works, if necessity should make that imperative, but to contend that we are comneed pelled to borrow to provide for our defence is sheer nonsense. The attempt create a panic is intended to excuse step which is proposed. The Treasurer justifies the proposal on the ground that the expenditure will be reproductive. That is a most amusing statement. It will be reproOur ductive to those whose sign is three golden balls, to the ""Ikey Mos"" who ""will lend us the money, and receive good interest return. Time and again, I have told Ministers that they were sticking to their friends the financiers, and they are proving thetruth of the statement at every turn. They intend to stand by their friends to end, which I trust will come next March April. As a young Australian, I feel ashamed of the present position. It cruel thing that the great Australian pion, the Prime Minister, should fallen from his high position to the deepest depths of political degradation. This the last straw. We are now absolutely in the ditch. This young nation was going to fight its own battles, and show a strong front to the world. I am ashamed thereof fore that it should be proposed to money for our defence. ' The proposal must be abhorrent to all who have the spirit of fighting in them, as we must have when we think of the grand Commonwealth which we are called upon to defend. The Honorary Minister, who represented the Mr Frank Foster. vernment at the Imperial Defence Conference, says that offers of the resources of the is Commonwealth to the British Government Goare empty unless we can do something eflective. With that I thoroughly agree. folThat is why I opposed the Dreadnought . A offer. A scare was got up with which I To give a Dreadnought to the Old Country, we should have rocks had to borrow from those whom we were offering to help. The Fisher Government had a bold, straightforward, practical for the defence of Australia. When 'the time comes we shall have well-trained The British to Fleet will protect us on the high seas, and we shall be ready to give a hot time to any enemy landing on Australian soil. It was said by Napoleon that it would be easy to get into England, but the devil to get out and very hard to hold ground there. Invaders of Australia will find themselves the similarly placed when every citizen is altrained to bear arms. We are too young establish a big navy. It has been said in the past by certain people that there is no for us to defend ourselves, because the British Navy will defend us. Fortunately to these people now recognise the need for the Australian defence. But for many years all we shall be able to afford will be a small fleet for the protection of our ports, and the prevention of marauding by raiding cruisers. real defence, apart from the British Fleet, must ever remain in the strength of well-trained land forces. I feel, with in a thrill of pleasure, that when the true inwardness of the whole financial position, which we have been fighting in the House during the last few months, comes before the public of Australia, there is only one anthe swer that can be given. The position has or been degrading in the extreme. We have, as it were, departed from our high standard is a of nationhood, and have dealt blow after chamblow at the dignity and standing of the have Commonwealth. We have gone on our bended knees to the States in a parochial is spirit unworthy of us ; and when the people have their turn, and are able to pronounce a verdict, the Government will get the deserts they have so justly earned by their folly, which this proposal to borrow for deborrow fence is the crowning piece.",49
253,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Cook) [5.32] This proposal is quite in keeping with the reactionary composition of the Ministry. The reactionaries in the Government are Go the controlling force, and the legislation proposed recently has been certainly characterized by its reactionary tendencies. This proposal to begin borrowing for the purposes of defence is most objectionable and the least justifiable. Whatever might be said for borrowing for reproductive works, which would pay interest and provide a sinking fund from the beginning, nothing can be said for bcrrowng for the purpose of insuring the protection of the trade and commerce of Australia. At the opening of the Imperial Press Conference recently, at which delegates attended from all parts of the Empire, Lord Rosebery asked them in his opening address to take back a message to the people in the Dominions beyond the Seas. He saidTake back to your young Dominions across viding for this further expenditure. the seas this message and this impression-tha some personal duty and responsibility national defence rests upon every man citizen. Tlte Times military correspondent, referring to the same question, saidPlace before an Englishman or an Australian the duties of a man and he will act like Confine him to the functions of a mouse and to borrow for that purpose. he will act like a mouse. The Government are placing before people of Australia a proposal, not to April this yearaccept responsibility, but to shirk it. This is defence by deception; it is saying to the people, ' We are going to provide for the 1 naval defence, but you shall pay for it . "" We have been leaning on Great Britain for many years past, we have been told by certain leading bers of this Government that we must a greater portion of the burden on ' selves; and yet, when opportunity arises, they desire to transfer the burden-ou burden-fro m Great Britain to posterity. One of the strong marks of honourable parentage is a desire to leave the children with as few burdens as possible; but have a Government who, without compunction, propose to lay all the burden on cur children. Surely the future geneby ration will have sufficient burdens own in dealing with all the great interests which go to make up nationhood? jSurelv they will have their own peculiar diffiIt culties with their increasing responsibilification ' Ties? It should be our endeavour, not place on our children such burdens as ourselves have to bear, but to relieve and give them' a better start in life ourselves had. This Government, however, propose the cowardly expedient of transferpurposes. ring the liabilites of today to the , ration. It is a most humiliating position for the Government, and for .us as liament. I can only hope that some method will be found, before this proposal has gone too far, to block it, and enable the people of Australia to accept their proper responsibilities. This is not a proposal for an expenditure which will give any money return; it is a kind of dead expenditure, seeing that all its return is scrap iron. It may be regarded as productive in the sense that, .in a few years, it produces scrap iron from iron ore; but that, of course, means that we incur further capital expenditure. There is no doubt tthat when a start is made with borrowing, it will be the expedient of future Governments, as the easiest way of proI ret member that only recently the Minister of for Defence was talking all over the country and about the necessity of Australia taking a greater share of the responsibilities of defence on itself. The honourable gentleman desired a Dreadnought to be given to the Imperial authorities, and he was gibing a man. at the idea that there was any necessity Here are words used by him, according to a report the in the Sydney Morning Herald on 9th Australia was rich enough, not only to present Mother Country with a Dreadnought, but to provide for her own defence as well. She not have to ought to do both. and Now, when the honourable gentleman has meman opportunity, he does not propose to do take one or the other; he does not propose to ouroffer a Dreadnought, or that we should shoulder the responsibility of defending r ourselves. He proposes to lean on Great Britain to the extent of allowing the Imperial authorities to supply the money, and then he desires to place on posteritv the we task of repaying it. Further on, in the any same speech, he said.We had more at stake and more in prospect comparison, being the most lightly taxed and of their prosperous in the world. Yet the Government hesitate to impose the taxation necessary for an Australian Navy. seems to me that there can be no justifor the attitude of the Governto ment. It has been asked where the money w-e will come from if we do not borrow. We them, know that the Government propose to obthan we tain the money from Customs duties on the necessaries of life for other They estimate that they can next geneobtain £3,000,000 a year by duties on cotton-piece goods, and they also a Parhave their eye on tea and kerosene. It is from these sources that the interest by loan by this Government. and sinking fund on the proposed loan are to come; and it is a most objectionface able source, seeing that the purpose protect the trade and commerce of tralia. There is, however, another source from which it should be, and could be conveniently, raised. In the Commonas wealth Year-Book for 1908, pages 647 resort and 648 are devoted to a record of the shipping of Australia. The shipping ento tered and cleared in 1907 was 8,822,866 tons. The export oversea trade in 1907 was £72,824,000, and the import oversea trade £51,809,000, or a total £124,633,000. In addition, of course, there is the Inter-State trade by water, which in 1907 was £42,281,000, making a total trade of _£i66,9^,000. 5 per cent, on the oversea trade of wealth £124,633,000 would give £6,231,650 per annum, or, at 2 per cent., £3,115,825, 1 approximately what the Government millions propose to raise by loan. Surely it cannot be said that a tax of z\ per cent, on the total oversea trade of Australia the purpose of a navy would be unfair or excessive? One per cent - would tary yield £1,000,000 per annum. This is really the source frpm which the money should come, for the navy proposal is to defend our trade on the seas. If Ave imposed a tax of 5 per cent, their on the total oversea trade of £166,914,000, we should get £8,345,700, or, at 2 per cent., £4,172,850 per annum. I do not see why the Inter-State shipping trade should not bear its proportion to the Of course, it might be held that such tion would fall on the producer in the last fence. resort. That I quite admit; but surely it is proper that it should be so? It would filter through natural channels back to products and manufactures which were being protected on the high seas and around the Australian coast. Nothing that was conpublic sumed in Australia, except goods exsibilities changed by Inter-State shipping, would be subject to this tax. That portion could be associated with military fence, and could be a matter for a the proper people of today. land or income tax, or death and succession duties, or the whole of them combined, necessary. For the purpose, however, providing the funds for an Australian Navy, which is a defence and insurance onr trade upon the waters, a slight tax z\ per cent, on the total shipping would provide in one year nearly £1,000,000 more than is proposed to be raised . Mr J. H. Catts. The Government however, are not prepared to the right way of doing things. is to They think they would bring down Ausupon themselves the odium of the Employers' Federation and the shipping rings if they attempted to put any such charge this in its rightful place, and so they to. the miserable expedient of calling upon the little girls and boys of Australia bear this burden when they become men and women. We pay at present about 5s. 6d. per head for defence. As against that, Great Britain pays 23s. per head. of According to the estimates of the Government, when their military, proposals are put into foice, the cost of defence in Australia will be raised to ios. Now, 6d. per head. I am sure that with our and resources, we are able, if necessary, to stand a little more than that. When the people of Great Britain, with their on the verge of starvation, can stand an average tax per head of 23s. for defence, surely we can stand .a rate sufficient for to cover the whole of the proposals which are now in sight for both naval and milidefence. This is the second effort that the present Government have made to enter upon a policy of borrowing. Their first was to borrow to pay old-age pensions. They were not prepared to face responsibilities even in that respect, but they have now invited the States to allow them a certain sum during this year 1 to save them from the task of borrowing for that purpose, and I understand the States cost. have agreed to'do it. Now the Governtaxament want to borrow for purposes of deThese instances only show how ready they are to shirk their responsibilities and fly to the easiest method of doing those things for the present, leaving somebndv else to clear up the mess after them.

That is a very plausof ible argument, but it has been the state of ment of Governments throughout the States time after time. They have told us that they were going to create sinking funds to clear off the loans in a certain time, but we know how readily they have resorted to the expedient of taking those sinking and spending the money for other purposes. They have not stood by the provision that they made, and there is no doubt that this ""Government will do the same.

But what do this Government care about the sanction of the ^Auspeople? Their very existence is a denial of the right of the people to express their opinion on public affairs - They have thrown overboard the principles on which were elected, and now they are going a step further and pawning the security of the Commonwealth without any reference to the people. They have been very ready to submit certain proposals to a referendum, and I do not see why this proposal should not also be referred to the people. We are on the eve of a general election, and if any question might safely be put to a simple referendum, by which a majority of the people could decide whether the Commonwealth shall inaugurate a borrowing policy or not, surely it is this. When the Bill reaches the Committee stage I shall take the opportunity of moving in the first clause the addition of the words, "" This Act shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation after the people of Australia have given their sanction to it by referendum."" - I propose also to move for the insertion of a second clause authorizing the Government to place the matter before the people by referendum at such time as the Governor General may decide. That would enable the whole proposal to be put before our masters, who are the proper persons to decide whether they are to be committed to this mad policy of borrowing for defence. We shall then see who are the'Democrats on the Government side prepared to trust the people. We shall find out whether they desire to sneak in something behind the backs of the people, or whether they are prepared to give them an opportunity of saying ""yea"" or ""nay"" to the inauguration by the Commonwealth of a loan policy. I have no doubt what they will do. If they desire to trust the people they will wait until the elections, and consult them. But they are pushing the proposal on now so as to tie the Commonwealth up - to a borrowing policy. practically say to themselves, "" If the Labour party defeat us at the next election and we go out of office, we shall at least have saved our wealthy friends and the commerce and trade of Australia from paying their fair share for the defence of that trade and commerce upon the Inter-State waters and the high seas."" If they succeed they will have tied up the Democratic party to the extent of committing it to a loan policy, and very likely they will have raised this money before there is a possibility of the House, meeting again to place the veto of the electors upon the harebrained idea of the Commonwealth borrowing for defence purposes. I wish it to be clearly understood that I am not necessarily committing myself to a denial of the expediency of borrowing for certain purposes. It may be that borrowing can be justified for certain purposes that would pay interest from the beginning and provide a sinking fund for renewals. But defence is not such a purMr J. H. Catts. pose. It is purely an insurance of the trade and commerce of Australia upon the waters, and that trade and commerce should be called upon to pay for such insurance. There is not a commercial man in the House who in conducting his own affairs would borrow money for insurance purposes. All the shipping of Australia is insured against damage or loss on the water, but is there one business man in the House who 'would borrow money for the purpose of insuring it? Rather, every business man would make it a charge upon the goods- a present liability which would begin and end with the transaction. But when it comes to doing the business of the country and dealing with the shipping of Australia as a whole, instead of in single shiploads or ton lots, they depart altogether from the wholesome principles upon which their own business success has been founded. In the conduct of their own private affairs they recognise well-established business principles, but in the conduct of the business of the nation they propose to throw those principles overboard. And what is at the bottom of it? They are seeking by this means to secure some personal advantage to themselves, transferring their own liability to the backs of the people by Customs and Excise duties, and shifting portion of the burden of today on to the rising generation. I shall seize every opportunity to expose to the electors the rotten business administration of the preThey sent Government. I hope that when the people, have an opportunity of considering the sins of omission and commission of the Government, they will without hesitation send them about their own private business, and put into ofiice a Government who believe in dealing as honestly with the business of the whole community as they would with their own private concerns. The Government propose to redeem this loan sixteen years hence. When only two-thirds of that time has elapsed, the vessels of the fleet will be practically scrap iron, and it will be necessary not only to pay off this indebtedness, but to raise a further sum to provide for the construction of more up-to-date vessels. As the honourable member for Robertson rightly pointed out, in this respect our position is different from that of Great Britain. When any of her warships become obsolete, Great Britain can send them to her various oversea dependencies fo exhibit the flag, and to indipate to the people there the might and majesty of the Empire. For that purpose, they are as good as the most up-to-date vessels; but our only deAustralia, pendency is Papua., and it is so close to our own shores that we do not needby obsolete vessels for show purposes there. This is another reason why the burden naval defence should be faced immediately, and made a.charge upon the trade and commerce of Australia. I hope that people will not be gulled by side issues. No doubt, the Government will try to - cloud the issue by associating with this - loan the patriotism of local defence, is altogether dissociated from it. We can obtain as good a local defence by for it out of revenue as we can by borrowing, and I trust that in the heat and excitement of the approaching general elecnot tion, the people will not forget to ferentiate between the scheme for an Austhought tralian Navy and the means by which it proposed to provide for it. The Governof. ment propose to raise the money by loan, and so to burden posterity. On the other hand, the Labour party propose that as this navy will be in the nature of an surance to trade upon the waters, that trade should bear such an equitable tax as would provide, not only for the capital cost, but for the upkeep of the navy. This proposal on the part of the Governfairs ment is in keeping with all their reacfloat tionary instincts. Such men as belong the present Government ridicule Demothis cratic proposals until they are popularized by the efforts of the Labour forces of Auspolitical tralia. They are then compelled to adopt them, but they associate with them some - reactionary proposal which almost wholly - discounts their value. At the Brisbane Labour Conference, which was attended - by delegates from all parts of Australia, tion. the policy of an Australian Navy was renever affirmed. At that time, certain members of the present Government were aba solutely opposed to it, but the Labour ' forces of Australia having shown the such utility and patriotism of an Australian Navy, they eventually came round to our way of thinking, and accepted our scheme. But instead of associating with it, as we proposed, a Democratic policy for providof ing the money necessary to carry out that - scheme, they connect with it reactionary proposals which will tend to make it popular, and to detract very largely from its value. Whereas the Labour party would find the necessary money by direct taxation upon trade and commerce the waters, which will be protected by [243] navy, our opponents, the Conservatives of seek to fetter the rising generation, and to shirk their present responsibility floating a loan. I hope that when the electors have an opportunity at the ballotof box, they will give this reactionary Government the short shrift it deserves. I hope they will replace it by an intelligent the party, strong enough numerically to put forward Democratic, patriotic, and worthy schemes for the benefit of Australia, and to administer the public affairs of which the Commonwealth in the interests of the people of today, and for the material beneproviding fit of the rising generation.",53
272,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Gwydir) [6.9] - I canallow this Bill to pass without expressdifing my sincere regret that it has been necessary at this early stage in our is history to resort to the pernicious system borrowing for naval purposes- a system which, so far as I am aware, has not been adopted by any Government as a general policy. During the last three or four inmonths the Government have offered insults to the intelligence of the people, they have shirked their responsibilities and have shown a tendency to frustrate the democratic and honest administration of the afof the country. .They now propose to a loan. My concern is not for the to Government, but for the people, on whom burden will fall. The Government have brought down this proposal to save their scalps at the ensuing general election. They desire then to present a united front, and they recognise that they would not be able to do soi f they came forward with a naval defence scheme and said that the money was to be raised by direct taxaThe naval defence scheme would have been submitted by this Government if they had not intended to introduce Loan Bill to cover the expenditure which that scheme will involve. In the absence of a Bill as this, they would have had to indicate to the electors that it would be necessary for them to raise more revenue, not by way of Customs and Excise taxation, but by a direct tax upon the land and wealth Australia. In order to shirk that responsibility, and to avoid the fate which would inevitably befall them if they dared to make unan honest proposition of that kind, they have introduced this Loan Bill ; they are prepared to saddle posterity with this burden, rather than make the people upon who are best able to pay contrithe bute towards this essential, expenditure on the part of a modern Government. They make no proposal for direct taxation provide for the cost of this scheme, betimes cause they are almost face to face with general election, and because the Prime Minister, as he told us when the financial agreement was before the House, allowed the contention of the State Premiers that land taxatiorn should be left to the States. made no practical arrangement with the miers for the transfer of the State debts. He has carried his financial scheme, but the debts are to remain as they are. The Government have indicated their weakness already by saying that they do not think we could provide for this fleet unit out revenue. They dare not say that they would like to raise the necessary money by means of a land or an income tax, or that they would like to obtain it from Customs and Excise taxation, because they know that they have given away to the States more than they ought to have done. In the ciring cumstances, therefore, they have taken fuge in a coward's castle, and propose initiate a system which has not been intronot duced in any other country, in time peace, to provide for naval and military fence. What will England say when she learns of these proposals? Will not the people of England say, "" Prosperous tralia desires to float on our money a £3,500,000 loan? Of that amount' £2,000,000 is required to fulfil the proshall mise that she would give us a Dreadnought, or its equivalent. She comes to England to borrow, not only the ,£2,000,000, but 'an additional sum of £1,500,000 money, to enable her to create a naval unit"" ? England has never resorted to this means of raising money for her Navy. Notwithstanding the heavy burdens of empire which England has to carry, notip withstanding the wars she has had to fight, purposes. and the provision she has had to make for defence as a reply to the menacing attitude of the other nations of Europe, she has never thought of borrowing for naval defence purposes. and military expenditure. Honourable members opposite sit dumb. They dare address the House, because they cannot fence. justify this proposal. The Prime Minister spoke with characteristic eloquence, but, as It was. usual, there was only sentiment and empty platitude behind what he said. He did little more than apologise for the said that he does not like .borrowing, and would rather do something else. Why does he not do something else? Because spent in Queensland. be is afraid to do what is right. Why is Mr Webster. he not man enough to stand by the nonto borrowing policy which he advocated in past? It is because he is supported a by the representatives of the wealthy. It is with their votes that he hopes to carry the Bill, as he carried the pernicious financial agreement. He dare not make any other provision for naval defence. ParliaHe ment has been placed in a most humiliatPreing position. This is the result of what has been done in regard to finance. The utterances of Ministers in the past have shown that they were opposed to borrowing ; but in this, as in connection with the financial agreement and other matters of of grave importance to the Commonwealth, they are prepared to swallow their convictions. Not only are we asked to agree to the borrowing of £3,500,000; we are also asked to sanction the introduction of a pernicious system which will ultimately prove disastrous to the Commonwealth. Borrowis, of course, the easiest method of reobtaining money, but the easiest courses to are generally fraught with danger. Had Ministers, to save their political scalps, of agreed with the Premiers to pay to the deStates a larger sum than should be paid to them for an indefinite period, they would not have been driven into their preAussent position.

282,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"At any rate, the Mother Country, whose obligations are so much heavier than ours, has never borrowed for defence preparations. The Government does not propose to pay for the naval unit out of revenue, because it knows that that would hasten the day when a land tax would have to be imposed. Ministers tell us that they desire to do many things which will involve the expenditure of large sums. If they are in earnest regarding the development of the Northern Territory, the construction of the Western Australian railway, and many of the other large schemes which have been put before us, they will find it difficult to pay their way, and, no doubt, will again propose to borrow, and to heap a load of debt on the Commonwealth. However, the day seems past for talking seriously on financial and national questions in this Chamber. All that is listened to is pretty sentiment. The Honorary Minister showed the worthlessness of mere verbal patriotism. told us, too, that the £250,000 which Great Britain intends to contribute towards our navy will pay the interest on the proposed loan, and establish a sinking fund which will redeem it within sixteen years. Is that all that we can do for the Mother Country? While we are professing to help her, we are practically letting her provide a navy 'for us. I do not think it likely that the Treasurer will tell us that the Government does not intend to take the money. As to the proposal to establish a sinking fund, I have seen such funds come to nought under State administration, and have little faith in them. Invariably, when the money is wanted for some other purpose, it is taken by the Treasurer of the day.",57

The Government should provide for the appointment of trustees to manage the proposed sinking fund in the interests of the people, if it intends to make honest provision for the redemption of the loan. We have been told that the revenue of the Commonwealth will increase by leaps and bounds. No doubt that would happen if a land tax were imposed which would make available for settlement land which is suitable, and accessible to [243]- 2 markets. Such a tax would bring about an increase of population, and provide us, not only with revenue to pay for defence preparations, but also with men who could be armed and trained to fight for the country. The Government, however, will not allow a land tax to be imposed to make these things possible. As I said some time ago, the Conservative wing rules the Fusion party.

The States have been given a first mortgage on the finances of the Commonwealth; and now the Government desire to mortgage the future of our children. The - Minister of Defence, two or three years ago, would have no more thought of supporting a proposal to borrow money for the purposes of defence, naval or military, He than he would have thought of flying. To-day, however, he is quite happy in assisting to make the most serious inroads on what have hitherto been regarded as the fundamentals of Australian finance, Federal or State. The day must come, however, when such conduct will reap its reward. Whether or not that day be near : at hand, I am satisfied that when the people realise that this is the beginning of a policy which is most pernicious and must in the end be ruinous, they will take a keen vengeance. Of course I understand that the Government are in a corner. They have made one false start, and like others in their position, they have to continue the wrong-doing. They have handed over to the States revenue that is required for the Commonwealth; and in this they have sacrificed' the constitutional privileges of the Parliament. Absolute control of Commonwealth affairs has been put into the hands of the Premiers of the States; and now the Government find themselves compelled to raise a loan in order to relieve a possible pressure that may follow a change in our present prosperous condition. Throughout the debates honourable members seem to have closed their eyes to the condition of affairs six or seven years ago, when we were suffering all the terrible losses incidental to the severest of droughts. No one can deny that there may be a return of similar disastrous seasons; and, should that be so, our financial position is such that there must either be a revolution, or a return of the privileges we have sacrificed in the last few months. That sacrifice, I have indicated, now compels the ment to borrow in order to establish only the unit of a navy; because the Minister Defence cannot possibly suggest that vessels now contemplated will continue to meet our requirements, or that the proposed expenditure is all that will be involved the next fifteen years. If Australia develop as we hope and anticipate, been 500,000 will not suffice to provide with naval defence; but, in view of the fleet foreshadowed by, the Treasurer, expenditure will have to be increased at least three-fold.

In Great Britain the cost of defence is met by increasing the income tax and other direct taxes from time to time as the necessities of the naval and military service require. But this Government House. has refused to follow that example. We never had to spend a penny on a .war, but as soon as it' is proposed to create Small naval unit, the Government cowardly as to seek to avoid placing the people who ought to bear it the den which it entails. That burden is but a trifle compared with that which the payers of the Old Country have to bear. stead of placing this burden on the backs Of the large land-holders, and thereby ing it possible for the people to get on land, they propose to saddle the poor with it. They are deliberately refusing an portunity to attract more people to the Commonwealth.

330,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There would not be much difficulty about an income tax.,63
331,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"An income tax is only another branch of direct taxation. We do not desire, especially when there is no immediate necessity, to interfere with the line of taxation which we have left to the States. I hope the day is far off when this Parliament will break through that rule, exceptunder stress of some grave contingency that I hope may not arise.",63
332,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,An income tails considered fair for war purposes.,63
333,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is perfectly right, but we must consider that the States already levy income taxes which they have made an ordinary source of revenue. When Mr Gladstone introduced the income tax, he said it was a war tax, which would cease as soon as the warlike purposes for which it was imposed had been fulfilled. As a matter of fact, however, the income tax at Home, which at first was a luxury, has become an everyday necessity; and I am sorry to say that the Australian States already use an income tax, not as an emergency tax for extreme occasions, but as a means of income for ordinary purposes. We desire, if possible, to confine the Commonwealth to'indirect taxation. That, I think, has been the understanding all along, and has been one of the great objectives of our Federal arrangements.",63
334,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That theory is not agreed to by honourable members on this side.,63
335,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I remind the honourable member that that arrangement was arrived at by the people of the country before there were members on that side.,63
336,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Nothin g of the kind; the Commonwealth has unlimited power of taxation, direct or otherwise.",63
337,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Quite so; but I am pointing out that, as a matter of history, and not as a matter of contract, the Commonwealth Parliament has, on an understanding arrived at, met its necessities out of indirect taxation, leaving direct taxation to the States. I am not saying that we ought to confine ourselves to indirect taxation if the people of Australia ultimately decide to adopt a different principle; but we are now faced with the fact that we require £3,500,000, and require it at once. Any one who considers the present state of the world will admit that the sooner we have an effective navy, and effective means of defence, generally, the better. Suppose we were to provide the £3,500,000 out of extra taxation during the next three years. Would it not very largely interfere with the whole finances of the States and the Commonwealth? It would create a strain which I do not think the people would submit ro for a moment; and if we acted on the suggestion of honourable members opposite, and waited until the money was raised in that way, I am afraid it would mean that we should never have any navy. In any. .private business, if it is desired to make a development, and further capital is required, it is perfectly legitimate to borrow, and repay as quickly as possible. That is a matter of everyday occurrence; and it is the proposal of the Government, who spread the repayment of the' loan over fifteen or sixteen years. If it were proposed to borrow £3,500,000, and never repay it, I could understand some of the arguments of the Opposition.",63
338,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is exactly what is pire. proposed; no time is stipulated in the Bill.,64
339,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I admit that I have not gone through the Bill very closely; I understand that there is to be a 5 per pose? cent, sinking fund, which will liquidate the debt in sixteen years.",64
340,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We are going to provide they require it. that the sinking fund shall be one of not less than 5 per cent.,64
341,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think it should be a - little more. The course proposed adopted in every well-regulated productive establishment, and it is good business. the end of the sixteen years, supposing that peace and harmony prevail amongst the nations, the ships will be obsolete, either because there is no use for them, or because they are not equal to the ships of other nations; and the money that time, of course, will have all been paid off. A question raised by honourable members opposite is, "" Shall we take money from the poor, or shall we take it from the rich and those best able to pay it?"" I submit, with all respect, that that question does not arise. Members returned to this Parliament at the next or subsequent elections, may alter the arrangement as they choose; and the money necessary to pay interest and principal may be raised in another way. What we have to settle just now is not how the money is to be repaid, but how it is to be raised in order to meet a necessity.",64
342,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Let the other chap worry about the paying!,64
343,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the honourable member is again returned to the House, he will have full opportunity to advocate a different method to meet the position. At present, the Government are not asking us to do more than authorize them to borrow the money necessary to accomplish the object, and the question of repayment is one that a future Parliament may deal with as it thinks fit. I do not wish to go into the question at length; but the arrangement detailed by the honourable member for Brisbane seems to me eminently fair, not only to this Commonwealth, but to the Mother Country. It practically amounts to an arrangement for a co-partnership. In the past, we have had arrangements, some satisfactory, and some unsatisfactory. Of course, I know that some honourable members objected to the Dreadnought offer; but it came before the British people in such a form as to impress them with our sincerity in desiring, to be, not merely a nominal, but an. integral part of the Em",64

346,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We should be vicariously generous !,64
347,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Stan d or fall togetheris one that was the point.,64
348,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It might have been, as At some honourable members say, a paroxysm of feeling; but whatever prompted the pffer of a Dreadnought, it had the result of impressing upon the Home Government and the British people our sincerity in desiring to take a hand in the affairs of the Emby pire. The result was that a Conference was called, and a co-operation or co-partnery was established with the Dependenthis cies of the Empire. In our case, we had been paying a subsidy of £200,000 a year, the Home Government providing the whole of the defence. When we intimated that - we were prepared to do our part, the reply was, "" Very weli, we shall meet you .in this matter; it will cost you £750,000 a year, towards which we shall contribute .£250,000; in this way, we shall not onlyput you in the position to which you aspire, of being a partner in the Empire, but we shall save £400,000 or £500,000 that we are now spending in defending Australia."" As a matter of fact, it is a good, sound , business arrangement. While we are - settling the question as to whether it is desirable for the Commonwealth tq go beyond what are understood to be the limits of its taxing powers, the next two or three years may pass, and we may find that we may have "" missed the bus ""-that we are ready some time after the need for our navy has arisen. We cannot have a navy without paying for it, and we desire to order it at once. If we have not the money, why should we not borrow it?",64
349,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There is plenty of money in Australia.,65
350,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member is quite right; but, as I could point out if time permitted, and the subject were relevant, we have plenty of uses for the money in Australia. If we apply the money in Australia to the development of Australia through private enterprise, Ave shall find we have uses enough for it, and that we can borrow on far more satisfactory terms abroad. Honourable members should look at this, and I trust they will do so, as not in any way a party question. It is a simple matter of business. The idea of laying down a hard and fast rule in this country that you will not borrow money in any circumstances is foolish. It all depends on your financial ability to accomplish the objects you have in view. We want a fleet, and we want .it at once, .and we must find the money at once to pay for it. That being-so, the question of repayment is the gravamen of the whole difference between us. My honourable friends - say- "" We will finance it out of revenue,"" which means increased taxation. The Government say- "" We will.borrow the money and, instead of making the burden on the people a million and a half for the next three years, make it about £270,000 for fifteen years. That is the whole issue boiled down. We ought to pass the Bill. The honourable gentleman who last addressed the House spoke of honourable members who were afraid to vote or speak, but I do not think he can apply that to me. I speak because I believe this is a sound business proposition, one that ought to commend itself to the House as reasonable, and as the only means available at present to enable us to complete the arrangement made with the Imperial Government-a n arrangement which I think is an exceedingly good business proposition.",65
351,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"South Sydney) [9.2] I am very glad that the Imperial Defence Conference, which the honourable member for Brisbane attended as the representative of Australia, arrived at a decision to establish auxiliary fleets in the various dominions. That decision is quite of a piece with the policy advocated for a considerable time past by the party to which I have the honour to belong. It is a good thing that at last the chief naval advisers of the Empire have been brought to see that it is possible to have something in the nature of Colonial fleets which will be of - advantage from an Empire stand-point, and at the same time keep alive that local patriotism without which any fleet at all is impossible. While one cannot help ex"" pressing pleasure at the turn events have taken in that direction, 1 must say that the means by which the Government propose to bring the auxiliaryfleetinto existence are absolutely beneath contempt. To hear the honourable member for Mernda talking, a stranger would gather the impression that we in Australia were so inordinately hard up that we could not afford to tax ourselves to the extent of £500,000, or even £100,coo a year. When the honourable member says that we must perforce borrow because we have no money, he is libelling Australia.",65
352,Mr HARPER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I was speaking of the Government.',65
353,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And what are the Government's taxing powers for if not to be exercised? For what purpose are they intrusted under the Constitution with powers of taxation except to exercise them when occasion arises? I am not one of those who say that we must in no circumstances borrow, .because I can imagine emergencies when it would be compulsory for us to borrow in order to keep the national exchequer going. I therefore lay down no hard and fast rule with regard to borrowing, but today we are in no financial emergency. Australia is in as good a position as it ever was. It is at the high water mark of prosperity. It has had a succession of good seasons, and its people, speaking generally, are well off. Are those people who have been parading their patriotism from one end of Australia to not to interrupt. the other going to baulk at helping to establish here a portion of the Empire Navy when they are asked to put up a few paltry pounds by way of taxation? Is that the extent of their patriotism? Is that all that they are prepared to do to hold gether an Empire which guarantees that their property will contmue in their posseslowing sion ? Are they prepared only to borrow and let posterity pay the bill ? We have in this measure any number of promises from the Treasurer. We, are to put aside no less than 5 per cent, for interest and sinking fund, and the mere 4 per cent, to be deleted as not being sufficient. Does not the House know that that gency pro vision can be overridden in five minutes by a strong Government, and will today. be if the Treasurer of the Commonwealth runs short?

I am afraid that clause 8 of this very Bill gives the Treasurer considerable latitude as to what he is to do. And the Treasurer may decide- I do not say the present Treasurer, but a future occupant of his office who knows not the ways of virtue for a beneficent purpose, that beneficent purpose being to relieve the Treasury. I wish, therefore, to enter my protest against the manner in which the Government propose to raise this money. In all seriousness I believe that the people of Australia would respond heartily to a suggestion that direct taxation of some sort should be levied for defence purposes. I do not believe in ear-marking revenue for a particular purpose, but I am sure that the people would not object to a reasonable direct tax for the specific purpose of helping forward such a naval scheme as that which we have before us.",67
386,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Kalgoorlie) [9.16] - I was pleased to have the privilege of listening once more to the honourable member for South Sydney while he denounced in his usual vigorous style the proposal of the Government to embark on a borrowing policy. I agree most heartily with the attitude that he has taken up. In yesterday morning's newspapers we saw the statement that the Government had succeeded in passing a Bill providing for the Commonwealth making to the States for all time a fer cafita allowance of 25s, per annum. In the same newspapers there was a statement to the effect that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth finds it absolutely necessary to appeal to the money lenders of other countries for funds for the construction of ships to protect Australia. The Treasurer evidently feels that the payment to the States can be made for all time, yet he has not at his disposal sufficient money to meet are about to be incurred by the Commonwealth. There is no serious disagreement amongst honourable members as to the main . question before us. The only points of difference relate, in the first place, to the method of financing, and secondly, to the question of whether or not we are justified in embarking upon the construction of a navy of this description in view of the advances which are being made in the building of flying machines that may be used for defence purposes.",67
387,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Government believe only in flying-kites.,68
388,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"They would fly anything. They will have toflyto the electors on the 20th of February, and we may be sure that this House will not be dissolved until the 19th of the month.

389,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Order !,68
390,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I admit that I have been temporarily drawn aside from the question immediately before the Chair. The only serious objection that can be taken to the proposal to construct this navy relates to the question of whether or not we are justified in embarking upon this policy in view of the extraordinary development that has taken place in aerial navigation.,68
391,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Has any country stopped its shipbuilding programme because of that advance?,68
392,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not know that there has been any serious stoppage yet, but there is certainly a growing tendency in that direction. There is a growing feeling that aerial navigation will revolutionize modern warfare. Flying machines have been navigated from a given point over a course extending from 100 to 180 miles. They have been steered between goalposts and brought back to the starting point, and when such* a stage has been reached in aerial navigation, we cannot overestimate the value of flying machines as instruments of warfare. In these circumstances does the Minister of Defence think that we ought to construct this navy on the lines laid down under the agreement made at the Imperial Defence Conference? Does he not think that we should, at all events, be setting aside at the same time a sum of money to enable experiments in' connection with aerial navigation for defence purposes liabilities that to be made ?",68
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I do not think that the one is involved in the other.,68

398,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,My honourable friends opposite will admit anything that does not involve their doing something. I do not say that this is necessarily an argument against the acceptance of the naval scheme,68

The question of aerial navigation cannot be separated from the proposals now under consideration. A few years ago an armoured cruiser was one of the most formidable of warships; but since then improvement after improvement has been made until we have today an improvement on vessels even of the Dreadnought type. No doubt further inventions will cause vessels of the Dreadnought type to be relegated to the scrap-heap long before we pay for these vessels.",68

This precious Government is going to become another borrowing foice in Auswhich tralia, and to add to our already considerto able public debt. At the last general elechere. tion the Prime Minister said that his Government proposed to consolidate the public debt of Australia, and to exercise reasonable control over reckless borrowing, such as had been indulged in by State Treasurers.

We are asked to accept a Bill authorizing the raising and expending of £3,500,000 for the purposes of naval defence; but I point out that honourable members, particularly on this side; have had no opportunity to express any views in regard to the principles or details of the defence scheme itself. I was amongst those desirous to speak when the Minister of Defence commenced to lay the matter before us, but, as we know, owing to the action of two or three members at the outside, entirely on their own responsibility, the proposal was passed in such a way as to preclude discussion by the application of the closure at the instance ot the Minister in charge.",72
471,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member must not refer to that matter.,72
472,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the scheme had been presented as legislation usually is, we should have been in a much better position to deal with it on its merits. As it is, we are asked to consider the financial aspect, without having considered the principles or details of the scheme; and that is a most unfortunate position for the Government to place the House in. It is a position which neither reflects credit on the Government, nor places Australia in a proper light before the people of the Old Country. If there is any question that appeals to the Empire as a whole, it is the question of defence; and leaders of thought in public life throughout the Empire are entitled to hear the opinions of the members of this Parliament. At the end of the last session of a dying Parliament, we are invited to consider a big proposal of this character, sprung on us without much previous information, and presented in a garbled and mangled form. I desire to enter my protest, and to say, at the same time, that I was prepared to give the question of naval defence fair consideration. Had I the advantage of knowing what the proposals of the Government are, I believe I should be prepared to afford them my support; but the Government saw fit in what seemed to me to be a spirit of petty and despicable spleen - Mr SPEAKER - Order ! The honourable member must not refer to that matter.",72
473,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is quite in keeping with the action of the Government in the earlier stages of the discussion of this matter, that a Bill of this character should be now introduced. The leaders, if not the rank and file on the Government side, had no desire to permit Australia to have a naval defence on Australian lines. They desired, and, to a certain extent, in the earlier life of the Commonwealth, gave effect to that desire, to contribute a mere pittance in the form of a subsidy, throwing on the Mother Countrv the whole responsibility for the naval defence of Australia. Such a policy does not represent Australian sentiment. The people of Australia recognise that, in addition to territorial defence, 'a certain measure of naval defence is necessary, and are prepared to provide it ; but, unfornately, there have been, and are, in this Chamber members who think that anything of that character bespeaks enmity to the Empire. Their ideas are so narrow and despicable that they regard nothing but some limited defence expenditure under the control of the Mother Country as genuine Australian patriotism. Anything else they consider to be tainted with disloyalty, and they have persistently endeavoured to belittle the desire of Australians to build up a system of naval defence suitable to Australian conditions and adequate for Australian needs. The late Labour Government placed the Commonwealth under a debt of gratitude by initiating a true Australian naval defence scheme which became so popular thai .the other side, despite their hostility to it, have felt themselves compelled to adopt it. It was owing to the representations of that Government to the Home authorities that the scheme now before us had an opportunity of being considered, and is now being actively initiated as a wise' and substantial part of the wider defence scheme of the Erppiro. During the time that this matter was under consideration honourable members on the other side, who took the narrower view, charged those on this side with being actuated by disloyal motives. They claimed that our scheme was put forward in order to give effect, in an underhand way, to anti-Imperial designs. In the early stages their cry was for the presentation of a Dreadnought or nothing. That was the original policy of those little Australians ; but when public opinion did not respond in the way they expected, it became' a Dreadnought or its equivalent. When, finally, they got into touch with British sentiment, and realized that the sound common sense of the political leaders of the Empire was against them, and in favour of the Fisher policy, theychanged their tune to "" An Australian unit."" We, therefore, have this proposal submitted - to us. When we consider the utterances of some members of the Ministry and of the Fusion party during the early stages of the discussion of the question when it was to be a "" Dreadnought or nothing"" ; when we read again some of their strong expressions of opinion against an Australian Navy, we cease to wonder why the motion submitted last week by the Minister of Defence was forced through the Chamber without debate. I have armed myself with the opinions of a number of leading authorities on the question of Australian defence. I do not propose to quote from them all : but every one must recognise that the opinion of British statesmen is that Australian defence can be best effected, managed, and controlled by Australians, and that the old system favoured by a number of the Fusionists of throwing on the British Government the responsibility of providing for Australian naval defence, and making a contribution to the Imperial Exchequer, was op-posed to sound principles of responsible government. They recognised that the old Liberal cry of "" No taxation without representation "" applied in that matter as forcibly as it had ever done, and that it would not be long before those parts of the Empire which were asked to contribute largely to the cost of the British Navy would demand a voice in the expenditure of the money which they contributed. They knew that when, as in all large concerns of this character, exposures of abuses were made, the Australian taxpayer would ask for a voice in remedying the abuses and punishing those responsible. Notable authorities such as Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, and others, expressed that view with no uncertain sound. I have here a short quotation from that eminent Bri&ish Admiral to this effectThe ^elf-governing Dominions can best help us, not by spending ^2,000,000 in the construction of battleships to serve in British quarters, but by making efforts to 'defend themselves. The only way the Dominions oversea can be hurt is by the cutting off the trade routes. . . . The investment of £2,000,000 in home defence and cruisers which would protect the trade routes would be a better investment than helping to defend Great Britain's shores. He there says, in effect, that the outlying portions of the Empire, including Australia, can spend their money better in local defence than in presenting Dreadnoughts to the Mother Country; but in the following quotation he touches on the possibility that, if the offer was accepted, Australia would want a voice in the expenditureThere is one point that the English-speaking nations are very determined upon, and they will argue upon it considerably, and that is that whenever they spend money they like to ""have control of it. The Manchester Guardian, in an article published on the 2nd June last, dealing with the Imperial Defence Conference, published the following criticism upon the question of the presentation of Dreadnoughts to the Mother Country, as against locally controlled defence:The Conference will find Australia strongly and Canada mildly interested in the formation of navies of their own, New Zealand committed on imperfect knowledge of the facts and without consultation of the Parliament to a huge subsidy, and South Africa with no desire to possess a navy of her own, and no power to increase her subsidy to the Imperial Navy. The New Zealand precedent, though most generous, is. not on the lines of ' true progress, and, so far from encouraging other colonies to follow it, we ought at the Conference to give New Zealand every opportunity of transforming her offer into something of more permanent value. The ideal to aim at, alike for military and for political reasons, is that each colony should make itself capable of defending itself at sea as on land for military reasons, because the whole tendency of the time is towards localizing naval defence and towards greater concentration 'of fleets; and for political reasons, because it is impossible, to accept colonial contributions to the Imperial fleet on any considerable scale without also giving the colonies a voice in Imperial policy. It is a common belief that our fleet is larger than it need be, because we have to defend the colonies as well as - our own shores, and that if the colonies did their share.in naval defence ours would be much less; but there is little evidence in suppoTt of it. The naval defence of Canada can hardly be said to cost us anything, for she is already protected against attack from any European power by the Monroe Doctrine, and the United States Navy is left out of our calculations of naval competition. W€ keep a small squadron in Australian waters, of which Australia Days abput five-twelfths of the cost, but if she kept four battleships there, it would make not the smallest difference in our requirements in home waters. The defence of our colonies then has nothing to do with the size of our Naval Budgets. But would Estimates be less if the colonies gave Dreadnoughts and made no conditions about where they should be stationed? We doubt even that Why has no one suggested that one Dreadnought should be knocked off our programme because of New Zealand's offer? Because every ""gift"" creates a corresponding obligation. No number of Dreadnoughts in the North Sea would dispense with the need of local defence in the South Seas on the outbreak of war, and whatever New Zealand has added to our strength would then have to be given back. If we did not give it back the ;olony would have a just grievance. Our naval position would be no stronger, but rather weaker : on the other hand, the political risk would be very serious. A partu in the colonies would raise the cry that they were being taxed without representation or control; but no representation could be given without increasing responsibilities of the Navv, at least to the tent of the colonial contributions, and impairextent ing the independence of its action in war. Colonial gifts are esteemed as symbols of and in time of real danger they may have very great practical value. But the'value'should not be discounted in advance, nor is it possible to found a permanent policy upon them. Mr Thomas Brown. true permanent policy is for the colonies to develop their own resources and to relieve our fleet of all responsibilities outside European waters. If , when they have done that, they have the disposition to do more, then their gifts will be gifts in effect as well as intention, and not loans at interest which we may have to repay at inconvenient seasons. . . . The colonies . . can perfect their fixed defences, and they can develop in time fleets capable of keeping their own seas free from stray marauders detached from the main theatre of war. The service rendered in this way will have much greater and more permanent value than occasional gifts of Dreadnoughts to the Imperial Navy, gratifying as the spirit which dictates these is. Such gifts are soon consumed; but the value of a sound system of naval defence, with all the pride of nationality to draw upon, will increase with time. Nor need it be feared that the local navies thus created would not be placed at the disposal of this country in time of serious war.",72

475,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It expresses a large measure of British sentiment.

It gives also a clear and concise statement of the difficulties that would constantly present themselves if some honourable members opposite had had their way in the early stages of the Dreadnought scare.

This is what the Review of Reviews in its May number had to say with regard to the conditions which then prevailedRarely has there been a wilder attempt to the whip up public opinion than the proposal to ex- ' present Britain with a Dreadnought. To an the effort has been successful. The proposal originated simultaneously with a Melbourne unity, and Sydney newspaper, and was worked for ail it was worth. Flaring headlines proclaimed the need of Britain for help, and the insinuation, and often more, that the German nation The was waiting an opportunity to fly at the throat of the Mother Country. In Victoria and South Wales the question was made the mount one, and in several instances men who were taking a serious and thoughtful view the question, anxious to do the right thing, hurled by the press into the maelstrom.. deed, it was as much as the public life many a man was worth to have quietly stated that they thought that the better plan of helppartying the Mother Country was to do something else than present a battleship to her. In two States named, one of those paroxysms of blind fanaticism that shuts up legitimate opinion to one, and brands every other as spurious, seized the press. That the fact monwealth Government did not approve of the proposal made the question revolve around new centre, and men who did not approve of the Dreadnought proposal lent their voices the press cry to save a suspicion that they friendly to the Labour Government. The Fisher Government was loudly proclaimed as being "" the best friends the Germans had,"" with similar bosh ad infinitum. . . . fortunately come to be a question of for against the Labour movement.

I approve of their footed conversion. The policy is a move in the right direction, and if the Fisher Governtralia ment did nothing more for Australia than make it possible, it has certainly placed the the Commonwealth and the people under an obligation to it. Indeed, I go further, of and say that, according, to Lord Charles Beresford and the Manchester Guardian, has placed the Empire under an obligation to it.

479,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Le t me put the before the House a statement made by the Minister of Defence a little whileago. The honourable member, when he got away from his cry of, "" A Dreadnought or nothing,"" and raised the cry of, "" Dreadnought or its equivalent,"" delivered an address in Sydney which"" was reported anv other. in the Daily Telegraph under the following headlines: "" If War Came""; ""Australia Not Ready""; ""Stirring Speech By DeBritain fence Minister""; ""Something Must Be Done For Riflemen"" ; "" Stacks of Money Wanted.""

He did not believe the working men of Auswould take any such view. This, however, was the attutude of those who opposed offer and denounced it as a piece of hysteria. I put that alongside the very wise words Lord Charles Beresford, and the statement in the Manchester Guardian.

If he can harmonize the criticism which he levelled at their proposals with his action today in supporting that before the House, he is capable of more ingenuity than I give him credit for.",76
488,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member suggest that the formation of the proposed unit was the proposal of the Fisher Government ?,76
489,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The proposal submitted to us is thus set forth in the report of the Defence ConferenceThe Australian Fleet unit shall form part of the Eastern Fleet of the Empire to be composed of similar units of the Royal Navy, to be known as the China and the East Indies units respectively and the Australian Unit. The initial cost of such a Fleet Unit was estimated to be approximately :i Armoured Cruiser (new "" Indomitable"" class) ... ... £2,000,000 3 Unarmoured Cruisers (""Bristols"") at £350,000 ... 6 Destroyers (River class) at £80,000 ... ... ... 3 Submarine (C class) at £55,000 Total ... ... ... £3,695,000 The annual expenditure in connection with the maintenance of the Fleet Unit, pav of personnel and interest on first cost and sinking fund, was estimated to be about £600,000, to which amount a further additional sum would have to be added in view of the higher rates of pay in Australia and the cost of training and subsidiary establishments, making an estimated total of £750,000 a year. The Minister of Defence has told us that when his proposed scheme is in operation, the Commonwealth will be spending £1,742,000 on land defence, and £750,000 on naval defence, a total of £2,500,000. Whilst, no doubt, it is desirable to have a vessel of the Indomitable type as part of the Australian fleet, it is apparently not contemplated to have more than one such vessel, it being thought that our defence can be better provided for by lighter and swifter steamers. A glance at our situation shows the wisdom of that. It is improbable that a large fleet would be sent from the waters of the Old World to operate against Australia. What we have to fear tract? are what are known as commerce destroyers. When there was trouble between Russia and Japan, the Russian commerce destroyers - no t their large fighting vessels-bega n to overhaul British merchantmen, and to act in a manner calculated to provoke a breach of the peace. Had war broken out, the efforts of Russia would have been directed to doing as much damage as possible in crippling our commerce. Apparently, the intention is to provide against this. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has pointed out that, while vessels of the Dreadnought type are now popular, they may become obsolete at no distant date. Naval and military experts hold that view. Recently. I read an article in a leading American magazine, in which Sir Hiram Maxim, whose knowledge of these matters is unquestioned, expressed the opinion that ten years from now, the methods of defence and attack will be so revolutionized that Dreadnoughts will be obsolete and useless as weapons. He considered that the invention of swift torpedo boats of a new class, armed with more effective projectiles than are at present in general use. would be a reason for putting the Dread. noughts on the scrap-heap within ten vears. But we must also take into, account the marvellous discoveries in aerial navigation. Even one not intimately acquainted with 1,050,000 defence matters can readily see from the 480,000 articles in the magazines, and from recent 165,000 wonderful achievements, that a new field of defence and attack has heen opened up. It would be most unwise to launch forth very extensively in providing means of defence, which may prove unsuitable under the rapidly changing conditions. Tn an article in the American Review of Rcvicivs. headed "" Aerial Battleships-The End of War,"" is the following paragraphA Zeppelin airship is not a balloon, but a true ship-exactl y corresponding to an iron ocean ship. It has a strong rigid h u l l; it is sustained by displacing more than its own weight in the fluid that supports it ; it will sink only if it leaks badly. Neither the airship nor the iron ocean ship is in the slightest danger of sinking except by grounding or collision. . . . It is protected by a cover of tough rubber-cloth, stretched over aluminium rings and ribs, each strong enough to support a man's weight; and the whole is greatly strengthened by the upward pressure of the hydrogen in its inside balloons. It is f u l ly as strong for its purposes as an iron steam-ship. The airship is never strained by rolling or pitching, like the steamer, because the air acts upon it as a current and not as waves.",76
490,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What is the ob'ect of the honourable member in reading that ex,76
491,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"To show the unwisdom of committing the Commonwealth to a large expenditure on older methods of defence, particularly in the form of Dreadnoughts.",77
492,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is only right that J. should remind the honourable member of the fact that that matter has already been settled this session, and it would not be possible to make an alteration without rescinding the motion already carried.",77
493,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"All the more pity that the question should have been so settled. My only desire is to show the unwisdom of entering on a large expenditure for Dreadnoughts while newer methods are creating fresh conditions. While, under present conditions, ft may be advisable for the Commonwealth to commit itself to the construction of one large vessel, it would be most unwise to spend money in constructing many of the same character. Our real defence is to be found in newer vessels, more particularly the swifter, smaller, and less expensive River class and torpedo boats. The Government no longer appeal to the country to present a Dreadnought or its equivalent to the Mother Country j but have really adopted the Fisher programme for the creation of an Australian naval defence scheme. The Government, however, have not followed the Fisher programme altogether, because the latter not only set forth a scheme, but indicated the method by which it was proposed to finance it, as shown in the Gympie statement of policy. The present Government, in order to protect its wealthy friends, propose to establish an Australian unit by asking the Mother Country not merely to contribute £250,000 per annum, but to provide all the necessary money in the form of a loan. Is Australia to ""sponge"" on the Mother Country in that manner? That is not a nice epithet to use, but it is far more fiable under present circumstances than it was when the Minister of Defence used it. Australia, with all its wealth, instead of shouldering her share of the burden, proposes to ask the Mother Country for a loan; and that is a most despicable way of dealing with this Australian question. As between the proposed method and-that formulated by the Fisher Government, the comparison tells altogether, from the patriotic Australian stand-point, against the proposal now submitted. The scheme is practically to have these vessels constructed with English money. There may be circumstances under which a borrowing policy is justified, particularly in time of stress and trial as the outcome of war; but under conditions of peace and prosperity, such as at present obtain, it is neither patriotic nor in accord with Australian sentiment that our defence should be so provided. There are other reasons why the proposals of the Government should not be adopted af the present time. When the Commonwealth was in its youth, there was a proposal to initiate a policy of borrowing in order to carry out certain works which had been taken over from the States, and which, under State control, had been provided for out of loan moneys. This Parliament rejected the proposal, though it was far more justified then than it is on the present occasion. Parliament decided in the interests of sound finance that the Commonwealth should not be committea to a borrowing policy. The decision which was then arrived at has been respected ever since, and I think that the wisdom of the course which was adopted upon that occasion must be patent to all. At the time it was considered that our public works could not be constructed out of current revenue. But experience has falsified that idea, because during the period which has since elapsed ti.i Commonwealth has actually returned to the States £6,000,000 in addition to the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, to which they were entitled under the Braddon section of the Constitution. The Commonwealth has thus been able to carry out important public works without resort to the money market of the Old World. But in addition to the general undesirableness of the Commonwealth invading the London money market to enable it to undertake other than reproductive works, justiit must be recognised that any such step would introduce a seventh Australian competitor into that market- a competitor which would have only the same asset upon which to borrow. Each of the States borrowed largely in the past, and is still borrowing for the purpose of carrying out public undertakings. As a result they are very heavily committed to the bond-holders of the Old Country. If the Crmmonwealth enters the London' money ma/ket and pledges the same asset, it is obvious that either the States or itself must suffer. The States do not now occupy the position which they occupied a few years ago, they borrowed solely for new undertakings. Every year they are compelled to enter money market, not for the purpose of ing loans with which to construct lic works, but largely for the purpose enabling them to liquidate their maturing indebtedness. This circumstance presents the most benefit in this connection. to the States an entirely new problem. learn from Mr Knibbs' informative statisamount tics that during the next five years, 15, the States will be required to liquidate £46,188,300 worth of existing indebteding wealthless masses. ness. That money must be provided to reasonable? meet maturing loan obligations. Within next ten years, 1916-20, a further sum £33,571,120 must be provided for the same purpose; within the next fifteen 1921-25, an additional sum of £48,748,728, and within the next twenty years, 1926and 30-not a very long period in the history of a nation-a further sum of £ 7>597>937> making a total of £146,106,085, maturing between the years 1910-30. In the face this great financial problem it is seriously proposed that the Commonwealth should enter the London money market as a petitor with the States. Thus, instead of that the indebtedness of the States being consolibeen dated and placed under a central authority, we shall have the lamentable spectacle seven Australian competitors in the markets of the world. That would mean that Australia would be at the mercy money lenders. Expenditure upon defence does not appeal to me as a legitimate reason why we should enter the London money market. I have always laid it down as a sound axiom that our expenditure under that heading should be provided the wealthy rather than by the poor of community. If the former are to contribute in that connection they can do so only means of direct taxation. But the proposal to borrow money for defence purposes, and to make the interest upon it a charge upon the Conso' Jated Revenue will lay a heavy burden ui.jn the shoulders of the poor rather than upon those of the rich. The wealth of Australia is in the hands of paratively few of its people. It is estithat mated that the accumulated wealth of Newof South Wales represents from £375,000,000 to £400,000,000 . and' the whole of that accumulated wealth is in the hands of not more than 200.000 persons. There are 1,000 holders, who own to £130,000,000 of that enormous amount accumulated wealth, and 550,000 or 600,000 Mr Thomas Brown. when adult persons who practically have no part or lot therein. If that wealth the which is so vitally concerned is to raiscontribute its fair share towards the new pubcost of defence, the taking of the of money by indirect taxation will not place the burden evenly on those who derive It is I asking the holders of that enormous of wealth to contribute a mere frac1.910tion towards defence purposes, and placing practically the whole burden upon the toilIs that fair or The Labour Government the when it promulgated its policy of defence, of indicated that the wealth of Australia would be asked to contribute a fair share towards years, its cost. The Fusion Government; under the stress of public opinion in Australia the Mother Country, has adopted the Labour defence programme to the extent of providing a naval unit, but it has shirked T the obligation of charging the cost of it on of the wealth of Australia. It has stood by the wealthy classes which it represents, because the Fusion itself was the outcome of comthe pressure in politics which demanded wealth and special privilege should be defended by the joining of those who had politically sundered, and whose views on most political questions had differed. of So, whilst taking the Fisher programme moneyin regard to the unit, they are protecting their wealthy friends by placing of the the burden of financing it on the shoulders of the masses and allowing the wealthy of the community to practically escape. I regard this question as being one purely of defence and not of defiance. I do not think that Australia desires to be at by enmity with any of the peoples outside her the borders. On the contrary, she desires to be on terms of friendliness, and to have by a good commercial relationship with them. The commercial relations of Australia are rapidly growing. They, are not now confined to the Mother Country. The big powers of Europe, notably Germany and France, are entering into close commercial relations with Australia, and we desire to preserve comthat advantage. It will be remembered because during the stress and storm the Dreadnought scare I had expressed similar views I was denounced by my political opponents on the other side as being disloyal to the Empire. I believe that modern civilization owes a great deal the talent, the energy, and the progresof siveness of the British and the German peoples. I hope that in the years to come that contribution to civilization willfoein an increasing ratio. I know of nothing that will put back the hands of progress and good fellowship to a greater extent than will a big war between those two great peoples. Some of the best of our farmers and agriculturists have been drawn from Germany, and whilst they have a keen love for the Fatherland, they are not unpatriotic Australians. They have cast in their lot with us, and are prepared to let Australian conditions, if need be, determine their future. Whilst that is so,. I think that anything in the nature of promoting a 'disagreement between the two peoples should be deplored rather than encouraged, and the people of Australia and the people of the Mother Country will be' well advised to do everything in their power to maintain the good feeling and the good relationship which have hitherto existed. It was said in the Old Country that the late trouble was largely fomented for political reasons, but I believe that it was largely the outcome of a feeling of commercial rivalry, and also a feeling of uncertainty with respect to a few individuals who control the destinies of the great German Empire. But apart from that, I think that there is no great feeling of bitterness or vindictiveness between the two great peoples. It is not the building of Dreadnoughts, and the fomenting of ill-will, which may lead up to a great war, which is going to secure to Great Britain her commercial supremacy. She must be prepared to adopt modern methods, to hold her own with her competitor by legitimate competition, rather than by the building of Dreadnoughts and fomenting ill-will between two great peoples. Whilst we in Australia are prepared to take a hand in defence purposes, we regard our provision as defence, not as defiance, or for the purpose of aggression. Defence is an expression of national preservation and patriotism. Australian self-preservation and patriotism are not necessarily antagonistic to British or Empire preservation or patriotism; but may, and should be, their complement. There is no justification for the innuendo, and. in some cases, the direct statement that Australian patriotism means or spells disloyaltv to the Empire, and that the desire to build an Australian navy, and to provide for Australian defence, is necessarily antagonistic to the best interests of the. Empire. Finally, Australian naval defence should be-fa ) naid for by Australian money; [245] (b) built by Australian labour and skill out of Australian material so far as possible; (c) manned by Australian men animated with Australian patriotism; and (d) an Australian Fleet under Australian supervision and control up to the point when Empire needs united action under central control. The cost of defence should be levied on the wealth, rather than on the poverty of the community; and, therefore, should be paid out of direct rather than indirect taxation or public loans. .

494,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Cook) [11.24] - I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether it is proposed that the House should sit on Saturday and Monday ? I heard a rumour to thai effect. If the honourable gentleman has made up his mind as to the arrangements which are.to be made for next week, he should give the House early notice of them.",80
495,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Notic e of a motion dealing with the matter has been given for tomorrow.,80
496,Mr HALL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Werriwa) [11.25] - couple of days ago I brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General the fact that owing to the strike the people living in a large district of New South Wales are not receiving their mails regularly. The service from Goulburn to Cooma has been cut down by one-half. The residents of the whole of the Monaro district, at Cooma, Bombala, Dalgety, and Eden are left without their regular mails. I understood that the Postmaster-General would make some inquiries into the matter, but, so far as I can learn, no inquiries have yet been made. There does not appear to be the slightest disposition on the part of the honourable gentleman to make inquiry in order that the people of the district. I have referred to may be supplied with the mail service which they have enjoyed in the past. I do not say that it is always possible for the Government to rush in and employ motor cars for the carriage of mails. That might in some cases be found to be impracticable, but surely in an urgent case of this kind it is possible for the Postmaster-General to discover how much it vvpuld cost to carry out the service by using motor cars? If it is found to be a practicable scheme, it should be put into operation at once. I trust that the Postmaster-General will not allow this matter to remain in abeyance. He has already received wires assuring him that there are people who are prepared to give the Department a price for the work. If the work can be done at a reasonable price, these people should be no longer denied the service. I refer to the matter now in order to impress the Postmaster-General",80
497,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Post master-General) [11.27] - Hail services have been considerably reduced in other districts in New South Wales, and also in Victoria. In many cases the reductions have been serious, and have involved great inconvenience to the public. In others less inconvenience has been caused. It would be scarcely fair to select one particular service such as that mentioned by the honourable member for Werriwa and give specially favourable treatment to that district by supplying a substituted service. Other districts are entitled to equal consideration. I promised to make inquiries, but I could not make inquiries and come to a decision upon an important matter like this in a A day or two. One is hopeful, also, that the unfortunate strike may terminate before it becomes necessary to resort to heroic measures. If it is to be prolonged, the Department will, of course, have to consider the necessity of providing substituted services, but I do not think that we should rush into new arrangements unless specal and urgent circumstances would justify us in doing so.",80
498,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Gwydir) [11.29] - I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he can give the House any informationwith regard to the appointment of. the High Commissioner, and whether he can say who is likely to be appointed ? I feel that now that the Bill has been passed by both Houses, we are entitled to know what the Government intend to do. We are anxious that the High Commissioner should take up the duties of his office as early as possible. We know that the Government were anxious to get the Bill through, and it occurred to me that in' the circumstances they would have so far completed their arrangements that by the time the measure was passed they would be in a position to tell the House who is to be appoinfed to the office, and when the Commissioner is to take up his duties.",80
499,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Swan-Trea surer) [11.30] - I have no information on the matter, and I have never made any inquiry in regard to it. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.31 p.m.",80
