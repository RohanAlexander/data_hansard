These men, I understand, have now received notice to leave, bn the ground that the Public Service Act prohibits temporary employment for periods longer' than nine months.

Mr. JOSEPH COOK laid upon the the Gotable the following paper:Defence Acts-Militar y Forces-Financia l and Allowance Regulations Amended (ProviNos. 158, 158(a)-Statutor y Rules 1909, ADJOURNMENT (Formal). the OLD-AGE PENSIONS ACT ADMINISTRATION.",17
29,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Newcastle) [2.47] - I with desire to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The administration of the Old-age Pensions Act."" Five honourable members having risen in Question proposed.",17
30,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"The question that If a wish to bring under the notice of the House has engaged my attention for the if last three months, and has been brought Conbv me before both the Minister and the Commissioner. It affects, roughly speaking, about 60,000 citizens. According to the figures that I have been able to obtain there are in New South Wales 43,756 miners, and allowing for men engaged in other industries who are affected by the proadministration of the Old-age Pensions Act, we have the total I have mentioned. In section 4 of the Act we have a definition of the "" income,"" which is to be taken into account, in determining the pensions payable to claimants. There is a proviso to that definition which was evidently inserted with a view of encouraging thrift. The definition reads: : Income means any moneys . ceived by any person for his own use or benefit . . . and shall be deemed to include personal earnings, but not any payment(a) By way of benefit from any friendly society registered under any Act, or State Act, or (4) During illness, infirmity, or old-age, from any trade union, provident society, or other society or association. I regard that language as wide enough to include any association of workmen or other people formed with a view to providing benefits in case of old age, accident, or death; but the Attorney-General has decided that the particular association I have in view cannot be brought within the section. The fund has been in existence in New South Wales, under Act of Parliament, since 1900. Prior to that date, miners and other employees had formed local branches, by means of which the fund was collected and managed; but,'under the present arrangements, contributions are made by the employers and by the Government. The payment by the Government is not a subsidy, but a contribution from a participator in the business, seeing that the State receives large royalties on the coal produced. The fund is contributed, roughly, to the extent of one-half by the men, and one-half by the employers and the Government ; and not only are temporary act cidents provided for, but there are payments to widows, orphans, and other relatives in case of fatal accident, and allowances to men who have been permamently injured while following their employment. The following figures for 1908 will, I think, show that, in every sense of the word, this is a provident fund:Distinct mines subject to the Act during the year ... ... Mines subject to the Act, 31st igoS ... ... Number of fatal accidents year ... Number of non-fatal accidents year ... ... BENEFICIARIES, 31 ST DECEMBER, (a) Fatal Accidents. Widows .. --- .. --Fathers ... ... Mothers ... ... Sisters and guardians ... .Children ... ... (i) Non-fatal Accidents. Persons permanently disabled ... ... 92 Children of persons permanently disabled 106 Funeral allowances, igoS ... £728 1 o Relief paid, exclusive of funeral allowances. re- (a) To relatives of deceased persons £g, g 5 4 5 (0) To persons disabled ... £24,212 8 10 7 Every provision that is made in any other provident fund is made in this fund. The Attorney-General merely gave a decision without any reason; and it is to the following effect:The New South Wales Miners' Accident Relief Act igoo provides for certain payments being made to miners meeting with accidents by Committees appointed under the Act. The funds available to meet the payments arise from contributions by the miners, contributions by the mine-owners, and an annual Government subsidy. Roughly, the miners' contribution is one-half of the whole sum contributed, the remainder being made up by the mine-owners' contributions and the Government subsidy. In my opinion the payments are not payments from a friendly society, trade union, provident society, or other society or association, and should therefore be treated as income. I have examined the Old-age Pensions Act and I cannot find anything to debar a fund of this description, simply on the ground that it is regulated by Act of Parliament; there is nothing which makes it necessary for a provident fund to be either voluntary or compulsory. Whether the technical reading given to the section by the Attorney-General be correct or not, it was never the intention of Parliament to make such a differentiation as has been made under the regulations. The New South Wales Act was passed with a view to encouraging the employees to make provision for themselves; and, under the decision of the Attorney-General, the contributors to the fund are to have, their pensions reduced simply and solely because they have been thrifty. The administration of old-age pensions, particularly since it has been a Commonwealth concern, shows too great a ... ... 185 desire to punish people because they have December, been thoughtful enough to endeavour to 172 make some provision for themselves. A during the person who, for instance, has been able ... 64 during the to purchase a small cottage, or to join such ... ... 6,147 a fund as that to which I have referred, igog. is made to suffer, while the careless and thriftless are paid pensions without demur. 207 I may point out that a little while ago, the ... ... 12 Treasurer was questioned as to the position .. --- 31 of Imperial military pensioners under ... ... n the Old-age Pensions Act, and we were ... ... 417 informed that such pensions must not be regarded as income.",17
31,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,Whose decision is that?,19
32,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"The Treasurer so decided, and, I think, very properly.",19
33,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I do not think the honourable member is quite right, because, when I spoke to the Treasurer on Tuesday last, he said he had not given such a decision.",19
34,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,I think the honourable member for Newcastle is mistaken.,19
35,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,I am quoting a reply which was given by the Treasurer to Mr. Crouch.,19
36,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,When was that question asked ?,19
37,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"A month or six weeks ago; and if I am correct, the contributors to the miners' fund of New South Wales are doubly wronged. The money subscribed by the men themselves, has paid for all benefits and accidents compensation within about £6.ooo; and the position of the men is surely bad enough when we have regard to the calling which they follow. Surely the position of employees, whether in the leaden hell, shall I say, of Broken Hill, or the coal mines of New South Wales, in which so many accidents occur every year, is bad and hard enough, with their intermittent employment and the necessity of keeping up their contributions to this fund, without their being robbed under an Act which was intended to benefit them, owing to the way in which it is being administered. I shall be glad to hear the Attorney-General give reasons for this decision. If the Government accept the Attorney-General's opinion as to the reading of the Act, do they not think that this point alone is important enough to warrant the immediate introduction of an amending Bill? The intention of the Legislature was not to differentiate between one provident society and another, or to deal differently with different bodies of citizens. Apart from that question, I am sorry to say that my experience shows that the administration of the Act generally has been very unsympathetic, to say the least of it. Every attempt has been made to lower the pensions of people who have come under the Federal Act from under the New South Wales Act. All sorts of flimsy excuses have been given for these reductions.",19
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,It is curious that the New South Wales Act has always been administered in the same way in regard to those who benefit under the fund to which the honourable member refers.,19
39,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Whether that is true or not, it does not affect our position.",19
40,Mr THOMAS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,I am surprised to hear that the New South Wales Act was administered in that way.,19
41,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I also am surprised to learn it ; but the administration of the Federal Act generally, although it is supposed to be a more liberal measure than was the New South Wales Act, presses more hardly upon these people. Facts speak for themselves. Is the Treasurer prepared to allow this anomaly to remain in our Act? A man who receives a gratuity or pension from a friendly society receives full consideration, but another, who receives payments from this fund, to which he has subscribed in the same way as he would have subscribed to a friendly society, is penalized. Is the Treasurer prepared to say that that practice must continue? If he will look at the question as he ought to do, I am sure he will agree that he can make no distinction between one subscriber and another.",19
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,The administration is exactly the same as in New South Wales.,19
43,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,That is not the point. The point is: Does the right honourable member believe it to be right ?,19
44,Mr JH CATTS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"It is not the same, anyhow.",19
45,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I do not think that it is the same. The question is: Is it right or wrong? It seems to be stretching the law to the furthest degree to exclude these people from the full benefits of the Act. Has the Treasurer decided, or has he not, that old soldiers' pensions shall not be regarded as income?",19
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,Certainly not. They are income.,19
47,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Then the reply received by the honourable member for Corio was incorrect. As I read it, it was that the Treasurer had decided not to treat old soldiers' pensions as income. I do not object to that.",19
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I think the honourable member is in error. Mr WATKIN S' - The reply that I saw came from the Department in answer to a request by the honourable member for Corio. Will the Treasurer seek to have the Act rectified so as to put those who receive benefits under the fund to which I have referred in the same position as every other person who belongs to a provident society ? The very silence of Ministers on this point, as on the other point, proves to me that during the two and a half months in which they have been administering the Act-and this has been my experience-thei r desire has ibeen to cut the pensions down to the lowest possible limit.",19
49,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I suppose that this is very good "" copy "" for the honourable member.",20
50,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Unlik e the right honourable member, I do not require it.",20
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,It is insulting.,20
52,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,I do not wish insulting.,20
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I have given honourable member any number of answers, but they will not suit. Apparently he must advertise himself.",20
54,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Is not that insulting? raised. I do not require to advertise myself in my definition :electorate. The right honourable member cannot regard an old-age pensioner in any sideration, other way than as a rogue who is trying to get at the Treasury.",20
55,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,And he is an Imperial in pensioner himself.,20
56,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Although , as I am reminded, the right honourable member is a pensioner himself, he cannot consider the claims of these old people fairly. There is too great a tendency on the part of those who are at the head of this DepartAs ment, at least in - New South Wales, to requestion gard old people who have been at all thrifty as trying to get at the Treasury with respect to their pensions. The effect of such administration has been that per-, sons who have not been thrifty or successin ful enough to secure a bit of a cottage their heads, or to be able to keep up their contributions to a provident fund, receive the full pension of ios. They certainly should get it, but, on the other hand, the person who has kept up his contributions owns a cottage should surely not be ished for his thriftiness. I trust when the Attorney-General replies he will give cogent reasons for his interpretation the Act, and that he will also state whether it is the intention of the Government to the matter right at the earliest possible moment.",20
57,Dr LIDDELL,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,Hunter) [3.11] - I dewhoever he may be. sire to extend my cordial support to the views expressed by the honourable member the State law? for Newcastle.,20
58,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"This is not ""copy,"" I suppose?",20
59,Dr LIDDELL,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"This is not ""copy."" I am not making an electioneering speech. I am speaking as the representative of the majority of the miners of New South Wales. This is not the first time that I have had occasion to champion their cause. I am proud to number many friends among the miners, and I trust that for many years to come I shall have the honour and pleasure of representing them in this House. I am not now canvassing for their votes, but endeavouring to do my duty, and shall continue to do it, in spite of the remarks hurled at me by honourable members oppoto be site, who ought to know better.",20

61,Dr LIDDELL,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I will read the portion of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act affecting the question that has been Section 4 contains the following _ "" Income "" means any moneys, valuable conor profits earned, derived, or received by any persons for his own use or benefit by any means from any source whatever, whether or out of the Commonwealth, and shall be deemed to include personal earnings, but not any payment(a) by way of benefit from any friendly society registered under any. Act or State Act, or (i) during illness, infirmity, or old age from any trade union, provident society, or other society or association. I understand it, the accident fund in is maintained by contributions from the. Government of New South Wales, the employers, and the employees. Personally I can see no difference between such a fund and a friendly society, such as is mentioned the definition which I have quoted. It over would have been better had it been made clearer in the Act that it was not intended that an accident fund should be ear-marked as is now being done. But the mere fact that such accident funds were not specially or mentioned is sufficient to show that it was punnot intended by Parliament that such a that fund should be ear-marked. As a layman I do not intend to question the ruling of of the Attorney-General. I know enough of what happens in my own profession in conput nexion with consultations to express an opinion in opposition to the ruling of the chief law officer of the Commonwealth,",20
62,Mr MAUGER,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,What was done under,20
63,Dr LIDDELL,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,We have no concern with the State law. Our business is with the Commonwealth Act.,20
64,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,Unde r a motion for the adjournment of the House honourable members are strictly limited to time. Therefore it is distinctly unfair for other honoris able members to take up a portion of the time of a speaker by asking questions which may or may not be relevant. I ask honourable members to permit the honourable member for Hunter to proceed uninterrupted.,21
65,Dr LIDDELL,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I shall not enter into such details as were quoted by the honourable member for Newcastle, who put the matter very clearly. I agree with him that it is undesirable to levy a tax on the thrift of the people. We should remember that, although a man may not be a millionaire, yet, if he has brought up a family in such a way that its members are of use and service to the country, he deserves just as much credit as does a man who, perhaps, with a smaller family, leaves a large sum of money for public purposes. The wealth of a State is not to be counted only in pounds, shillings, and pence. We are not dealing merely with a question of gold, silver, and copper, but with the lives of men who have produced wealth for the benefit of the country. Such a man, who has lived a useful and industrious life, is, in my opinion, worth more to the country than many a man who leaves a mass of wealth behind him. I wish to make a suggestion .to the Government. I do not know that it is desirable to urge it particularly upon the Treasurer, because he is a sort of Cerberus standing at the door of the Treasury, and naturally anxious to diminish the expenditure of money. I would make an appeal to the Prime Minister, that he should, at the earliest possible moment, draft an amending Bill providing that miners' accident funds shall not be earmarked.",21
66,Mr SPENCE,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Darling) [3.16] - It is evident, from what has been discovered on the point at issue being submitted to the Attorney-General, that an oversight occurred in the drafting of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Such errors are not uncommon. We have frequently had amending Bills designed to improve Acts of Parliament. But no one can doubt that when the Act was under consideration there was a desire to be liberal, and not to have a narrow interpretation put upon the measure. The rapidity and unanimity with which the Act was passed is proof of what I say. The Miners' Relief Fund was established in New South Wales for a beneficent purpose. I am glad to say that I had a hand in assisting to establish it. Contributions are made to the fund by the Go%ernr ment, the miners, and employers. One-half contributed by the miners themselves. It is true that the fund is not called an association, but that is no reason why it should not be treated on the same basis as friendly societies, which have a similar object. The fund makes provision for contingencies that are likely to arise in such a dangerous occupation as that of coal mining. I do not think that there is any desire to save money for the Treasury in this way. I doubt whether the Treasurer himself is the kind of man who would desire to save a few pounds by shutting out a class on a mere technically. The Act was passed hurriedly It was a well-designed measure, but, of course, we only find out defects after such an Act has been in working order for some time.",21
67,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,Ver y few of the clauses were discussed at all.,21
68,Mr SPENCE,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Scarcel y any of them were discussed. The desire was to pass the Bill quickly, and the details were not debated. I doubt whether the draftsman realized how the measure would affect such a fund as that which has been mentioned. I have no doubt that if honourable members had been reminded of the existence of this fund in New South Wales an amendment of the Bill would have been proposed to meet the difficulty which has since arisen. I am sure that honourable members of the Labour party, and particularly those representing mining districts, would have seen to that. The provisions of the New South Wales Act which has been referred to were based to some extent upon details which I was able to supply from myexperience, and as one who for very many years was associated with miners and Labour organizations generally, I should certainly have taken some action in the matter had I remembered the existence of this fund inNew South Wales. I was astounded when the honourable member for Newcastle brought under my notice the interpretation put upon the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act in this respect. I am not going to say that the Attorney-General is not right in his interpretation. The probability is that the honourable and learned gentleman is right, and in any case we have to be guided by his opinion. In the circumstances the Government should not hesitate to propose the necessary amendment of the law. Honourable members are unanimous in their desire that the Commonwealth Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act should be as liberal a measure as is possible, and I believe that they will be just as unanimous in agreeing - that miners receiving benefits from the miners' relief fund in New South Wales should be placed on the same footing as members of friendly societies and kindred associations. Those who have read of the conditions under which miners have to carry on their occupation at Bendigo and other places in the Commonwealth, who know how unhealthy the occupation is, and that young men working in mines frequently suffer and die from miners' complaint, will agree that there, is no class in the community more deserving of consideration. I hope that the Government will at once announce their intention to proceed with an amendment of the law. Now is the time to deal with the matter, and give satisfaction to a large section in the community who, unfortunately, because of this interpretation of the law, are shut out from the benefits it was intended to confer. They believe that they are suffering an injustice forwhich Parliament must be held responsible as long as the injustice continues, and the Government, having in their hands the conduct of the business of Parliament, must shoulder the responsibility for any delay in remedying the defect which has been pointed out.",21
69,Mr THOMAS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,Barrier) [3.25] - I am very glad that the honourable member for Newcastle has brought this matter under the attention of the House. I confess that I was surprised to learn that the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was'being administered in such a way as to exclude from its benefits those who are in receipt of any benefit from the Miners' Accident Relief Fund established in New South Wales.,22
70,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"It is not a question of administration, but of the legal interpretation of the Act.",22
71,Mr THOMAS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I am not blaming Ministers particularly in the matter. interpretation placed upon the Act is correct, we must bow to it, and it will be our duty to alter the Act - I am glad that the question has been raised, because there is a bigger question behind it. I believe that what has transpired adds force to the contention which I have emphasized more than once in this House, that if the operation of an Old-age Pensions Act is to be satisfactory its application must be'universal. Every one in the community should come under its operation without any disqualification depending upon the ownership of property. I have also been surprised to learn from the Treasurer that the New South Wales Old-age Pensions Act was administered in such a way that any one receiving benefits from the Miners' Accident Relief Fund was held not to be entitled to an old-age pension.",22
72,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"As a matter of policy, not as a matter of law. I asked the question today, and I am informed that that was the manner in which the Act was administered. At the same time the New South Wales Act was not identical in terms with the Commonwealth Act.",22
73,Mr THOMAS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I was surprised to learn that the New South Wales Act was administered in that way, because I was a member of the New South Wales Parliament when the Miners' Accident Relief Bill was carried, and I remember that we specially provided in the measure that the receipt of money from the relief fund should not interfere with the right of a miner to compensation in case of accident. It seems strange that the Government of New South Wales should hold that if a person is injured in a mine he can claim compensation from the owner of the mine, although he might be in receipt of benefit from the miners' relief fund, and that at the same time they should hold that if a miner is in receipt of benefit from that fund he is not entitled to an old-age pension. I understand that as Law Officer of the Crown, the Attorney-General is' of opinion that pensions jfcannot legally be paid to persons receiving benefits under the New South Wales Miners' Relief Fund.",22
74,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,That is so.,22
75,Mr THOMAS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"If that be so, I hope that, in common with other honourable members who have spoken, some amendment of the law will be passed to overcome the difficulty. If the Attorney-General's view of the law be correct, the miners of If the New South Wales are placed in a different position from miners in any other part of Australia, because I think there are no other miners in Australia who are working under an Act similar to the Miners' Accident Re lief Act of New South Wales.",22
76,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,I think their position is unique.,22
77,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,How much does a miner get under the Act referred to?,22
78,Mr THOMAS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I think a miner gets 12s. 6d. per week, and if he is killed in an accident his widow gets 8s. per week.",22
79,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,The contributions from the fund cannot exceed those amounts.,23
80,Mr THOMAS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"It seems very hard that because miners of New South Wales contribute 4^d. per week to an accident fund, out of which in case of death, pensions are paid to their widows, they should be ineligible to receive old-age pensions. However, that is the position, and, therefore, it must be conceded that they labour under a disability as compared with the miners in other parts of the 'Commonwealth. If the Crown Law authorities are satisfied that that is the law, I hope that it will be speedily amended. I can assure the Government that if they will introduce an: amending which will remove this disqualification, no time will be wasted by honourable members upon this side of the Chamber in discussing it. I am glad that the matter has been brought forward, not only because it affects the miners of New South Wales, .but because it shows how anomalous is the law in regard to the payment of old age pensions. I do not ask the Treasurer to pay any claims made under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act which are outside the law.",23
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,I have not the power to fix the amounts payable under that Act,23
82,Mr THOMAS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Exactly . But within the scope of the law, I hope that the honourable gentleman will see that the Act is sympathetically administered. very humane measure, but it is one which contains many anomalies. anomalies will never be rectified until we provide for the payment of universal old age pensions. I hope that at an early date the Government will bring forward an amending measure to meet the case of the coal miners of New South Wales, and to so widen the scope of existing legislation that every person, upon reaching sixty-five years of age, shall receive an old-age pension.",23
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [3.34]--As one who, with others, originated the legislation in New South Wales to which reference has been made-legislatio n which seems to lay upon the coal miners of that State a disability under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, I sympathize deeply with those who take up a similar attitude to that taken up by the honourable member for Newcastle. But it is a pity that he did not state his case without tilting at the Government. After all, we are bound by the law.",23
84,Mr WJATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,The tilting at the Government was provoked by the taunt of the Treasurer.,23
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I think that we ought to consider this matter free from prejudice, and absolutely upon its merits. To me, it does seem an anomaly that the contributions of the coal miners of New South Wales should be placed in a different category, so far as the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act is concerned, from those made to ordinary friendly societies. Those contributions ought not to lay the miners under a disability-in fact, the Bill, contrary should be the case.. The menare compelled to make those contributions. To my mind, the anomaly seems to be that while they are compelled by law to provide this beneficial interest for themselves under the Coal Mines Accident Act, they are also compelled as taxpayers to assist in providing funds with which to pay old-age pensions to other persons who do not labour under a similar disability. The result is that the law bears unequally upon these citizens of the Commonwealth. To tell them that their action in contributing towards an accident fund shall hereafter constitute a disability under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, is a poor way of encouraging them. There is, of course, this circumstance to be considered, that It is a the New South Wales Government themselves contribute towards that fund to Those the extent of, I think, one-third.",23
86,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"That contribution is not in the nature of State aid. It is made because the New South Wales Government receive royalties, and are part proprietors in the business.",23
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,I am aware of that.,23
88,Mr THOMAS BROWN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"The men contribute one half, the mine-owners a quarter,, and the New South Wales Government a quarter.",23
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Originall y the amount contributed by the men was a third. But the fact that the Government contributes so little makes the claim of the minersall the stronger. The Coal Mines Accident Act was passed with the idea of encouraging them to provide for themselves whenaccident befell them. It is an anomaly that their action in that connection should impose upon them a disability under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions ActHowever, that is the law, and, candidly, I think that some action ought to be taken to amend it. J do not see why the coal miners of New South Wales should not be placed in the same category as the members of friendly societies and of other societies of a kindred character. In its very essence the fund to which they contribute is a provident fund. The very genius of the Act under which those contributions are made is to induce them to effect this provident assurance against accidents.",23
90,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"U p to date, the subscriptions of the miners have almost cov- ered the amount which has been paid to them out of the fund. The other contri-butions are practically held in reserve.",24
91,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,That is the principle underlying the Act.,24
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Exactly . Whatever the miners receive out of the fund, they first pay into it. I do not know anything about the subtleties of law, but pears to me that in its very essence, - the fund to which these miners contribute is a provident fund. However, I cannot pretend to interpret the legal position. I have no doubt but the Attorney-General has given this matter that careful and patient study which he bestows upon all matters demanding his attention. Knowing his humanitarian instincts we may be quite sure that if he could he would stretch the law a point in favour of the miners. Every one in the House, I believe, holds that opinion of my honourable friend, but, of course, he is bound by the law. I think that the suggestion of the honourable member for Hunter, that this matter should receive the earnest consideration of the Government, is a very proper one, and, on the Prime Minister's return, I shall put the case to him.",24

99,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,-Provisio n is also made in respect of contributors to insurance companies.,24
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"This insurance is forced upon the miners by the State law, no doubt with a very good object, and the system works admirably. The contribution to the fund means that so much is taken out of their scanty earnings every year. It seems to me that they are treated very harshly when the contribution is made a disability by the Old-age Pensions Act. If we were to take into account all the matters to which the honourable member for Dalley alluded, it would be necessary to reconstruct the law. It should be borne in mind that the very genius of our legislation is indigence as well as old age. In order to be qualified for a pension, a person must <be not merely old and incapable of work, but also indigent. It has been it ap- suggested by the honourable member for Barrier that the old-age pension should be made a matter of right, and associated with citizenship rather than with indigence. That is one of those evolutions of the future to which we shall all look forward with great interest. Speaking quite candidly, I should like to see established a great national insurance fund under which every individual would be entitled to receive an amount, because he was a citizen and a contributor. That, no doubt, is the logical outcome of this legislation, and hereafter it may become obligatory upon a Government to bring a scheme of that kind into operation, but that time is not now. The Old-age Pensions Act has to be administered as it stands. At the present time, certain miners are deprived of an old-age pension.

It is quite opposed to every ciple which should operate in a rightlystart. governed community. It relieves unfortunate persons, no matter what they have done, so long as they are poor and incapable of work. It is wrong not to help a miner simply because he has made some provision for his old age by means of weekly contribution to an insurance fund.

121,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"West Sydney) [3-5 ]-I am not satisfied that the opinion of the Attorney-General respecting the deduction from old-age pensions of amounts equivalent to the income earned during the previous year must be regarded as conclusive, and am strengthened in that view by the fact that the administration of the Commonwealth Act has been upon the lines laid down in New South Wales, in this and other matters. The definition of ""income "" in the Commonwealth Act is in part copied verbatim from the. New South Wales Act, and where it departs from it. must be assumed to do so for a good and sufficient reason. The New South Wales definition is thisAny moneys, valuable consideration, or profits derived or received by any person for his own use or benefit in any year, by any means or from any source, and computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and includes personal earnings, but does Dot include any pension payable under this Act, nor any payment by way of sick allowance or funeral benefit from any registered friendly society. That is almost exactly the wording of the Commonwealth Act, but we deliberately substituted, in regard to payments of sick relief and the like, this provisionBut not any payment(a) By way of benefit from any friendly society registered under any Act or State'Act, or (i) During illness, infirmity, or old-age from any trade union, provident society, or other society or association. The New South Wales Miners' Accident Relief Act created a fund vested in a Board, which, within the meaning of the Commonwealth Old-age Pensions Act is an association, just as the Railways Commisthe sioners of the States would be within the meaning of our Conciliation and and Arbitration Act, were they not specUnder ially exempted from the operation its provisions. An old-age pensions should always be administered symceived pathetically, and where there is ambiguity, application for the pension. the interpretation should be such as to the fullest effect to the intentions of its framers. But in the administration of Commonwealth Act the Department, whencome, ever a provision has been open to a wide and a narrow interpretation, has always adopted the latter. I do not blame the Treasurer for his vigilance in protecting the revenue, but it is the duty of Commissioner for old-age pensions to terpret the law sympathetically. In opinion, the definition of income, and the exceptions mentioned in connection thereat with, are sufficient to justify him in treatcumstances ing the Miners' Accident Relief Fund 2 Board as an association within the meaning . of the section. According to the Attorney General, the payments from this fund are not "" payments from a friendly society, trade union, provident society or other society or association."" I ask the honourable member whether a body having a corporate existence such as this has, is net an "" association,"" arid why it must not be so regarded merely because it happens to be a State Department. Had the New South Wales Government, like the New Zealand Government!"", provided for insurance against sickness or accidents, any person insured with it would be prevented, according to the opinion given by the honourable gentleman, from benefiting under the Old-age Pensions Act without suffering a deduction of the amount paid to him in regard thereto. I wish to know why he considers that a State Department differs from an ordinary corporation. If we took away one ot the three contributors-the Stateto the Miners' Accident Relief Fund, the remaining two would constitute such a corporation as would enable any miner benefiting under it to draw an old-age pension without deduction. I think that we should proceed to the amendment of the Act only in the last resort. The Treasury has a traditional dislike to disbursing public money in a liberal fashion. That is shown by the interpretation which' it has adopted as to what constitutes income, and how the amount of an income is to be determined. According to the New South Wales Act, an income year meanstwelve months ending one month before the date on which the pension claim is admitted, at the same time in each subsequent year. that Act the amount of pension of payable to a claimant is determined law upon the basis of the income reduring the year preceding the Those give administering the New South Wales Act, therefore, were perfectly justified in paying the upon the basis of the previous year's inbut since there is no such provision in th? Commonwealth Act, there is no 'justification for adopting a like basis; in dealing with claims made under it. the Under the Commonwealth Act there is no indirection to the Commissioner save that my given in section 24, which provides thatThe amount of a pensiin shall in each case be such rate as, having regard to all the cirof the case, the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner who determines the pension claim, deems reasonable and sufficient. . . . I , therefore, submit that the Commissioner has fallen into an error in assuming that the mandatory provision in the New South fund. Wales Act, to which I have referred, applies also to the Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. His decision in that respect affects a great many more persons than does that which the honourable memresult ber for Newcastle has brought up. Both these matters can be adjusted, however, without an amendment of the Statute. In the Miners' Accident Relief Fund Act New South Wales, it is provided that there shall be a Committee invested with certain powers. Section 8 provides that there shall be a Board, to be known as the New South Wales Miners' Accident Relief Board, and that it shall be a body corporate tual succession and a common seal. By what process of reasoning does the Attorney-GenOld-age eral declare that that Board is not an sociation within the meaning of section 4 not pay the levy. of the Commonwealth Act?

At the same time the association ought not to be allowed to force its members to contribute to a with perpepolitical organization.",27
128,Mr JH CATTS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,The Commonwealth Pensions Act does not distinguish asbetween those who pay and those who do,27
129,Dr WILSON,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I admit that. The is point I wish to make is that in the working of the association one set of men holding certain political views should not be penalized as against another set holding other political views. They ought not to be cut off from the fund because of their refusal pay this special levy,' and those who are receiving payments from that fund should not be deprived of the privileges of the Old-age Pensions Act. I do not underthe legal position, as put by the Atbut I hope that both he and Treasurer will be able to deal with this a matter sympathetically. Men ought not to be made to suffer because of their proviis, dence. To my own knowledge the administration of the Act in some respects has been rather on the side of harshness than of leniency. Recently in the Piggoreet disan old woman who had a house and be some land, but was in very bad health, apfor a pension and was awarded by the police magistrate who dealt with her memclaim a pension of ios. per week. To her astonishment, when she applied for the first payment she could not obtain it, a and pending a settlement of her case, some of her friends had to provide her with money. She then found that she was to receive 9s. instead of ios.; but it was about a fortpolnight before even that was finally settled. The house and land' she had recently transferred to her daughter, because the latter had given up a situation in order that she The house was such a poor one that it swayed with the wind, while the land, in a mining to district, was such that it would not run a billy-goat. The only product of the land was a little firewood, so that it was of no value for the purpose of income. We all admit that the Act ought to be administered so as to prevent fraud; but when a case has ibeen looked into very closely by the magistrates-and they are generally pretty astute-it is stretching the point too far to reduce a pension, in the way I have described, unless for very good cause. This is only one case of the kind brought under my notice, but it indicates that there may be a great many more; and I plead that the Act should be sympathetically administered. People who earn comparatively small wages ought to be encouraged rather than discouraged in making efforts to provide in some measure for their old age.",27
130,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Perth) [4.14] - I had intended saying something on the matter of old-age pensions on the first item on the notice-paper; but, seeing that, for some reasons, which I do not quite understand, the adjournment of the House has been moved, I shall take the present opportunity. The discussion has taken an interesting, and, I think, instructive turn; and doubtless the Treasurer will have received some very useful suggestions for improvement in the administration of the Act. 1 agree with those who urge that thrift should not be penalized in the way it is under the present measure. A line could easily be drawn between indigence and competency, so that a person, of the required age, and in needful circumstances, should have the advantage of the Act. But the honourable member for Barrier, in his contention that everybody on reaching a certain age should be entitled to draw a pension, has almost reached.the reductio ad. absutdum.' No one will seriously contend that a person with a competency ought to be entitled to draw any supplementary sum from the public funds, though I believe that, if opportunity were given, there are people, with very respectable incomes, who would take advantage of such unusual generosity on the part of the State. fact, I am told by a gentleman who is in a position to gain information, that in Victoria, there are people receiving pensions under the existing Act who are not in such a position that such assistance is a necessity. My idea is - that the scheme of pensions ought to be enlarged to include orphans and persons suffering from any infirmity which makes them unable to earn a living. Further, I should make it compulsory on all male adults to contribute to the pension fund until they reach the age of sixty-five. The collection could, I think, be made without much expense, and the price of a couple of beers, or a plug of tobacco in the fortnight, would result in a substantial sum. If any refused to contribute, I would first strike their names off the rolls of voters for both State and Commonwealth.",28
131,Mr BOWDEN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,Would the honourable member make them contribute whether they could afford it or not?,28
132,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Certainl y not; the attempt would be useless in the case of a* man out of employment; and under my scheme, men so circumstanced would receive assistance. If any person who was able to contribute refused to do so, I would ultimately make it impossible for him to derive any benefit in his old age. A contributory scheme of the kind would at once lift the pension out of the category of an, ordinary State dole, and make it something that a person could accept without the slightest loss of self-respect, assuming that there are people who hesitate to take the pension under present conditions. I desire particularly to direct attention to the fact that, although there has been some improvement in Western Australia in the rate at which pensions are being granted, the officers are still very much in arrears. A large number of claims have yet to be dealt with, and, as a matter of fact, the percentage is very much higher than in any of the other States. There may be some difficulties owing to the peculiar position of old people in Western Acstralia, who have come from other States, or even from other countries. But, even allowing for that, there is delay which the Treasurer ought to be at pains to obviate, if possible. I am quite sure that the gentleman who has charge of the work in Western Australia is straining every nerve, and, if he errs at all, it is in the direction of the dictates of humanity rather than of strict officialism. There is no fear in my mind In that the failure to give applicants pensions is due to the officials concerned; but there is evidently something wrong. It is just possible that the office is under staffed, or there may be some technical difficulties which the officials have some trouble in overcoming. At any rate, there is the fact that a large number of applicants are still without their pensions. Such a state of affairs should not exist to the degree to which it does exist even in Western Australia. I hope that the Treasurer will try to ascertain where the difficulty lies, and, if possible, to obviate it.",28
133,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"They are getting on much better now. Mr FOWLER^But, still, the percentage of claims awaiting settlement is much higher than in any of the other States.",29
134,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,The work is new to the officers I think.,29
135,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,Possibl y an increase of the staff might be an advantage.,29
136,Sir JOHN FORREST,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"We have offered them that, but they say that the delay is due, not to that, but to other reasons:",29
137,Mr FOWLER,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I regret very .much that those reasons seem so successfully to militate against people getting their pensions. Some of them must be badly in want of them. I urge the Treasurer to look into the matter further, arid get all the claims brought up to date as speedily as possible.",29
138,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"Angas-Attorney-Gene ral) [4.22] - I shall not detain the House by going into the question of law, because I am sure that honourable members will credit the Department with every desire to approach the construction of a Statute like the Old-age Pensions Act in a liberal spirit. At the same time, the Attorney General is not bound to read into the words of an Act his feelings of philanthropy if he cannot, by a reasonable construction of those words, find an exemption in them. If I were to follow the line of reasoning adopted by my predecessor, the honourable member for West Sydney, I am afraid I should 'not only bring in societies which ought to be within the purport of the Act, but which are not, but also all insurance societies and other bodies that are, perhaps, the source of the income of comparatively rich people. The honourable member asked. me a question, which I preferred not to answer in the Socratic method of question and answer of which he appears to be so fond, as to whether the mere word ""association "" itself, read altogether without regard to the words with which it is collocated, was not the test of this particular exemption. But in the definition of "" income,"" which contains the two exemptions, I have fo read each particular word in the light of the words with which it is in collocation, and, even by a stretch of the imagination with which lawyers are sometimes credited, one cannot read into the word "" association "" in 'that definition a meaning which would bring within it all the mutual insurance companies that can be found throughout Australia. That, however, would be the logical result of adopting the honourable member's principle of interpretation. The honourable member for West Sydney also asked whether we ought, under this Act, to assume that a man has this year an income which would debar him from receiving an old-age pension because he had a certain income last year. No such question has been submitted to me as Attorney General for consideration. Primd facie, the fact of a man having an income last year is hot a final test of his having an income this year.",29
139,Mr BOWDEN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,The officers take it as the basis of his income this year.,29
140,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"On that point, I can only deal with what has come under the notice of my Department. All I can say at present is that primd facie there is a good deal to be said for the contention of the honourable member for West Sydney. The honourable member for Newcastle urged that it was rather hard to refuse the benefit of the exemption to those receiving payments from the provident fund to which he referred, when Imperial Army or Navy pensioners were not treated in the same way. I did not make any inquiries as to that matter when I was considering the point of law, but afterwards, in considering the question of policy to see whether anything could be done by an amendment of the Act, I asked the question, and was told",29
141,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,The paragraph that I read evidently did not give the full facts.,29
142,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"There must have been some mistake, for I have since made inquiries, and I believe the honourable member was under a misapprehension when he - spoke. Shortly put, our Act has not been based upon the New South Wales Act, although the administration in this regard is on the lines of the opinion given in New South Wales. In that State, in regard to the exemption, they stopped at friendly societies. Our Act has been based rather upon the Queensland Act, of which it is an exact copy, and it is very nearly a copy of the Victorian Act. The principle of the Act is, of course, to regard indigence as the test, with two exceptions only, and those two exceptions were put in so as not to discourage thrift; hence the word used is "" provident."" "" Providence,"" as the dictionary shows, is a matter of self help. On the question of policy, a great deal is to be said for amending the Act. I do not think it would cost very much to amend it so as to bring within it those about whom the honourable member for Newcastle is anxious. I wish we had had more help from the honourable member upon the question of the probable cost. He mentioned that about 60,000 miners were insured.",29
143,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I think there are about 60,000 employees altogether.",30
144,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I understand that about 23,000 would come under the Act, but 1 do not know what the percentage of accidents is.",30
145,Mr WATKINS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,Las t year there were about ninetv.,30
146,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"There is no doubt that the annual outlay caused by. such an 'amendment would be very little. These are matters that we can easily ascertain in the course of the next day or two by communication with the Government of New South Wales. I tried to get the information before this motion came on today, but was unable to do so. From what has been said by the Acting-Leader of the Government, I am sure that the Cabinet will approach the matter in a sympathetic spirit. It is anomalous that, while men are compelled to insure, that very compulsion-for in relation to it they have net the choice which .a member of a voluntary insurance society has-shoul d disable them - pro tanto from receiving an old-age pension.",30
147,Mr BOWDEN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I do not think it would cost more than .£2,000.",30
148,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED,"I do not think it would. If honourable members will look at the definition of provident society in the English - Acts and ""in the New South Wales Acts which have been based uponthem, they will find that what is meant is not "" compulsory providence,"" which really would be a contradiction in terms, but societies of working men formed on the basis of mutual assistance.

162,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Dalley) [4.35] - If is to be regretted that the speech of the Attorney-General was interrupted by the expiration of the time allowed for the discussion of a motion for the adjournment of the House. I trust that in the intecests of the country the honourable gentleman will complete his statement on the motion now before the Chair. I listened to his speech very carefully, and also to that of the Minister of Defence. Both honourable gentlemen profess themselves to be iii accord with the suggestion made by the honourable member for Newcastle as to the cruelty of making deductions from the old age pension on account of the receipt cf payments from the Miners' Accident Relief Fund. It necessarily follows that there must be an amendment of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act. I trust that an amending Bill will be speedily introduced, and that it will be passed during the sent session. There are hundreds of cases in which the administration has been too rigid, and has defeated the ends which Parliament had in view when the Act was passed. A case of great hardship occurs to me. An artisan in my electorate built a house for himself, and is paying for it by instalments. Old age came upon him. The house was mortgaged. Deductions have been made by the old-age pensions authorities on count of the value of the house, although he is receiving no value from it. I have no doubt that there are hundreds of such cases in the Commonwealth. As has been said in the course of the debate, thrift ought not to be penalized. I ask the Government to extend their sympathies to such men. The Attorney-General has stated that the Commonwealth law was founded upon, the New South Wales measure. But the deductions made by the administrators are more severe and exacting than were those which were made under the New South Wales Act. I know DE- many people who were recipients of pensions in N.ew South Wales, but who today are in a worse position than they formerly vvere. The man to whom I have referred was a sturdy iron worker. Because he is the owner of a mortgaged house, the officials have deducted is. 8d. per week from his old-age pension. Such a deduction, made from ios. per week, amounts to a tremendous loss. It amounts to one day's pension. But the administrator m New South Wales, Mr Cleg considers that he is bound by the terms of < the Act,.and is compelled to make the deduction. I trust that no one will think"" that I am bringing this case forward from political motives. As a matter of fact, the man in question was one of my strongest opponents, and I presume that he will be so in future. But if in matters of this kind, a member of Parliament were to speak only for his political supporters, he certainly would reach very low depths indeed. Every honourable member has received scores of letters drawing attention to serious deductions which have been made from the amount of the old-age pensions. It is regrettable that the Act has to be interpreted in such a rigid manner, and the sooner we amend it the better. Honourable members are so satisfied of the importance of amending the law that I am sure that'an amending Bill would not be obstructed.'",32
163,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,That is what we thought pre- when the last amending Bill was introduced.,32
164,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do not believe that the Opposition would make use of a Bill to amend the Old-age Pensions Act in this respect for purposes of obstruction. The honourable member for Newcastle has been fortunate in securing the concurrence of two members of the Ministry. The Minister of Defence has admitted that if the Invalid ac- and Old-age Pensions Act is to be interpreted in a certain way, the sooner it is amended the better, and the Attorney-General has said that it requires amendment.",32
165,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"What does that mean? MT. WILKS - I hope that it means something more than mere empty words. I hope that it will mean something for the advantage of the unfortunate persons who have had their pensions reduced. As this is "" grievance day,"" I intend to say a little on the political side in the interests of my own electorate. It is just as well to be frank, and the reference which has been made to iron workers has led me to suggest to the Minister of Defence, who appears to be in a particularly good humour this afternoon, the matter of the construction of the destrover., Recently the matter has been brought under notice frequently byhonorable members representing Victoria, ancl I have myself asked a question of the Minister on the subject. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports got in early, and, about a fortnight ago, managed to introduce a deputation to the Minister of Defence, to remind him that the best place for the construction of the destroyer would be the Newport Railway Workshops.",32
166,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"No , at Williamstown.",33
167,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member did not extend an invitation to the honourable member for Dalley to accompany him with that deputation. If he had done so, I should probably have used some persuasive language to induce the Minister to believe that there is a .better place at which to build destroyers than even railway workshops. If some consideration is not given to the claims of the place I have in mind in this connection it cannot be expected that I shall continue to be a supporter of the Government. There is a place called the Fitzrov dock in New South Wales, which is owned by the State Government, and in and around that dock are. to be found the largest engineering establishments in the Commonwealth. The Woolwich Engineering Works, in the electorate of the Minister of Defence, are the largest private engineering works in the Commonwealth, and, perhaps, before the honourable gentleman comes to a decision on this matter, he will see what might be done in his own constituency.",33
168,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The State Government docks should be taken over by the Commonwealth.,33
169,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member makes a good suggestion. If the Commonwealth took over the dock at Cockatoo Island, it would be good business, as we have the necessary plant there, and might assemble the parts of the destroyer ourselves more cheaply than could any private firm in the Commonwealth. The Fitzroy dock, I may say, is not in my electorate. It is in the electorate of the honourable member for West Sydney, but the men who work at it live in my electorate. If I had not told honourable members that, some other honourable member would no doubt have done so before the night was over. As we have very properly decided to go in for naval construction, I have thought it well to remind the Minister of Defence of the splendid facilities immediately at hand, to which I have just referred. I am not suggesting that there should be only one naval construction establishment for the whole of the Commonwealth, and that at Sydney. I believe that latei on there should be one in Melbourne. If it were only for the purpose of effecting necessary repairs, naval workshops must be established at other ports in the Commonwealth. The necessities of the southern coast of Australia will have to be considered as much as those of the eastern and north-eastern coast. In case of accident a vessel should be able to run into the nearest port for repairs. I think that if the Government undertook the work of construction at the dockyard on Cockatoo Island, they would get better results than by giving the work to private firms, though I do not doubt that private firms, like'Mort's dock, and other engineering firms that could be mentioned, could do the work that would require to be done. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports will probably admit that, as I was brought up with, and have always been associated with, iron workers, no member of the House is likely to be better acquainted with them. All the iron workers of the Commonwealth are not resident in either Sydney or Melbourne. To my knowledge there are hundreds of shipbuilders and other highly skilled workers in iron in different parts of the Commonwealth. There are hundreds of such men who would be quite capable of undertaking this class of work. There are scores who have had actual experience in naval construction, because most of the iron workers of the Commonwealth have come here from Newcastle-on-Tyne and the Belfast shipbuilding yards. These men could undertake the work of naval construction tomorrow, if the necessary plant were available. I do not contend that there is available in Australia today the plant necessary for the construction of iron ships. Such a plant is not available at the Fitzroy dock, or at any other shipbuilding works established in the Commonwealth.",33
170,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Repair s are effected to warships at the Fitzroy dock.,33
171,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"They have a plant sufficient for repairs, but they are not able to carry out naval construction on any large scale. I have no doubt that a sufficient plant for the purpose could be secured within a very short period. I admired the last Government for their determination to have one of the destroyers constructed here. Personally I do not know why they should have gone out of Australia for the first two vessels, as models. All that they need have done was to get the plans from the Admiralty.",33
172,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,They tried and could not get them.,34
173,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Surely the Admiralty would have extended that courtesy to so important a portion of the Empire ?,34
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The Admiralty could not get them.,34
175,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Probably the shipbuilding firms would not part with the plans. There are naval architects who could draw the plans, so that we should merely require to import for a short period the men who are known as "" leading hands."" There are scores of men available in Australia who could do the work after the plans had been drafted. The practice that is generally adopted is to draw on the plates of iron a rough plan to which the shipwrights work, and the "" leading hands "" from the workshops of the Old Country would merely be required to direct them. There are in Australia today thousands of good iron operatives, hundreds who have a practical knowledge of this class of work, and scores'who have recently been engaged upon similar work in Scotland and Ireland. I do not pretend for ai moment that my action this afternoon is not promoted by consideration for the interests of my constituents. I make no attempt to conceal the fact that it is. I find that other able members get up early. Only the other day the honourable member for Melbourne Ports introduced a deputation to the Minister of Defence for the purpose of urging upon him that the assembling of the parts of the third torpedo boat destroyer should be undertaken at Williamstown. I do not blame him for his action, but I think thai he might have invited the representatives of other districts who are interested in this work to be present. Had he done so I should have been glad to attend. One would think from reading the Melbourne press that the representatives of New South Wales were anxious to take all Commonwealth work from Victoria. As a matter of .fact there is ample room for the interests both States to be studied. In Sydney the necessary, works are already established so that the third destroyer-upo n the arrival of its parts-coul d easily be put together there. The construction of the larger vessels should also be undertaken in Australia, and to that end the Government docks in New South Wales and Victoria should be utilized. The Commonwealth would thus save the profit which would otherwise be made by outside firms. It would merely have to incur the necessary expenditure on plant and to pay the standard rate of wages. We have already had some experience in the construction of a trawler. ",34
176,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do not care what the honourable member may call it. I say that if the Government can undertake any work better than can private enterprise it should undertake it. We have to consider the interests of the taxpayers. It is our duty to guard the public funds, and we shall do that effectually by getting these vessels constructed in the Government workshops. At the opening of this Parliament some honourable members, who avow themselves anti-Socialists, voted in favour of a proposal that provision should be made upon our mail steamers for the carriage of perishable produce. They were not concerned with the question of whether or not their action might be dubbed Socialism. In the same way I see an opportunity to make use of the Government workshops. I hope that the Minister of Defence will consider my remarks as favourably as he did those of the honourable member for Newcastle in reference to old-age pensions.",34
177,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Melbourne Ports) [4-55]--It is quite refreshing to hear good honorSocialism preached from the Ministerial benches.,34
178,Mr TUDOR,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,And good protection too.,34
179,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Yes, the honourable member for Dalley has given utterance to good Protectionist ideas to which I hope effect will be given in the near future. He has admitted that Socialism, so far as shipbuilding is concerned, is possible in Australia. He also mentioned incidentally that a few days ago I introduced a deputation to the Minister of Defence, which urge"" upon that gentleman the desirableness of having the third torpedo boat destroyer put together at Williamstown, and also of establishing ship-building yards there. That honourable member further stated of that he would have liked to be present. I entertained no objection to his presence, but I scarcely cared to invite him to attend a deputation whose object was to make the advantages of the Williamstown site so very apparent, because being human, he would, I ' assume, have liked to make an interjection or two. There seems to be - a general opinion that it is necessary to establish docks for the building of ships. It is true lhat in Sydney the trawler was constructed in a dock, but such a procedure is never adopted by the ship-building nations of the world. In most countries ships are constructed upon slips, and upon their completion are slipped into deep water. The idea that New South Wales is up-to-date in dock accommodation is an absolute fallacy, and I am rather of opinion that the New South Wales Government recognise the fact, because, not long ago, they en. deavoured to make a bargain with the Commonwealth for the purpose of getting rid of their dock.",34
180,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,It is the best dock in the Commonwealth.,35
181,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I may be wrong, but while I admit that the Fitzroy_ dock is a good one, it is not up-to-date, in addition to which a dock is not necessary for the building of ships.",35
182,Mr FULLER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Has the honourable member seen the Fitzroy dock?,35
183,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Yes, I had the pleasure of seeing it last year. I admit that it is a very good dock In introducing the deputation to which I have referred, I assured the Minister of Defence that its members were not present in any captious spirit, but merely desired to place before him the advantages of a site at Williamstown for a ship-building yard. We all recognise that ships can be built in Sydney harbour, and I see no reason why States, other than New South Wales and Victoria, could not undertake the assembling of the parts of the third torpedo boat destroyer. I am satisfied that we have workers in* Melbourne who, without any instruction from the Old Country, could put them together. But I suppose that the Government of the day wanted to be on sure ground, and therefore took a certain stand. I did not agree with their action, though I did not cavil at it. For many reasons, the site suggested by the deputation duced is superior to the site in Port Jackson. No site could possibly be better than the Point Gellibrand site, as a strong rocky formation offers great stability, and there is unalienated land to the area of about thirty acres. A ship could be floated immediately into deep water without any possibility of trouble or danger arising. In the Old Country a ship could not be built end on because, if so built, it could not be launched. Therefore, every ship is built diagonally, and when it is launched, there is an arrangement for turning it down stream. No trouble in that direction would arise at Williamstown, because .a ship would be launched into an open harbour. That' is an advantage which no construction yard in Sydney could offer. Again, there is no possibility of a ship-building yard at Point Gellibrand being shelled by an enemy from the open sea. I have no desire to belittle Sydney Harbor, but in view of the fact that large guns will propel a shot for a distance of fifteen miles, honourable members can understand that it would be easy for an enemy to shell a shipbuilding yard in the remotest portion of Sydney Harbor.",35
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,So it would in Melbourne.,35
185,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Of course, I did not expect that my remark would meet with universal approval.",35
186,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Are the forts in Sydney Harbor to be closed ?,35
187,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I have seen some gun-firing, but I do not think that the honourable member has. An honourable member has tried to point out in rather an ingenious way how a ship is at a disadvantage in comparison with a fort. I do not know whether he is an authority on the subject or not, but common sense tells us that it is harder to hit a moving object than a stationary one. To my mind, forts are placed at a disadvantage as compared with ships. There is no doubt that ships of war could stand outside Port Jackson, and shell any portion' of Sydney. But they could not shell the site at Point Gellibrand, in Hobson's Bay.",35
188,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Why ?,35
189,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Because it is situated 30 miles from the sea, and there is no gun which can hit an object at that distance. In order to shell a ship-building yard at Williamstown, ships would have to stand off 6 or 7 miles from the Heads.",35
190,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Coul d they not get I intro- into Hobson's Bay?,35
191,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,They might. Certainly if ships could get into Hobson's Bay they could get into Port Jackson.,35
192,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The guns at Port Jackson would not be so defective as those in Hobson's Bay.,35
193,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,It is not necessary for ships to get into Port Jackson to shell a ship-building yard.,36
194,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"They could not get within, range either.",36
195,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"As the wish is father to the thought I cannot blame the honourable member, who represents a Sydney constituency, and is, therefore, impelled to stick up for "" Ma."" The fact that a ship-building yard at Point Gellibrand would be beyond gun fire proves that it must be superior to any ship-building yard in Sydney Harbor. I have always endeavoured to avoid provincialism. admit that, like other members, I have a little provincial feeling running through me - I have received numerous communications",36
196,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"No , quite a stream.",36
197,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I can discern still more provincial feeling in the representatives of New South Wales, more especially in the representatives of Sydney constituencies. Whenever there is anything afloat Sydney members always look after its interests, and I do not blame them. My opinion is that they have always looked after their capital, and obtained prettv well all that could the got, leaving little for any one 'else.",36
198,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,That is what impelled me to vote for protection.,36
199,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member took a certain stand on the Tariff, and, in my opinion, quite justifiably. When a site is required for a ship-building yard I would be foolish if I did not bring before the House a site which is distinctly superior to any site which the honourable member can find in Sydney Harbor.",36
200,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,They could not build a canoe at Williamstown.,36
201,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I ' do not know that there are any canoe builders at Williamstown, but I do know that Melbourne iron workers can do more than the iron workers of Sydney can do.",36
202,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,They must be sweated if they do more.,36
203,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Large r ships have been constructed in Melbourne than in New South Wales. That assertion cannot be denied. The representatives of the Mother State, no matter to what party they may belong, fight with bulldog tenacity for her supposed rights, even, when none exist. They regard Sydney as entitled to everything. But the time has come when they should be shown that other parts of Australia have claims to consideration from: the Commonwealth Government.",36
204,Mr FULLER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"What consideration has Svdney received from the Commonwealth? ' Mr MATHEWS - Sydne y has always claimed, generally successfully, that the heads of the navy, the churches, and other organizations) religious and civil, shall live there. In my opinion, Newcastle has facilities which are superior to those of Sydney. As for Hobson's Bay, it is certainly better in this respect, that it is secure from the fire of I an enemy's ships. That is a very great advantage from a naval stand-point. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [5.14]. complaining of the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act and, as the subject is being debated, wish to take the opportunity to bring three or four cases under the notice of the House. I thought that the law would deal with our people in a liberal spirit, but apparently their treatment is just the reverse. In one case brought under my notice, a Mr Bulloch, of Manus Station, an invalid 83 years of age, who has no property, has had his pension reduced from ios. to 7s. 6d. a week - The Deputy Commissioner at Sydney has been written to, but I have not yet received a reply from him. I know this pensioner very well, and cannot think why, his pension should have been reduced. When he was receiving ios. a week, it was little enough to live upon. The intention of the New South Wales Legislature, when the first old-age pensions measure was introduced, was to enable the old people of the State to live, not in affluence, but with some degree of comfort, and what was called an "" economy"" provision was inserted, to induce thrift, so that they might not be entirely dependent on Government - assistance. I am sorry that the Treasurer, who administers the Old-age Pensions Act, is not here, as he should be, to listen to these complaints. I have hardly seen him in the chamber this afternoon.",36
205,Mr WATKINS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,He spoke of the debate as a placard. That was all the sympathy that he showed.,36
206,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I am not speaking to waste time. These matters may be of small importance to those who live in comfort, but they are very serious to the poor who depend on Government assistance for some small degree of comfort in their declining years. Another case to which I direct attention is that a man named Harry Carrier, a native of Mauritius, and formerly a Britisli soldier. He is totally blind in one eye, and the sight of the other eye is defecsame attitude. tive. His age is 72 years, and for seven years he received a pension from Under Commonwealth administration he has been deprived of his pension, and now in-the Wagga Benevolent Asylum. That is an outrageous case. Why should this man be made the recipient of the charity of a benevolent asylum? Ij: intended that persons situated as he should receive pensions as a right, that they should not be treated as paupers. this case, too, the Deputy Commissioner at Sydney has been communicated with, but a reply has not yet been received from him. What sort of a Government is it that will allow such cases to occur ? We expect the Ministry to accept seme responsibility, - not to allow cases to arise that are grace to the community, and amount almost to maladministration of the law. The spirit of the Act is undoubtedly that a dale. pension shall not be regarded as a charity, and that the claim of any deserving son shall not be ignored. I wish now bring under the notice of the Minister ease of Mrs Mary Crandell, a widow, Adelong, who is penniless. Under the his principles. State Act she received a pension of £22 per annum, but that has been reduced under the Commonwealth Act to £13 17 per annum, or about 5s. per week. 1I have received from the Department today letter, stating that the reason reduction has been made is that Mrs. Crandell's adopted son and family with her, and allow her 5s. per week for the use of part of the house owned by her. ference The house is considered to return income, the Speaker and under these circumstances a statutory an honourable to deduction of £50 only can be allowed in computing her pension. I determined that if I remained in office' as Treasurer I should endeavour to cause wealthy relatives to assist to maintain claimants for pensions, but I certainly would not have sorted to the course that has been adopted in this case. The Treasurer is not present, but he vyill be able to read in Hansard report of my speech. The Ministry are the most callous lot I have met. If such a resolution as that carried last night against the Government had been carried against a self-respecting Ministry, they would have had it rescinded, or would have Sir William Lyne. gone out of office. Their attitude is the of most contemptible and outrageous that I have ever known a Government to take up.",36

227,Mr STORRER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I rise to a point of order. Is it in order for an honourable member to try to incite another honourable member to attack, the honourable member who is addressing the Chair ? - Mr SPEAKER - It is certainly not only out of order, but a distinct infringement of the rights and privileges of every honourable member. I sincerely hope no honourable member will pursue a course so unbecoming not only to him, but to the whole assembly.",38

It is about time matters were treated seriously, and not with that levity with which a certain motion was received last night.

If the Department does not administer the Act properly, the head of the Department is to blame, and the Treasurer seems to have a callous heart in this matter.",38
229,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The Departmental officers are either carrying out the instructions of the Minister, or are carrying out the Act.",38
230,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"But we ought to know what instructions have been given. The method now is to keep the House in [Quorum the dark until everything that should not' be done has been done; and there will be scenes here if there is not a change.

232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I am not threatening in any way, but merely say that, if matters continue to be dealt with in the flippant way some honourable members seem to desire, there will be serious scenes, which will become necessary in order to insure the attention of the Government. The present position is the result of the confusion we observe amongst the Ministry and their supporters. In regard to the building of naval ships, it is not wise to pit Melbourne against Sydney, or vice versa. I hope a fair arrangement will be arrived at; but' there is no doubt that, at present, the harbour ancl' other facilities at Sydney are superior to any in Australia. It may be that hereafter suitable docks can be made near Melbourne, but Sydney is the only place ready now. for such work.",38
233,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,What part of Sydney Harbor would the honourable member suggest?,38
234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"There are many places, but I suppose the ships would be built at the Fitzroy dock or thereabouts. Mr HENRY WIL L IS - T he r e is no better place in Australia.",38
235,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"That is what I am saying. I think it was unwise on the part of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to pit one city against the other; because, strong as I am in a reasonable way in my support of the interests of Sydney and New South Wales, I recognise that we all represent Australia as a whole. As to the danger of being shelled from sea, we have only,to remember that modern guns carry twelve to fifteen miles,' so that Melbourne could be bombarded from Hobson's Bay as easily as could Sydney from Port Jackson.",38
236,Dr LIDDELL,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Is it not a. fact that Hobson's Bay is little more than a drainmud flats with a channel through them ?,39
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"No ; Hobson's Bay is a fine inland sea; and such contrasts as have been drawn are ridiculous. I believe that ships as large as any that enter Port Jackson can also come up Hobson's Bay; at any rate, I know that at one point in Darling Island, there cannot be loaded a ship drawing more than twenty-eight or thirty feet.",39
238,Dr LIDDELL,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Does the honourable member not think that Port Stephens would be the best place of all?,39
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"There are Jervis Bay, Port Stephens, and a number of other places, but it is a subject which I have not deeply studied.

242,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,It is all in the Age this morning.,39
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The Prime Minister may say that he did not give the Age the information. I should like to get from the Leader of the Government a definite and authentic statement, out of which, when it is on record in Hansard, he will not be able to slide. When the papers publish a statement, he can say that he did not authorize it, and that the papers had no right to publish it. We should have had this statement of policy long ago. If I had my way, I should not have allowed the Government to do a single bit of work if I could help it, until they told us vvhat the agreement is in regard to deferring the consideration of the Tariff. It is not fair or just to the House, which should have the knowledge first of all, to keep it in the dark in the way the Government are doing. The Government, last night, managed to prevent any private member's motions from being discussed. The real fact is that they are afraid of a vote on my motion regarding the Tariff, but the names of those who voted last night can be published.",39
244,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The honourable member should have seen them try to slip out of it last night.,39
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I believe they slid away as if they were going down Kosciusko. I want to know what arrangement has been made, and how long the Tariff is to remain in abeyance. It is palpable from what is happening today that there is a movement going, on among the Fusion, or confusion party, to force a revenue Tariff on the Commonwealth. That fact is becoming more and more patent.",39
246,Dr LIDDELL,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,That is imagination on the honourable member's part.,39
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It is not. If that is so, there is all the more reason why the Government should state when they are going to deal with the matter, or for how long it is their policy to defer it. I suppose we shall shortly have an opportunity of dealing with the financial problem. I tried yesterday to gauge what the feeling on the subject was amongst 12,000 people.",39
248,Dr WILSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Were there 12,000 people at the Albury show ?",39
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"There were certainly between 10,000 and 12,000, and the general feeling there was that they would have nothing whatever to do with the Government's present proposals for the settlement of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States. A number of electors there, who have never been supporters of mine, said that such proposals would make them support me more strongly even than my old supporters did. I have tried to gauge the feelings of the people at four shows now, and I can say that the feeling on this question is very keen. The public want .the Government to bring the matter forward at the earliest possible date, or to abandon it. If there is any attempt to make the agreement with the States permanent, it will make the position of the Opposition surer than it might' otherwise be. There is no doubt that there vvill be a large majority against' any such proposition. I rose, however, mainly to speak of the maladministration of the Old-age Pensions law. If that is not remedied the House must take a serious stand, because we cannot afford to let these old people be starved out or driven into benevolent asylums. Our object in passing the Old-age Pensions Act in the State as well as in the Federal Parliament, was to keep them out of benevolent asylums. It cannot be tolerated that they should be so pinched, and their pensions so reduced, or the amount of property which they are allowed to hold as an encouragement of thrift should be so cut down, that they cannot on at all. I commend most sincerely to the Government, and especially to the Treasurer, the necessity of looking into the matter at once, and of not allowing it to dangle until it becomes a very serious lem throughout the Commonwealth.",39
250,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Cook) [5.45]-- I listened with some interest to the reference of the honourable member for Dalley to the building of ships of war for the Australian Navy. Although I agree with him in the attitude he now takes up, it is refreshing and also a little amusing to. hear a number of honourable members who were returned as anti-Socialists giving voice one after the other to Socialistic proposals. I remember the honourable member stating in this Parliament that at the last elecSocialistic tion he was beating the anti-Socialistic drum for the party of the right honourable member for East Sydney, but that he was now beginning to take cover under what he termed the umbrella policy. That is the policy .which a number of honourable members opposite are now adopting, because when they find that the opinions of the electorates are changing, they try to square their attitude inside Parliament to the views expressed outside. I have made a note of a number of anti-Socialists who h.ive turned round in this Parliament and advocated Socialism. The honourable member for Fremantle on the 5th July, 1907. advocated a form of Socialism, and on the 17th July, 1907, the honourable member for Brisbane did the same. The present Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Bendigo, also advocated Socialism for the farmers in his constituency on the 17th July, 1907, and, when asked whether that was not the Socialism which he was elected to oppose, replied, "" I do not care what you call i I call it common sense."" I notice the honourable member for Balaclava also advocated Socialistic proposals on the 23rd July. 1:907, as did the honoraMe member for Kooyong. while the honourable member for Capricornia did the same on the 12th September, 1907. The honourable member for Parramatta did likewise on the 25th September, 1907, and the honourable member for Moreton distinguished himself in the same way on the 27th September, 1907. The honourable member for Robertson spoke in the same direction on the 20th November, 1907, and so did the honourable member for Franklin, while only yesterday the honourable member for carry Wentworth was found to have on the notice-paper a motion advocating the establishment of a Government farm for the breeding of military horses. Those are only twelve of the anti-Socialists returned prob- to this Parliament as opponents of Socialism, who have stood up time after time and urged the adoption of Socialistic proposals.",40
251,Dr WILSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,In what form?,40
252,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I have not given the particular cases, because they are to be found in Hansard on the dates named. We ought to have the fact on record somewhere, so that people outside can turn up the references and see that the attitude of a number of honourable members has been most insincere, because whenever a proposal is submitted, especially if it concerns their own electorates, they drop the policy upon which they were returned, and adopt the other policy which at the elections they condemned as leading to the abolition of home life, the destruction of the marriage tie, and many other evils.",40
253,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,That only goes to show that the Labour party have taken up our proposals.,40
254,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It goes to show that the propaganda work of the Labour party has had some effect even upon the hide-bound Conservatives who have come together in the present Ministerial party. In an endeavour to forestall the propositions of the Labour party, these honourable members, when they find that the public have been, sufficiently educated to accept our policy, turn round and act as if they had pursued the same course all along. There is no great objection to that conduct. It is pleasing to us as propagandists t ; to find that propositions which we put forthat ward are accepted by our opponents. The honourable member for Dalley has referred to the question of assembling the parts of torpedo boats and destroyers at the Government Docks in Sydney. In coming to a decision as to where the boats should be put together, the Government should not take notice of whether Sydney, or Melbourne, Or Perth, or Port Darwin interests are affected. They should act entirely on the merits of the case, and consider simply where the boats can be most efficiently conare structed, and the best results secured. when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports tries to compare the facilities building at Williamstown with those at the Fitzroy Dock, Cockatoo Island, the if smallest reflection will show that he is tirely in the wrong. For instance, the hon the orable member says that in the vicinity the proposed construction yards at Williamstown there is a strong rocky founused dation. If the foundation of Cockatoo Island is not rocky, I do not know what to call it. As a matter of fact, the island is simply a mass of rock. Another point of comparison made by the honourable member was that there are 30 acres of unalienhave ated land at Williamstown. But at CockaIsland, too Island, there are, I suppose, 100 acres which the State Government could make available to the Commonwealth authorities without interfering with the present dockhas yards. The honourable member also said that there is deep water at Williamstown. At any point around Cockatoo Island, largest British warships could float, the docks there are sufficient to accommothis date the largest vessels of the kind likely come to Australia. The honourable member be manufactured and fitted there. said that it would be impossible for the at Williamstown to be shelled from ocean, which is 30 miles away. Co;katco Island is about 10 miles from the Port Jackson Heads. It is estimated that fire of a modern warship reaches about 15 or J6 miles. So that an enemy's vessel would need to come within 5 or 6 miles the Port Jackson Heads to be able to shell the Island, which, however, is situated hind a mountainous projection. FurtherScotland. more, the height aibove sea-level of the tifications at the Heads give the guns considerable range, so that it would not reasonable to suppose that any-warship oould come within 5 or 6 miles without being destroyed. I venture to say that any force that could make an effective attack upon Cockatoo Island from the sea would be able to make an equally strong fight against the site at Williamstown. There may be other arguments in favour of Williamstown than those put forward by the honourable member for the district, but upon the guments advanced by him. Williamstown hopelessly outclassed. A point to which the honourable member did not refer is the proximity of coal supplies. Coal is being raised near Sydney Harbor. There are many deposits there. It is only a matter a little time w^hen ample coal will be Mr J. H. Catts. able close at hand for any works which likely to be carried on. But apart from But the coal deposits near Sydney Harbor, we have the Illawarra coal-fields within a for couple of hours rail, and the Newcastle coal-fields are also available j whereas even Williamstown possessed docks and other enaccommodation sufficient for the purpose, coal supplies would in all probability of have to be drawn from Newcastle and Illawarra. The greater part of the coal on the Victorian Railways is imported from New South Wales. ' Coal is, of course, a most important factor in the construction of these vessels. Another point is that the New South Wales Government an up-to-date dock at Cockatoo and are prepared to hand it over to the Commonwealth authorities. These docks could be made equal to anything in the world for the purpose in view. There for many years been a disposition on the part of the New South Wales Government to place in the Fitzroy Dock the machinery much beyond present requireand ments, in anticipation of works of description being carried on there. The to propellers of vessels like the Powerfid can I am site sure that if honourable members, who are the not acquainted with the deck . would visit the place, see the magnificent machinery, and inspect samples of the the work done, they would be convinced of the suitability of both works and site. I agree with the honourable member for of Dalley that many of the men working in these docks are mechanics who came from be the shipbuilding yards of Ireland and If the necessary plant were foravailable they would be quite competent to a undertake the whole work of naval conbe struction. The reason why the Fisher Government did not decide to have the first of the destroyers put together in the Commonwealth was that the plans were in the hands of private contractors, and it was impossible for the Government to secure them. It is all very well for the honourable member for Dalley to say that a naval architect could draw plans of such vessels at sight; but I believe that, however desirarable it might be to have this work done is by our own artisans, the Fisher Government were wise in coming to the conclusion that they could not afford to make experiments in the construction of vessels of this of description. Skilled iron workers are to be availfound, not only in our dockyards, but in the railway workshops of the various States. I know that when it was proposed that locomotives should be built at the Government workshops at Eveleigh, all sorts of objections were raised by those who believed that it would be better to have this work done out of the country. A number of the mechanics engaged in the Eveleigh workshops had served their time with Beyer Peacock and Company, of England, and with the Baldwin Company of America, and when the work of locomotive construction was undertaken there it proved so successful that the Government of New South Wales will never revert to the old system of having the locomotives used on its railways constructed by private enterprise.",40
255,Dr WILSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Did they not give an order for locomotives to the Newport workshops ?,42
256,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I am not sure, but I know that locomotives are successfully constructed in the Newport workshops.",42
257,Dr MALONEY,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"For £900 cheaper than the Baldwin, and ^1,100 cheaper than English locomotives, although higher wages are paid in their construction. Mr J. H.. CATTS - That is the case for manufacture by the State-w e get at the same time a cheaper and a Better article. Although the construction of locomotives in the Old Country is carried on under the closest inspection, there stant effort on the part of private manu^ f acturers to cut down the cost of construction by working-in shoddy material. 1 could give instances of all sorts of repairs having to be effected to imported locomotives. It has been found that after running them for a little beyond the necessary trial they have had to be brought into the State workshops to undergo considerable repairs.",42
258,Dr WILSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Is the honourable member speaking now of English or of American locomotives ?,42
259,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I speak of both English and American locomotives. I see no distinction between the greed of the British capitalist and the American capitalist. They are equally concerned in piling up wealth, and are not too scrupulous as to the means they adopt",42
260,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"To supply a bad article is a funny way of piling up wealth. Mr J. H. CATTS - It is a funny way, but we know that some manufacturers of foodstuffs, in their endeavour to pile up wealth, do not hesitate to use poisonous gredients. That would appear to be a funny way in which to pile up wealth, but the shareholders in private enterprises of the kind do not care how funny the methods of manufacture may be so long as the money comes in. Everything is subordinated to the rapid accumulation of profits.",42
261,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,On e could hardly establish a business by building bad engines.,42
262,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do not say whether the policy adopted is a mistaken one or not, but the fact remains that locomotives built by private firms have not been as satisfactory as those built in the Government workshops of either New South Wales or Victoria. The magnificent locomotive which takes our train every Friday afternoon from Melbourne to Albury is a standing testimony to the high character of the work done at the Newport workshops. On the New South Wales side we have to employ two engines to draw a train of the same weight as that which is drawn by a single engine from Melbourne to Albury.",42
263,Dr WILSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,That is a strong argument in favour of Williamstown as against the place mentioned by the honourable member.,42
264,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The building of locomotives is a totally different thing from is a conthe building of vessels of war.,42
265,Dr WILSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The Newport workshops offered to assemble the parts of the destroyers.,42
266,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I was glad to notice that the anti-Socialist Government of Victoria were prepared to carry out the Socialistic doctrine to such an extent as to offer to assemble the parts of these vessels in the State railway workshops. This only shows how strong the case is for State manufacture as against manufacture by private enterprise. I wish to say a word or two on the subject of old-age pensions. The Government must have been impressed by the fact that so great is the dissatisfaction with the administration of the Act that, although two hours were allowed for the discussion of the motion of adjournment moved by the honourable member for Newcastle, quite a number of honourable members who desired to speak upon it were unable to do so in the time allotted. I have no doubt as to the chief cause for this dissatisfaction. I attribute it to the Government, and''particularly to the Minister who is charged with the administration of in- the Act. We could not have a more unsympathetic administrator of such an Act. I remember that when the Invalid and Old age Pensions Bill was under consideration, and Labour members, including myself, desired to eliminate some of the clauses under which this unsympathetic administration has been possible, we witnessed the nervous excitement of the Treasurer in his opposition to every attempt to liberalize the measure. I say emphatically that we cannot hope to have a sympathetic administration of this and similar Acts until we have a Labour Government in power. Conservative Governments have passed legislation of this kind only, so to speak, at the point of the bayonet and in obedience to an almost universal public clamour. But what they have given with one hand they have taken away with the other by their unsympathetic administration. Parliament having decided what the amount of an old-age pension should be, the Government have sought to limit the benefits of the Act by taking away so much for one reason and so much for another, until their action has given to the objections which have been continually urged in this House since the present Treasurer has had the administration of the law.",42
267,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Is the honourable member in favour of giving a pension to a coloured native of Jamaica?,43
268,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member is aware that when that particular question was being considered I not only supported an amendment to give a pension to every naturalized citizen of the Commonwealth regardless of his colour, but I voted for the amendment when the opportunity offered. The honourable member spoke in favour of it, but the moment the party whip was cracked he voted against his convictions. Only a little while ago he wrote a scathing article to the Sydney Daily Telegraph in condemnation of the Fusion and the way in which its members had abandoned their pledges. Similarly he condemned the Fusion upon the floor of this chamber, but the moment the Government were in danger he ran to their assistance. Why? Because he is bound and gagged. Despite all his prating upon the public platform about freedom, despite his protestations of sympathy with the working classes, despite his avowals that he is as good as a Labour man, the moment the party whip is cracked and the cry "" Government in danger "" is raised, he deserts his professed principles. I have no doubt that his actions will duly impress his constituents and that at the next election a representative will be returned in his stead who is pledged to a definite programme, and who will be loyal to that programme.",43
269,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I hope that the party to which the honourable member belongs will not withdraw its candidate. . Mr JH CATTS - The honourable member will discover that the electors will not trouble themselves so much about men as they will about measures. They have been too long fooled by men who proclaim themselves jolly good fellows. They want something more than jolly good fellowship. They require the sympathetic administration of our laws. The honourable member talks about what the Government have done ancl what they ought to do, but they know perfectly well that his teeth are drawn and that there is no bite in him. All his barking is of no account/ He has been grumbling like a bear with a sore head about rise a number of things. But the Government take no heed of his grumbling. They know that when the whip is cracked, he will vote submissively with them. When I was interrupted, I was pointing out that in my opinion the Treasurer is a most unsympathetic administrator of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. When that measure was under consideration in this House, clause 17 provided that a claimant for an old-age pension must be unable to maintain himself or herself. At my instance paragraph g of that clause, which contained this embargo, was eliminated. The Treasurer was absent at the time, and I well remember his troubled countenance when he entered the House next morning and learned of what had taken place. Upon page 1239 of Hansard, of 4th June, 1908, he is thus reportedYesterday, whilst I was absent from the chamber, an amendment was made- I understand, with the concurrence of the Attorney-Generalin the Old-age Pensions Bill . I desire to know whether the omission of the words in clause 17, providing that an old-age pension shall not be paid unless an applicant is unable to maintain himself. I have no desire to argue the question At this stage Mr Speaker intervened, and the Treasurer then asked whether, when the Bill had been passed by another place, he would be in order in again referring to the matter. He indicated that when the measure was returned to this House, he would endeavour to have the provision which had been excised by the Committee re-inserted. Throughout the discussion the Bill, the honourable gentleman was in state of nervous excitement, lest the restricanything, tions which it imposed should be removed, and lest there should be any enlargement of its scope which would involve further penditure. In view of these circumstances, I cannot help thinking that the difficulties which are being experienced in the adminexemption istration of the Act come from the Treasurer himself. I cannot believe that the officers charged with its administration are responsAccording ible. If I did think that, I should advocate sweeping out the whole of them, and putdeduction ting new men in their places. Although we do not know the nature of the instructions by the Act. which have been issued to these officers, I strongly suspect that they have formed that savings must be effected in the administration of the measure, and that circumstance explains the parsimonious tude of the Department towards old-age pensioners. It cannot be denied that wherethe ever the Act is capable of two interpretacipal valuation. tions, the one which is less favourable to the applicant is always adopted.",43
270,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The least liberal pretation is placed upon the Act every time.,44
271,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Yes . Under the to be taken. law, as it stands, there is ample room for looking with a more kindly eye applicants for old-age pensions. But where it is possible to construe the provisa ions of that measure to the detriment claimant, that course is invariably adopted. The Treasurer stated that the Federal Act is being administered in the same way as the New South Wales Act, but here is a case which occurred at Alexandria in my electorate, and in which the Commonthe wealth has valued the applicant's home at indigent. 50 per cent, more than did the State authorities.",44
272,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Whic h valuation is correct ?,44
273,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do not say which valuation is correct, but the case furnishes an answer to the argument of the Treasurer that the Commonwealth is doing the same thing as the State did. The Federal Act is much more liberal than was the State Act, but the former is not ministered so liberally as was the latter, and the administration of the State Act was a long way from perfection.",44
274,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Tak e what is the right thing.,44
275,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"We all know that lawyers can take an Act and argue that was previously. [127] of anything is the right thing. They will a take a provision and prove that it means so that an interjection of that kind is absolutely valueless. Here is the case of a man named 'Wm. Philpott, of exMarrickville. He owns a home which is valued by the municipal council at £140The Old-age Pensions Act grants an of £100, and for every £ 1 0 worth of property over that amount there is a deduction of £ t from the pension. to the Act there should be a deduction of £ 4 , but, as a matter of fact, a is made on the assumption of a valuation of £ 1 6 0 over the £100 allowed",44
276,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It .was the munibeen incipal valuation, I suppose.",44
277,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"No , the Departthat ment has accepted the valuation at ;£i6o attiover the municipal valuation.",44
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The Act says that officers are to take notice of the muni,44
279,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,This is the second case in which the officers have not taken the intermunicipal valuation.,44
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Unles s there is some good reason to the contrary, it ought",44
281,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"A poor old appliupon cant named Mrs Newman, of Camperdown, had a deduction made in respect of very unpretentious cottage in which she of a lived. I hold in my hand a notice from the municipal authorities telling her that the cottage must be pulled down, as it is not fit for a person to live in. Yet in respect of properties of that kind, the Federal officers are making deductions from pensions of poor old people, who are",44
282,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Has she appealed against the deduction?,44
283,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The way in which the Act is being administered places upon poor old people who are tottering on the verge of the grave the onus offightingfor a pension just as if they were fighting a civil case in a Law Court. The authorities ought to show some disposition to help old folks in difficulties of this kind. It is very adeasv indeed to tell them to appeal.,44
284,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The Commonwealth has the same man in New South Wales 'as that State had, Mr Clegg.",44
285,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The administration in New South Wales is very unsympathetic.,44
286,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,It is the same as i i,44
287,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,No .,45
288,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The same officer is at the head of the administration there.,45
289,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I have quoted a case in which the valuation of a property was fixed at 50 per cent, more than the amount which was accepted by the .State. Of course, I have no proof to submit to the House, but I conclude that, as the result of instructions issued to officers, the Act is being administered most technically.",45
290,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,How would honourable member have the Act administered ?,45
291,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It should be administered sympathetically rather than harshly, technically, and niggardly. In every case which has come under my notice, and in which a provision of the Act was capable of two interpretations the hardest and most technical interpretation - the one which would save the Commonwealth the largest number of shillingswas adopted. This is not the first occasion on which this thing has been complained of here. Time after time it has been discussed on the motion for adjournment. On every occasion when honourable members have had the right to refer to the subject, it has been brought before the House.",45
292,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It suits the honourable member very well, I should think, by the look of things. Mr J. H . 'CATTS - It would suit me a lot better if the right honourable member would administer the Act a little more sympathetically.",45
293,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,That would not suit the honourable member at all.,45
294,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I am sick and tired of ventilating this grievance. would need a private secretary to answer all the letters which are sent to me about the administration of the Act.,45
295,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Why does not the honourable member send the Department? We will look into them.,45
296,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"- I did send on cases, and afte* the lapse of months I an answer which left things in exactly same position. Let me state the case of a blind man who is over the age prescribed. His wife is dead, but before he applied for a pension she kept a little grocer's shop. When the authorities were winding up her estate, they could not make the books balance, and they assumed that the blind widower, who has not a penny in the knew what had become of the moneys which could not be accounted or, whereas r he knew nothing about the matter at all. I brought the case under the notice of the Department, and was told a good while ago that the matter would receive consideration. What chance has a blind man of fighting an appeal ? If the officers are free to deal with cases sympathetically, I cannot understand why they are not authorized to display more sympathy.",45
297,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Did not the blind the man have a pension from the State?,45
298,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do not know whether he had one or not; but that is not the point. The deductions which have been made from pensions seem to me wholly unjustifiable. Is it not the height of absurdity to call upon a blind man to account for something which occurred in connection with the estate of his deceased wife, and about which he knows exactly nothing?",45
299,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The honourable member has had a very good innings.,45
300,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I was returned to this House to see, so far as I am able, that justice is done to my constituents. I cannot do more than my best. I have used my best endeavours with the Department to get their grievances redressed. I am bringing them before the Treasurer as intelligently as I can. My next duty will be to advise the electors not only in Cook, but in other constituencies to return Labour men, so that we may have a decent administration of laws which affect old people.",45
301,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,But the Labour Government appointed the Commissioner.,45
302,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I am not complaining about the Commissioner.,45
303,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Of whom is the I honourable member complaining?,45
304,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,What instructions has the honourable member given to the oflicers who administer the Act?,45
305,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I have not given cases on to the anv instructions.,45
306,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"If the officers are free to administer the Act as harshly as got they are doing, then the sooner the honour the able member instructs them to be a little more sympathetic the better it will be for the poor old people of Australia. Silting susfended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m. '",45
307,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The Treasurer has stated that the officers administering the old-age pensions law were appointed by the world, Fisher Government. I do not know whether he suggests that they have failed to do their duty. In my opinion, the origin of the trouble is at a higher source. But were the Fisher Ministry still in power, those officers would be promptly replaced by others, should it be found that their administration was contrary to the intentions of Parliament. I make no charge against them; the responsibility rests with the Minister. He should give instructions that the old people of Australia must be treated more sympathetically in the future than they have been in the past. I have mentioned several instances in which fault has been found with the manner in which the Minister, or some of his officers, has used the discretion given under the Act. I have referred to the case of a blind man who was being supported by his wife by means of a small grocer's shop. The wife died suddenly, intestate, leaving her estate heavily encumbered with debts. Because the Curator of Intestate Estates is unable to trace certain moneys, the responsibility of accounting for them has been placed on the widower, who is an applicant for a pension. Surely officers should be invited to go out of their way to help applicants, rather than induced to put obstacles in their way. These old persons come to members of Parliament with their applications, and' we often have to go to their private residences, where, by dealing with their cases in a spirit of sympathy, Ave are able to set right the mistakes they have made in filling in their claims. Why cannot the officers of the Department act similarly ? Members of Parliament should not be called upon to do clerical work of this kind when there, are officers to do it. If , as has been suggested, the Department is short-handed, and the clerks cannot overtake the arrears, even by working late at night, assistance should be given. Mine is a densely populated constituency, containing over 30,000 electors, and my Saturdays and Mondays, and often, for the greater part, my Sundays, are taken up in attending to matters which should be dealt with by the departmental officers;",45
308,Mr STORKER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,It is very good work for a member to be engaged in. .,46
309,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Yes ; if he can attend to it all. I am glad to be able to do what I can; but when I have been in Melbourne all the week, attending to my constituents' interests, I ought to be allowed to have an occasional Sunday to myself. [127]- 2",46
310,Mr STORRER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Many of these old persons cannot get to the pension offices to have their forms filled up there.,46
311,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Thos e who call ore me would be able to go to the pension' officers; but no doubt they find that the oflicers have either not the time or not the inclination to attend to them. The latter cannot be held responsible; but the complaints have been so numerous that the Minister might well bestir himself, and have the grievances remedied. Another case to which I invite attention is that of Mrs Anderson, Union-street, Newtown, which I brought under the notice of .the Department on the 13th August. On the 17th August, I was informed that further inquiries had been made, since when I have heard nothing, though surely the necessary investigation could have been made in a month.",46
312,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Has the pensioner heard anything? Mr JH CATTS,- I do not know; but, as I brought the matter under the notice of the Department, I should have been informed had any action been taken. Another case is that of Mrs. Rogers, 73 Wells-street, Newtown, to which I referred on a previous occasion. This old lady is totally incapacitated, has no one to provide for her, and is in every way eligible to receive a pension. Nevertheless, she has experienced considerable difficulty, and owing to technical objections has not yet received the pension which she deserves. I desire to mention another case in regard to which I have received today a letter. It is that of a Mr Stewart, of Dickson-street, Newtown. This gentleman interviewed me, and from vvhat I could gather filled in his application papers properly, and .was entitled to a pension. He had children thirty-five and forty years of age, natives of this country; he could prove that they were born here; but he had some difficulty in producing his own certificate of birth. There was no doubt that he was of the required age, but his claim was held up because he was unable to put his hands on the certificate of his birth. He is sixty seven years of age and a fitter in the iron trade; but he is unable to take his place at the bench owing, not only to the loss of several fingers, but to his advanced years. He has had considerable difficulty, however, in connection with his claim. I do - not think any disgrace attaches to an application for an old-age pension, and therefore see no reason why these names should not be mentioned. All these people have been many years in the country, have reared families here, have devoted all their energies to their work, and, owing to the action of Conservative Governments, have been pretty .well exploited throughout their lives. Instead of placing the cost of government upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it, various Conservative Administrations have contrived, by the imposition of indirect taxation, such as the present Government desire to continue, to place most of it upon those least able to bear it. Money has been taken out of the pockets of the workers by taxing necessaries of life instead of imposing taxation upon those whose properties are increased by public energy.",46
313,Mr ARCHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Did the honourable member vote against any portion of the Tariff?,47
314,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I voted against every revenue duty, and shall always do so. Unfortunately, when the Tariff was under consideration in this House, those who called themselves Free Traders and believers in direct taxation conspired to pass revenue duties, which would be horne chiefly by the working people, in order to save the rich landlords from their just share of taxation.",47
315,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,They were ably assisted by a number of Protectionists.,47
316,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"That is so. Free Traders and Protectionists who are Conservatives are to be found banded together on the Government side pf the House. When it is a question of putting a fair proportion of the cost of government upon the owners of wealth in the Commonwealth they come together to save the great landlords. I was asked how long I intended to speak to this question, and can only say that I think we might as well be discussing the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act as any of the Government proposals. I know of no Government measure on the business paper that would do anything to help the country. There may be proposals with Democratic titles, but'that is about as much Democracy as we shall obtain from any of the Government propositions.",47
317,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,So that the honourable gentleman is simply killing time?,47
318,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I am drawing attention to matters of importance. No doubt the Postmaster-General and other Ministers think that questions affecting the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act are of no concern. If the Government had something of greater importance to submit we might in all probability arrange to discuss this matter at some other time. I have no desire to unnecessarily take up the time of the House, but may say in passing that it is not the policy of the Opposition to block the measures which the Government are bringing forward. Believing as I do that the Fusion has been brought about in defiance of election pledges; that the Government measures are not designed to help the majority of the people; that the Government are aiming at Conservative class rule and neglecting the interests of those who have less than enough, I should, if I had my own way, do my best to prevent the passing, of any of the legislation proposed by them. The majority of the electors would endorse my action.",47
319,Mr ARCHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Why does not the honourable member leave it to the electors to decide the question presently?,47
320,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The present Government had an opportunity some months ago to test the feeling of the electors.,47
321,Mr THOMAS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,And another opportunity was given them last night.,47
322,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Las t night the business of the House was taken out of their hands. A motion submitted by the Minister of 'Defence that, the House should adjourn was negatived, and immediately afterwards the House adjourned on the motion of the Leader of the Opposition. The Government, however, propose to take no notice of the incident.",47
323,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"That , I suppose, is very disappointing to the honourable member.",47
324,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"If such an experience had befallen a Labour Government huge headlines in regard to it would have appeared in the newspapers. We should have seen in the contents bills of the daily newspapers the heading, in large type, "" Defeat of the Federal Government."" But since the daily newspapers, like the Ministry, represent Conservative classes, and dare not mete out to the present Government the treatment that they would extend to a Labour Ministry, the whole incident has been practically suppressed. A brief notice of the incident was printed in the smallest type in the morning's; newspapers, whereas other political items were starred out in big letters. We saw big headlines referring to "" Opposition Grievances"" and ""Obstructionist Tactics,"" which were doubtless designed to divert the attention of the public from that portion of the reports which, in very small type, referred to the defeat of the Government. If we had had an impartial press last night's incident in this House would have been heralded throughout the Commonwealth as the defeat of the Ministry, and they would have been compelled to take notice of it. I do not expect from the Government any legislation of benefit to the people.",47
325,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Is that the honourable member's grievance to-night?,48
326,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It is one of my grievances that we have a Government in power who will do nothing for the majority of the people outside. The present Administration have been in power for some months, and I ask, what measure of any use to the community have they placed on the statute-book ? We' have heard a great deal about the cost of Parliament, the payment received by members, and so forth; and it is the duty of the Government to see that the people get value for their money. If the Government had the interests of the people at heart, there would have been a general election months ago, and we should now have had a mandate from the people. As a matter of fact, the Government dare not face the electors, but' are trusting to the short memory of the public, in the hope that, assisted by the daily press, they will float into power again on some good party cry. I may say that I have taken very Httle part in the debates so far. For weeks at a stretch I have sat here without uttering a word; and today I have occupied only about an hour; and had I not had some matters of great importance to my constituents to bring forward, I should not have risen. There are one or two matters on which I shall have something to say later, unless I am prevented. The Prime Minister, through his Minister of Trade and Customs, induced me to give certain votes on the Tariff, on the distinct understanding that correlative proposals for new Protection would be submitted. We now have a Conservative Government with a Conservative following, and the Prime Minister has gone back on that arrangement. Votes have been secured from me under false pretences; and if the Government come forward with a scheme of new Protection, and it differs materially from the scheme that I was promised, they will, so far ""as I am concerned, have some difficulty in getting one line of it passed. I turned up Hansard, and showed the Prime Minister where he distinctly promised honourable members that if they gave certain votes on the Tariff, and the new Protection was not afforded, he would give them an opportunity to reconsider those votes. The half-hearted, hotch-potch new Protection which the Government now suggest has absolutely no relation to whatwas then promised.",48
327,Mr THOMAS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Does the honourable member expect the Prime Minister to keep his word ?,48
328,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do not; and in the House I have told the Prime Minister that, after what has occurred, I cannot accept his word. I represent 30,000 electors; and when the Prime Minister enters into an understanding with me, I expect that understanding to be honouredThe Prime Minister has ' 'jewed ' ' me out of my rights, and I hold that as a bitter grievance against the Government. When the patchwork-quilt new Protection of the Government is proposed, I shall have something more to say; and it will not trouble me if I am charged with wasting time. I have spoken warmly on the subject of old-age pensions, because I think that, whatever our differences may be, the .Treasurer ought to take note of the constant stream of complaints, and see that the administration is such that Federal action shall not be discredited as it now is in New South Wales. There are large numbers in that State who are cursing the day the Federal Government took over the administration of old-age pensions and, although we have our party differences here, I am as jealous as anybody of the opinion which is held of the National Parliament by the rank ancl file of the people. The Treasurer has it in his power to so administer the Act that the old people of Australia, will look to the National Parliament with reverence and respect instead of with disgust and abhorrence.",48

It was decided by the House that you should not leave the chair.

NOES. decided that you shall not leave the chair, I wish to know exactly vvhat the position is.",50
343,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I think that the position is well known to all honourable members who have had experience of this thirdThursday motion. The Standing Orders provide for a special motion to be submitted on stated occasions, under cover of which a general debate may take place. The custom has always been to continue the debate until the motion was put. If it were considered desirable that the House should --- 31 go into Committee of Supply, the motion would be carried. The Speaker would then 13 leave the chair. If , on the contrary, the AYES. motion were negatived, the next business would be called on. The question that has been put to the House is, "" That the Speaker do now - leave the chair."" That motion has been negatived. Consequently I remain in the chair.",50

Even if the matter were in doubt I appeal to you, as Speaker, follow the example of the late Speaker Brand who said that whenever there was any doubt in a matter of this kind he felt it to be his duty to protect the interests of the minority on the sound principle that majority could always take care of itnow self. I do not say that that is the case here, but that is what Mr Speaker Brand said. I submit that the Treasurer was not order in moving the motion he has subare mitted, and there is no warrant for his motion being put to the House at the present time. I ask, sir, for your ruling on",50
348,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"During the whole of the time. I have been in this Parliament 1I have never known a position similar to that with which we are now faced to arise. I have never heard the order of the business that would follow the negativing of the formal Supply motion challenged. have known the motion to be discussed over and over again, and the universal practice has been to negative the question, ""That the Speaker do now leave the chair,"" and the House has then proceeded with the business next on the paper. I must admit that I find it somewhat difficult to give reasons at this juncture why the House should follow any other than the usual course. In the circumstances I put it to honourable members to say whether it would not be better to follow the ordinary practice rather than to establish a new, and it might be an improper practice in this re? gard.",51
349,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I understand that you, sir, appeal to the Government, as the leaders of the House, to follow the ordinary practice of the House.",51
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,This is the ordinary practice.,51
351,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"A 3 the Minister of Defence takes that stand I have to ask your ruling, Mr Speaker, as to whether the Treasurer was in order in submitting the motion. Without debating the matter I invite you, sir, to protect the interests minority. We have only you to depend on at the present time. Our Standing Orders, and, as you have admitted, the practice of this Parliament are entirely against what is now being proposed. I appeal to the sense of fairness of honourable members on both sides to say whether they think we should violate the practice of the House in the way now proposed.",51
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,We are following the practice of the House.,51
353,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It appears to me' to be perfectly clear that the Treasurer could not have been in order in moving the motion because at the time he moved it there was the question before the House. "" That the Speaker do now leave the chair.' That question had been put from the chair, but had not been decided. You, sir, have explained that it was a formal question under cover of which grievances might be discussed. It having been decided by the last division that you should not leave the chair, I submit that there is still before the House the question under cover of which we can go on with the discussion of grievances. If not, what is our position ?' It is this: You, sir, put the question, "" That the Speaker do now leave the chair."" That motion was submitted by a member of the Ministry, or it was not. If it was submitted by a Minister he could not vote I against it, but Ministers have voted against it. That is unanswerable. One of them had moved a motion, and if that were not so, the Minister of Defence could not have moved-' ' That the question be now put,"" because there would have been no question to put. Ministers voted against their own motion, if there was any motion. I say it was not proper to put the question under the circumstances; but the question having been put and carried in the negative, you, sir, remain in the chair, and Ave are entitled to go on with the discussion of the business, and Ministers must find some other way of dealing with the matter. The other way is perfectly clear. They should have voted in the opposite way to that in which they did vote. They should have voted to put you, sir, out of the chair. They could then have moved to get you back into the chair, and have gone on with other business. However, you are in the chair now, and there is nothing before the House but the formal motion-""That the Speaker do now leave the chair.""",51

356,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I shall say what I have to say in a minute, if honourable members will allow me. I wish to raise the point whether the vote which we have just recorded has not had the effect of destroying the Committee of Supply altogether.",51
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I rise to a point of order. I desire to know whether the Leader of the Opposition can raise a second point of order while the first remains undecided? These proceedings are degenerating into a farce.,52
358,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do trust that honourable members will assist the Chair to preserve order. The position is difficult enough for a new occupant to fill, without his being further confused by the exchange of remarks across the chamber. In reply to the statement of the Minister of Defence, I would point out that we are not dealing with two points of order at once, nor would it' be usual to simultaneously deal with three. But, in order to save time, I thought that it was advisable to allow the Leader of the Opposition to statehis point of order, as he has assured me that it has an important bearing upon the point of order which has been raised.",52
359,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It appears to me that the divisions that have taken place during the last few minutes have had the effect of entirely destroying the Committee of Supply. I ask you, sir, in coming to your decision, to take that view of the position' into consideration.",52

HI GH COMMISSIONER BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 8th September, vide page 3200) : Clause 4The High Commissioner shall(a) act as representative and resident agent of the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom, and in that capacity exercise such powers and perform such duties as are conferred upon and assigned to him by the Governor General ; (i) carry out such instructions as he receives from the Minister respecting the commercial, financial, and general interests of the Commonwealth and the States in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [8.56] - It seems to me that the mission of the High Commissioner will be a most important one, and that before_he can be properly equipped the Commonwealth ought to open in London a branch of the National Postal Banking System. I was sorry last year that we had to drop the proposal for the acquisition of the building which was selected in Trafalgar Square, away from the financial centre of London, I should like to know whether this clause permits me to discuss the qualifications which the High Commissioner ought to possess, because while I want to examine these matters carefully, I do not desire to break the Standing Orders.",52
363,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Unde r the words "" general interests,"" in paragraph b, the honourable member can get in what he desires to say. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We ought to have in London an establishment which would enable the High Commissioner to carry out the purposes for which he is appointed. If we had a building such as I suggested here several years ago, it could accommodate the State Agents-General, and then we should not have the spectacle of Agents-General abusing some States while praising their own. When I pick up their reports and see that they only talk of their own little section of Australia, I often ask myself how the Commonwealth will ever attain an exalted financial or commercial position in the world. When one meets a Yankee from any part of the United States - fro m the ice-bound coast of Maine to the golden sands of the Pacific, or from the Arctic snows of the north to the tepid waters of the Gulf of Mexico-h e talks of the United States, not of the little section where he was born. When I pick up the papers and find an Agent-General blowing up Tasmania, an Agent-General blowing up New South Wales, an Agent-General praising Victoria, and an Agent-General praising Western Australia, and none of them praising the Commonwealth, I begin to think that the time has come when we ought to have a representative with national ideasa man with a high order of intellect, possessing financial ability, and appreciating the objects of his mission. Otherwise, we shall have over again the same old muddle that we have ""had for fifty years. We shall have the States borrowing money for building bridges, and when a bridge wears out, building another bridge out of borrowed money. We shall have no depreciation funds, or anything else. The conduct of the finances of Australia would disgrace a New York Tammany Hall, three-card, bunko-steering monte-man. As I may have the gagapplied to be, I propose to defer my, remarks until other honourable members have had an opportunity to speak. I am anxious to see that the Commonwealth is represented by a man with national ideas; in other words, by a big man, with a big head and something in it.",53
364,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Dalley) [9.3] - On the motion for the second reading, some honourable members described the character of the man who was required for the position of High Commissioner, and on this clause we are to have a repetition of what was then said. It has been stated by the honourable member for Darwin that the High Commissioner must be a man of national ideas, and a leading financier. It has also been said that he must be a diplomatist- a man outside the ordinary run of diplomatists who, we are told, are honest men who lie in other countries. The representative of Australia must not lie in other countries : but he must be an honest diplomatist, and tell the truth .about Australia wherever he goes. These are some of the requisites demanded by honourable members opposite.",53
365,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,When the honourable member has said that the High Commissioner must be an Australian he has said everything.,53
366,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It has been said that the High Commisisoner must possess Australian ideals, but the honourable member for West Sydney has really put the position in a nutshell. The High Commissioner must not only possess Australian ideals, but live up to them when he is in London. The difficulty in Australia is not to find a man who has national ideas of finance, and can be a diplomatist when he is required, but to find a representative who will remain an Australian after he has coquetted with the club life of London. That is my only concern in regard to the requisites for the position. According to paragraph b of this clause, the High Commissioner shallcarry out such instructions as he receives from the Minister respecting the commercial, financial, and general interests of the Commonwealth. I suggested to the honourable member for Darwin by way of interjection that the words ""general interests"" would permit him to speak his mind fully, because under cover of those words the Minister can advise the High Commissioner in England. It would be most difficult, not only in Australia, but even in the crowded cities of the Old World to find all the requisite characteristics in one individual at the munificent salary of £3,000 per annum. How are we to get a man who will approach to the ideals stipulated by the members of the Opposition? Australia is not clogged with patriots who are ready to sacrifice their livelihood in order to take up a position in London at £3>ooo a year. Men of that stamp in Australia are receiving more than that remuneration. I trust that honourable members who are demanding that the High Commissioner shall be a man with national ideals will not forget to vote an ideal salary for the office. The public should be taught that the High Commissionership is the highest post at the disposal of a Ministry. When it learns that, it will be prepared to pay a salary commensurate with the importance of the position. But it requires to be educated in the matter. If not properly advised as to the reputation and character of the man needed to fill this office, it may look upon the salary fixed in the Bill as a high one, and regard any attempt to increase it as extortionate. The High Commissioner should not be appointed because of his friendly relations with Ministers, or for political fidelity in the past. The honourable member for Darwin has described the type of man who is needed. We may not get one who possesses all the qualifications that have been mentioned, but I hope that whoever is appointed will be as nearly as possible the ideal High Commissioner.",53
367,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney) [9.8] - ! do not know why the Government has brought forward this Bill again now. It cannot be that it is anxious to appoint a High Commissioner, because as the Senate has adjourned for. a fortnight, even if we pass the Bill, if will have to wait at least that length of time for its consideration elsewhere. As has been pointed out, it matters little what kind of measure we pass if the appointment made under it is bad. Had the Government taken Parliament and the country into its confidence, and made a reasonable proposition, an appointment could have been arranged for within twenty-four hours, but since we do not know who may be appointed, and there is a chance that the position may lie filled to please an ally, .or to placate a toocandid friend, we must scrutinize the measure most carefully. If the provisions of the clause would apply only to men who have qualified for the position it creates,. I would assent to them without further discussion. The clause says "" the High Commissioner shall "" do certain things. He shall do nothing, if I can help it, until I know who he will be.",54
368,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Logically , then, the honourable member should ask to know all his successors as well.",54
369,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The Attorney-General does not resemble Alice in Wonderland, but there are characters in Lewis Carroll's immortal work whom he does resemble. He preserves an air of severe detachment from the affairs of this world which I admire, but scarcely wish to emulate. The study of mankind is too attractive to me. I suggest that the clause should be amended to read ""the High Commissioner may"" do certain things, if directed in a certain way. He is to act as representative and resident - agent of the Commonwealth. Those words are surplusage. He will be appointed to act as our representative, but the use of those words cannot make him act in that way. The honourable member for Darwin spoke of the very high and important duties which he will have to perform, but here he is referred to as something a little lower than an Agent-General; he is to be merely a resident agent. The clause has been framed to meet the appointment of such a man as we all agree should not be appointed. He is to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are conferred upon and assigned to him by the Governor General. Clause 4 provides that he must carry out the instructions he receives as to the States. Why should he be in the first place instructed by the "" Governor General,"" which means the Executive, and in the next by the "" Minister,"" which means the Minister acting under his cwn powers? No instruction should be given to the High Commissioner except by the Government. He will represent, not a Department or a State, but the whole Commonwealth, and should be instructed, in so far as it is necessary to instruct him, by the Government of the Commonwealth. If he received improper instructions from the Minister, should he carry them out? Obviously not. There are some gentlemen who, it is conceivable, would carry out any instructions, or would not even wait for them. The High Commissioner is to act as the representative and resident agent of the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom ; but he is to carry out instructions received from the Minister, not only in the United Kingdom, but elsewhere. In the United Kingdom he is to be the representative of the Commonwealth, but outside he is not; yet he is still to carry out the instructions of the Minister. This is a most amazing feat of draftsmanship. I suppose it is useless to ask the Attorney-General whether the Committee is to learn the. mind of the Government in this matter; but I certainly think it ought to. Will the honourable gentleman agree to strike out the word "" Minister "" in paragraph b and to insert in its stead the words "" Governor General,"" so that the Commissioner will have to take his instructions from the Executive, rather than from the Minister?",54
370,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,No .,55
371,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Then I move That the word ""Minister,"" paragraph b, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" Governor General."" No instructions should be given to the High Commissioner by a Minister. They should be given, if at all, by the Government.",55
372,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,But the High Commissioner must be under some Department.,55
373,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Certainly ; but Ministries come and go. It is one of the defects of our present system that a good Government is often brought down by the act of an indiscreet Departmental administrator. In this Department such a man would have wider scope than elsewhere; and he might issue unwise instructions. To my own knowledge, instructions are often given by a Minister without the consent and approval of his colleagues; but under the theory of responsible government, all Ministers are responsible for the acts of one of their number.",55
374,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The honourable member would make .all instructions a Cabinet matter?,55
375,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I would, and I fail to understand why the Minister will not accept my amendment.",55
376,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,It is the usual custom to have instructions given through the responsible Minister.,55
377,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"On e might say that this is a unique occasion. We propose to have a representative of the Commonwealth in England, and that representative ought to receive instructions from the Ministry rather than from a Minister.",55
378,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Angas-Attorney-Gene ral) [9.21] - I am sure that the honourable member for West Sydney is as anxious as the Government are to make the Bill perfect. The office of High Commissioner is a very dignified one, and it would be a pity if we were, in all cases, to tie the hands of the Government in relation to instructions to an officer of such high importance, having a multiplicity of duties to perform, while in connection with Agents General, instructions may be sent through a Minister.",55
379,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Does the Attorney-General think that the responsible Minister would send any important instructions to the High Commissioner without consulting the Cabinet ?,55
380,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Of course not. The theory of Cabinet responsibility applies to the acts of Ministers, but a Minister is appointed to control those officers who are associated directly with the Department he controls. He is the hand. As the duties of this office grow, it may be necessary to cable instructions to the High Commissioner half a dozen 'times a day. If on every occasion that we had to send specific instructions it was necessary first of all to convene a meeting of the Cabinet, it would be almost impossible for the Commissioner to carry out his duties with that expedition which modern commercial transactions require. I do not wish to reason a matter which seems self-evident, but would point out that authority goes in the direction we have taken. We follow, to some extent in expression, and, altogether, in effect, the New Zealand Act, which prescribes, as this Bill does, that the duties of the High Commissionerwhich are important, and are laid down practically once and for all-ar e to be prescribed by the Cabinet, or. as in our case, by the Governor General in Council. The actual operations of the Commissioner under the powers vested in him must be controlled to some extent by his own discretion, but if by any one from this side of the world, by the Minister in charge of the responsible Department. In the New Zealand Act, we have the declaration that the High Commissioner shall exercise such powers, and perform such duties, as are assigned to him by the Government. Then, under paragraph b of the same section, he is to carry out such instructions as he receives from the Government, which, of course, means the member of the Ministry who has charge of his Department. If the honourable member will look into the New Zealand Act, he will see that there must have been some reason for adopting this principle. The honourable member jocosely pointed out that in this case there was an error of drafting.",55
381,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The provision in paragraph b of the section of the New Zealand Act to which the honourable member has just referred is what I want embodied in this Bill.,56
382,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The Government is not the Governor General in Council. The word "" Government "" is used in some cases to mean the Minister, and in some cases to mean the Government; and in Canada the same principle applies, and it is the Minister who gives the instruction; one is merely a generic term to cover the particular person. The honourable member will see the distinction between the Governor General in Council and the Government, the latter merely meaning whatever member of the Government may administer the Act. The honourable member referred to what he called an error in the drafting of paragraph a; but there is no error. The ""High Commissioner is to act as the "" representative and the resident agent for the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom "" ; and, of course, he is not to act as the representative and resident agent on the Continent. But, while his place of residence and agency is the United Kingdom, his duties are not confined to the United Kingdom, but may carry him elsewhere; and hence the drafting is correct. Another point was raised by the honourable member, but whether jocoselv or seriously I do not know. The honourable memlier said he was rather loath to vote for this clause-owing , I suppose, to what he thought the great responsibility to be vested in the High 'Commissioner-unles s honourable members were told who the High Commissioner was to be. The honourable member apparently does not like to invest such powers and duties in a man of whose qualifications and policy he is ignorant. If that be the objection, the honourable member should oppose the Bill, because, to be satisfied, he ought to know the line of successors, including, perhaps, people yet unborn, who are to be High Commissioners. It would be against all Parliamentary practice to ferential ly affect the discretion of honourable members by naming in the Bill a particular person to be the first to hold the office, even if Ministers knew who he was-; and I may say that, up to the present, my ignorance on the matter is quite profound.",56
383,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Dee s the Attorney General say that the man is yet unborn whom we are going to appoint?,56
384,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Wit h all due respect I think that the honourable member was merely playing with the subject.,56
385,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The Attorney-General knows that the man who is going to get the office was born a good while ago!,56
386,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"As I have said, my ignorance as to the person to be appointed is profound; and, at, all events, it would be most injudicious, to put it mildly, even if the Ministry had a suitable person for the office of High - Commissioner in their mind, to put his name in the Bill. Such a thing has never been done; and, besides, it would be against the spirit of the Constitution, especially if , as is suggested, the person were a member of the House, for then there would be a constitutional objection. I suppose, however, that the honourable member for West Sydney is more ingenious than serious in his objections.",56
387,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I suggest that the honourable member for West Sydney temporarily withdraw his amendment in ordc that I may submit a prior amendment.,56
388,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I - ask - leave to temporarily withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",56
389,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Cook) [9.29] - I move That after the word ""duties,"" line 6, the words "" except those of a purely social nature"" be inserted. I am very much afraid that a great part of the duty of the High Commissioner will be to fly round to banquets gorging and guzzling, and that the Commonwealth - is, in consequence, going to be called upon to foot a heavy bill.",56
390,Mr FOWLER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Does the honourable member propose to make attending a banquet a penal offence?,56
391,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Certainl y not; but I do not desire attending banquets to be part of the official duties of this officer. If he wishes to attend fine banquets in London, let him do so, but not as part of his duty, when he might be in a position to in- say that he had not the time, in consequence, to attend to other more important affairs.",56
392,Mr FOWLER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Would any High 'Commissioner make an excuse of the sort?,57
393,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,It is all very well for the honourable member to make these innocent interjections; but I have heard honourable members in the lobbies suggest that the main duty of the High Commissioner will be to keep his mouth shut and gorge and guzzle as much as possible.,57
394,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,How could the High Commissioner gorge and guzzle with his mouth shut?,57
395,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It has been suggested that the Commissioner's main duty will be to keep his mouth shut so far as speech is concerned, but to keep it open for gorging j and guzzling.",57
396,Mr MAUGER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Is the honourable member really serious?,57
397,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member for Maribyrnong, with his laugh, reminds me very often of the bray of an as. The 'CHAIRMAN - Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that remark.",57
398,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I shall not allow the honourable member for Maribyrnong to sit there insulting me !,57
399,Mr MAUGER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I am not laughing. it insulting to ask whether the honourable member is really serious?,57
400,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Order ! The honourable member for Cook must withdraw his remark.,57
401,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"In deference to the Chair I withdraw the remark; but how is it possible for any tody to be serious when he looks at the honourable member for Maribyrnong, whom the right honourable member for East Sydney has described as ""the most stupendous joke of the century ?"" The Agents-General, in their report, make a strong point of the social business; and, after a reference to certain other duties, state that the High Commissioner willin addition perform such social duties as would naturally fall to a high official. Further on the report statesSome allowance would have to be made to the High Commissioner to enable him to discharge the social duties of his office, for living in London is inordinately expensive, and there' are many demands oh the hospitality of Australian officials. I do not think that the High Commissioner ought to be called on to provide a free table for persons visiting London. I desire to see him dealing with serious business ; and I hope that his duties will be set forth at the discretion of the Government. If the High Commissioner desires fo entertain his friends or himself, he should be at perfect liberty to do so in his own time.' 1'he next paragraph requires the High Commissioner to perform certain functions and - duties for the States. That would seem to pre-suppose that the High Commissioner will take the place of the Agents General. There is a strong consensus of opinion that since Federation there should have been a diminution instead of a multiplication of the number of public officials, aiid we ought to have a statement from the Government as to whether the High Commissioner is to be an addition to the representatives of Australia in London, or whether the number already there is to be reduced. If the State Agents General are to carry on their present work, the duties of the Commonwealth representative will be of a very, meagre .character. If all the Agents General could be withdrawn and one office established to* represent the Commonwealth as a whole, there would, perhaps, be some advantage to the people in appointing a High Commissioner, but there is no indication that that will happen. We have had no statement from the Government in Is regard to it. I wished to address myself to the subject on the second reading of the Bill, but before I had an opportunity of doing so the gag was applied.",57
402,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Order ! The honourable member must confine himself to the clause.,57
403,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do not know whether there is any urgency for seriously considering the High Commissioner's duties. Some time ago the Government submitted a motion for the purchase of land and the building of quarters for a High Commissioner in London. That proposal was dropped, but it is like putting the cart before the horse to talk of appointing a High Commissioner or to set forth his duties before deciding where he i's to be housed.  money on the Estimates for that purpose.",57
404,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I take it that the Government will consult-the House about the site for any such building, as they did previously.",57
405,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Will the honourable member confine himself to the duties of the High Commissioner?,57
406,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I want to know what those duties are to be. The report of the Agents-General details them as folI lowsThe High Commissioner would manage the commercial agency, instruct the inspecting engineer, obtain and organize immigrants, defend the Commonwealth, and support its interests the public press, advertise its resources, advise ral investors proposing to place their capital tralia, perform the duties usually carried Consuls placed abroad, watch the interests of Australia in connection with treaties entered by Great Britain with foreign countries, and, in addition, perform such social duties as naturally fall to a high official. A number of those duties are being perclause, formed by the Agents-General now, but the Government have not told us which of them are to be performed by the High take Commissioner and which are to be left to the State officials, or whether the State officials are to be withdrawn and the taxof payers of Australia saved some expense. At present it appears that the appointment will simply mean an addition to our total expenditure in London without the Comin monwealth receiving any value in return. When Canada appointed its High Compublic missioner, twenty-five years ago, it was thought that the representatives of the vinces would be withdrawn, but they still flourish.",57
407,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable himself member's remarks would have been in order on the second reading, but they are out order on this clause, which deals simply with the duties of the High Commissioner.",58
408,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I am sorry that we are so restricted in discussing the tion, seeing that we had no opportunity debating it on the second reading of the Bill. The clause deals with the reprepayers sentation of the States, and I thought T should be in order in pointing out that similar circumstances in the case of Canada, the Provinces were continuing to exercise their representative functions separately from the Dominion. This clause, on the other hand, seems to foreshadow that in looked. the case of the Commonwealth the functions are to be combined. The Government do not explain why the word ""-States "" .appears in the clause. They seem to put the measure on the table and expect us to anticipate what is in their minds without hearing anything about it.",58
409,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,And the Minister wanted Parliament to choose the man last time.,58
410,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I am reminded that the Minister now in charge of the Bill Was prepand on a previous occasion to agree to Parliament selecting a man. believe he signed an agreement to thai effect, and has now gone back on it.",58
411,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I signed no agreement.,58
412,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"If the Minister in did, it is only iti conformity with the genetenor of the conduct of honin Ausorable members on that side of the out by House to agree to a thing one day and go into back on it the next, according to the exigencies of the situation. I am afraid it would will not be possible to deal with the broader aspect of the question on this and apparently the only opportunity open to us will be to debate the third reading. I hope the Government vvill not then up the attitude of the tyrant and autocrat, and use their majority to compel us to vote on the Bill without an opportunity publicly explaining our views on it to our constituents. The wording of the amendment is not altogether to my liking, but if we are to have a High Commissioner London he should go there to do business. There is a general idea in the minds of the that a good deal of the time of the High Commissioner wili be occupied, not Prowith serious business, but with attending social functions. I cannot see the necessity for that. If this gentleman wishes to amuse in such a manner, let him do it av. his own expense. It is probable that the of High Commissioner will possess considerable private means. If he considers it' necessary, in order to bring credit upon theCommonwealtli. to loom large in the fashionable world of London, he should not quesmake the cost of doing so a charge upon of the people of Australia. We should make it clear that when the money of the taxis to be spent to the extent of many thousands of pounds, a real return shall be in had for the money, and that a large amount of it shall net be frittered away on functions where gold lace and silks and satins predominate, while the real business interests of the Commonwealth are over",58
413,Mr WILKS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Dalley) [9.47] - The honourable member for Cook evidently fears that a large amount of the salary of the High Commissioner will be squandered on social functions. But no man accepting the position will look upon it as an opportunity for going on a wild ""jambouree."" He will naturally use his astuteness to get out of as many banquets as possible. He will not desire to go to every beanfeast on the board any more than the Governor General of the Commonwealth does. His Excellency shows his astuteness in avoiding social engagements whenever he can. The difficulty is to get him to go to any of them. I should not blame him if he refused more than he does. But there are certain social functions in London which the High Commissioner will have to attend in the interest of the Commonwealth. He will have to entertain as well as be entertained. It is absurd to put in the Bill a stipulation regarding the social duties of the officer. He will not be able to accept invitations without himself giving entertainments ; and when he gives them they will not have to be three-courses-for-a-shilling feasts. I can' understand the honourable member being afraid of public money being wasted on banquets. We certainly do not want to make this a rich man's post. But the honourable member for Cook, having ventilated the view naturally entertained by some people, might very well withdraw his amendment. He may be satisfied that the person appointed to be High Commissioner will desire to live for a few years. He will not be so young a man as to be anxious to be continually attending banquets. We all know, as public men, that even in our own little way we do not, if we are at all wise, accept every invitation that is extended to us. We show our wisdom in the number of invitations that we refuse. Jf there is one time more than another when a public man is uncomfortable, it is when he is at a banquet. The honourable member should withdraw his amendment, being satisfied that the type of man likely to be selected will not go the lengths that some people seem to fear.",58
414,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Calare) [9.50]. - I had not an opportunity of speaking oil this Bill.on the motion for the second reading. Now that we are discussing vvhat the duties of the High Commissioner should be, I do not know whether I shall be in order in referring to the qualities which the Commonwealth representative should possess. In the first place, I . venture to express the hope that the High Commissioner will possess all the abilities and qualifications that we should like to man occupying such an office. I hope that he will be thoroughly Australian in sentiment and aspiration, and will worthily represent the Commonwealth at the centre of the Empire. I have heard the name of the right honourable member for East Sydney mentioned as the man likelv to be appointed. I am free to admit that'if the Government saw their way to secure the services of"" the late leader of the Opposition, I , for one, should raise no objection to the appointment. I believe that the Commonwealth would find displayed by that right honourable member, not only all the ability that we are looking for, but that he would also be an exponent of the true Australian sentiment while holding this high and important position. But what .I am chiefly anxious about is that our High Commissioner shall be armed with such powers and functions as will enable him to be a true representative of Australia in London. Indeed, he "" should discharge the whole of the functions that are now being exercised by the representatives of the six States. 1 hoped that this matter would be discussed at the Premiers' Confeience, and that some understanding would be arrived at which would enable the Government to come to Parliament and intimate the extent of the functions to be discharged by the High Commissioner whom it is proposed to appoint. Unless something of the kind is done, we shall be constituting an office that no doubt will be desirable, but the value of which will be largely detracted from by the fact that the High Commissioner will be only one of seven claiming to represent Australia. We shall thus be repeating one of the least desirable of the features to be met with in our public life, the States claiming equal powers with the Federation in many respects, and being jealous of the exercise of the powers vested in the Commonwealth. We do not want a repetition of that kind of thing in connection with our representation in the Mother Country. I hope that an effort will be made to secure in London an Australian representative in the widest possible sense, and not an official who will be merely one of seven contending Australian representatives. The Commonwealth must, of course, make a move in the matter before we can ask the State Governments to agree to merge their representation in London into that of the Commonwealth. As I have said, I had hoped that the see in a matter would have been considered at the Premier's Conference, and that the Government would be in a position to indicate to the Committee the extent to which we are likely to realise the purpose of this Bill. If the attitude of the State Premiers is such that the High Commissioner vvill be only one of seven Australian representatives in London, we must consider whether we should be justified in spending on this important office the amount of money which we might reasonably expend if the High Commissioner were to be really a representative of Australia. The matter is one which closely affects the interests of the. taxpayers of the Commonwealth. As reports show, and as might readily be understood without any reports, 'under the existing system of State representation in London, much of the work is duplicated. So far each State Government has been acting independently. They have been concerned only with the representation of their own State, and have had nothing to do with the action taken by the representatives of other States. This has involved duplication, increased expenditure, and considerable friction between State and State, conditions which might be removed by the appointment of a High Commissioner .to represent the States as well as the Commonwealth. This view of the matter should be pressed home to the State Premiers, and finally to the masters of State and Commonwealth Government's, the taxpayers who will have to pay for the representation of Australia in London. I have no desire to debate the matter at great length. I am not hostile to this measure. If the lines I have indicated are followed, I shall be prepared to assist the passage of the Bill. I do say, however, that when the Bill is passed, the Government should be in a position to take the necessary steps to appoint the High Commissioner, so that Parliament may know who is to be our representative in London. I understand that in discussing that matter, I am going beyond the limit of the debate, but I hope the Government will recognise the wisdom of the suggestion I have made. I hold it to be our duty to pay to the High Commissioner such a salary as will enable us to command the services of a man of ability and patriotism, who will do credit to this high office, no matter what his financial position may be. This office should not be considered as a perquisite of wealthy men in our community. It should be open to the best talent we can secure, but if we are to command the services of such a representative as I have described, the salary set down .in this Bill is, in my opinion, quite inadequate. On the subject of the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Cook, I think that the man fitted for this position would not dream of considering himself merely a social functionary. If we get the right man, we need not be afraid of anything of the kind. Of course, if we get the wrong man, if we appoint as High Commissioner a man who cannot rise above mere social functions, there will be some danger that what the honourable member for Cook fears will take place. There will be nothing to prevent the High Commissioner spending his own means in this way. I recognise that these social functions may be utilized as an important advertising medium. They might be made use of as a means of bringing Australian sentiments and views not merely before the English' people, but before the world. I ask honourable members to recall the reports we have received of some of these functions, and they will acknowledge that we have derived a great deal of information about Canada from the utterances of the Canadian High Commissioner at gatherings'of this kind. What we have to do is to appoint the right man, and trust to his discretion and judgment in this matter.",59
415,Mr KELLY,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Wentworth) [10.4] - The excellent points the honourable member for Calare has made as to the selection of the best man, and the necessity of providing a salary which will secure the appointment of a representative Australian, whatever may be his private circumstances, have nothing to do with the amendment before the Committee, which is intended to prevent the High Commissioner from attending any function of a purely social nature.",60
416,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Certainl y not to prevent him; he can do what he likes in his own time.,60
417,Mr KELLY,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I suggest to my honourable friends opposite that inasmuch as the Government are bound to endeavour to pass this Bill this evening, it might be as well if they devoted the time that we have at our disposal to the consideration of the more important questions involved in it.",60

419,Mr KELLY,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I am suggesting to the honourable member for Cook, who, having delivered his bombshell, is now immersed in the pages of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, that in the interests of the proper discussion of this Bill he should withdraw his amendment.

423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I rise to a point of order. I submit, sir, that under the standing order you must now put the clause to the Committee, otherwise there can be no closure. It clearly contemplates the closure of the debate on the whole question under the consideration of the Chair. It says :When the motion "" That the question be now put"" has been carried, and the question consequent thereon has been decided, any further motion may be at once made which may be requisite to bring to a decision any question already proposed from the Chair; In this case the question proposed from the Chair was, "" That the clause stand part of the Bill .

426,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I desire to settle the point of order straight away. It is quite right, as the Minister has stated, that the closure, as it was adopted by the House, is of little use. I have had a good deal of experience of the closure, not only here, but in another Parliament, so that I can speak with some authority. The question before the Committee was an amendment by the honourable member for Cook to insert cerNOES. tain words in the clause. The Minister of External Affairs moved that the question be now put; that motion was carried, and then the amendment was negatived on the voices. It was then open to any honourable member to rise in his place and move a further amendment. The Minister of Defence was quite correct when he said that the question may be put forthwith. Any PAIR. member of the House may rise, at any time, and move that the question be now put, and that motion vvill have to be immediately put.",61
427,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Eve n before an amendment.,61
428,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Yes . The Minister of Defence pointed out that if honourable members can move amendments continually it vvill really make the closure useless.

Question so resolved in the negative. Clause 5Subject to the provisions of the last preceding section, the High Commissioner, for the purpose of more economically and effectively advancing the material interests and welfare of every part of Australia, shall also, at the .request of the Governments of the several State's, perform for the States functions and duties similar to those hereinbefore described and similar to those now discharged by the Agents-General of the States, and shall perform the same without discrimination or preference, or to the advantage or advantage of any State as regards another",63
461,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney) [10.45]. - It is very desirable that the High Commissioner shall be the sole representative of the Commonwealth; and, in so far as the functions performed by the Agents-General are those which, in the aggregate, can be performed by a High Commissioner, it is entirely proper that the latter should perform them. But there are some duties performed by the Agents-General which are more in the nature of commercial agency business; and these, I submit, the High Commissioner could not effectively or even properly undertake. I doubt very much whether the States would consult their interests best by asking him to perform them. What vvill very likely happen is that the Agents-General, as we know them, will disappear, and in their place will be a High Commissioner, plus a commercial agent for .each State. It nowhere says in the clause, that it is the intention to limit the duties of the High Commissioner to those of the character I have indicated, and which are now performed by the Agents-General; and if the purpose of the clause is merely to empower the High Commissioner to do that which he-could do without this authorization, if the States so requested, I do not see that it is of any use. The financial interests of the States and of the Commonwealth may be opposed in some particulars. stance, if both the Commonwealth and the States go on the London market to borrow, 'it may be that their interests will so clash that those of the Commonwealth cannot be served by an agent who represents both it and the States. conceive that it would be in the last degree disastrous to the financial standing of the Commonwealth if loans should be placed on the market by the Commonwealth and the States at the same time; and in such case, I do not see how one man could serve two masters. Since the Government do not propose to do that which is obviously right and proper, namely, sever the financial arrangements completely, we must contemplate such a position; and clause 5, as drawn, is not at all satisfactory. I was not permitted to move to exempt from the instructions in clause 4 those relating to finance; but the instructions of that nature referred to in clause 5 ought not to be carried out by the High Commissioner unless and until there has been handed over to the Commonwealth dis- the complete control of thefinancesof both State. States and Commonwealth, so far as borrowing operations on the British market are concerned. I do not see any prospect of usefully moving an amendment in the clause; indeed, an amendment could hardly be made in the clause as drawn. Perhaps the Minister will consent to such an amendment as would make the clause declaratory, because that is all it is in any case. It does not empower us to do anything we could not otherwise do, because we have ample power in the Constitution to authorize the High Commissioner to do anything we wish to which the States consent. In regard tofinance,there should be a clear understanding that, under no set of circumstances, until the complete control is in the hands of the Commonwealth, shall the High Commissioner be asked to perform those duties. If the clause is pressed in its present form, I shall be compelled to vote against it.",64
462,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Robertson) [10..51] - I think we are protected against any such disability as that referred to by the honourable member for West Sydney, seeing that the High Commissioner has to carry out such instructions as he receives from the Minister, in accordance with clause 4, and that clause 5 opens with the words "" Subject to the provisions of the last preceding section."" I , and others, have fallen into For in- the same error; but the Minister will see that the interests of the States and Commonwealth do not clash, and will give his instructions accordingly.",64
463,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Is clause 5 necessary ?,64
464,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I think so. I can The States may desire certain work to be done through the High Commissioner; and though the clause may be to a certain extent surplusage, it conveys the necessary power to the High Commissioner under the Minister.",64
465,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Wide Bay) [10.54] - I agree with the honourable member for Corio that the clause is not merely only declaratory, but is surplusage. To be of any value, the clause should prescribe a penalty of, say, ;£ioo for any neglect to perform the duties, because that is the only way to make sense out of a provision of the kind. The High Commissioner is appointed under an Act subject to the Governor General in Council, which means the Minister, so that clause 5 really prescribes what the Governor General in Council is to do under particular circumstances. A declaratory clause of this kind will have the effect of actually limiting the usefulness of the High Commissioner. Read it again and again, and you will find that it contains nothing. It gives no larger powers. It is simply a string of platitudes. Every man appointed to such a position ought to be, and will be capable of performing those duties. No one could sav that the High Commissioner would differentiate between the interests of the Commonwealth and the States. I take this opportunity of reminding honourable members that the present Agents-General consider it part of their duty to extol their own States and reflect on other States. I made a number of quotations in the speech I delivered at Gympie to showwhat the Agents-General had been doing in that direction. If the Government want to lay down the functions of the High Commissioner, they should say that he must not speak in disparagement of anv State, but it is unnecessary to encumber the Bill with little directions of that kind. The duties might be denned in the Bill as briefly as possible, leaving it to the Government to say from time to time what they should be. This raises ing clause. a larger question. As the High Commissioner will hold his office for a fixed period at a fixed salary, I see nothing in the Bill to enable the Government to remove or recall him if he carries out his duties in an unsatisfactory way.",64
466,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"What about "" incapacity "" under sub-clause 2 of clause 3?",65
467,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I do not think that covers it. I presume it means mental or physical incapacity.,65
468,Mr KELLY,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"What about "" misbehaviour "" ?",65
469,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,""" Misbehaviour "" would probably mean a criminal offence. Those are very strong words, which indicate something distinctly out of the ordinary run of incompetency or even failure to perform duties. I ' do not think that failure to perform a duty, or dilatorithat ness, or-wha t is equally grave-the giving vent by the High Commissioner to his own political views contrary to the views of the people of Australia, would amount "" misbehaviour.""",65
470,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Then the joint address by Parliament comes in.,65
471,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Yes , but should that, be necessary? It would be far better to give the Government power over the High Commissioner, subject to any action of theirs in that direction being dealt with by Parliament immediately. After all, the more we endeavour to entrench an officer of this kind, the less effective he becomes. The High Commissioner is not in the position of an ordinary Commissioner of Railways. He should be there at the direction of the Ministry to carry out the policy of the Ministry for the time being. We do not want a man appointed for a number of years, and so entrenched in his position by this Bill as to be able to give vent to opinions that are contrary to the wishes of the Parliament and Government of the day. That would be an obvious mistake, and I should be very sorry if any gentleman were intrusted with such powers.",65
472,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [n.i]--This clause is not only necessary, but highly desirable. The honourable member for West Sydney objects to it, first, on the ground that there may be some conflict. As the honourable member for Robertson pointed out, the whole of the clause, with a view to preventing conflict, is subject to the precedBy that the High 'Commissioner performs his duties upon all occasions subject to the instructions of the Minister. If there were any possibility of conflict in financial or other matters, the Minister's complete control would prevent it, and the Government of the day would issue their instructions accordingly. It is advisable to retain the clause, because' we want to declare to the States the relations that we are prepared to enter into with them for the purpose of the carrying out of these duties. It is therefore necessary to state in clear, plain, and unmistakable language what we are ready to do in that regard. We tell the States in this clause that the High Commissioner may perform for them "" functions and duties similar to those hereinbefore described and similar to those now discharged by the Agents-General of the States."" It is our desire and hope the States will come in and utilize this officer as much as possible.",65
473,Mr CHANTER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Does the Minister preto sume that the States will withdraw their Agents-General ?,65
474,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Judgin g by the tone of letters written some time ago by the States, I am of opinion that they will take advantage of this office.",65
475,Mr CHANTER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,But still retain their Agents-General ?,66
476,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The States will probably keep commercial agents in London, as the honourable member for West Sydney said, but the wisdom of having even commercial agents representing the different States has been questioned by eminent authorities. It is right that this Parliament should state clearly and unmistakablythat we are prepared to carry out work for the States if they so desire. But, as the honourable member for Robertson very properly pointed out, in order to prevent clashing, to preserve control, and to obviate conflict between State and State, the whole matter will be subject to Ministerial direction.",66
477,Mr WISE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Gippsland) [n.4] - Not withstanding what the Minister of External Affairs has said, it seems that this clause is covered by the preceding one. You cannot get anything broader, stronger, or more emphatic than the language of paragraph b of the preceding clause. According to that, the High Commissioner must carry out the instructions he receives from the Minister concerning certain specified interests of the States. It is not necessary to declare it again. If it is necessary, and the Government intend to retain this clause, I propose to move an amendment to the following effectThat after the word "" States,"" line 6, the words "" and with the consent of the Government of the Commonwealth"" be inserted. I shall move that amendment if this clause is not governed by clause 4. If the clause is governed by clase 4, the amendment is unnecessary.",66
478,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Wide Bay) [11.5]-- I said previously that it was quite unnecessary to define the High Commissioner's duties so elaborately. Since then I have looked up the Canadian Act, and find that Canada followed exactly the ideas that I expressed.",66
479,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The position is not the same. In Canada they had a number of Provincial Agents.,66
480,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The Provincial Parliaments of Canada were, comparatively speaking, as strong as the Parliaments of the States of Australia were when we federated. The Canadian Provinces had their commercial agents in London. ""What's in a name?"" Our Agents-General would be quite as important officials, even though we called them commercial agents.",66
481,Mr FOWLER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Some of them have not the slightest idea of business.,66
482,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"That observation misses the point. Although the commercial agents of the Canadian Provinces were more strictly commercial men than our Agents-General are, they were, nevertheless, the representatives of the Provinces. Let us look at the Canadian Act under which the High Commissioner is appointed. It consists simply of three sections. The first one is formal. The second section is so short lhat I will read it. 2. The High Commissioner shall(1) act as representative and resident agent of Canada in the United Kingdom, and in that capacity execute such powers and perform such duties as are, from time to time, conferred upon and assigned to him by the Governor in Council; How clear and direct that is. The remaining provisions of the Canadian Act are(2) take the charge, supervision, and control of the immigration offices and agencies in the United Kingdom under the Minister of Agriculture; (3) carry out such instructions as he, from time to time, receives from the Governor in Council respecting the commercial, financial, and general interests of Canada in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. 3. The High Commissioner shall receive a salary of not more than $10,000 per annum, and the same shall be payable out of any unappropriated money, forming part of the consolidated revenue fund of Canada. Instead of a short, simple measure, setting out the duties of the High Commissioner, as the Canadian Act does, we have a long Bill' containing a number of details as to what the High Commissioner is to do. In my opinion, the power of the Ministry is' limited by these numerous directions, which may have the very opposite effect from what is intended.",66
483,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Balaclava) [11.8]. - I think that it would be a mistake to retain the clause in the Bill. During the absence of a State Agent-General, or during a vacancy, the High Commissioner might have to act as the representative of a State. Suppose that a State wished to put a loan on the market. Does any one think that the State Government would allow the Commonwealth Minister of External Affairs to exercise a voice as to how the loan should be floated? When the High Commissioner acts for a State, he will have to obey the State Government, just as if he were the officer of the State. Under this Bill he will occupy a dual position, and I am afraid that friction and jealousy will be created. Suppose that two States wished to put a loan on the market at the same time. If the High Commissioner acted for one State and an Agent-General for another, this clause would give the High Commissioner authority to write to the Minister of External Affairs, asking him for permission to place the loan on the market on behalf of the State for which he was acting - If the Commonwealth is going to have an oflicer in London, I doubt whether the States would be wise in allowing him to act for them; and if lie does, he will not act as their agent, but will be under the control of the Commonwealth Minister. I trust that the clause will be withdrawn from the Bill.",66
484,Mr STORRER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Bass) [ n . i o ] - I trust that the Government will not withdraw the clause. The Bill requires a provision of the kind. I believe that it is necessary for the Commonwealth to have a representative in London, and I also believe that he will have to perform functions for the State. When I was a member of the Tasmanian Parliament, about six years ago, I remember a debate with reference to the Agent General. It was said that he should be appointed only for twelve months, because it was exceedingly probable that the Commonwealth would appoint a High Commissioner, who would then be able to act for Tasmania. If that was the opinion of a State Parliament six years ago, I do not think it likely to have been altered in the meantime. The States will be willing to fall in with any arrangement made by the Commonwealth. I do not think that the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland is necessary. The Bill itself uses the words "" subject to the provisions of the last preceding section."" The High Commissioner will always act under the control of the Commonwealth. It will be well for the Federal Government to work on the same lines as a business man would follow under such circumstances. We should have one principal man to represent Australia in London, and a number of business men to look after the interests of particular branches. The States and the Commonwealth should establish a uniformity of interests in matters of this kind, and we should not have regard to particular geographical boundaries. The Agents-General of the States have done good work in the past, but many of their functions will in future be discharged by the High Commissioner. I trust that the clause will be passed, in order that the States may see that they will be able to utilize the services of this officer, and that the Commonwealth is willing to work in unison with the States in reference to the matter.",67
485,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [11.14] - This clause was inserted in the Bill deliberately, in order to enable the Committee to decide whether the States should be afforded the means of direct communication with the High Commissioner, subject, of course, to the permission of the Commonwealth Government.",67
486,Mr WISE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Does not clause 4 provide for that ?,67
487,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"No , the issue is not directly stated in that clause, under which the High Commissioner can only carry out anything subject to the instructions of the Government. This clause was intended to declare in statutory form that the States would have the right to utilize the services of the High Commissioner.",67
488,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Is any power given in clause 5 which could not be exercised under clause 4?,67
489,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"This clause contains a direct declaration. We thought it best to let the States know the exact position. The matter is, however, one upon which the Committee may express an opinion. We felt that it was right to submit the question in this form, though we recognise that the matter is one as to which we should abide by the decision of the Committee.",67
490,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The clause amounts to a limitation of power?,67
491,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"No , it is a. definition.",67
492,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"To the extent that the clause defines, it limits.",67
493,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The preceding provision is wide, This is an additional duty cast upon the High Commissioner. The honourable member for Wide Bay, amongst others, has sometimes complained that our Statutes do not clearly set out all that is intended. The complaint has frequently been made that in drafting Bills too much is left to regulation. The desire of the Government in introducing this clause was to bring this matter distinctly before honourable members.",67
494,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable gentleman speaks of regulations, but this is simply a direction of the Executive.",68
495,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member will see that the clause referred to by him relates to "" such duties as are conferred upon and assigned to him by the Governor General."" That could be by regulation.",68
496,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,And by direction of the Minister.,68
497,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,That is additional.,68
498,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,If the honourable gentleman will look at the Canadian Act he will see that everything is left to the Minister.,68
499,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"No , to the Governor General in Council.",68
500,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,What is the difference?,68
501,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"On e is the Minister administering the Act, and in the other case the Governor General prescribes duties by Executive action. Our desire was to make what is proposed quite clear in order to get the sense of the Committee upon it. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [11.16] - I think, this clause is all right. It seems to me that it is absolutely necessary to offer some inducement to the States to federate, because at present they are not federated. I want to provide something which will enable the State and Commonwealth Governments to come together in connection with financial transactions. The State Governments will not entrust the floating of their loans to the High Commissioner unless some body invested with the power to. deal with financial matters is created which offers them such an induce-ment as would enable them to float their loans at par under the Commonwealth representative, when they would be obliged to float them below par if they .did their business through their own Agents-General. I desire to have a branch of the National Postal Banking System established in London.",68
502,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"We might make this one of the functions of the High Commissioner. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I think it might be included amongst his functions and duties. We might insert in clause 5 the wordsshall bs a representative of the Commonwealth National Postal Banking System when established. I am most anxious that in this particular respect the States should be federated. From my experience as an old American banker, I know that nothing unites the human family as money does.",68
503,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It unites political parties too. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Politica l parties are bought, owned and run by money in America.",68
504,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"We have nothing like that here. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I agree with the honourable member, but while we do a lot of talking up here a man in a bank down in Collins-street runs the lot of us, and we do not know it.",68
505,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the; Mr KING O'MALLEY - If I am to confine myself to the clause I am bound to say that I do not think that there is much in it. I should like to know from you, sir, how I had better propose th®. amendment I have indicated?",68
506,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I suggest to the honourable member that he might submit his amendment as a new clause. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Ver y well; I have no more to sav on this clause.,68
507,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Flinders) [11.20]. - I think that this clause should remain in the Bill, because it is desirable that we should hold out a kind of invitation to the State Governments to do as much of their work as they can through the representative of the central authority. I am afraid, however, that the drafting of the clause, as it stands, might lead to some serious difficulty hereafter. I do not think our invitation to the State Governments will have much effect if when at our request they have agreed to entrust their affairs to the High Commissioner, he is in the management of those affairs to be under the direct control of the Commonwealth Government. What we want to do is to invite the State Governments if they have any particular business to transact in London to do it through the High Commissioner instead of through their own representative. But we could not reasonably expect them to accept that invitation if their agent in the transaction of that business, for the High Commissioner would in that matter be their agent, was to be under the direct control of a Commonwealth Minister.",68
508,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Surely the High Commissioner must have but one master?,68
509,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Not necessarily. For instance, if a State Government desired to float a loan and asked the High Commissioner to take the necessary steps it will not be contended that it would be desirable that the Minister of External Affairs, or any other Commonwealth Minister, should have the power to interfere and advise the High Commissioner as to the steps he should take.",68
510,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Paragrap h b of clause 4 would not go to that extent. The High Commissioner would merely apply to the Minister for leave to undertake the work. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - The paragraph goes further than that. It provides that in all matters with which the High Commissionei is dealing for the Commonwealth 01 the States affecting their financial, commercial, and general interests, he is to be directly under the control and direction of the Commonwealth - Ministry. The difficulty might be overcome by adopting a slight modification of the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland. I think that in clause 5 we ought not to say "" Subject to the provisions of the last preceding section,"" but "" Subject to the consent of the Commonwealth Government.""",69
511,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I i is purely a matter of tcistc Mr VV. H . IRVINE - I think not. The Commonwealth Government should have the right to say whether and under what conditions the High Commissioner should be allowed to accept mandates from the various State Governments, but once he has been allowed to do so he should be able to carry out the work with which he has been intrusted by a State Government without being under the express direction of the Commonwealth Government.",69
512,Mr WISE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It is the difference between consent and control. Mr W. H. IRVINE - That is so. If we are to hold out this invitation to the State Governments we must do so in such a way that they can reasonably accept it. Mr Wise ' (Gippsland) [11.24] - To meet the difficulty mentioned by the Honourable member for Flinders I shall ask leave to withdraw my amendment with view to proposingThat the words "" Subject to the provisions the last preceding section"" be left out, with view to insert in lieu thereof the words ject to the consent of the Governor General.""

513,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [11.25] - In the ing of this clause both forms were considis ered, and it was thought that that which has been adopted would be the less objecaccord tionable to the States. At the same time, [ am prepared to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Gippsland, and if he will permit me to do so, I will move an amendment to that effect.",69
514,Mr WISE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Ver y well.,69

Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 6(1.) The salary of the High Commissioner shall be Three thousand pounds a year, and shall be paid to him monthly out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated for that purpose accordingly. (2.) The High Commissioner shall be paid, out of moneys to be provided by the Parliament, the expenses, not exceeding Two thousand pounds a year, of an official residence, and such sums for travelling expenses as the Minister allows. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [11.27] - I desire to move that the word "" Three,"" line 1, be left out, with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the word "" Six."" In sub-clause 2 I also wish to strike out the word "" t w o . "" In my opinion we should vote the High Commissioner a lump sum, instead of paying him a salary and allowing him a certain amount for expenses. He should be placed in an absolutely independent position. He may desire to live at Brighton or Torquay, and he should be free to do so. We do not require to purchase an official residence for him. The United Slates has maintained, in London, Ambassadors of the highest honour, and yet they have never had an official court at St."" James's.",69
516,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Hav e they not been very wealthy men? Mr KING O'MALLEY - No . James Russell Lowell was a poor man, so was Baird. Joseph Choate was not a rich man!",69
517,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"He was. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He was only a an American millionaire-that is a ,£200,000 man here. Relatively speaking, of he was a poor man. _ The present Ambasa sador, Mr Whitelaw Reid, is the only rich "" Subman whom the United States has had in London.",69
518,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"What about Elliott? Mr KING O'MALLEY - He is a poor draftman. The very fact that Whitelaw Reid a rich man has led to his recall, because too much ceremony and grandeur do not with the simplicity of the American life. After all the 400 society people of'the United States do not represent the heart of the American Democracy-fh e farmers and industrial residents of the back blocks. We ought to make the position of High Commissioner one that any capable man, be he lawyer, doctor, or able financier, may accept. A salary of £3,000 a year is not sufficient for the occupant of that distinguished office. I have sometimes made that amount in an afternoon. I think that a salary of £6,000 would be a fair thing.",69
519,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I cannot, accept the proposal of the honourable member because it aims at increasing the burdenfi on the people.",70
520,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [11.30] - I realise that the objection raised by you, sir, is fatal to the honourable member's proposal. At the same time the Government desire to afford the Committee every latitude in considering this question. We are, therefore, prepared to accept the omission of any word in this clause as a direction by the Committee that we should increase the salary of the High Commissioner to £5,000. We should then ask the Committee to agree to the clause later; but we would take the necessary steps to put it in proper form should an amendment be made.",70
521,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Robertson) [11.31] - In order to test the feeling of the Committee, I move That the word ' Three,"" line 2, be left out. If my proposal be carried it will be an intimation to the Government that the Committee do not regard £3,000 as an adequate salary to pay to the High 'Commissioner, that the amount should be increased to at least £5,000 and that the allowance for an official residence should also be increased to at least £3,000 per annum.",70
522,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Wide Bay) [11.32] The Minister of External Affairs has had the grace to say that the Government willaccept any amendment of the clause as a direction to them to increase the salary of the High Commissioner. He has declared that they are anxious to give effect to the views of honourable members. To what honourable members does he allude?,70
523,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,To the members of this Committee.,70
524,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"This is a very importtant matter, and any direction that the Committee may give the Government will have no value in view of the small attendance of honourable members.",70
525,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Le t the Bill go. Mr iFISHER - The Treasurer need not be so peremptory.,70
526,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I did not mean my remark to be peremptory.,70
527,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Does 'the honourable gentleman object to members of the Opposition saying anything at all? Is that the stage which we have reached? It is no reflection upon honourable members to say that this is not a representative Committee.,70
528,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The Committee will have an opportunity of reconsidering this matter in accordance with the statement which I have made.,70
529,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I am well aware that it is quite a usual practice for a Government to take a vote upon some unimportant question in a Bill with a view to ascertaining the opinions of a majority of honourable members, because under the Standing Orders only a member of the Government can propose an increase of expenditure.",70
530,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Subjec t to bringing down a fresh message from the Governor General.,70
531,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do not agree that the Commonwealth could get a better man for £6,000 than for £3.000 a year. My experience is that if the salary were fixed at £10,000 we should get less work out of the officer. Whilst I think that .£5,000 is not an extraordinary amount, still £3,000 is a very fair salary to start with.",70
532,Mr HENRY WILMS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Onl y a rich man could take the position at that salary.,70
533,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The idea that only a rich man would be able to take this office is a grave reflection upon those who call themselves Democrats. Am I to assume that we cannot get an able man at a salary of £3,000. with an allowance of £2,000 per year for expenses, and such sums for travelling expenses as the Minister may allow ? In my opinion the provision for an allowance for travelling expenses is a very lax method to adopt. I would rather increase the allowance to £3,000 a year than have this provision for the allowance of expenses by the Minister. One of the most delicate and difficult subjects with which a Treasurer is called upon to deal is that of the expenses of a high public official. One man will spend four or five times as much as will another man. One man will take a most conscientious view of what he should spend, while another will spend most lavishly when he is travelling. At the beginning of this century, there were some celebrations in New South Wales, and a public officer went to Sydney to represent his State. All the tips and payments to the barber and the chemist were included as part of his expenses. Yet there is no more honourable or capable servant in the Commonwealth than the gentleman to whom I allude. That is an illustration of the danger of including in this clause a provision for the allowance of expenses by the Minister.",70
534,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The last part of the clause only applies to travelling expenses.,71
535,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Yes . Would it not be possible to fix a salary and let the High Commissioner pay his own expenses?,71
536,Mr GLYNN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,No .,71
537,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I think that the travelling expenses of Federal Ministers should be paid, but the High Commissioner should receive a stated salary and travel as he pleases.",71
538,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"He would, not travel.",71
539,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do not think it will be necessary for the High Commissioner to travel very much. The distances in Europe are short, and the travelling expenses will be a mere bagatelle.",71
540,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Hi s expenses may vary from year, to year, because in some years he will have Conferences to attend. The Judges of the High Court have a fixed allowance of £ 3 3s. per day.",71
541,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"My recollection is that the Judges demanded the payment of all their expenses, and won on that point.",71
542,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"No , they receive a fixed sum.",71
543,Mr FISHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"If the High Commissioner is allowed to claim all his expenses, whether he will travel like a King or a Prince, or a citizen, will be determined by his own disposition. It would be far better to give him a stated sum. He should have a residence in London, and should not flit from place to place, or live in lodgings. We are dealing with a most important matter at a time when honourable members are thinking more of catching their trains than of the subject under consideration.",71
544,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Corio) [11.42] - I submit to you, sir, that the honourable member for Darwin could move an amendment to increase the salary of the High Commissioner to £5,000 per year. The clause provides for a total expenditure of £5,000 per year, and in my opinion the Committee can allocate that sum as it chooses. If the salary vvere limited to £5,000 instead of to £6,000 the proposal of the honourable member might be acceptable to the Chair. I want to support the original decision of the Ministry, because I think that a salary °f ^3>°°° a year is quite enough. We are dealing with the remuneration of a business man only. The honourable member for Wide Bay quoted from an Act to show that the salary of the High Commissioner for Canada is only £2,000 per jear. We want a business man, not a society man, to represent Australia. I do not know how the appropriation of £12,000 per year for seven Ministers is divided, but I should not think that the Prime Minister receives more than £2,000 a year. Considering that we have obtained the best Australian ability for that salary, it would be veryunfortunate for the Commonwealth to have in its gift a better office than the Prime Ministership. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Why not fix the salary at £5,000, and allow no expenses? I would vote for a proposal of that kind.",71
545,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I do not even want that to be done. I rose to suggest a way in which possibly the Chair might accept the honourable member's amendment. I shall be glad to support the clause as it stands. Whether an official residence is necessary or not, I cannot say. Any official residence that may be provided may be useless to the High Commissioner, just as the official house in Downing-street was to Mr Gladstone or Mr Balfour, who preferred their own homes. It would depend largely on the domestic arrangements of the Commissioner whether he could conveniently live in an official residence. In my opinion, it would be better to give him £2,000 for expenses, without binding him to use the money for the upkeep of an official residence. But we must act economically. There is an impression abroad that there is too much spreadeagleism about our propositions. In my"" opinion, £3,000 ought to be a sufficient salary for a good man. We should think more of economy in our appointments, and he content to give fair and not extravagant salaries for good service.",71
546,Mr THOMAS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Barrier) [11.47]-- I hope that the Government will stick to the clause as it stands. In my opinion, £3.000 is a fair salary to fix for the High Commissioner, and I am - willing to grant £2,000 for the upkeep of an official residence, and to pay reasonable travelling expenses. If we vote a lump sum for travelling expenses, some Commissioners may do very little travelling, hoping to save all they can. I disagree with those who have expressed the opinion that it will not be necessary for the High Commissioner to travel. I hold the view that it will be all the better for Australia if he sees a little of what is going on in the world.",71
547,Mr BOWDEN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Nepean) [11.49] - I am in favour of increasing the salary of the High Commissioner to £5,000, with travelling expenses.",72
548,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.'],72
549,Mr BOWDEN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The salary paid to the Canadian representative has been mentioned as a precedent to guide us, but it must be remembered that that position has been almost monopolized by one man, simply because he has had money to spend in keeping it up. The honourable member for Wide Bay has said that Australia does not wish to make this position one for rich men. The most certain way to make it one for rich men is to attach a low salary to it, and considering what the High Commissioner will have to do, a salary of ,£5,000 a year will be little enough. I think, tco, that an official residence should be provided, for which I am willing to vote £2,000. The feeling of Americans is that their ambassador to the English Court should have an official home. would be undesirable to pay a lump sum for travelling expenses, because while one year a good deal of travelling might have to be done, the next year there might be very little. But in the performance of his duties, the High Commissioner might have to visit various places on the Continent, and even America, and we must be prepared to pay the expenses so incurred.",72
550,Mr STORRER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Bass) [11.52] - I shall support the clause as it stands; £3,000 is a fair salary to begin with. If necessary, we can increase the amount later, but if we fix a large sum now, it will not be easy to reduce it. My experience is that the best brains are not always obtained for the biggest money. We have in Australia men who could do the work satisfactorily for £3,000 a year.",72
551,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Hume) [11.53]. - When last in England, 1 had an opportunity to learn what the conditions are which attach to a position of this kind, and I say unhesitatingly that .£3,000 would be a ridiculously small salary to pay the Commissioner. Mr Whitelaw Reid, the United States Ambassador, does not get a high salary, but he is a wealthy man, while Lord Strathcona, who represents the Dominion of Canada, thinks nothing of spending £50,000 on a week's entertaining, and does it very often. Our High Commissioner will have to rub shoulders with very wealthy men, and it would not do to have him curbing himself, and perpetually doubting whether his salary would carry him through the year. No man should be placed in such a position that he could not entertain in accordance with his position, though perhaps not as some other representatives do. My feeling is that if the High Commissioner got ,£10,000 a year it would be little enough. The Governors of ""Victoria used to get £10,000 a year and certain expenses paid, but their expenditure always exceeded their salaries'. I know of my personal knowledge that Lord Hopetoun, while here, spent £16,000 more than his official salary. It is not fair to send the High Commissioner to England and give him such a salary that the people may be led to believe that he or Australia is mean. We should pay the High Commissioner a salary sufficient to enable him to represent us properly and reasonably without being guilty of extravagance. Captain Collins has done very well in the position he has occupied in London, but he has not been It called upon as the High Commissioner will be to entertain the leading men of Great Britain and some of the most prominent men in the British Dominions. To pay the High Commissioner such a salary as would make it almost impossible for him to live under reasonable conditions would not be right. If the salary paid be that for which the Bill now provides, the appointment will be confined to a few wealthy men. A man cannot be expected to leave Australia for England and to devote all his attention to the position of High Commissioner unless he is well paid. I should not object to the appointment of a wealthy man, provided that he was capable and worthy of the position, but we must have regard for the name of Australia and see that our representative at Home is adequately remunerated.",72
552,Mr ARCHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Capricornia) [11.57] I have no desire to exaggerate the duties or the expenses attaching to the position of High Commissioner; but entirely agree with those who have said that a salary of £3,000 per annum is absolutely insufficient. I do not think that Australia will expect the High Commissioner to entertain in an extravagant or fantastic way. We have heard of the banquets of the Four Hundred in New York",72
553,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Honourable members opposite are becoming garrulous at midnight.,73
554,Mr ARCHER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I have not had an opportunity to speak before owing to the Opposition having taken up so much of the time of the Committee. The duties of the High Commissioner will bring him into touch with representative people with whom it is his duty to confer, and it may be necessary for him to return entertainments to a considerable degree. He must reside in London and in"" certain surroundings. Those who have lived in London or Melbourne, know full well that it is exceedingly expensive to keep up an establishment there. If the High Commissioner receives only ,£3,000 per annum, he will be unable to properly discharge those functions of his office which involve entertaining and a considerable expenditure; he will have to reside, as our Agents-General have done, in some suburb where he may live cheaply. He must live in town, however, if he is to entertain and play his part with representatives of other Dominions, and his expenses will certainly be more than £3,000 a year. For that reason I shall be prepared to support an amendment providing for a salary of £5,000 per annum.",73
555,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [12.0] - May I suggest to honourable members that we should proceed to a vote as soon as possible ? There seem to be quite, a number of opinions as to the salary that should be provided, and it would be well for us to proceed to a test vote in order that we may determine what the Committee is disposed to do. It is open to the Committee to do what it likes in a reasonable way so far as the question of salary and emolument is concerned. We inserted this.amount in the Bill because we thought it would be a fair salary, but if the Committee thinks otherwise the Government will not object to the amount being increased.",73
556,Mr HARPER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Mernda) [12.2 a.m.] I agree with the honourable member for Hume that the salary fixed in the Bill as it stands is insufficient to enable the High Commissioner to represent Australia in a responsible way and to discharge all the duties of his position. The salary is designed to enable the High Commissioner to represent Australia properly in London, and my experience as one who has visited England on several occasions is that of the honourable member for Hume. A salary of ,£3,000 per annum would be inadequate for the occupant of the office of High Commissioner, and il therefore propose to move an amendment providing that the amount be fixed at £5,000 per annum.",73
557,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [12.3 a.m.] - It is not competent for an honourable member to move , to increase the amount named in the clause, but if the amendment for the omission of the word ""three"" be carried the Government will take it as a direction that the Committee is of opinion that the salary shall be £5,000 per annum. We will then bring down an additional message to cover the increased amount, and the Bill will be re-committed for the purpose of amending the clause.",73
558,Mr SPENCE,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Darling) [12.4 a.m.] The Minister of External Affairs is creating new complications.. If the Government accept the omission of the word ""three"" by the Committee as an indication of its desire that the salary shall be £5,000 per annum, and no alteration is made in the next clause, the High Commissioner will receive £7,000 per annum and travelling expenses. I think we ought to be told if that is the attitude of the Government. Personally I do not like the provision as to travelling expenses, because I think a definite sum would be much better. Exception might be taken on the Estimates to an unusually high expenditure under this head, followed by a discussion not at all desirable in connection with this high and important position. It is clear that if the duties of the office are to include entertaining and social functions similar to those which fall to the lot of a Governor, the salary proposed is very small; and in my opinion the work which will fall to a High Commissioner calls for more ability than is required in the other position. I favour an increased salary, but I think the matter ought to be more fully discussed than is possible at this hour of the night. The Government proposal suggests that the High Commissioner should be compelled to have an official residence, but I think the suggestion of the honourable member for Darwin would better meet the case. No doubt an official residence would add to the High Commissioner's importance, and if that idea is not carried out, I suppose the proposal, which appears to have been lest sight of lately, of securing Commonwealth buildings, will be revived. There appears no sign at present of the States Agents-General handing over any of their functions, and, therefore, it may be that a lower salary could be paid at the beginning than subsequently ; but the whole question requires further consideration.",73
559,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Franklin) [12.10 a.m.]-Fro m the speeches made one would imagine that all Europe were waiting to be feasted by and to feast the High Commissioner of Australia. The great probability is that the appointment will be announced in the English newspapers in a three or four line cable, and that when the Commissioner arrives he will take exactly the position that is occupied by any other representative of a portion of the Empire. It has to be remembered that, although Lord Strathcona receives a salary of £2,000, his position otherwise is one which no High Commissioner for Australia can hope to occupy for many years to come. It has been said that Lord Strathcona entertains Royalty and royally; but he has an enormous private income, and if the High Commissioner is to vie with him, we shall have to pay very much more than £5,000 a year. I take it that we are sending a man to do the work of Australia, and not one to occupy an ambassadorial position. If this is not to be a hard business proposition we ought not to pass the Bill. Our object, I suppose, is not to have a High Commissioner who will enter into rivalry with the ambassadors from different parts of the world, but one who, in return for his salary, will do the work we expect. If we raise the salary to £5,000 in the expectation that he will entertain, we shall place the High Commissioner in an entirely false position, and render it impossible for any one to accept the appointment who has not a large private income. It is proposed to raise the salary, not because we think the work is worth it, but simply because we expect the High Commissioner to entertain and be entertained.",74
560,Mr HARPER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Who said that?,74
561,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"That has been the whole trend of the arguments used; because, if there is no question of entertaining, a salary of £3,000 is ample. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That would not enable the High Commissioner to give a cup of tea to the Australians who would call on him.",74
562,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I hope it is not the intention to make the High Commissioner's house a kind of sponging place for touring Australians. For some time past, I have thought that the electors would force on us the necessity of considering the abnormal growth of the Commonwealth Public Service salary list; because we have attempted to place the service on far too high a level. When the honourable member for Hume was proposing the first increases of salary, he said that the object was to make the Federal Service the blue ribbon of Australia. But there are two classes directly interested in the matter-the taxpayers and the taxeaters; and I believe that the whole of the service will have to be taken in hand by this Parliament in the near future. We are making the expense of running the machine far too heavy-and now, in what should be a strictly business arrangement, the House is asked to depart from the proper basis. We are invited to increase the salary of the High Commissioner, with a view to imposing upon him certain ambassadorial functions which can only make him appear ridiculous. If the High Commissioner is not expected to entertain largely the salary fixed in the Bill is sufficient. It is the highest with one exception paid in the whole Commonwealth service. I think the Chief Justice of the High Court receives £3,500 a year. For many years to come we shall not require a man of transcendant ability to fill the position. I want to see a good man sent to England, and if this is made a fair commercial transaction a. salary of £3,000 will enable the Government to secure the pick of all Australia for the position. If our representative were expected to meet the ambassadors of the great nations of the world on an equal footing a salary approaching £25,000 would be required, but to attempt anything of. that sort would be to make ourselves the laughing stock of civilization. Our representative will have no ambassadorial functions to perform, and for many years to come this will be a kind of honorary office and largely a sinecure. Until we take over the State debts or embark on a large immigration policy there will be practically nothing for the High Commissioner to do. To make the total cost of the office run into £12,000 or £15,000 a year will be to pay far loo high a price for the work that we shall get in return. Mr J. H. CATTS - I think we ought to have a quorum present. [Quorum formed.]",74
563,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I hope that the Committee will be satisfied with the liberal provision proposed by the Government. I trust that Ministers will show bone, and insist as far as they can upon the Bill being passed as it stands.",75
564,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney) [12.20 a.m.] - I protest against the proposal of the Government to accept whatever salary the Committee is pleased to fix at this hour of the morning. I suggest that if on division "" £ 3 , 0 0 0 "" be struck out, the clause should' be left with a blank in it until we have a more numerous Committee to decide what amount shall be inserted. Many honourable members went away tonight under the impression that the salary would be fixed at £3,000. I am not taking exception to a larger salary, but an opportunity should be afforded to deal with the question in a larger Committee. The remaining clauses could be taken quickly and nothing would remain but to insert a figure. I did not expect that a Government, who Ave had e\'ery reason to believe intended to adhere to every word in the Bill, would at this hour of the morning go back on its intention in such a vital matter. I should be sorry to moA'e the gag on any honourable member on that side, but I shall have to do so if I am not alloAved to proceed.",75
565,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,What does the honourable member say ? Why does he not mind his own business?,75
566,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,T am nvnding my business. The honourable member has about ns much manners as a back-country bandicoot.,75
567,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,May I speak to the Attorney-General ?,75
568,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Le t the honourable member hold his tongue.,75
569,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I have repeatedly called the Minister of Defence to order. I ask him now to cease these continuous remarks.,75
570,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,I rise to order. The honorabie member has no right to make such remarks as he has been making. Nothing Avas taking place over here except that 1 Avas speaking to the Attorney General.,75
571,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The same thing has occurred frequently. The Minister of Defence rises ostensibly to a point of order, but really to rebuke an honourable member for doing something that he does not approve of. That is not treating the Chair properly. My duty Avas to call on the honourable member for West Sydney, but the honourable member rose to order and I allowed him to speak. I ask him not to pura little back- sue that course.",75
572,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The honourable member for West Sydney Avants to take charge of the House.,75
573,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The course I suggested will expedite matters.,75
574,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"I said that if a division were taken and the 'Committee deleted the AA'ord ""three"" Ave should have to bring the clause down again.",75
575,Mr HUGHES,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Then the proposal is merely to take a division on the question of striking out the figures? That is satisfactory to me.,75
576,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"That is all that the Committee can do to-night, but I said that the Government Would vote to retain the word "" three.""",75
577,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Kalgoorlie) [12.25 a.m.]. - I feel the force of the argument that it is our duty to decide Avhether or not the CommonAvealth is to pay to the High 'Commissioner the salary stipulated in this clause. But I feel at the same time that Ave are not at present in a proper position to settle the question. Very feAv members of the Opposition are here noAv. Most of them Avent to catch their trains before 12 o'clock. Many Government supporters have also gone home. The suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney that the clause might be postponed is one that .should be faA-orably considered by the Government. The remaining clauses, which are principally of a formal character, vrauld very likely be taken Avithout debate.",75
578,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Did the honourable member say "" Aery likely""? r",75
579,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"In the event of the clause under consideration being postponed, I haA'e no doubt that the remainder of the Bill Would be passed Avithout debate. The question df salary could be settled when the House re-assembled, and when, in all probability, there would be a representative gathering of members. Though Ave have had differences of opinion on many questions, I would appeal to the Minister in charge to recognise the suggestion as a reasonable one. There is a difference of opinion even among Ministerial supporters on the point at issue. It would be far better to postpone the clause than to go to a division now, with the object of creating a blank which the majority of honourable members tomorrow may consider ought not to haA'e been created. If the Minister is not prepared to take the view of the situation which I have submitted, it will be necessary to review the possibilities in relation to the men who are likely to be able to fill the position successfully on the lines laid down in the Bill.",75
580,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member means that it will be necessary to - "" stonewall""?",76
581,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The Minister of Defence is ever courteous and truthful.,76
582,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,That is practically what the honourable member said.,76
583,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,It is not what I said. I believe that the Government are well acquainted with the fact that the clause is not going to be carried in a form embodying their present proposal.,76
584,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"If the honourable member is of that opinion, why not allow the matter to go to a vote?",76
585,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Apparentl y the numbers have been arranged for amending the clause to-night.,76
586,Mr KELLY,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Does not the honourable member see that if there is a majority for an amendment of the clause, there would be nothing easier than to insist upon a recommittal tomorrow.",76
587,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member's Parliamentary experience is sufficient to show that it is the most 'difficult thing imaginable to secure a recommittal when once a particular provision has been decided upon. The question is one upon which at least one-half of the members of this House ought to express' an opinion. But if the vote is taken now, not half of the representatives of the people will be present to vote.",76
588,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Why are they not here?,76
589,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Why is the honourable member so frequently away? Being here now, he is apparently anxious to advertise the fact. I am one of those who hold that Australia is not necessarily called upon to provide for a social butterfly. We ought to pay for brains, and to get the best man available, paying him an adequate salary in order that he may be able to maintain the dignity of his office. But we are not called upon to pay thousands of pounds for lavish entertainments. The opinion of those who have had experience of London, and who are acquainted with the duties of officers similar to the High Commissioner, are in the highest degree valuable. But those honourable members who have had such experience, and who can [128] advise the Committee on the point, have gone home to bed. If a blank is created we are given to understand that the Government will come down with another message to provide an increased salary for the High Commissioner. That is a most objectionable method of dealing with the subject. The Government ought to have afforded us an opportunity to discuss the question at a reasonable hour. We ought not to determine so important an issue, affecting the satisfactory representation of Australia in London, at a time when at least half the members of this 'Chamber are absent.",76
590,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"North Sydney) [12-35 a.m.] - If a further message should be required to increase the amount of the salary to be paid to the High Commissioner that might be considered tomorrow, but I hope the Government will not on any account yield to the wish expressed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. They have been taunted with not getting their business through, and with neglecting to ask the House to sit late at night. Now, when they have asked honourable members to sit later than usual in order to get on with business which they were taunted with having postponed, it is claimed by those who previously taunted them, and expressed a desire to sit late, that it is not a proper thing to decide this question with a small attendance of members, and at this time of the night. If they yield to the appeal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, in these circumstances, the Government will abrogate their powers altogether. The fact that there is only a small attendance is due to those who have delayed the passage of the Bill by their opposition. If honourable members who have opposed the Bill from the other side believed that they had good reasons for doing so, they should have remained while it was under discussion. So far as the salary of the High Commissioner is concerned, I may say that I would prefer to vote for that provided in the Bill rather than for the amendment, though I think that it would have been wise to offer another £1.000 a year. I am not prepared to increase the salary to the extent which has been suggested, and if a division is taken I shall vote with the Government. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [12.37 a.m.] - I am afraid that if Ministers vote against the proposal to increase the salary, their followers may vote with them, and so an inadequate salary will be provided. I remind honourable members of the difficulty of reviewing the action of Parliament in passing a Bill of this kind. They will remember that it took us some years to secure an increase of our own ries. If a low salary is decided upon,- we shall not get the best brains in Australia for this position. VVe require as. High Commissioner a man who will be able to shine alongside the great men with whom he will be associated. Our country will be judged by the intelligence and knowledge of the man who represents Australia in London. I should prefer to vote for an allowance of ,£6,ooo in a lump sum, and let the High Commissioner do as ,he pleases as to the expenditure. The day is gone by for official residences. The High Commissioner could secure a suite of rooms at the ""Cecil,"" the ""Langham,"" or some other hotel, which would be his head-quarters. If we establish an official residence, we shall probably bankrupt the High Commissioner, because he will be unable to keep it up. Later on. when we have our own Commonwealth building in London, we can provide the High Commissioner with an official residence.",76
591,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Cook) [12.40 a.m.]. I understand that the proposal is to create a blank. If I thought lhat that would lead to a reduction of the amount of salary to be paid to the High Commissioner, I should be prepared to vote for it. I find, however, that those who desire to create a blank wish to increase the proposed salary by £.2,000, and I shall therefore vote against* the proposal. I would rather riot vote with the Government on any question, but I shall be compelled to vote on the same side with them if a division is taken on the question now before the Committee. I have already said that it is not likely that for some time the duties of the High Commissioner will be of a very responsible nature, because the State Agents General will continue to carry out their functions. In the circumstances, the salary proposed by the Bill is ample. If the responsibilities of the office increase, the salary can be increased later on. We are paying the Chief Justice of the High Court a salary of £3,500 a year; and it seems to me that he is charged with duties that are quite as onerous and responsible as - those which it is proposed that the High Commissioner shall attend to. It is, of course, a matter for themselves, but I find ' Bill. it difficult, to understand why some honourable members should be so ready to vote away the taxpayers' money. As we have gone so far with the Bill, I think it ought sala- not now to be postponed. I believethe Government have made up their minds as to whom they will appoint to this position, and the increase of the proposed salary by £2,000 would not be a matter of much importance to the gentleman who is likely, to be appointed. I feel that in asking that the proposed salary should be increased, honourable members are really asking the bulk of the taxpayers, who have little or nothing, to give more money to a person who will already have more than he will know what to do with. The honourable member for Franklin referred to the social side of the duties of the High Commissioner, but I did net notice that the honourable member was present earlier in the evening, when special reference was made to that aspect of the question. When I tried to have it considered, honourable members endeavoured to cast ridicule upon my proposal.",77
592,Mr STORRER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,The honourable member desired to exclude the High Commissioner from all social functions.,77
593,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"No , I did not desire to prevent the High Commissioner attending any functions he pleased .at his own expense, and in his own time. What I desired was that his attendance at social functions should not be regarded as. part of the duties for which he is to be paid. As I believe that the object in creating a blank is to increase the salary, I shall be compelled to vote for the clause as it stands.",77
594,Mr CARR,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Macquarie) [12.45 a.m.] I think that the Government would be well advised if they adhered to the proposals contained in this clause. In my judgment, the class of work that the Commonwealth will require to be performed at Home is of a utilitarian rather than of a social character. There is no need to offer special inducements to capitalists to invest capital in Australia, as capital always finds paying outlets. What we more urgently need is the settlement amongst us of men who are possessed of small means. I shall support the clause in its present form, with the full knowledge that when the duties of the High Commissioner increase, his salary can be increased.

595,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Kalgoorlie) [12.53 a.m.]. - This clause embodies a proposal which demands some attention at the hands of this Committee. I believe that if we could take a division upon the merits of the clause, certain words in it would be eliminated. It is either a good or bad thing to permit the High Commissioner to act as director or agent of any compaay 'or syndicate, but it is in the highest degree undesirable that he should be allowed to so actor be prevented from so acting at the dictation of the Minister. It is practically making the Minister a censor of the High Commissioner. We ought to be told why this power is reserved. [128}- 2",78
596,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Dees the honourable member think that the acceptance ot these offices ought to be prohibited (,78
597,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,It ought to be either 2 5 prohibited or allowed. It ought not to be 12 left to the discretion of the Minister.,78
598,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"There are some innocent 13 offices which have been held by the AgentsAVES General. For instance, an Agent-General has been Treasurer of the Committee of the Royal Military Charities Fund, and filled other positions which help the Imperial movement.",78
599,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Does my honourable friend think that we are going to send to London a man, at a salary of £3,000, with an allowance of £2,000 and expenses, in order that he may take honorary offices on the Committee of a Royal Military Charitable Fund, and do all that sort of. NOES. thing ?",78
600,Mr CROUCH,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The Agents-General have done so in the past, because they, represented Australia in the Imperial movement.",78
601,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The Minister ought not to be allowed to say whether the High Commissioner may accept particular offices or not. It ought to-be laid down in the Bill PAIBS. whether or not such offices can be held. I think that when an officer gets a decent salary, he should keep himself clear of the offices covered by this clause, or offices of the character indicated by the honourable member for Corio. I feel disposed, to move the omission of the words, but I should first like to hear an explanation from the Minister.",78
602,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [12.57-a.m.] - The object of the clause is to prevent the High Commissioner from being on a number of syndicates, and, perhaps, using the position for the purpose of personal gain and advantage.",78
603,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,Does the honourable member think that the Minister should have the power to allow him to do that ?,78
604,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,No ; the object of the clause is to preventit.,78
605,Mr FRAZER,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,But the Minister could give permission.,78
606,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"There are certain corporations formed for literary or scientific purposes which may be to the advantage of Australia, and it may be desirable that the High Commissioner should take a position on the directorates or act as agent in some capacity or other. Before he left Australia he might have been a member of a literary corporation, and whilst in England he might want to act in the capacity of agent or representative of it, and perhaps do good work. Again it might be necessary for him to keep in touch with hisprivate business here for a certain time. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Coul d not all these matters be dealt with under the word "" prescribed "" ?",78
607,Mr GROOM,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"Sometime s it is hard to frame a regulation to meet all cases. The idea would be to frame such a regulation; but individual cases might arise where the High Commissioner would wish to continue in the office for a period. No Minister would ever give a general authority to the Commissioner to be a director for a number of financial or trading corporations. The idea is to have that amount of elasticity which is essential in the practical working of affairs. I think, speaking from memory, and subject to correction, that in connection with public servants we do not allow payments to be taken, but where a public officer acts as an executor we make an exception in the interests of the family and his own interest. The general intention of this provision is to prohibit the High Commissioner from taking paid positions. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [i.o a.m.] - I remember that one. State in the Commonwealth had a Minister who, - after he had reached almost every position, was sentenced to a term of years. Suppose that a man who was mixed up in everything came to be the Minister under this Bill, and found that it would be a good thing to have the High Commissioner to run the show, and so bring wealth to his syndicates? He might not tell his colleagues what he was doing. I want the High Commissioner to be put in the same position as an ambassador, because the time is coming when all the British dependencies will become separate nations within the Empire. I do not want the Minister to have, any power over this officer or the slightest possibility of collusion. Clause agreed to. Clauses 8 to TO agreed to. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [1.3 a.m.] - I move That the following sub-clause be added to clause 4 :(f) Shall be the repiesentative of the Commonwealth National Postal Banking System when established. God knows when it will be established.",79
608,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member has submitted .this provision as a new sub-clause, but it will have no meaning in the place where he desires it to be inserted. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then I will move it as* a new clause, - and take a test vote.",79
609,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF TORPEDO,"It would be much better if the honourable member raised the question at the report stage. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There is not a hope then, sir. Preamble and title agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment. House adjourned at 1.6 a.m. (Friday).",79
