1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. G. H. Mackay) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. CENSUS. PREVEUENCE TO RETURNED SOLDIERS..",12
2,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"This morning's Canberra Times reports that only returned .soldiers are to be permitted to sit for the examination of applicants for employment in connection with the compilation of the census. As a very large number of the young men of Australia, including many sons of returned soldiers, had not an opportunity, on account of their youth, of going to the war, aud because a tragic position exists in the monwealth Public Service as a result of the suspension of the recruitment of young men, I ask if the Government will sympathetically reconsider the matter, and throw open the examination to everyone who wishes to sit for it? M>. LYONS - The second half of the honourable member's question has no bearing upon the subject, because no .permanent appointments are to be made to the Public Service in connection with the taking of the census.. These appointments will be temporary only, and will terminate when the work has been completed. As to whether other than returned soldiers should be permitted to sit for the examination, I would remind the House that there will be perhaps thousands of applicants for a comparatively few appointments. It is the-policy of this Government, as it was of the last Government, to show preference to returned soldiers. That has been the policy of this country since the termination of the war. If the suggestion of the honourable member were adopted, many young persons, and some who are not young, would sit for the examination, at some inconvenience, and probably expense, to thsmselvcs, with no hope of obtaining an appointment, even though they qualified. In these circumstances, the Public Service Commissioner felt that it would be useless and unfair to [131 invite persons who are not returned soldiers to sit for the examination. Unfortunately, of the hundreds of returned soldiers who may apply for appointment, only a few have the prospect of obtaining a position.",12
3,Mr GANDER,Unknown,Has the Prime Minister issued instructions to Divisional Returning Officers that only returned soldiers shall be employed in the collection of the census?,12
4,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"So far as I have any knowledge, the only instructions that have been issued are those of the Public Service Commissioner in relation to the examination. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY. CRUISERS FROM GREAT BRITAIN.",12
5,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence whether it is true that Australia is to obtain three cruisers Comfrom the British Government. If it is, when these vessels arrive in Australia will they be manned by ratings from the Australian Navy or from the British Navy?",12
6,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"I assume that the honourable member refers to a statement that appears in the press today, which is pure ""kiteflying"". The Government's policy on defence will be announced by the Prime Minister when a definite decision upon the matter has been arrived at. OVERSEAS FREIGHTS.",12
7,Mr STACEY,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Commerce noticed an article that appeared in the press of Friday last, stating that the freight position is now clear, and that ample space is available for whatever apples and pears it may be desired to ship from Australia? Is he aware that since shipments started, the only extra freight space South Australia has received is space for 6,000 cases of apples, which, luckily, was transferred from Tasmania; that no provision has been made for'freight to Hamburg during March; and that there is no boat for Rotterdam; further, that the total pear space available to South Australia is for 5,620 cases, and that it has been possible to fulfil a contract in Hamburg only by transferring to that'city space for 7,000 cases which had been allotted to Hull? Is the Minister aware that the shipping companies have made no further provision, and have thus left South Australia in the position that it originally occupied ?",12
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member should be aware that he may not, when asking a question without notice, make statements to the House and then ask a Minister whether he is aware of the facts mentioned. The purpose of questions is to elicit information from Ministers, not to give it to them.",13
9,Mr STAGEY,Unknown,"Then I ask, will the Minister, if it is not too late, take steps immediately to see what can be done in this matter?",13
10,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Not having seen the press report, I was not aware of the facts to which the honourable member has drawn attention. The latest official information that I have regarding shipping space from Adelaide is that, by the chartering of additional vessels, the full requirements of South Australia had been met. In view of what the honourable member has said, I shall institute further investigations. IMPORTS. DUMPING PROVISIONS.",13
11,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs inform the House of the number of applications received from Australian manufacturers during the last twelve months under the provisions of the Industries Preservation Act, the reason given in support of them, and the action taken by his department upon them ?",13
12,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"I shall institute inquiries, and later make a statement upon the matter. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION IN PEDERAL CAPITA L TERRITORY.",13
13,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Is the Minister for the Interior yet in a position to inform the House what has become of the ordinance dealing with workmen's comGeneral pensation in the Federal Capital Territory ?  not answer the question offhand. I shall have investigations made, and at earliest moment .acquaint the honourable member with the position. POSTAL DEPARTMENT: MAIL BRANCH, SYDNEY. COST OF ANSWERING QUESTION.",13
14,Mr MCNICOLL,Unknown,"Is the Postmaster General able to give an estimate of the cost involved in obtaining the information asked for in the question on the notice-paper today relating to the mail branch, Sydney.",13
15,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,"As soon as I saw this question, I issued the instruction that an estimate of the cost which would be involved in obtaining the information sought, and the research thai would be necessary, should first be made. That aspect of the matter is being considered in conjunction with the inquiries that are being made, which seem to have been inspired. LOSS ON TELEGRAPH BUSINESS.",13
16,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"What steps does the Postmaster-General propose to take to prevent the continuance of the losses thai are occurring each year in connection with the working of the telegraph branch of his department, which, during the last five years, have exceeded Â£1,000,000?",13
17,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,"B y the adoption of a sound policy, which was not put into operation until the present Government came into power, the disabilities and losses that are now occurring are expected to be reduced or removed.",13
18,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"Has the honourable gentleman enlisted the aid of the Western Electric Company in his efforts to obtain the necessary "" sound "", so that the public may know what is being done?",13
19,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,"It is not my intention to employ any such artifice; I shall be content, with making a statement in this chamber. WIRELESS RELAY STATIONS.",13
20,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,Is the Postmasteryet in a position to make a statement with respect to the establishment of wireless relay stations in western New,13
21,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,I the expect to make a statement on this matter either next week or shortly thereafter. AIRCRAFT AT ROCKHAMPTON.,13
22,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Is it a fact that the Lone Moth aircraft now in the possession of the Rockhampton Aero Club is to be sent to Brisbane? If so, does the Assistant Minister for Defence consider that such action is in accordance with the avowed policy of the Government, which favours decentralization? Will his department reconsider the application made by the Rockhampton Aero Club to have this Moth aircraft repaired and left in .the possession of the club which has done so much to further aviation in Central Queensland?",14
23,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"The matter will be investigated, and the honourable member advised later when a decision has been arrived at. NA RELATIONS.",14
24,Dr MALONEY,BRITISHAND SOVIET,"In view of the dangerous state of affairs arising between the British Government and the Soviet Government of Russia, as reported in the press, will the Government, if the position becomes accentuated, consider whether it would be wise to refer the matter to the League of Nations in the hope that delay will remove the danger ?",14
25,Mr LATHAM,BRITISHAND SOVIET,"The Ministry has no information regarding the controversy between Great B r it a in and Russia to which the honourable member has referred, other than what has appeared in the press; but the Government would hesitate a long time before gratuitously interfering in such a matter. NA COMMUNICATIONS.",14
26,Mr GIBSON,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,Has any finality been reached between the Imperial Communications Company and Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited and the Government with regard to overseas communications?,14
27,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,OVERSEAS WIRELESS," That matter is not yet completed. Arrangements of which the Government has approved are under consideration. TARIFF BOARD REPORTS. Mr WHITE laid on the table reports and recommendations of the Tariff Board on the following subjects:Black Printing Ink. Copper Rivets and Washers. Vessels exceeding 500 tons, but not exceeding 1,000 tons gross register. Ordered to be printed. TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933). CUSTOMS TABIFF (1 9 3 2 ): SPECIAL DUTIES (No . 4 ) : PRIMAGE DUTIE S (No . 2) : CUSTOMS DUTIES (CANADIA N PREFERENCE, NO . 2) : CUSTOMS TABIF F AMENDMENT (NO . 1) : SPECIAL CUSTOMS DUTY (NO . 5 ) : EXCISE TABIF F AMENDMENT (NO . 3). In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from the 16th March (vide page 353), on motion by",14
28,Sir HENKY GULLETT,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"vide page 1167, Volume 135)1. That on and after the fourteenth day of October, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-two, at nine o'clock in the forenoon, reckoned according to standard time in the Territory for the Seat of Government, Duties of Customs at the rates respectively specified in the column of the schedule hereto headed ""British Preferential Tariff"" be imposed on goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom. . . . And on. motion by Mr WHITE (vide page 29)1. That the Schedule to the Customs Tariff Proposals introduced into the House of Representatives on the thirteenth day of October, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-two, be amended as hereunder set out. Group 1 - Items under which the rates are the same as those operating under the 1921-30 Tariff. DIVISION 1 - ALE , SPIRITS, AND BEVERAGES. It e m 2 (Ale and other beer, & c ) .",14
29,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.50] - This group covers 535 separate duties out of a total of 1,773, comprising the complete tariff. Numerically it is the largest in dividual group. The rates operating under the items included in this group are the same as those operating under the existing law-the 1921-30 tariff. The group does not include any of the Scullin Government's tariff amendments, with the exception of a minor amendment affecting timber, which was passed in 1930. This amendment had the effect of making the 1921-28 tariff the 1921-30 tariff. Were it not for the desire of the Government to enact a complete new tariff, instead of allowing traders and the department to work under the present patchwork tariff, these items would not have come up for discussion by the committee. I submit that honourable members should take a broad view of these duties, and pass the whole group as expeditiously as possible, instead of requiring a detailed explanation in connection with each item. I should be surprised to learn of any real opposition in the committee to the rates operating under the items in this group. The fact that the Opposition, when in office, left these duties intact, and also that the Acting Leader of the Country Party (Mi . Paterson) submitted a motion that, a reversion of the whole tariff to the 19211930 tariff level be made, would indicate to the committee as a whole that the rates incorporated in this schedule are reasonable.  rectly describe my motion.",14
30,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,It describes it. correctly in respect of the British items. The honourable member wanted them to revert to the level of the 1921-1930 tariff.  respect of which no report bad been made.,15
31,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Thos e items, and also others which have been reported upon by the Tariff Board are included in this group.  need not apply to individual items.",15
32,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,That is rather a c nibble. ,15
33,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"To be consistent, the honourable membermust support most of the items in this group. Of course, every item can be debated, but I do not think that is necessary.",15
34,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Swan) [10.52] - I certainly have grave objections to the whole of the items in this group being taken as a whole, more particularly as I wish to move an important amendment to item 3. My reason for requiring a discussion on these items is the fact that the Minister declared in effect that the statistics that I gave to this chamber were not correct. I pointed out in my second reading speech that an enormous quantity of {roods enter this country free of duty, mostly for the benefit"" of manufacturers, and, according to the Statistician's figures in respect of goods L that pay duty, the average duty has increased from '20 per cent, in 1919, to 77 per cent, today. The more we make this fact public, the more the people will realise it. When we work out the figures, talcing into consideration the fact that a large quantity of these goods enter Australia at low rates of duty, we are justified in asserting that the average rate of duty has increased to about 100 per cent. Yet some honourable members prate about the inadequacy of the protection. 1 Mr WHITE (Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.55],-The honourable member for .Swan has stated that I challenged certain figures which he submitted to the chamber. If my memory serves me correctly, I made no mention in my reply of the honourable member's speech except to say that it would be heartily approved by the late Mr. Cobden. The figures referred to by thÂ» honourable member for Swan were mentioned by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock), aud I think that, in my reply, I thoroughly refuted them. Item agreed to. Item 3, sub-item (F ) (v) Spirit of strength not less than 65 per cent, over proof, denatured, or to be denatured prior to delivery(2) N.E.I., as prescribed by departmental by-laws, per gallon - British , Is.: genera], Is.",15
35,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Swan) [10.56] -. ! move That the words "" departmental by-laws "" be omitted from paragraph 2 with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""regulations"". I hope that this amendment will be accepted by the Government. Thi3 Parliament should be jealous of its rights, and slow to give any body or person the power to impose taxation upon the people without its authority. Under our present system of allowing customs duties to be increased as prescribed by departmental by-law, doubtful concessions are able to be made. Tariff duties should be dealt with in such a.manner as to enable Parliament to give consideration to proposed alterations. The customs law of this country should be in exactly the same category as every other law. A Minister cannot by a by-law impose special income taxation, and the same position should apply in respect, of duties. At present traders do not know exactly where they stand in respect of the tariff. So soon as this Parliament passes acustoms law, the Minister for Trade and Customs may alter it. I contend that the power now given to the Minister should be exercised through the Executive Council. In Canada any necessary alterations of the tariff are made by the Governor General in Council, so that the responsibility for them rests with the vernment. It has often happened that, so soon a3 a trader imports goods, he finds that a new tariff classification has been issued which alters the whole aspect of his business. If my amendment is accepted, the Minister will place before Cabinet any regulations he wishes to have passed by the Governor General in Council. The regulations will be advertised in the Commonwealth Gazette, and every one interested will know what is happening. The extraordinary method of altering duties by departmental by-law leads to grave rumours, which sometimes unfairly besmirch the good name of a member of Parliament, or even of a Minister.",15
36,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,That may have happened in the past; but it is not possible now.,16
37,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,We read in the Sydney newspapers of persons having said that they have influence with the Minister.,16
38,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"No one has any such influence with me. Mr GREGOR5T - I am not suggesting that the Minister is likely to lend himself to corruption, but I want to place tariff-making above suspicion. The present method of altering the tariff is likely to disorganize business. I remember how some honourable members in this chamber opposed the imposition of embargoes by regulation, and the fight was particularly keen in another place. There was a stern fight in connection with the sugar embargo. Under an earlier tariff schedule, manures entered this country free from duty, but, later, sulphate of ammonia was classified as a chemical, and made subject to a duty. In 1927, some fertilizers entered this country free, but as a result of - the influence brought to bear on him, the then Minister issued a classification which included fertilizers under the heading of chemicals, and they, therefore, became dutiable. That action was taken without the authority of Parliament; indeed, it was taken-in direct opposition to the expressed will of Parliament.",16
39,The CHAIRMAN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,^The honourable member may deal only with the item before the Chair.,16
40,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Ha d that change Go- been made by regulation, this Parliament would have been in a position to deal with it.",16
41,Mr FORDE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,To what by-law does the honourable member refer?,16
42,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"I am referring to one issued in 1926, when the then Minis* ter for Trade and Customs included fertilizers under the heading of chemicals. Another instance arose in connection with wine csshs. The casks in which Australian wine was exported to England dcost so much to manufacture that the exporters of wine decided to bring them back to Australia for further use, but by a departmental by-law they were made liable to a duty of Â£3 9s. Id. on re-entering this country. Prior to 1928, crude oil was admitted duty free, but under a departmental by-law",16
43,The CHAIRMAN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,The honourable member must confine his remarks to the amendment as it affects the item before the Chair.,16
44,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,There is already before this chamber a. bill to amend the Customs Act in practically the way in. which I now suggest.,16
45,The CHAIRMAN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"When that bill is before us, the honourable member should deal with the matter he now desires to bring before the committee. He may not do so at this juncture. Honourable members interjecting,",16
46,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,I know that' my remarks are unpalatable to some honourable members.,16
47,The CHAIRMAN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,Order ! The honourable member's remark is not in' order.,16
48,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"I was referring to those honourable members who were interjecting. I understand that interjections are disorderly, and I am surprised at the Chair allowing them.",16
49,The CHAIRMAN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Order ! The honourable member's remarks are a distinct reflection on the Chair and are Uierefore disorderly. He must either confine his remarks to the question before viae, committee or resume his seat.",16
50,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"In Canada these things are done by the Governor General in Council, which means the Executive, not by the Minister. It would be to the advantage of traders if these things were done by regulation, because then a member of either House of Parliament could move for their disallowance. That is what I am asking for. I am convinced that if that were done we should hear no more of the rumours which are current in the country.  - I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory) and I agree with him that these things should be done by regulation rather than by departmental by-law, for then Parliament would be in a position to express its views on these matters. In * supporting the amendment I cannot do better than quote a few sentences from an admirable speech which the present  livered i u this chamber in May, 1931. Dealing with the very point which has been raised today, the honourable gentleman said I submit that nobody in this country should have that power that is now exercised by the Minister for Trade and Customs, who, without referring to Parliament at all, can introduce embargoes on imports, and, at his own sweet will, can make one man wealthy. and ruin another. That is a power greater than was possessed by the Czar of Russia, or is assumed by the Soviet Government. I point odt that the power is inherent one member of the Government to say huge business organization, behind the back of this Parliament, ""You can bring in,Â£50,000 worth of your products this year, and nobody else can "". He can also say to a British manuthe Chair. facturer, "" I will not permit you to do it "" , and there the matter must end. extraordinary power should not be wielded any man. I agree with what the honourable gentleHansard man said <Ju that occasion. tinuedThe phrase "" as prescribed by departmental by-laws "" occurs 108 times in these schedules. The general effect is that many articles can admitted at reduced duties, if this course approved by the Minister or his officers. object in unmeasured terms to government by regulation and government by officers of the w Customs Department. I am not reflecting civil servants as a body; in fact, for them. I have the highest regard, but I am protesting against the principle of government by regulations and administration not by a Minister, but perhaps by some - inconsequential minor official in the Trade and Customs Department. To an interjection by the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde)The present system has been in operation ever since we have had tariffs The honourable member for Warringah repliedThe Minister does not deny that the system of which 1 complain is in operation now; his defence is that it has been operating for a long time. That does not dispose of my grave objection to government in that way. The Postmaster-General stated my view of the case admirably. I feel that I am right in assuming that the honourable gentleman is entitled to some of the credit for the new free list connected with item 174. I feel confident that he, because of his strong views on this subject of government by regulation, must have been the moving spirit in the Government in making amendments by which a great number of items which previously could enter only subject to departmental by-laws have been made free. If I am correct in my assumption, I congratulate the honourable member, even as I congratulate him on the speech from which I have quoted. I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs will accept the amendment.  support the amendment, because it is so reasonable. The extracts from a speech  h ill ) , which have just been read, must in have given the honourable gentleman a to a foretaste of the day of judgment.",17
51,The CHAIRMAN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"The honourable member must deal with the item before  by member for Warringah said nearly two years ago is written in the book of for all to read. If the honorHe conable member is consistent, he will vote for the amendment. When in Opposition he, and other honourable gentlemen now sitting on the Government benches, exbe pressed views similar to those which have is been expressed today in support of the I amendment. I hope that the amendment ill be carried, that it will apply throughon out 'the schedule, and not only to this item. It is not right that any one man should be given the power to override the will of Parliament. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [11.13] - I also support the amendment. - Many of the decisions given by departmental officers under this power have penalized the industries of this eountry. Unfortunately, I am debarred by a ruling of the Chair from giving instances in support of the contention of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory). Departmental officers, having no practical knowledge of certain industries, sometimes give rulings which amount to gross injustice.",17
52,Mr FENTON,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Maribyrnong) [11.14]. - I hope that the Minister will not accept the amendment. The statement that the control of the tariff is taken out of the hands of Parliament is absurd, because the Minister is always subject to the control of Parliament. At any time it is competent for any member to move the adjournment of the House to discuss any ministerial action.",18
53,Mr CAMERON,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,It may then be too late.,18
54,Mr FENTON,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"If we do these things by regulation, there will be chaos in the Customs Department. I believe in conserving the rights of Parliament and of its members. Those rights are not interfered with by allowing these things to be done by departmental by-law. I hope that the Minister will not accept the amendment, but will retain to the Customs Department the right to administer the law in respect of these items. This has been the practice for a great many years, and very few mistakes have been made.",18
55,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.16] - I cannot accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory); it would limit unduly the power of the Minister. No Minister would wish to be vested with this responsibility if he could pass it on to some else. I remind the committee that, in my speech when introducing the schedule, I informed honourable members that it contained 387 new items, prescribing duties which, formerly, were dealt with under departmental by-laws. The honourable member for Swan, as one of the oldest members of this Parliament, must know that, every week, goods are admitted under departmental by-laws, the practice being to inform wholesale houses, Chambers of Manufactures and - Chambers of . Commerce. As the fullest information is published in the press in respect of any such contemplated action, it is wide of the truth to suggest that anything is done surreptitiously. For this reason I am surprised that the honourable member should have conveyed that impression to the committee. The course indicated by the amendment was tried by the Tariff Board some years ago, and, in. 99.9 per cent, of cases the board's decision was in accord with departmental rulings. The fullest inquiries are made before any goods are admitted under by-law. Practically every member of the Country party has made application for the entry of some classes of machinery in this way, and I may add that the department gives the most sympathetic conskleration to all such applications.  done by regulation.",18
56,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"No . Very soon Parliament will go into recess for a few weeks. During that time the honourable  may be requested by some of his constituents to apply for the entry,. under departmental by-law, of certain machinery required in the dairying industry. If this had to be provided for by regulation, it would be necessary to lay the regulation before Parliament, and this would involve delay.  immediately on the re-assembling of either House.",18
57,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"But Parliament might be in recess for some months. Meantime, the required machinery would remain in bond, and bond charges would be accumulating. The complaint voiced this morning is simply'one of those time-honoured grievances which we hear whenever the. one. tariff is under discussion, and, as the question involved is one of principle, affecting customs administration since the imposition of the first tariff, the Government cannot accept the amendment.  -- L should not have risen a second time in the discussion on this item, but for the statement just made by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White). The honourable gentleman appears to be under the impression that to provide for admission by regulation would involve delay, and would not be so advantageous as the system of providing for admission under departmental by-law. I remind him that, even if Parliament were not in session, any regulation made would be gazetted immediately, and would have the force of law until the re-assembly of Parliament, when an opportunity would be presented for either House to disallow it. Actually, there would be no delay. The ouly difference between the two methods of customs administration is this: The decision to admit goods under departmental by-law rests with the Minister, whereas an admission by regulation would require the concurrence of three Ministers in the Executive Council, and, as I have just observed, when Parliament re-assembles, all regulations come before it for review. The argument put forward by the Minister is not at all convincing, and, I suggest that, if the Government rests its case for the continuance of the practice of admitting n.e.i. items 'under departmental by-laws, upon the honourable gentleman's defence, it has no case at all.",18
58,Mr SCULLIN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Yarra) [11.24] - If the position were exactly as the honourable  has stated it, there would not be much room for argument as to the merit of the course indicated by the amendment. But there are more difficulties than were mentioned by the honourable gentleman. In the first place, he must admit that the power of a departmental by-law is limited to the admission of goods; a by-law does not give authority to increase duties. It could only operate to increase the duties in cases where it was withdrawn after the admission of goods, so the complaint by members of the Country party who, by the way, are always seeking the admission, under by-law, of certain classes of goods, really comes from the wrong quarter. I could understand a high protectionist being fearful of the consequences of admission of goods by departmental by-law, but the history of customs administration should re-assure us; obviously, none of those things that have been suggested are ever likely to happen, because no Minister would dare so to misuse his powers. I come now to the difference between the admission of goods by regulation and admission under departmental by-law. The honourable member for Gippsland has himself shown that regulations require the concurrence of three Ministers in Cabinet and the Governor General, and any one who has been a member of a Cabinet knows perfectly well that important decisions affecting Government policy are not reached without full Cabinet consultation. So that no Minister for Customs would ever take upon himself the responsibility of doing, under departmental by-law, whai would not be done by regulation. That, I think, answers the objection ofrthe honourable member for Gippsland. The Minister has just explained the reason for the retention, by the Government, of the existing practice. Apparently, mem-, bers of the Country party attach no importance to it. The Minister stated that if, while Parliament was in recess, application were made for admission of certain machinery under departmental by-law, it could be done at once. But I do not agree that admission under regulation would necessarily cause delay, because, regulations can be gazetted immediately, and have the force of law. But this is the point: If the Government gazetted a regulation while Parliament was in recess, and under it, admitted certain goods at rates below those prescribed in the schedule, and if Parliament subsequently disallowed the regulation, how would the revenue be collected ? That, I think, is the whole crux of the argument. The department would not dare, while Parliament was in recess, to frame a the regulation to admit goods if there was a prospect of its disallowance by Parliament. The departmental officers would then be in trouble; they would be breaking the law by not collecting the revenue.",19
59,Mr NAIRN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"In submitting a regulation to Cabinet, they would not be breaking the law.",19
60,Mr SCULLIN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Yes ; because , customs duties would not be collected on the goods so admitted.",19
61,Mr NAIRN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,But Customs officials must obey a regulation.,19
62,Mr SCULLIN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Yes , and they must also obey Parliament.  in admitting goods under departmental by-laws, might be doing something of which Parliament would not approve. Mr Scullin"" - In that case, Parliament would express its opinion, and if it was against the Minister, he must bow to the will of Parjiament, or get out. But in that ease, there would be no repercussion due to the failure to collect the duties, because the duties would be collectable during the time when the by-law was operative. The position would be entirely different under the method of admitting by regulation. I suggest that, to argue that sion under departmental by-laws is equivalent to taking power out of the hands of the Parliament, is so much special pleading, because Parliament has specifically placed this power in the hands of the Minister for Customs, because of the special difficulty of speci-: tying, in the schedule, the duties on certain classes of goods. I , therefore, suggest to our friends in the corner that no Government would take the risk of acting under regulations, because Ministers would not know that, upon the reassembling of Parliament, there would not be a majorit y against them.",20
63,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"And under the regulation method, the actual payments would have to be higher. Mr Scullin"" - That is so, because, as the Minister has explained, goods subject to admission by regulation might be kept in bond until Parliament reassembled because of the fear on the part of the Government that the regulation might be disallowed. I do not very much like placing so much power in the hands of the Minister, but, after all, we have given the same discretion to the Commissioner of Taxation, and no great harm has been done. To some extent, and because of the special difficulties mentioned, the powers given are absolute, but if they are mis-used, Parliament may apply the remedy.",20
64,Mr NAIRN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Perth) [11.27] - I should like the committee to consider the difference between legislating in this matter by means of regulation and ' by means of departmental by-laws. Admission of goods under departmental by-laws prevents Parliament from exercising its authority. If the schedule is passed in its present form, the Minister for Trade and Customs for the time being will have the authority of Parliament to legislate in respect of all n.e.i. items; the only remedy being to ask the Hisdi Court to declare a by-law ultra vires. In the case of goods admitted in this way, Parliament parts entirely with its authority to review the Ministry's decision. But where goods are admitted under departmental regulations, the position is entirely different, because the regulations made by Cabinet come, in due time, before Parliament for review, and Parliament may disallow them within admis- fourteen days. If parliamentary action is not taken, the regulations become the law. W it h regard to the officers, it is not correct to say that they would be taking any risk in administering the customs duties by regulation, because the making of regulations would be the act, not of an official, but of the Government, and the first duty of an officer is to carry out the regulations. Therefore, he would be taking no risk even if , subsequently, regulations were disallowed by Parliament. This obligation'on officers to carry out regulations is inconsistent with the provisions of the Customs Act. For many years customs duties have been collected in anticipation of parliamentary sanction. Nominally a person is entitled to disregard duties which have been so imposed, because duties have no legislative force until passed by Parliament. The Scullin duties, under which millions of pounds have been collected, had, for months, no legislative authority behind them.",20
65,Mr SCULUK,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Yes , they had. . The Customs Act makes duties operative from the time the schedule is laid on the table.",20
66,Mr NAIRN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"But the matter has not been finally dealt .with, and they have no real legislative backing, u n t i l ratified by Parliament. Of course, the public know that there will be no refund of duties, because Parliament can always validate any collections that have been - made. It should be so arranged that alterations in the schedule made from time to time should come before Parliament for revision immediately it meets.",20
67,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Darling Downs) [11.33] - I cannot see my way to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory). The honourable member is confusing legislative with administrative power. The Customs Act gives authority for the inaking of regulations, which are usually framed to give effect to the general purposes of the act, or to lay down a general rule. Section 270 of the act defines the authority of the Executive to make regulations as follows: The Governor General may make regulations not inconsistent with this act prescribing matters which by this act are required mitted to be prescribed or as may be necessary or convenient to be prescribed for giving effect to this act or for the conduct of any business relating to the customs.",21
68,Mr GIBSON,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"In that definition, does the word ""regulation "" include by-law? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - No . substituted The. scheme of an act lays down the general principles of the measure, and regulations may be subsequently made ""to give effect to the intention of the act. Parliament should watch regulations very carefully. The important things should be laid down in the act, and regulations should be framed only to cover minor applicant. matters. A by-law is different; the authority for it is in the Tariff Act. the Trade and Customs Department, officers are constantly faced with probthat lems of administration. The honourable member said that classifications ought be dealt with by regulation, but that not practicable. By the classification goods it is decided whether they come under the heading of one item or another. That 'is a matter of law to be determined by the Attorney-General or, if his sion is disputed, to be determined by decision of the High Court. admissions of goods under by-laws are usually sought when a remission of duty is asked for. Frequently I have brought before me applications for the admission of dairying machinery of one kind and another, and the applications have been granted by the Minister. We should remember that, in effect, the laws confer the power to relieve, not to impose a tax. Parliament is careful to reserve to itself the power to impose tion, but it would be impossible to cover by regulation every conceivable instance s in which relief might be afforded to the importer. I should be very loath to depart from a practice which has worked so well in the past. This power has been exercised most carefully by the Trade and Customs Department. When an application is made for a remission of duty, a careful investigation is made throughout the Commonwealth to determine whether the admission of the goods forming the subject of the application would be likely to injure Australian manufacturers. The court recognizes that, as soon as tariff resolutions are tabled, the duties all must be collected. The matter has been or perbefore the High Court.",21
69,Mr NALKN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"The duties must be ratified during the currency of the session in which they are tabled. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - Some times a session lasts three years. If we regulations for by-laws, goods which formed the subject of an application for a remission of duty would either have to remain in bond until the matter had been finally dealt with, perhaps six months' later, or released upon an undertaking being given that duty would be paid if the decision went against the What is the reason for the proposed In change? So far as I can see, the honour the able member for Swan merely desires the regulations shall receive publicity. Do honourable members think that to any more publicity will be accorded to is regulations than is now given to byof laws ? I am informed that the by-laws are published in the Gazette, and circulated in the same way as regulations would be. Therefore, they receive all the publicity decipossible, short of being published a in the press. The power conferred on These customs officials to administer by-laws has not been abused. All the honourable member has been able to say is that such had power may be abused. The Minister for Customs, as the head of the department, is responsible for every act of administration in his department, and he may be challenged upon anything that byis done. The Minister is naturally jealous of the reputation of his officers, and stands by them so far as he is able. taxaThe Customs Department has a very fine record, equal to that of any similar department throughout the Empire. The capacity of its officers is high, and any one who has come into contact with them must be convinced of their impartiality and justice. It is important, as I have pointed out, to recognize the difference between legislation and administration. The work of Parliament is to lay down the law, to make general rules, to prescribe' conditions, to impose duties, and exercise certain powers, but when it comes to carrying out the law, some discretion must be left to the Minister. At the same time, I think that the Minister was right in obtaining legislative sanction for certain by-laws which have come to be recognized as permanent in character. This matter came before the Tariff Board several years ago, and was inquired into fully. When by-laws come to be recognized as permanent, they should - be incorporated in a statute.",21
70,Mr WHITE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"It is provided in Ottawa agreement that this shall be done, as far as possible. Sir LITTLETON"" GROOM - We now have the accumulated experience of many years to guide us. We know that the articles covered by certain by-laws are not likely to be manufactured in Australia, and it is well that manufacturers overseas should know just how they stand in regard to the tariff.",22
71,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Swan) [11.43] - If the honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom) were to read item 3 of the tariff, he would see that a regulation would cover the matter very much better than any departmental by-law. A regulation would be more complete, and would make it clear to traders what is the attitude of Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) expressed a fear that if regulations were substituted for by-laws, the department might find itself in the position of having to refund duties collected on goods if the regulations were subsequently disallowed by Parliament. The right honourable member must know, however, that in every instance in which a tariff has been imposed, and subsequently altered,- the alteration has been made effective only from the date upon which it was made. Parliament would be able to ensure that, the revenue was protected, and that no injustice was done, either to importers or to departmental officials. The honourable member for Darling Downs seems to think that by-laws receive all the publicity that is required, but I question whether half a dozen members of x'aruament have even seen the weekly notices issued by the Customs Department. Members of this Parliament, and the people generally, should be well informed of the changes that take place from timeto time in customs duties.",22
72,Sir LITTLETON GBOOM,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,That could be done straight away by administrative ftct,22
73,Mr GREGORY,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Possibl y so - Copies of regulations are sent to' every honourable member, and he may move for their disallowance, or propose any amendment; but departmental by-laws may be brought into operation without the Parliament having any voice in the matter. I could mention instances in which injustice has the been done; and many hundreds of thousands of pounds have been lost to the Commonwealth in revenue owing to tariff alterations made under ministerial or departmental direction. I have claimed for years that Parliament should have sole control of the taxation of the people. We should not permit a Minister to alter duties in a mandatory manner.",22
74,Mr NAIRN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Perth) [11.47] - We are discussing the wisdom of Parliament delegating its power to pass legislation. The honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom) has suggested the strongest reason why tariff alterations should be made by regulation rather than by by-law. When they are made by by-law the new duties operate immediately. But, when made by regulation, they operate only provided that they are not disallowed by either House of the Parliament withina certain time of being laid on the table. Of late years, governments have found it convenient to bring about parliamentary recesses by moving the adjournment of each House to a period to be subsequently fixed, instead of getting a prorogation. Thus we have had a continuous session extending over more than twelve months. One effect of this change in our procedure is to extend the time during which a tariff schedule can operate without parliamentary sanction. Many honourable members who in the last Parliament sat on the other side of the chamber, but are now ministerial supporters, we're loud in their protestations against this. Several of the present Ministers objected that, because of this lengthening of the sessions, alterations in duties were allowed to operate so long that ultimately vested interests were created under them, and it then became difficult for Parliament to interfere. Thus, during the term of office of the Scullin Government, its tariff was in operation for two years without, the Parliament being given the opportunity to say whether it should be the tariff of the country, or not. Mr - SCULLIN - That is not quite correct. A government must command a majority in the House of Representatives in support of its proposals.",22
75,Mr NAIRN,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"But a tariff must be passed by both branches of the legislature, and it is extremely doubtful whether the Scullin tariff would have been approved by the Senate if that body had had an opportunity to deal with it in ordinary circumstances. If the policy of legislation by regulation were adopted in cases like the item under discussion, tariff alterations would have to come under the notice of the Parliament, and a motion for the disallowance of any regulation could be submitted in either chamber.

FORDE (Capricornia) [11.55] Will the Minister give the committee an idea whether,- in the negotiations with New Zealand, anything will be done that, might lead to an alteration of the duties on butter and cheese. The party to which I belong stands for the adequate protection of both primary and Secondary industries, and one of the largest labour-employing industries in Australia today is the dairying industry. The Assistant Minister, Senator Greene, is about to leave for New Zealand, and, no doubt, representations will be made to him in favour of the removal of the duty on Now Zealand butter entering Australia. At the present time, the Australian dairy farmers are getting a lower price for their butter than at any other period during the last 30 years. It has been said by the Minister that since the signing of the Ottawa agreement, and the proposed restriction of imports of Australian butter into the United Kingdom, the price of butter on the London market .has been increased.",23
76,Mr FRANCIS,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"Ne w Zealand and foreign butter, but not Australian.",23
77,Mr FORDE,OVERSEAS WIRELESS,"The Canberra Times recently published the following message from London:Notwithstanding the announcement that Australia and New Zea.la.nd intend to restrict exports, butter prices continue to fall. The present value of choicest Australian and New Zealand butter (salted) is 80s., the lowest for more than 30 years. That paragraph clearly shows that the industry in Australia is now in a perilous position. Great hopes were held out that, as the result of the Ottawa agreement, there would be a substantial in crease in the price received by Australian dairymen for their butter; but as the result of the Minister's visit to New Zealand, their protection may be whittled down. Since my party has been criticized by certain sections of the (C ) , and primary producers because it stands for high protection for the secondary in dustries, I point out that we desire also TURES TlIEBEOF. to give adequate protection to the primary industries. The New South Wales Farmer and. Settler, published an article on the 9th of this month beginning as follows:NA AND GROCERIES. OTTAWA A PRACTICAL MEANING. OTTAWA A BACK NUMBER. Since the Ottawa agreement was put into operation, no country's butter has been harder hit by the falling market than Australian and New Zealand. Was this the purpose of Ottawa? . . . If the butter trade in London had played the game, and had supported Empire sentiment .to the same extent as the average English householder, dominion butter would occupy a leading position, as regards price, on the British market today. There is something sinister behind the whole business, a.nd it is becoming increasingly evident that a determined effort has been made to circumvent the growing movement of "" trade within the Empire."" Wires are being pulled to restrict Great Britain's imports of butter, and aided spineless British politicians, and the disinterestedness of our representative, Mr Bruce, pressure is likely to be brought to bear to bring about the restrictions. If the Federal Government agrees, it will be deserving of strong criticism, and will have shown that it is not concerned with the prosperity of the great wealth-producing dairy industry. What has Britain to gain by shielding the dairying industry of foreign countries? There seems to me a desire to restrict the imports of butter from the dominions; but I contend that any restrictions imposed by the Motherland should be placed upon foreign countries. A prominent Sydney business man, who recently returned from a world tour",23
78,The CHAIRMAN,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,The subject of the restriction of butter imports into Britain seems to me foreign to the tariff.,24
79,Mr FORDE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"We know that a representative of the Commonwealth Government is about to proceed to New Zealand, where requests are repeatedly made for the wiping out of the duty that we have imposed on butter from that dominion. I have drawn attention to the fact that our dairymen are now receiving prices lower than they have been getting for the last 30 years. Attempts are being made to restrict the exports of an industry that has contributed, in a great degree, to the closer settlement of this country, and to the placing of ex-soldiers on the land. Men have been assisted to take up dairying land through the agricultural banks, and if, because of importations from sister dominions, they are deprived of their home market, the Paterson butter scheme will break down. I fear also that a decision may be come to before honourable members are given an opportunity to debate the subject. I do not propose to move an amendment, but I ask for information. I represent one of the largest dairying districts in Australia, and am solicitous for the welfare of the dairymen generally. I want some assurance from the Minister that adequate protection will be granted to these primary producers. If the degree of protection that they at present enjoy is reduced, the Paterson scheme may break down, and additional burdens may be placed upon our producers. The price of butter is lower today than it has been for twenty years. According to figures published in January by the Empire Marketing Board, Australian butter was by selling in London at that time for from 80s. to 82s. per cwt., which is a drop of from 22s. to 2-4s. per cwt. from the prices ruling last October. There was a difference of 18s. per cwt. between the price of Australian and Argentine butter in October, but the margin now is only 2s. per cwt. The following table shows how the price of butter has varied, recently:Jan. 1033. Sept. 1982. Australian 80s. to 82s. .. 104s. to 108s. New Zealand 81s.

80,Mr RILEY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Cook) [12.3] - I also would like some information from the : Government respecting the negotiations that have been set on foot for a new trade agreement between Australia and New Zeala'nd. Is anything that Senator Massy Greene is likely to do liable to affect the welfare of our'dairymen? This Government and its supporters have a very high opinion of the ability of the members of . the Tariff Board. I desire to know, therefore, whether this whole subject will be referred to the Tariff Board for report before a decision is reached? We have been told by honourable members opposite that the members of the board are infallible, and expert in all industries, including the, pastoral, agricultural and dairying industries. One member of the board has been associated with a firm of importers, but yet he is an expert; another was a railways commissioner, and he also is an expert in primary and secondary industries. I , therefore, ask the Minister to say definitely whether the details of any proposed agreement with the New Zealand Government will be referred to the board for inquiry and report.",24
81,Mr FRANCIS,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Moreton-Assistant Minister) [12.4] - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) aud the honourable member for Cook. (Mr Riley) know very well that it is the policy of this Government to refer all tariff questions to the Tariff Board before submitting them to Parliament. The honourable gentlemen need have no anxiety about anything that Senator Massy Greene may do in New Zealand. Probably no honourable member of this Parliament has a better knowledge of the dairying industry than Senator Massy Greene; I am sure that the producers of Australia in general and the dairymen in particular, will have the profoundest confidence in the honourable senator, who has gone from Australia to New Zealand to negotiate the proposed new trade agreement, for throughout his public career he has shown every sympathy with this industry, and done everything in his power to protect those engaged in it.",24
82,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.5] - In view of the fact that the butter industry was thoroughly discussed a few days ago, I do not think it necessary to say very much about it at present. I have given a good deal of attention to our trade agreement with New Zealand,, and know that there are many anomalies in connection with it, one of which relates to the tobacco duty. But I think honourable members are quite able to vote on this item without dealing at any greater length with the marketing of our butter. Sub-items agreed to.

83,Mr FORDE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Capricornia) [12.7],- I direct' attention to the item citrus fruits. This is one of the items in respect of. which the Scullin Government prohibited importations on the ground that we could produce in this country all the citrus fruit that we reqiiired. We are now faced with the spectacle that, although returned soldiers were assisted by every State Government in Australia to engage in the production of citrus fruits, this Government has lifted the prohibition imposed by the Scullin Government, and it now imposes only an inadequate duty on imported citrus fruits. I understand that it is also proposed to allow citrus fruits from New Zealand to come into Australia. Although it is true that we have been able to build up an export trade in citrus fruits during the last few years it has not yet been possible to lift the whole of the pack from the Australian market. A statement issued recently by the Department of Commerce, shows that the export of citrus fruits from Australia increased from 39,850 centals in 1929-30 to 117,000 centals in 1930-31, and to 181,500 centals in 1931-32. It was pointed out that New Zealand was our best customer for citrus fruits, and provided a ready market for Australian lemons and oranges. With oranges a gratifying expansion has taken place also in our trade with other countries. Shipments of Australian oranges to New Zealand increased from 29,500 centals in 1929-30 to 81,511 centals in 1930-31. But the action taken by the New Zealand Government has practically deprived the Australian citrus-growers of that market. Does the Government propose to do anything in that regard? It cannot be said that the policy of the Scullin Government is responsible for what the New Zealand Government is doing, because the Scullin Government did not interfere with the duties on New Zealand goods. Thousands of citrus-growers all over Australia, as well as many in my own electorate, are very much concerned about the removal of the Scullin embargo. In support of this statement. I quote the following report which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on the 3rd October, 1932:Windsor, Saturday. At n large meeting of the Oakville Branch of the 'Fruit growers Federation, the Federal Government was severely criticized. A protest was entered against the lift in g of the embargo by the Federal Government on imported citrus f r u it . It was maintained that the Government was selling its country in order that a few big commercial concerns could benefit by importing foreign fruits. The citrus-growers are an important section of our producing community. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Gardner) had to face an irate group of citrus-growers at Gosford not long ago, and he knows how strongly they feel on this subject. Probably no other honourable members wish to take the part of these producers, but I feel it necessary to strike a note of warning to the Government, and to inform it that this industry needs help. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, I imposed prohibitions for the benefit of the primary producers on the importation of glucose. cheese, eggs, lemons and oranges, dried fruits, except dates and figs, fruits preserved in liquid, vegetables salted or preserved in liquid or partly preserved or pulned, corn flour, jams and jellies, lard and edible fats, meats preserved in tins and other air-tight containers, pork, milk dried or in powder form, malted milk, peanut butter, onions and canary seed. It was said at that time that the adoption of this nolicv would ruin the producers and impair the financial stability of the country; but these doleful forecasts were not realized. All these prohibitions were removed by the present Government. This party, however, still stands for adequate protection for our primary and secondary industries, and we believe that the protection which the Government is now proposing for the citrus fruit industry is insufficient. In 1927-28, 846,900 lb. 'of lemons and 595,900 of oranges were imported into Australia. We felt that this v/as not in the best interests of our citrus industry. I sincerely trust that the policy of this Government will not cause a recurrence of imports of this nature.",25
84,Mr NOCK,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"-Riverina) [12.14] - In reference to the statement made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde-), I would point out that representations have been made to me by the citrus fruit growers on the irrigation areas in my electorate to the effect that they are opposed to all embargoes and, of course, to the New Zealand embargo. Their request is that all embargoes shall be removed. They believe that if this policy is adopted they will be able to duce economically, and to compete against the producers of other countries.",26
85,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.15] - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) must be aware that one of the principal reasons for the visit of the Assistant Minister (Senator Greene) to New Zealand is to endeavour to effect a more satisfactory reciprocal trade arrangement between the sister dominion and Australia. The honourable gentleman must also know that the prohibition of citrus fruits was a financial measure, and bad nothing to do with the tariff. That has been explained many times in this chamber by his leader, and it was on that basis that the arrangement had the support of honourable members on this side, who were then in opposition. The whole subject is now before the Tariff Board for. consideration, and its report should soon be before the Government. That the Government has the interests of the citrus-growers in mind is plainly demonstrated by the trouble and expense to which it has gone in sending the Assistant Minister to New Zealand , to promote better trade relations in this respect.",26
86,Mr GARDNER,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Robertson) [12.17] I am pleased with the information the Minister has imparted to the committee. It was on my representation that the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Sir Henry Gullett) referred this matter to the Tariff Board. Unfortunately, I was not in the chamber when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) spoke on the item. I understand that he referred to some allegedly irate meeting that was held in my electorate. I assure him that I can handle all such matters myself. For his information, I may say that I attended a meeting, and placed the position before the growers, who were so satisfied that they indicated confidence in my efforts. I am prepared to admit that the action of the Government in prohibiting generally the importation of citrus fruits was helpful to growers, and that they were perturbed when it tvas removed. However, when I went before the electors of Robertson during the last election campaign, I espoused the policy of the Government, which pro- was definitely opposed to embargoes of any description, and, eventhough I was most anxious to assist growers, it was not possible for me to reverse my - attitude. Recently, in Sydney, I introduced a deputation to the Attorney General (Mr Latham), in the absence of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons). Temporarily, our trade relations with New Zealand are troubled because the sister dominion has refused to admit our citrus fruits, on the general ground of the danger of the introduction of diseases. The committee' must be pleased with the action of the Government in sending the Assistant Minister to New Zealand, to deal with trade matters generally, and, principally, to ndjn.Â«* the trouble. As au indication of my close association with head-quarters, 1 might mention that I have just received certain information .from the industry, as repreof sented by the Fruit growers Federation New South Wales, which I have passed on to the Prime Minister, as it will Senator Greene in the coming deliberations. I hope that the Australian citrus industry will receive every consideration and advantage from that conference. Sub-items agreed to. Item 55 agreed to.. item 56, sub-items (A ) to (D (Ginger).",26
87,Mr FORDE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Capricornia) [12.20] I should like the Minister for Trade Customs (Mr White) to give me a protesting mise that the position of the Australian ginger industry will be referred to the Tariff Board, and the industry afforded protection. The matter was put before the boa'rd in 1931, and the outcome a recommendation that, the existing duty should not be increased. There are 100 growers at present engaged in the in industry at Buderim Mountain, in of Queensland. Obviously, that number will approximately Â£53 a ton. be increased steadily. In these times, when there is a general urge to settle people on the land, we should do we can to advance what will be quite worth-while industry,- and give some encouragement to the enterprising sons now engaged in it.

92,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,It will be presented very soon.,28
93,Mr FENTON,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Maribyrnong) [12.27]. - In view of the Minister's statement 7 the report of the Tariff Board on matches has not yet been presented, would it not. be advisable to postpone consideration the item until honourable members possession of the report? recollected that, only a little while the Australian match industry was placed in an unenviable position as a result a considerable reduction in the rates duty on matches. The Government advocates that Parliament should conCommonwealth sider and, if possible, act in accordance with the recommendations of the Tariff Board. In the circumstances, I suggest that it would be unwise to proceed with the item without being in possession the board's report on the subject?",28
94,Dr MALONEY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Melbourne) [12.28]. - I contend that there should be a conthe siderable increase in the duty In a few remarks, I shall demonstrate to honourable members how difficult it is trade with Japan and hope to receive fair play. I do not accuse that country of not keeping agreements, but. I shall show bow "" slim "" its people are in their transactions with customers. In the 1902, Japan manufactured 328,806"",090 gross of matches at a cost of 8,608,571 yen. Beckoning the yen at 2s - actuall the value at that time was 2s. 0-|d - thi works out at a trifle overfive-eighthsof Id. per gross. I contend that workers the British match industry were sweated Proposals (1932-1933). 377 in being compelled to make boxes alone at the rate of 2^d. a gross, and find their the o'.vn paste. The Japanese were able to make the boxes, fill them with matches, and export them atfive-eighthsof a penny a gross. Of what avail is a duty of 2s. a gross against competition of that character? The facts I have mentioned translated to me first by the Consul in General of Japan, and subsequently checked 'by the Warden of the Melbourne University and by myself. The letters of that great English philosopher, Herbert Spencer, show that when Japan sought his advice as to how it could best avoid quarrelling with the white nations, advised that country to be careful of foreign missionaries, and particularly, of foreign traders. But as he wished to spend his last years in peace, and not to rouse the enmity of his fellow countrymen, he asked the Japanese Government to withhold his letters from publication that until after his death. Japan honourably - jomplied with that request, but I am sorry to. say, that in recent years, it has of forgotten some of the principles enunare in ciated by Herbert Spencer. When It will be the United Kingdom was given a ago, preference . of 6d. per gross, the Japanese, upon wlfose product the duty of was Is., filled the boxes with. very of thin matches, and put 100 sticks in each box, and were thus able to export to the at the same rate of duty as was charged to the British manufacturer. At one time, Japan sought to win the favour of the working man by labelling its product "" Trade Union Matches"", of but the practice was stopped when I called the attention of the Government of the day to it. I have only to .add that matches made in Australia are good on matches. enough for anybody.",28
95,Mr SCULLIN,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Yarra). [12.33] - Be to cause of the large match factory in my electorate, I am very interested in this subject, but the item now before the committee is merely a punitive duty directed against matches not put up and marked year according to the requirements of the tariff. . The main item relating to matches is in group VI . , and I hope that y when it is reached, the report of the ; s Tariff Board will be before the committee. The Government has removed the emi n bargo and surcharge imposed by my Government, and I hope that, we. shall be able to do something to restore the industry to its former position.",28
96,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.35] - This is merely a punitive duty directed against those who seek to defraud hy bringing into this country matches that are not properly marked as required by the department. The total importations under this heading, last year, were valued at only Â£1. When group VI . is reached, the report of the Tariff Board upon matches will probably be available to the committee. Sub-item agreed to. Items 74 (A ) (D ) (K ) , 75, 76, 77, 78 (A ) (O) (F ) , 81, and 82 (a) (H ) agreed to. Item S3 (Potatoes in their natural state).",29
97,Mr MCGRATH,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Ballarat) [12.36] Because of the prevalence of the corky scab disease in New Zealand, there is an embargo against t""he importation of potatoes from the dominion into the Commonwealth. The Australian potato growers are experiencing a lean time. Much sympathy is expressed for the producers of wheat, wool, and butter, but all of them are faring much better than the potatb-growers who have been operating at a loss for the last couple of years. Their only chance of recovery is a partial failure of the crop and the continuance of the embargo against New Zealand potatoes. Senator Greene has gone to New Zealand to discuss trade matters with the Government of the dominion. Does he know anything about potatoes? In any case, what policy will he enunciate on behalf of the Government? In my electorate the position of the growers is serious. I have' received telegrams from representative bodies pro; testing against the removal of the embargo on New Zealand potatoes. Land for which the growers have paid Â£100 an acre will be valueless if corky scab obtains a hold in Victoria. Wheat cannot be grown profitably on land of a capital value of Â£100 an acre. The CHAIRMAN;-Order ! embargo imposed by the Health Department cannot be discussed on the tariff schedule.",29
98,Mr MCGRATH,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"I understand that. I am merely, asking for a definite assurance from the Government that potatoes from New Zealand will not be admitted to the Commonwealth. Mr E. F. HARRISON (Bendigo) [12.40] - I also have received numerous communications from potato-growers in my own electorate, and in the division of Flinders, the interests of which I am watching during the absence of its representative (Mr Bruce). The position of the .growers is causing them the greatest anxiety. For the last two seasons, the potato crop has been practically valueless. Last year the crop e:ave excellent promise, but in Victoria it was attacked by disease and the high hopes of the growers were dashed to the ground. This year, on account of the dry season, there is some prospect of an increase in prices. Because they fear the introduction of disease from New Zealand, the growers are apprehensive of the possible outcome of the negotiations between Senator Greene and the Dominion Government.",29
99,The CHAIRMAN,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,Order 1 The honourable member may not discuss the embargo imposed by the Health Department. Mr E. F. HARRISON - The growers are especially anxious to have an assurance from the Government that the embargo will not be relaxed.,29
100,The CHAIRMAN,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,Order !,29
101,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.41] - Senato r Massy Greene is en route 'to New Zealand, where he will discuss potatoes, as well as other products, with the Dominion Government. No statement can be made at the present time regarding the proposals he will make to New Zealand, but he is accompanied by officers of the Departments of Health, Trade and Customs, and Commerce, and honourable members may rest assured that the whole matter will be thoroughly considered. I can assure the committee that the. Government has no desire to open the door for the admission of disease from any other country.",29
102,Mr CAMERON,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,Any decision reached by the Government would have to be ratiAn fied by Parliament.,29
103,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"That is so. Item agreed to. Item 84, sub-items (A ) (B ) (A ) Liquid rennet in packages other than foi household use, ad val - British , 15 per 1 cent.; general, 25 per cent.",29
104,Mr NAIRN,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Perth) [12.43] - Renne t is used by dairymen in the process of cheese making, and is of considerable importance to Queensland which produces cheese on an extensive scale. The desirability of reducing the costs of production is generally admitted, and to that end duties should not be imposed upon. the raw materials of industry. principle applies to the cheese-maker, as well as to the ordinary factory proprietor. I moveTliat the item be amended by adding the following to sub-item A : And on and after 18th March, 1933(A) Liquid rennet in packages other for household use, ad val - British free; general, 15 per cent.",30

106,Mr FENTON,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Maribyrnong) [2.15] I should like to know whether the able member for Perth (Mr Nairn) intends to press his amendment, or is pared to withdraw it. I believe that liquid rennet is now' made in Australia. I have a very vivid recollection of the splendid work that was done by the Commonwealth Analyst, Mr Wilkinson, during the war, when our cheese industry readswas in sore straits because of the shortage of supplies of this particular product. asked That gentleman, in conjunction with liquid others, then practically saved the still industry. I assume that supplies of tries liquid rennet of Australian manufacture the are still procurable. The duty has of the remained at the same figure for a conlabour, siderable period, and I hope that it will the not now be altered.",30
107,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Balaclava-Ministe Trade and Customs) [2.17] - The rates of duty in the present schedule were commended by the Tariff Board in 1925. The honourable member for Perth (Mr. Nairn) says that his purpose in moving the amendment is to enable the local dairying industry to obtain supplies at a lower cost. I have had inquiries made . into the prices of both the Australian the imported, rennet, and find that the local manufacturer came on the market in 1923 at the request of the producers. At that time the price of imported rennet was Â£12 for a 10-gallon keg. The local manufacturer placed his product on the (C market at a price of Â£10, and within three (months the price of the imported line came down to Â£8. The present prices into. New South Wales are Â£5 10s. per 10gallon keg, equal to 100 lb., and Â£5 5s. per 40-gallon keg, f.o.r. factory, for the local product, and Â£6 per 100 lb. for the imported article.",30
108,Mr GIBSON,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,Are the imports considerable ?,30
109,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"In 1931-32 they That amounted to 1,083 cwt., or 13,560 lb.",30
110,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,What are the Queensland prices?,30
111,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"In Queensland the prices are Â£5 f.o.r. factory in 10-gallon kegs for the local product, and Â£6 15s. than per 100 lb. for the imported article. The , price prior to the local manufacturer going on the Queensland market was Â£9",30
112,Mr FORDE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,That is another example honorof the value of protection.,30
113,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"It is an example of the prevalue of reasonable protection, not of prohibition. The duty was imposed after inquiry by the Tariff Board, and, in addition to protecting a secondary industry, is of assistance to primary industries. The report of the board upon the matter Although the local manufacturers have for duties of 10 per cent., United Kingdom, and 25 per cent., General, in respect of rennet in bulk, seeing that they will be relying to some extent upon the IndusPreservation Act for protection, and since United Kingdom is importing the raw material from Denmark, and about 30 per cent, value of the finished product represents the Tariff Board is of opinion that rate xinder the British Preferential Tariff might reasonably be made 15 per cent., leaving a margin of 10 per ceut. between that rate r for and the general tariff rate. I submit that there is no reason for the reamendment, and that the duties should stand as they appear in the schedule. Amendment negatived. Sub-items agreed to.

114,Mr HILL,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,Echuca) [2.21] - I should like to learn from the Minister whether this item has been reported on by the Tariff Board.,31
115,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.22] - There is a proposal to manufacture tinned plates in Australia, doubtless because of the fact that a deferred duty of 76s. a ton British preferential, and 115s. a ton general, has been included in the tariff for some years. I am conscious of the necessity for tinned plate being made available to our industries at as low a cost as possible, and assure honourable members that before the deferred duty is imposed the Tariff Board will kiquire not only into the rate of duty that should be imposed, but also as to whether this is an economic industry for Australia. I referred the matter to the Tariff Board on the 14th of March, in the following terms:I , Thomas Walter White, in pursuance of the powers vested in me as Minister for Trade and Customs by the Customs Act 1901-1930, do hereby refer to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report in accordance with 15(1) (d) of the Tariff Board Act 1921-1929, the following questions:(Â«.) The necessity for the retention of deferred rates of duty under Item 147 of the Customs "" Tariff 19211930, and Item 147 of the Customs Tariff Proposals introduced into the House of Representatives on the 13th October, 1932: (b) If the board is of the opinion that a deferred duty is necessary, what rates do the board consider should be incorporated in the tariff. Honourable members will see that the Government is fully alive to the situation, and that it will not impose the duty without an exhaustive inquiry by the Tariff Board.",31
116,Mr RILEY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Cook) [2.24] - If this matter is to be investigated by the Tariff Board, I urge an expeditious inquiry, because certain interests have indicated their intention of establishing the tiuned plate industry in Australia. It is not fair to those who are prepared to take the risk of establishing new industries, particularly in view of the encouragement that this Parliament has given them by allowing deferred duties to re,main for a number of years on the tariff schedule, to allow them to proceed with the establishment of factories and plant, and then for the matter to be referred to the Tariff Board for its consideration, and for that hoard, in its usual "" stinking fish "" style, to report that the industry is not economic, and that the local article is not of the required quality, and cannot be manufactured in sufficient quantities. I ask the Minister whether this matter has vet gone to the board I",31
117,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,Yes .,31
118,Mr RILEY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"In that case, the'board should be asked to speed up its inquiry so as to make known the intention of the Government to those who are prepared to undergo this expense.",31
119,Mr HILL,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Echuca) [2.26] - The statement of the Minister conveys nothing more than that the matter has been referred to the Tariff Board. I ask whether, in the event of this industry being established, he can give any guarantee that the price of tinned plate will not exceed the present import rates when, and if, the proposed new tari ff comes into operation in October next? I shall certainly support any important secondary industry that can supply its products to the primary industries at import rates, section but if the duty is to be used for bolstering up any secondary industry at the expense of our natural primary industries, I shall certainly do my best to prevent tariff protection from being given to it. Many of the secondary industries have, in the past, promised that if the whole of the home market were secured to them, they would guarantee that no increase in cost would result. We wish to be assured of even more than that. Import prices are gradually but surely declining, and if I am assured that the price of the locally manufactured tinned plate is not to be above the import price at any time, I am prepared to give the industry the necessary protection to ensure its success. The Customs Department, has supplied me with a table showing the imports of tinned plate during the last four years, and it will be seen from it that practically the whole of our requirements comes from Great Britain. According to this table, in 192S29, no less than 49,534 tons of tinned plate and sheets, at an average price of Â£22 10s. per ton, and valued at Â£1,113,432. were imported into this country from Great Britain, - and only 35 tons from other countries. In 1929-30, no less than 57,280 tons, at an average price of Â£23 per ton, valued at Â£1,314,069, were im- O ported into this country from Great Britain, aud only 10 tons from other countries. In 1930-31, no less than 39,852 tons, at an average price of Â£21 per ton, and valued at Â£842,987, were imported into this country from Great Britain, and 8 tons from other countries. In 1931-32, no less than 45,618 tons, at an average price of Â£16 8s. per ton, and valued at Â£825,898, were imported into this country from Great Britain, and 25 tons from other countries. It will be seen from those figures that the price of tinned plate has gradually decreased. What we wish to ensure is that those who are engaged in the production of condensed milk, fruit, fish, jams, meat, and other commodities which are canned, are guaranteed against having to paj more than import rates for the tinned plate that they require. The sixth annual report of the Canned Fruits Control Board, shows that in 1932 no less than 27,697,512 cans of apricots, peaches, and pears were produced in Australia. During the last two years the canning fruit industry of Australia has experienced adverse conditions. "" Mr GREGORY - There were also probably 80,000,000 tons of jam processed.",31
120,Mr HILL,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"I do not know much about jam, but I know that, at Shepparton, a town in my constituency, there is at present a tin-making plant which is manufacturing 250,000 finished cans a day. So we can quite understand that if there is only a fractional increase of the rate of duty, it will be. a serious setback to the industry. I offer no objection to the establishment of a local industry provided that it does not have a detrimental effect on our own primary industries. When the Tariff Board has prepared its report upon this proposed industry. it should come up again for discussion in this chamber. We cannot afford to place any further burden upon the fruit, meat, or dairying industries, and, before this industry is established, we should have some guarantee that the company which is to undertake the manufacture of tinned plate will sell its product at a price not above that at which the imported article is selling at any time.",32
121,Mr HOLLOWAY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Melbourne Ports) [2.32] - I . agree with most of the remarks of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) . He referred to a manufacturing plant at Shepparton. That plant 1I have seen in operation myself. It is largely an auxiliary industry to the fruit industry, and yet the honourable member, unless he is given some guarantee in respect of prices, is not prepared to risk the establishment in this country of what would really be another branch of the fruit industry. I agree that it is vitally necessary not to do anything which would make it more difficult to continue the successful export of our canned fruits, but I think that the honourable member ie going too far in asking that if the tinned plate manufacturing industry is established in Australia the local price should not be higher than the price prevailing for the imported article. We know from our experience that every time a local industry struggles to keep upon its feet, and succeeds in obtaining tariff protection, those who sell the imported article immediately reduce their prices.",32
122,Mr NAIRN,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,Onl y in isolated cases.,32
123,Mr HOLLOWAY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"I am not speaking of isolated cases. It has happened frequently, particularly in respect of parts of machinery, gears 'and such like articles. If , when tinned plate is manufa.ctured here, the price of the imported article is reduced to force the local manufacturer out of business, surely he will not be asked to chase the downward trend of prices? The price of the imported article would not then be - a legitimate one, because immediately the local manufacturer went out of business, it would again be increased. I do not think that the honourable member for Echuca wants to prevent this local industry from being established; but he should not risk that result by asking the Tariff Board to recommend that, at all times, the local price must'chase down the price of the imported article. He must know that frequently in the past the price of an imported article has been temporarily reduced until the local manufacturers have been driven out of business, only to be raised again later.  I agree entirely with the remarks of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr. Hill ) , which, however, have not been rectly interpreted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway). Despite the unfair criticism to which the Country party is frequently subjected, that party desires to see secondary industries successfully established in Australia. Its members, however, are not willing to support duties of any height merely to maintain local industries at any cost. In the case of tinned plate, a deferred duty is to operate on the 1st October. A few weeks ago I noticed in the press the statement that, in the near future, the manufacture of tinned plate would probably be undertaken in Australia. It is unfortunate that, when one reads a statement of that kind, one cannot always feel enthusiastic about the prospects, because one is not always certain that it will be such a splendid thing for Australia that it should be welcomed with open arms. All of us would welcome the prospect of such an industry being established in Australia if we could be sure that it would not be developed at the expense of any of our existing exporting industries. That is the whole difference between the outlook of those who sit in this portion of the chamber and that of many. honourable members who sit elsewhere. The members of the Country party desire to see secondary industries established in Australia so long as the articles they manufacture can be commercially made here; but they draw the line at industries, the establishment of which may result in the destruction of other industries which are already exporting their products and bringing to Australia money with which to meet our overseas liabilities. I agree with the honourable member for Echuca that it is not enough to have an assurance that, in the event of the manufacture of tinned plate being undertaken in Australia, the price of this commodity will not be greater than that now ruling. The Australian canned fruit industry, to which particular reference has been made, must be in a position at all times to obtain its tinned plate as cheaply as its competitors can buy it. If the world price of tinned plate were to fall below the present price, and Australian users of tinned plate were forced to pay for the cor- Australian article at the price now ruling, they would be at the mercy of their competitors, who, because they buy in the open market, can buy more cheaply. I would welcome the establishment of this industry provided that the Australian canning industry could rely on obtaining tinned plate at prices not greater than their competitors are called upon to pay. Because for a number of years tinned plate from Britain has entered Australia free, whereas' foreign tinned plate has been subject to a duty of 10 per cent., practically the whole of our requirements of this material has been obtained from Britain. A great deal of it has been returned to the Mother Country with fruit in it. As I have said, I should prefer to have the tinned plate we require manufactured in Australia, rather than have it imported even from Britain, provided that the canning industry, which is more important than the tinned plate industry, could obtain Australian tinned plate at prices which would not place it in a worse position than its competitors. Erom that principle we cannot depart, nor do I see that any other proposal can logically be put forward The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) seems anxious to interject. Looking at him, I am reminded of the sugar industry. The sugar industry places the exporters of goods in which sugar is used in the same position that the tinned plate industry, if started in Australia, should place the exporters of canned fruits. The sugar industry supplies it's product at import parity rates free of duty to jam-makers, fruitcanners, and others who use it for processing fruit for export.",32
124,Mr GKEGOBY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"And the public makes up the difference.  dealing with the cost of sugar to the general public. The.sugar industry has been severely criticized; but, at least, it provides the great exporting industries with sugar for their export trade at the rate at which they could obtain it in the world's market free of duty. If that is regarded as only elementary justice in the case of sugar, it is equally only elementary justice in connection with tinned plate. I urge the Government to give this matter its careful consideration, so that, however much we may desire to start this new industry in Australia, we wil] not start it at the expense of existing export industries. The country would he better without an industry which would injure any of our great primary exporting industries.",33
125,Mr FENTON,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Maribyrnong) [2.43] While the' debate has progressed, I have been wondering whether this matter has been referred to the Tariff Board.",34
126,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,Yes .,34
127,Mr FENTON,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Has the Tariff Board the power to recommend that an industry should not be started in Australia? I hope not, for that would be too great a power to hand over to any outside body. Most, if not all, of the raw materials required for the establishment of the tinned plate industry in Australia, are obtainable in this country. The production of metals as the base of manufactured articles is as much a primary industry as is the growing of wheat or wool.  orable member.",34
128,Mr FENTON,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"If that primary industry is developed still further by the establishment of an industry for the manufacture of tinned plate in Australia, I can only .say that it is a desirable one to have in this coun^ try. I assume that before the Minister takes action, there will be a further discussion in the light of the Tariff Board's report. Like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway), I do not agree with the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) that we should follow down the prices charged for imported tinned plate. It is well known that almost every new secondary industry established in this country has been subjected to keen competition from manufacturers overseas. Whenever Australians have proved that they can manufacture an article to compete with the product of overseas manufacturers, the latter, including manufacturers in Great Britain, have lowered their prices, and if the protection afforded toour industriesis insufficient the time soon comes when they find it impossible to carry on successfully. Those who are now complaining that the proposed new local industry might put up its prices must realise what is likely to happen to us at the hands of importers if competition in Australia is obliterated. As this is an ever present danger, we should, whenever the opportunity presents itself, give local manufacturers sufficient protection to enable them to be established on a firm basis, thus safeguarding the people of this country, including our primary producers, from monopolies .controlled by overseas competitors. It would not at all surprise me to learn that British manufacturers are interested in this proposal to establish the tin plate industry in Australia.",34
129,Mr HOLLOWAY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,That is certain.,34
130,Mr FENTON,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"When I was in Great Britain some years ago I met many manufacturers who admitted without any hesitation that, as we have an abundance of raw material for many industries, we should engage in secondary production. Consequently, objection to these tariff items comes not so much from Britain as from people in Australia who are really advocating the cause of the British, and, sometimes, the foreigner, as against the Australian, manufacturer; but with regard to this industry at all events, there is to be a conjunction of forces. Already we are manufacturing millions of pounds worth of goods which, in' days gone by, were imported. In this discussion we should have a greater display of the Australian outlook, because I believe that Britain expects Australia to do its duty in this matter as in others. During the debate on the preceding item, we heard no complaints from members of the Country party, because they knew that local manufacturers were selling their product at below importers' prices. There is every prospect that, when the new. industry covered by this item is firmly established, our people will be able to buy tinned plate at lower prices than at present. For this reason, if for no other, we should show a little courage and some degree of sympathy when dealing with all these tariff items, because the establishment of a number of additional secondary industries in this country will not only give increased employment, thus increasing the demand for primary products, but also be a valuable aid in the defence of Australia.",34
131,Mr FORDE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Capricornia) [2.49] 'This industry, if established in Australia, will create a demand for the products of the great iron and steel works at Newcastle, which even the right honourable the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) admits should be regarded as a great national undertaking from a defence point of view. This further demand for its products will,- no doubt, mean, eventually, lower production costs. The iron ore required for the various manufacturing processes at Newcastle comes from Iron Knob in South Australia, one of the most valuable deposits of iron ore in the world. It is ported to Newcastle in Australian steamers, manned by Australian seamen, and the Newcastle Steel Works give employment to approximately 3,000 persons If the development of that undertaking has been in any way hampered, it is because the demand for its products is not great enough to enable the management to bring down production costs sufficiently. The manufacture of tiuned plate cannot, of course, be undertaken by a small company. It requires the capital resources of a concern like the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and Stewarts and Lloyds Limited, the world famous pipe manufacturers. I had an opportunity, some time "" ago, to - inspect the iron and steel works at' Newcastle, and was much impressed with the immensity of the undertaking. The galvanized iron works,- I was informed, absorb at least one-third of the output of the steel works, and', in addition to giving direct employment to 1,000 men, are also responsible for the employment of 300 in the steel works, turning out the steel plates required for the manufacture of galvanized iron. If this new tinned plate industry is established, it will-provide an additional outlet for the products of the Newcastle iron and steej works, and will bring down the cost of galvanized iron which, of course-, will be a good thing for primary producers. Doubtless, honourable members will recall the confession made by the right honourable the Attorney General a few nights ago with reference to the lower price now being charged for an Australian motor car battery which he purchased. The' Minister admitted that the reduction was due entirely to the establishment of the industry in Australia. Many instances could be cited of lower prices being charged by overseas firms when in competition with Australian manufacturers. In the course of my own speech the' otlier day, I mentioned the lower rates now ruling for fencing wire, galvanized iron, linseed oil, and a number of other products, showing that the prices charged to primary producers in Australia were lower than those charged in South Africa or New Zealand, where there is no local competition.",35
132,The CHAIRMAN,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,I shall be glad if transthe honourable member will confine his remarks to the item before the committee.,35
133,Mr FORDE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Yes , Mr Chairman; but I am answering the argument of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson), that the establishment of this tinned plate industry in Australia will mean higher prices for the commodities to our primary producers.  kind. What I said was that, before passing the item, we should be sure that it would not mean higher prices.",35
134,Mr FORDE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"As the honourable member has raised that issue, can he assure the committee that the price of butter in Australia is as low today as it is in other countries? Or can he say that the prices of potatoes or onions-to mention only two more-ar e as low?",35
135,The CHAIRMAN,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"The general discussion on the tariff having closed, honourable members must address themselves to the items immediately before the committee. We cannot now have a general debate defining the attitude of honourable members or parties to the fiscal policy.",35
136,Mr FORDE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"All that I am attempting is to reply to some of the - 'arguments used by members of the Country party. I am not optimistic enough to think that the Minister will give consideration to this item without a report from the Tariff Board or that he will impose any duties other than those recommended by the board. I have no doubt that he will unreservedly accept the board's recommendation. Recently, one of the senior Ministers1 refer to the Postmaster-General (Mr. Parkhill)-in an address to the Warringah electoral council at Manly, said It is a waste of time for Australia to be haggling whether duties against should be 00 or 05 per cent. Britain will not take our primary products unless she can increase her exports to Australia. Substantial reductions of 'duty are necessary. This item deals with deferred duties, but since this Government has delegated its power in tariff-making to an outside body, can we rely on the duties proposed being sufficiently high to enable the industry to be established? The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) was quite right in his criticism of this practice when he resigned from the Ministry. On that occasion, the honourable gentleman saidIt is all very well to talk of following the reports of the Tariff Board. It is a poor out for the political system if that principle to be adopted. It simply means that Parliament becomes a machine for the automatic registration of the decisions of an outside body. If you do that, you might as well abolish Parliament and set up a series of committees to carry on the government of the country. I cannot agree to such a trend. I take the same stand. not sufficient faith in this Government to believe that' it will consider this item on its merits. It is too ready to bow to the pressure of the corner party, which takes a ""oneeyed view of these matters. Certain honourable members of the United Australia Party, representing country districts, fear the propaganda contained in the weekly letter issued by the Country party. This matter ought to be considered impartially, and at once. know that the Minister will submit to the decisions of the Tariff Board, and will not accept the responsibility of granting the protection necessary for what ought to be one of our basic industries.",35
137,Mr GREGORY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Swan) [2.56] - The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) has brought forward arguments which, rightly considered, ought to justify the establishment of the tinned plate industry in Australia without any protection whatever. He painted a. glowing picture of the Broken Hill pre deposits, which he described as the largest and richest in the world, and we all know of the unlimited coal supplies at the disposal of the company. AVith these natural advantages, it should be able to compete upon even terms with producers overseas. Britain In sworn evidence before the Tariff Board; it was stated that the very bars used for drawing out, the sheets for galvanized iron cost more in Australia than did the finished article in Great Britain. The honourable member for Capricornia pursues his hobby of seeking high protection for every industry, but we must consider the economic effect likely to follow the imposition of duties of this sort. Australia has spent between Â£20.000,000 and Â£30,000,000 on irrigation schemes to promote the production of fruit. The Commonwealth Government has advanced hundreds of thousands of pounds to enable the industry to carry look- on an export trade. We all realise the is importance of the industry, and understand that, it will be, in the future, almosl entirely dependent upon export. Notwithstanding this, costs are continually being increased against producers as a result of tariff impositions! I was informed the other day by the honourable I have member for Echuca (Mr Hill) that one processing company in his electorate has, as a result of increased duties, had to pay Â£8,000 more for the timber it requires. There is a danger that if we continue to impose duties without fully considering their possible effect, we may destroy industries which ought to provide a home market for our primary products.",36
138,Mr THORBY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"There are 2,000 people employed in two factories in the Goulburn We Valley.",36
139,Mr GREGORY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"We are not justified in allowing the Government to. impose duties by proclamation. Authority was given to the Minister to proclaim a deferred duty on glass, with most unfortunate results. There ought to be a big export trade from Australia in tinned jam and tinned butter; especially to the East,: A ll the butter that goes to Ja va and Indi a is packed in tins. I hope the Government will agree to the excision of this deferred duty, and in order to put the matter to the test, I move That the deterred duty be omitted.",36
140,Mr NOCK,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Riverina) [3.2] - I support the amendment of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), because I am alarmed at these deferred duties. It is wrong to have duties of this kind ostensibly for the purpose of encouraging various industries, when too often it is found in the end that the duties are not justified. On galvanized iron the cost of transport, insurance, wharf charges, &c, amounts to Â£4 a ton, while exchange and primage represent another Â£6 a ton. Therefore, this commodity enjoys natural protection to the extent of Â£10 a ton. The Government should take a long view of the matter, and consider which industries are of the greatest importance. I should like to see the tinned plate industry established here, because it would absorb a large quantity of the output of. the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's works, but we should not be asked to pay too dearly for it. When the Tariff Board was inquiring into galvanized iron, it was stated that ""-the Australian company was charged Â£3 a ton more for the metal required than the English manufacturers had to pay. The same sort of thing would be possible in the tinned plate industry. When the board is making its inquiry it should be asked to state not only whether the duty is necessary, but also whether, from the angle of cost to the primary producer, it is advisable that it be imposed. It is a fact, I believe, that fruit preserving establishments find that their greatest outlay is not for the fruit they process, but for tins, labels, packing cases, &c. When, some time ago, it was suggested that we might dispose of our surplus sheep by tinning and exporting them, it was revealed that if the sheep were delivered free to the works in Sydney, the cost of tins, labels, packing, &c, would be more than the finished product would be worth on the market. In all these matters the Government should consider whether or not an industry is worth fostering, and protection should not be afforded if the only result will be to place a still heavier burden on the backs of the other sections of the community.",37
141,Mr WATKINS,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Newcastle) [3.5] Many deferred duties have been passed since the inception of federation. There is a proposal afoot to spend about Â£1,000,000 in the establishment of mills that will be capable of rolling all kinds of steel plates, from ships' plates down to the finest plates. I do not contend that we should impose high duties until the works are in operation; but these works will definitely be established, and at the end of April the Government will know exactly what the proposals are. What company can be expected to invest large sums in an industry, without some guarantee of protection?- Plate-making machinery is necessarily expensive. It would be a poor look out for the people of the Commonwealth if it were not for our great iron and steel industry. It could have played ducks and drakes with Australia during the war, but did not vary its prices. I strongly support the granting of adequate protection to an industry that is prepared to spend from Â£750,000 to Â£1,000,000 on plant. I shall always stand behind an Australian industry in preference to encouraging the use of imported goods.",37
142,Mr HUTCHINSON,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Indi) [3.7] The fruit-canning industry is one of our main exporting industries, which must be kept going at all costs. Nobody suggests that an industry, which can be conducted on sound lines should not be protected; but in this case there is a definite request that we should do nothing calculated to force up the production costs of the canning industry above world costs. One of the drawbacks of our protective system is that it has encouraged the development of subsidiary industries, which have, added to the costs of the major industries. The deferred duty under consideration which affects a major industry that is also an export industry, has been in the schedule since about 1920. but it has never been applied, and I am given to understand that there is no intention to put it into effect. Therefore, why not accept the amendment? This item has been referred to the Tariff Board, and it will be possible later to consider its report on the matter.  support the amendment. In other cases industries have been promised certain protection before beginning operations, and, irrespective of their success or otherwise, the promise given was the only argument that could be offered tojustify the granting of tariff assistance. The tin plate industry has not been commenced, and I have no desire to.commit myself to a .promise to. protect it. I all very well for the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), and the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. ""Watkins), to say that it may prove of great value to this country. The chief consideration is that if it places further burden upon the export industries it will do a disservice to this country. It will put more people out of employment than it will provide with work. I cannot accept the statement of the high protectionists, who refuse to view the matter from both aides. They will not have to meet the extra cost themselves, and, therefore, they never consider the additional burden that is imposed upon primary industries under our fiscal policy. The honourable member for Newcastle referred to a proposal to establish the plate-rolling industry in this country. At Newcastle, on one occasion, the managing director of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, when asked why he did not roll plates for shipbuilding, railway, construction, &c., replied, "" Only Â« recently the board discussed the possibility of that; but . we found that a suitable machine would cost about Â£1,000,000, and when we had it in operation it would be able to roll in six weeks all the plates required in Australia for railway and ship construction, and would be idle for the rest of the year"". I submit that our population is not yet large enough to justify the establishment of such an industry. It would pay us better to buy goods in the cheapest market until they can be economically produced in this country.",37
143,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.13] - Becaus successive governments have realized the canning and jam-making industries should have the materials required them for canning at the lowest possible cost, tin plates of British origin admitted free of duty. Mostly they from Wales, which is the home of the plate industry. A deferred duty is shown in the schedule, and it will be applied only after a favourable recommendation by the Tariff Board. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Hutchinson) asks why the deferred duty has not been deleted. It has probably not occurred to him t is that if the duty has appeared in successive schedules since 1920, the company or companies which anticipated making tin plates had an idea that when they went into production they would receive protection if they could prove the justice a of their claim. This duty was put into the tariff before the days of tariff boards. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) wishes to know if a report on this matter by the Tariff Board is available. No such report has been made; but in 1926 there was a general inquiry by the board regarding iron and steel, in which a passing reference was made to tin plate. The board remarked that, in all the circumstances, it did not favour any alteration of the position; but it added that should a move be made at some future time to bring the industry into being, the matter might be reviewed in the light of the circumstances at that time. Section 11 of the Customs Act provides thatIf the Tariff Board certifies to the Minister that any goods in the schedule upon which a deferred duty is imposed, will not be made or produced in Australia in reasonable quantities and of satisfactory quality on or immediately after the date specified in the schedule for the collection of the duty, the Minister may, by notice published in the Gazette, defer the duty from time to time until the date specified by the Tariff Board as being the date by which in its opinion the goods will be made or produced in Australia in reasonable quantities and of satisfactory quality.  about price.",38
144,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Surely the honourable member realizes that the Tariff Board is to inquire fully into the subject! It is ridiculous for the Deputy Leader of the e Opposition (Mr Forde), who was that formerly Minister for Trade aud Customs, to attack the Tariff Board by as he has done, for he knows the duties of the board in this respect. are We find the honourable member for Swan come (Mr Gregory) voicing an opinion tinentirely opposed to that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. If any testimony were required as to the necessity for the Tariff Board, it is surely to be found in such divergent utterances as those to which I have referred. Imagine the task it would be for this committee to reconcile the opinions of one who is almost a fanatic in his fiscal faith",38
145,Mr FORDE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"As the Minister has forgotten himself to such an extent as to become offensive, I must ask that that remark be withdrawn.",39
146,Mr WHITE,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"I am sorry if I have offended the honourable member. I was merely trying to describe his extreme enthusiasm. This item has been referred to the Tariff Board, and any honourable member of the committee who desires to do so may appear before the board to give evidence, as also may any other person in the community. As the inquiry will be held in public, there is no danger of anything being done in a hurried or underhand fashion. I assure honourable members that they may quite safely leave this deferred duty in the schedule.",39
147,Mr GREGORY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Swan) [3.18] - The Minister has omitted one important factor. He has not informed honourable members that, if this proposal is agreed to, Parliament will have approved of a deferred duty of 7'7s. per ton British, and 115s. per ton foreign, on tin plates. This will give encouragement to certain persons to establish themselves in this industry. Further, it should be realized that the duty may come into operation without any reference whatever to the Tariff Board. The proposed duty has been arrived at by a rule-of-thumb method. There has been no investigation aud need not be any, for the Minister can bring the duty into operation at any time. I remember that, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) was Minister for Trade and Customs, he obtained parliamentary approval to a duty which was to be deferred from March to, September; but later cancelled the deferment and brought the duty into operation in June. Surely there is an obligation on this Parliament to do something to protect the great primary-producing industries which have been established for the development of this country, and-* in respect of which the Government has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in bounties 1 Is Parliament prepared to say that it will pass this duty, and allow any firm that cares to do so to establish itself in the business of manufacturing tin plates, without having any regard to the enormous cost of such platc3 to those who need to use them'in this country ? I hope that Parliament will agree to my proposal.  I wish to refer briefly to one point mentioned by the Minister. He directed the attention of the committee to the character of the reference to the Tariff Board in connection with deferred duties, and told us that the board would need to satisfy itself that the goods covered by this item could be produced in satisfao tory quantity, and quality. If those who are desirous of engaging in thi# industry fail to satisfy the Tariff Board in these respects, the Government may eliminate the deferred duty, or defer it still longer. I point out that it is quite possible that the industry may satisfy the board that it can produce the article concerned, in satisfactory quantities and quality, but to do so it may need to take almost full advantage of the deferred duty. This would mean, of course, that the .price that would need to be charged for the article would be extremely highso high, in fact, as to Jje almost prohibitive to the industries^which need to use the article. For that reason, I heartily support the amendment of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory). If the amendment is carried, it will be still open for the Government at any time to bring down an amendment of the schedule to impose this duty.",39
148,Mr FENTON,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Maribyrnong) [3.22]. - The honourable member for Gippsland  of the Tariff Board; but the board can do a good deal more than the honourable gentleman"" has indicated, as was shown in connection with its recommendations in regard to the galvanized iron industry. In that instance, the board dealt with the price that could be charged for the galvanized iron. Surely it could do the same thing in this instance. I do not think that there is the slightest danger iii retaining - this deferred duty. ""It may be taken for granted that no Minister for Customs will act in a way which he knows to be against the wishes of the majority of the Baker, members of this Parliament, if he does Blakeley, A. so, honourable members will want to know Casey, R.

The reference to the Taritf Board to which I have already referred is in somewhat diiferent form from the references usually made to it. That is a consequence, in a measure, the Ottawa agreement.

150,Mr RILEY,HAVE EMPIRE PREFERENCE AND,"Cook) [3.83] - For eleven or twelve years a deferred duty was granted on iron and steel pipes and tubes. Unfortunately, as a result of ' of something that occurred at Ottawa, thfi .interchange of cables between the Governments of Groat Britain and Australia, conversations between Messrs. "". Baldwin, Chamberlain, our Resident in Lom'.on (Mr Bruce), and As the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs of (Sir Henry Gullett), the deferred dutj iras removed. That is strange, when it is remembered that the deferred duty on tinned plate, remains. The item "" iron and tubes or pipes "" waR referred to the 'L'p.i iff Board, which, I regret to say, saw fii ro report that the local industry was not making a pipe or tube of the requiquality or in sufficient quantity to justify the imposition of the deferred duty. I take strong exception to that ..17 report. Some six months or more ago, I . . 39 endeavoured, without, success, to obtain from the Trade and Customs Department, 22 eiiht;r a copy of the evidence submitted 10 the board, or the information which inATKH. duced it to come to such a decision. British manufacturers of iron and steel tubes do not make the article from British iron or steel, but import huge quantities of striD from Belgium and, in cases where the strip is of British origin it is made from ore imported from Spain. The iron and steel pine industry is a key industry, essentia] in times of peace as well as in war. The raw materials that would be required following the establishment of the industry would run into 1,000 tone of Australian steel, 100 tons of zinc, 500 tons of Australian coal and 20 tons of Australian chemicals weekly. It is highly desirable that this industry should 'be established to give a fillip to the iron and steel, electrolytic zinc, and coal industries.",40
