I promised that the Government would deal with each shipment on its merits, and that requests from Western Australia would, because of its situation, receive special consideration. That was a3 far as auy government could go. Some shipments have been admitted free of duty, and we have since received communications which indicate that they are competing with local industries.

27,Mr THEODORE,Unknown,"The matter has been under consideration, and only this morning I consulted with the Commissioner of Taxation regarding it.

The important coal-mining industry is languishing, and on that account is deserving of every protection against the coal used by ships trading to Australia which take in at South African ports cheaply produced coal sufficient for the round trip.",12

31,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"In the department there is no record compiled from which we could furnish the honourable member with the information desired.

The Inspector of Charitieshas informed me that the rebuilding scheme will have to be commenced at the end of this year.

In other words, will the Government enforce the law?",13

47,Mr JAMES,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"I withdraw the statement. I should now like to know if it is the intention of the Government to continue with its ruthless policy of reduction of pension payments over and above the 22£ per cent, provided for in the Premiers' plan?",13
48,Mr THEODORE,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"The . Financial Emergency Act provides, among other things, for a reduction of pension payments. The manner in which those reductions apply is in accordance with recommendations made by a committee appointed by the Returned Soldiers Association, and including the representatives of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, the blinded and limbless soldiers and various other organizations of returned soldiers. The committee referred to made certain recommendations to the Government dealing with the proposed economies in pension payments, and its recommendations were adopted. GARDEN ISLAND. CONDITIONS OE RATIONING .",13
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"I have received from the honourable member for Martin (Mr Eldridge) an intimation that he intends to move the adjournment of the House this morning for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The condition of unrest existing among the employees at Garden Island "". Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",13
50,Mr ELDRIDGE,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"Martin) [10.55] There is considerable unrest among employees at Garden Island following the posting of a notice connected with rationing by the Naval Board arbitrarily depriving employees of certain annual leave privileges and holiday pay. provided for them under existing awards. The notice in question appeared on the 4th September, and intimated that alterations would be made in the conditions relating to continuity of service, annual leave privilege, public holidays and furlough. On the 10th September, a deputation representative of the Metal Trades Union, Sydney, waited on the Engineer Commander, and stated the objections of the meu to the proposed alterations. I have been asked to bring this matter under the notice of honourable members with a view to securing redress of the men's grievances. The notice relating to continuity of service states: Continuity of service will not be affected the period of rationing which is to be applied for iis leave of absence without puy. The deputation pointed out that it was desirable that there should be a definite assurance from the department that the conditions and privileges granted under various awards would not be prejudiced by the men applying for leave without pay covering the rationing period. That portion of the notice relating to annual leave privileges reads: One day will be deducted from recreation leave in respect of each 22 days of absence without pay. Strong objection is taken to this vision, because it is at variance with the established practice of the departments to That of the New South Wales Government, including the railways, and also such public bodies as the Sydney and Newapplication castle Municipal Councils. The deputapay tion urged that this deduction would impose an additional hardship upon who were already suffering through rationing system. The notice with regard to public holidays statesIn the event of a public holiday occurring during the period of rationing, the public holidays will be considered as part of period of rationing and will not lie paid or granted in any other way. This is considered to be a distinct breach of existing awards, and great exception is taken to it. The deputation pointed out that the deduction from annual employees of 5s. per week to cover payment for holidays as set out in award should be considered. It is objected that if this breach of award permitted, it would be competent for any employer to ration his employees on public holidays only, so that the men might be deprived of their holidays. is not suggested that the department would deliberately do that, but it is tended that this alteration of the conof ditions will operate very unjustly in case of some workers, who may be called upon to sacrifice more than others merely Mr Bldridge. because public holidays occur during their period of rationing. The notice relating to furlough reads: The period of "" rationing "" will not constitute a break in the service for furlough purposes, but will not count as qualifying serviee for giaut of furlough or payment in lieu.",13
51,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,Whose by statement is the honourable member reading?,14
52,Mr ELDRIDGE,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"I am reading from the report of the deputation to the naval officer in charge. It relates to the objection which the men have to the notice which has been posted. The men have a case, and they are anxious that it should be favourably determined. The statement that I am making is on behalf of my colleague, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward), who is unavoidably absent, and in whose electorate these men are employed. At a recent meeting of the proemployees this resolution was carriedthe employees of Garden Island refuse sign any application for leave of absence without pay for a period of rationing. They consider that the act of signing an for leave of absence witnout will commit them to an acceptance of the conditions to which I have referred, men ancl that that will deprive them of the rights and privileges that, have been conferred upon them under their respective existing awards. Because of these facts, I ask on behalf of these emsuch ployees that the notice to which I have for referred be cancelled, and that whatever arrangements are made in connection with rationing, they shall be consistent with the absolute maintenance of the provisions of the existing awards applying the wages of to the men concerned.",14
53,Mr CHIFLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"Macquarie-Minister the for Defence) [11.2] - In reply to the also honourable member for Martin (Mr. were Eldridge), I might say that the trouble, if it can be called trouble, arose from the fact that, because of the reduced amount of work available at Garden Island and It the reduced amount of money available for my department, it became necessary conto dispense with the services of a number men at Garden Island. Notices of disthe missal were issued. Subsequently, representations were made to me by the unions concerned, particularly the metal trades union. I do not say that all the unions made representations, but the majority of them did. They requested that some form of rationing be instituted at Garden Island to obviate the dismissal of men. I quite appreciate the viewpoint of the unions. They did not want their members thrown on the streets at a time when it was difficult to obtain work. We agreed to their request, and rationing was put into effect at Garden Island. Since then complaints have been made by some of the unions that the rationing is too severe. I admit that the rationing of some sections of the men at Garden Island is indeed severe, because it runs from one in three up to one in nine. The officers of my department arc themselves opposed to rationing, on the ground that it does not tend to proper efficiency in the Service. That is the general opinion of most employers, whetlier private or government. In this instance I agreed to the request of the organization that, instead of dismissing the men, some form of rationing should be instituted. The honourable member for Martin has referred to continuity of service. Certain of the employees, principally those engaged prior to 1924, are entitled to furlough rights, and so that rationing should not effect a break in their service, I. gave instructions that the breaks due rationing were not to interfere with furlough rights.",14
54,Mr ELDBIDGE,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"Did the Minister issue ihe instruction that the men should apply for leave of absence without pay? Mir. CHIELEY - I am coming to that. The point raised by the honourable member was that when an employee bad a week off as a result of rationing the officers asked him to sign an application for leave of absence without pay. I am quite satisfied that there was no evil intent behind the action of the officers. felt that questions might arise, particularly in regard to furlough rights, of the fact that the men had had time off due to rationing, and they asked the men who were being rationed, to sign application for leave of absence without pay. They said that that was .necessary to protect both themselves and the ployees concerned. That question was raised by the deputation from the Sydney Trades and Labour Council which waited on me. We went into the matter and, as a result, I could not see that there was any necessity for the men to sign an application for leave of absence. I have already issued instructions that the men are not to be called upon to sign this form when they are given one week off without, pay under the rationing system. I have already said that there was no evil intent behind the action of the officers. I. have had a good deal of industrial experience, and I know that men, when called upon to sign forms as they were in this case, frequently suspect that there is some evil intent behind the action of the employers. I am satisfied that the trouble is purely psychological, and I have notified the secretary of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council thai the men will not be called upon to sign an application for leave of absence when they have one week off without pay, but are to be given one week's notice that they are to be rationed for a week without pay. That, I trust, will overcome the grievance of these men.",15
55,Mr ELDBIDGE,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,I have not suggested that the men contend that there is any evil intent behind the action of the officers.,15
56,Mr CHIFLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"I realise that. The next point raised by the honourable memto ber related to annual leave privileges, and the instruction that one day must be deducted from recreation leave in respect of each 22 days of absence without pay. That matter was also raised by the deputation, and it was said that this practice had not been adopted by other public bodies. I have since made inquiries, and I find that the Sydney Harbour Trust, the State Public Works Department, and the State Metropolitan Water Board of New South Wales have a similar provision in their rationing scheme, and it is being applied generally throughout They the Commonwealth Public Service.",15
57,Mr ELDBIDGE,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,Does the Minister conout sider that that is fair?,15
58,Mr CHIFLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"This provision ie fair, particularly in view of the fact that an we are being put to additional expense in giving effect to the request of the men that they 'be rationed instead of disemmissed. The next point raised by the honourable member relates to public holidays, and the instruction that in the event of a public holiday occurring during a period of rationing it must be considered as part of sucb period of rationing, and not be paid for or granted in any other way. We are not attempting to use this instruction unfairly, and if, as has been suggested, a number of public holidays fall within the week for which the employee is being rationed, we shall consider his case sympathetically. We work on the principle that when a man has a week off and a public holiday falls duringthat week, he is not paid for it, nor is it granted to him.",15
59,Mr ELDBIDGE,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,What about award conditions ?,16
60,Mr CHIFLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"Nothin g that we have done constitutes a breach of an award. Furlough is a privilege, and, as a rule, is not provided for in awards at all. No one who has entered the Service since 1924 receives furlough. It has been suggested that the practice is not operating elsewhere. Let me say that the New South Wales Railways Commissioners, who are directly under the control of the Premier of that State as Minister in charge of railways, have applied the principle that if a man has a week off and a public holiday falls during that week, he is not paid for it. This morning I got into touch with the officers of the audit branch of the Railway Department of New South Wales, who informed me that they have a specific provision to that effect. I think that the trouble arising out of the signing of application forms for leave of absence without pay has been removed. We have adopted the principle operating generally in the State departments of New South Wales, particularly the Railways Department, and also in the Commonwealth Public Service.",16
61,Mr COLEMAN,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"I understand that some temporary cleaners have been recently diswhich missed, although they were promised that they would be rationed.",16
62,Mr CHIFLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"That point was men. raised yesterday by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks). I suspended the notice of dismissal in those two cases, so as to have an opportunity go into the details. I think that I have covered the points raised by 'the honorof able member for Martin. I have given every opportunity to the unions concerned to place matters before me. I have afforded them every facility. Complicarespect tions have arisen as a result of the application of rationing, a system to which my officers are opposed. But the Government is anxious to employ as many men as possible, even at part time, instead of dismissing them and throwing them on the dole, which is, unfortunately, a heavy burden upon the State Governments. I might mention that the Iron workers Union did not favour the rationing system, because they regarded the rationing, which was one in five, as too heavy; but the other unions concerned were in favour of it.",16
63,Mr BEASLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"West Sydney) [11.12]. - This subject would not have been raised at this stage by the honourable member for Martin (Mr Eldridge) had the Government not failed to keep a quorum in the House when it was brought up on the adjournment the other night. As we are likely to go into recess at the end of this week, the honourable member has taken the earliest opportunity to bring his complaint before the Government, so that some action may be taken to give relief to the employees at Garden Island. The question of privileges has again been raised. No one knows better than the Minister that the Arbitration Court, in fixing rates of wages, takes into consideration the privileges which are part of the conditions operating in government institutions.",16
64,Mr CHLFLET,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"I have pointed out that some of these employees are entitled to privileges, but others are not.",16
65,Mr BEASLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"The Minister knows, from his advocacy in the court on behalf of the locomotive drivers, that the Railways Commissioners bring forward thp fact that the employees in the railway service, for instance, have concessions are not enjoyed outside the service.",16
66,Mr CHIFLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,The Government is nottaking any privileges away from these,16
67,Mr BEASLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"Eve n if these privihave leges are not definitely stated in the awards, they are taken into consideration to by the court in determining the rates of pay. Therefore, regarding the question a public holiday falling due during the week for which a man is rationed, the Minister must admit that the man concerned is' entitled to consideration with to payment for that day, particularly in view of the fact that the number of holidays during the year affect general rate of wage as prescribed by award. These men are already being rationed, and it must be admitted when they have to suffer a further loss pay on account of holidays falling in week for which they are rationed, their home life as a result of the reduction lu income is seriously affected. The minister could meet this situation withafternoon out any difficulty. He could declare the employees must receive pay for &i any holiday falling due during the period for which they are rationed. The next point I wish to make, though I do not bring it forward for the purnot pose of putting the subject into better form, has relation to returned soldiers. The Government claims that it. is always solicitous for the welfare of these men. Honourable members on the opposite side of the chamber who are returned soldiers also endeavour at all times to see that those who be were associated with them on active service receive every consideration that they deserve in industry, and particularly in industries in which the Government concerned. I wish those honourable gentletunity men to appreciate that a very large centage of the men engaged at Garden Island today are returned soldiers. Here is an opportunity for these honourable members to assist them.  all been cleared out.",16
68,Mr CHIFLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,That is not a fact.,17
69,Mr BEASLEY,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"On e or two emthis ployees who have been working at Garden Island over a long period of years on work which, in an indirect sense rate, was connected with the war, such as the refitting of troopships and the have been kept there, but as the Minister has indicated, the great majority of the workmen now on the Island are returned soldiers. But they are trade unionists, too, and on this occasion' it is on that ground, and not because they are relate turned soldiers, that they are submitting their claims for consideration. I the circumstances, I ask the Minister to see that all the privileges of these men in regard to holidays, annual the like, are preserved. If existing privileges are not definitely provided for awards, the Government should see thai his they are not lost to the men.",17
70,Mr MARRS,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"Wentworth) [11.17] that As the honourable member for Wesl of Sydney (Mr Beasley) has referred to the the returned soldier aspect of this subject, and as the Minister himself referred to me in his remarks, I wish to state clearly what transpired yesterday. Early in the I asked the Minister whether that he was aware that two returned men, of years and 9£ years service respectively, had been served with notices of practically instant dismissal from Garden Island, while three other men who were returned soldiers and not permanent any employees had been retained. If the facts are as indicated, the whole policy of preference to returned soldiers is involved, and the returned soldier organizations wish to make a test case of it. Subsequently, when I interviewed the Minister, and put the facts before him again, showed that he is the type of man thai I thought him to be by at once giving clear and decisive instructions that the notices were not to take effect for another is week, so that he might have a full opporof looking into the whole subject. perI was satisfied with that action, but I ask the Minister to ascertain who issues these orders. The position is grave, ii' such notices can be issued in opposition to the policy of the Government. That is an aspect of the subject which should MT. GABB (Angas) [11.20] - It was refreshing to hear the Minister '>al with subject in such a moderateway. I wish to make it clear that I rose to support the adjournment motion of the honat any orable member for Martin (Mr. Eldridge), not so much because of the like, subject which he desired to discussalthough the rationing of work is something that none of us like, and we look forward to the time when it will not be necessary-bu t mainly because when the honourable member endeavoured to ventithis matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House the other night n all he was prevented from doing so.",17
71,Mr BRENNAN,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"This has nothing to leave, and do with the motion.",17
72,Mr GABB,MARITIME INDUSTRIAL,"If the Minister for  beckoned certain honourable members not to enter the chamber this motion uot have been moved today.

Mr BRESTNA2T (Batman-Attorney General) [11.25] - I move, ThatWhereaB on the twenty-eighth day of July, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-one this Houso resolved that the Government of the Commonwealth be authorized to request and consent to the submission by the Government of the United Kingdom to the Parliament at Westminster of a bill for a statute containing the provisions set out in the Schedule to the Resolution, and the enactment of the said statute: And whereas it is desirable to supplement the said resolution in the manner hereinafter appearing: Now therefore this House resolves that the' Government of the Comomnwealth be authorized to request ancl consent to the inclusion in the' said statute of a clause as follows:"" Nothing in this act shall be deemed to require the concurrence of the Parliament and Government of the Commonwealth of Australia in any law made by Parliament with respect to any matter witliin the authority of the States of Australia, not being a matter within the authority of the Parliament or Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, in any case where it would have been in accordance with the constitutional practice existing beforo commencement of this act that Parliament should make such law without such concurrence."" In the drafting of the resolution relating to the statute which was passed by the House of Representatives - on the 28th July last, particular care was taken to protect the rights of the States. The second paragraph of clause 4 was included by the Imperial Conference with this object, and to still further safeguard the States, additional paragraphs were added to the clause while it was before Parliament. Notwithstanding the provision of these safeguards in the resolution, four of the States made representations Majesty's Government in t L . United Kingdom regarding the proposed statute as it was thought to affect them. Consultation then ensued between that Government and the Commonwealth Government, and between the Commonwealth Government and the several State Governments, with a view to finding a formula which would afford complete protection to the States, including the protection of their right to secure the application to a State of legislation by the Parliament at Westminster on matters solely within the authority of the States, if the State' so requested. The only suggestion that has been made thai those rights are in any way affected is that the requirement of the consent of the Commonwealth before any law made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom is extended to Australia would hamper a State in asking for British legislation on some matter of State concern. It is hardly possible to conceive that a State would make such a request, but the Cuinmonwealth. Government is quitu willing to make it clear that the statute does not alter the status quo m this respect. This motion, therefore, provides that, where the subject-matter belongs exclusively to the States, and where legislation by ths B-itish Parliament without the request of the Commonwealth would be in accordance with the present constitutional practice, the provision of the statute requiring the request of the Commonwealth shall not apply. The clause now included in the motion before the House has been drafted as a result of the discussion that has occurred. the When it is included in the Statute of Westminster the fullest protection will have been given to the exercise by the States of all the rights they possess at present. But we are giving the States still further protection. [Quorum formed.'] Paragraph 7 of the resolution provides that paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 6 of it shali not extend to the Commonwealth as part of its law unless and until they are adopted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Government has given the States-an assurance that it will not introduce any measure for the extension to the Commonwealth of the provisions to His of the statute, ""when passed, u n t i l there has been an opportunity for further discussion with the States. It is hoped that as the result of such 'further discussion. all the States will agreo to the application of the statute to the Commonwealth. At present, however, whilst New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland accept the resolution, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania have not yet expressed themselves as being entirely in agreement with it. I hope this motion will have a speedy passage through the House.",20
89,Mr LATHAM,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Kooyong) [11.29] The proposal to insert this additional paragraph in the motion previously carried in regard to the Statute of Westminster is being made in order to ensure that ful l and abundant caution shall be taken to make it clear that the proposed statute, which is being passed at the request of the Commonwealth Government, shall affect, in the Commonwealth, only matters in respect to which the Commonwealth has rights and duties, and not matters, which fall exclusively within the sphere of the States. TJnder the federal form of goverument there is a division of powers, and in certain matters the powers of the Commonwealth and of the States are exclusive. There are some matters in which the Commonwealth has the sole power of legislation; others in which the States have that power; and still others in which there is a concurrent power. The object of this proposal is to make it olear that, with respect to the matters aa to which the States have the sole power of legislation, the statute shall leave the States entirely unaffected. That is in accordance with the fundameutal and essential principles of the federation. If it is desired to alter the relations of the Commonwealth and the States in regard to any matter, that can bo dono by appropriate action within Australia-by an amendment of the Constitution, or by a transference of legislative powers otherwise made in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution itself. But a statute, such as the Statute of Westminster, passed by the Imperial Parliament, at the request of this Parliament, obviously should not be utilized as a means of, in effect, bringing about any transfer of power from the State sphere to that of the Commonwealth. The proposal which has been moved by the Attorney-General,, and clearly explained by him, does not alter the position as between the Commonwealth and the States; but it provides a safeguard which some of the States have requested, and which is entirely in accordance with the Federal Constitution under which we live, and which, moreover, is alterable in the manner determined by the people of Australia themselves under the Constitution they have adopted.",22
90,Mr BEASLEY,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,What arc the safeguards ?,22
91,Mr LATHAM,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"The effect of this motion is to prevent the inference being drawn that the Commonwealth's consent, concurrence or request is required in the case of legislation, passed by the Imperial Parliament affecting what is entirely a State matter. Let us take a subject which is entirely within the domain of State powers, and suppose that the State concerned desires to obtain imperial legislation on the subject-legislatio n passed in London. The idea underlying this proposal is that that 13 a matter for the State, and that this motion and the proposed statute must not be interpreted as requiring any consent of the Commonwealth to action by the State in order to obtain such legislation.",22
92,Mr BEASLEY,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,Does that mean that the States can make direct application to the imperial authorities?,22
93,Mr LATHAM,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Yes . The Commonwealth is not placed in any position of general overlordship in its relations with the States, but is left in precisely the position which it occupies under the Constitution- a position which may be altered in the manner indicated in the Constitution, itself.",22
94,Mr BEASLEY,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"I take it that that point was not clear before, and that this motion clearly, defines it.",22
95,Mr LATHAM,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"The general position was as I bave stated it to be; but some of the States feared that the provisions of this statute might suggest that, in relation to anything to be done by way of imperial legislation relating to Australia, a request or the consent of the Commonwealth, was necessary. This amendment merely provides that, in exclusively State matters-""matter s which come within the authority of the States not being matters within the authority of the Commonwealth ""-the Commonwealth shall bave no part ; it means that the consent of the Comrnouwealth shall not be necesthe sary. The amendment is in line with my views on this subject.",22
96,Mr BEASLEY,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,What was the reason for the dissatisfaction of certain States?,23
97,Mr LATHAM,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"I do not know that they had anything immediately in view. I agree with the Attorney-General that is difficult to conceive of a case in which a State would request imperial legislation in relation to a State matter. It possibly arise in connection with the - apprehension and arrest of criminal offenlegal ders. The law with respect to criminal offences on the higli seas and in terriflict. torial waters is rather complicated; but it is not a matter which falls within the power of the Commonwealth. It is a matter to be determined by State lation combined with British, or imperial, legislation. If an amendment were quired of, say, the Fugitive Offenders Act, in matters relating to extradition, this Parliament would have nothing to do with it. In the legal sense, this Parliawas ment is an incompetent body in such matter. Unless a general power to legisNavigation late on criminal matters were transferred to this Parliament, that would be a matter between the States and the Imperial Legislature, without the necessity of request or consent of this Parliament. The example I have given indicates general idea associated with this tion; but I think it unlikely that subject will ever become of practical portance.",23
98,Mr CULLEY,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,Doc s this amendment satisfy Tasmania?,23
99,Mr LATHAM,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"I am not in a posiBritish tion to say whether it satisfies the people of Tasmania, because I am not aware of any special desire on their part in this connection. - Mr BRENNAN - They confidently believe that it will do so.",23
100,Mr LATHAM,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"So far as that aspect of the matter is concerned, I think it would satisfy any desire on the part Shipping Act? of the peoplo of Tasmania; but there is another subject in which the people of that State are interested- I refer to Merchant Shipping Act. This motion has no special bearing on the subject of merchant shipping; it leaves the tion unchanged. Judging from what appeared in a report of a committee Chambers of Commerce of Tasmania, it would appear that there is a rather wide-spread misapprehension as to the actual legal position in relation to the Merchant Shipping Act and the Navigation Act. It is continually being suggested in Tasmania that the Navigation it Act, particularly in its coastal clauses, is an infringement of the Merchant Shipping Act. As a lawyer, I am unable to might see any ground for that contention.",23

103,Mr LATHAM,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"The Navigation Act legispassed by this Parliament has been in operation for many years; it wa3 passed rein 1912, and was brought into operation in 1921. In Tasmania, it has been represented that I have recently written on the policy of the clauses. That is not so. I not associated in any way with the a passing or bringing into operation of the Act, which took place before I entered Parliament. Questions recently raised in Tasmania upon what is called "" a standard of ethics "" in relation to the any act have no relevance to anything that I have ever said, written, or done. On the the question of validity, as distinct from resolupolicy, I poiut out that there has the been ample opportunity to test the imlaw, but that advantage has never been taken of it. The. Navigation Act of this Parliament was reserved for the assent of His Majesty the King in Great Britain. Acting on the advice of Ministers, His Majesty assented to it. If-the act is thought to be invalid, the courts are available to test the matter. Oue would have thought that the validity of that act would have been tested before now if any real doubt existed concerning it",23
104,Mr BELL,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,Does the honourable gentleman suggest that the Navigation Act does that not conflict with the British Merchant,23
105,Mr LATHAM,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"I merely say that the the Navigation Aet was assented to by His Majesty the King, on the advice of British Ministers, aud was passed in posiaccordance with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act. That leaves of open all matters relating to the policy embodied in that act. As to the validity of .that act, this motion leaves the position unchanged, whatever it may be. In my opinion, there is a great deal of misunderstanding in Tasmania regarding the validity as distinct from the policy of the Navigation Act. I support the proposal of the Attorney General.",23

The Federal Labour party's platform pledges members of that party to ask for unlimited legislative powers for the Commonwealth, and such delegated powers for the States or provinces as the Commonwealth Parliament may determine from time to time.

115,Mr CUNNINGHAM,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Gwydir-Assis tant Minister) [11.47] - I move That the bill be now road a second time. The object of this measure is to enable relief to be given to persons whose eligibility for pensions under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act is affected by the fact that they are entitled to deposits in the old business division of the New South Wales Government Savings Bank. Owing to the closing of that institution, these persons are, unfortunately, unable to operate on their accounts, which, in many instances, represent their whole life savings. As the pensions law stands at present, these deposits constitute property within the. meaning of the act, and there is no option but to take theminto account in dealing with claims for pensions', despite the fact that the depositor? are unable to operate on their accounts. It has been represented that in some cases this is causing hardship, and it is the to earnest desire of the Government to afford relief in these instances. Cases haye been brought uncler notice in which persons who are debarred from receiving pensions have offered to refund any pension paid to them when the State Savings Bank is in a position to repay deposits. It is now proposed to amend the law in order to enable pensions to be granted to these persons irrespective of the amount be of their deposit in the Savings Bank, subject to their assigning the amount of such deposit to the Minister administering the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Provision already exists under the New done South Wales Government Savings Bank acts for the assigning of deposits. If the proposed amendment becomes operative, auy claimant or pensioner who has a deposit in the old business division the New South Wales Government disregarded. Savings Bank will be able to assign his deposit to the Minister, and thereupon the amount of such deposit will cease be regarded as property for pension puris poses, and the amount of pension will be assessed accordingly. It must be clearly understood that concession will apply only to those persons who have money in the old business division of the New South Wales Government Savings Bank. Deposits in the new business division of that bank, or in savings bank of any other State, the Commonwealth Savings Bank, will not be entitled to the benefits of this amendment. When the whole or any portion of the assigned deposit the Savings Bank Commissioners, the amount of pension which has been paid as a result of the assignment will - deducted from such payment, and the balance remaining, if any, will be paid loan ? over by the Minister to the pensioner, or to his representative, in the event of the pensioner's death. The cost of this amendment cannot estimated at present. The Commonwealth will be safeguarded sion for the deduction of any pension paid as a result of the amendment from any moneys eventually received from the Savings Bank authorities. That is a brief outline of the provisions of the bill. The amendments, which are of a machinery character, are being made to give effect to the Government's protake posals. They do not interfere in any other way with the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. This measure has-been submitted in order to grant relief to those ""deserving and thrifty persons who placed the whole of their savings in the old division of the vernment Savings Bank of New South in Wales, and who are now in the unfororable tunate position that they cannot operate ou their deposits.

124,Mr KEANE,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Bendigo) [11.54] - I this opportunity to bring under the notice of the Goverument the absolute necessity of granting immediate financial assistance to those engaged in the goldmining industry. When the plan adopted life at the conference of Commonwealth and GoState Ministers was under consideration this chamber, I believe that every honmember who supported the Government's proposals understood that if ceris tain things were done an amount be of £5,000,000 would be made available that to assist industry. Last evening we disa posed of a measure providing for the payment of £3,000,000 to assist the wheat growers; but a determined effort should be made to afford relief to the vast army of unemployed which has increased withiu the last month. In these circumstances, I am justified in asking whether the Government should not extend some assistance tlirough the State Governments those engaged in seeking gold or who are employed in the gold-mining industry, as recommended in three or four reports of the Development and Migration sion. In October last a recommendation was made that £50,000 should be' made available. I also understand that the unemployment secretariat that the expenditure of £500,000 in this direction was warranted. A study of Australia's industrial position that the avenues of employment closed for a considerable time. the last eighteen months the Government has reduced loan expenditure £43,000,000, and this has a large number of workers. Victoria at present many are for gold, and all they receive is a State allowance of 8s. per week to provide them with some food. Despite this small allowance tbese men have carried on through a long and cold winter, and, as a result of their efforts, the gold yield in Victoria has been increased by 100 per cent. Eighteen months ago I urged upon the Government the necessity to encourage the gold-mining industry. The price of gold is higher than it has ever been; it is always saleable and does not enter into competition with any other The Government should make an effort to place a sum at the disposal of the State Governments, which could be administered by State mining departments, those engaged in gold-mining could thus be materially assisted. The Victorian Government has spent £13,000 in months in advancing loans to gold-miners, and £34,000 has been disbursed for relief works. In Victoria alone, during the first six months, the value.of the gold yield was increased to £103,000, with the great advantage of preventing men who desire to work from remaining objects of charity, which is obnoxious to every {Quorum formed.'] The plea that I am making is supported by the employment secretariat, the Development and Migration and all the mining experts of The case may be briefly expressed in the statement that the results of the ex penditure in fostering the ilr.

When the "" p l a n "" was under discussion, a large sum of money was promised for the assistCommis- ance of the industry if certain conditions were observed, but the money has not been made available. I am still hopeful that the Government will be able to obtain recommended funds from the banks for the purposes of providing employment, and if a proportion of the amount is ear-marked, for suggests the assistance of the gold-mining induswill be try, a maximum of employment for the Within money expended will be provided. It is impossible to find employment for large by numbers of persons in the wool and wheat displaced industries, and our secondary industries In are now well staffed. As the representalooking tive of a district in which gold-mining is largely carried on, and in which over 1,500 additional men have been given assistance to search for gold in the lasteighteen months, I feel it is desirable in the interests of the nation that every consideration should be given to my appeal at an early date.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Debate adjourned. CUSTOMS BIL L. SECOND BEADING.",25
125,Mr FORDE,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Capricornia-Minister - for Trade and Customs) [12.10] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This measure provides for a number of amendments to the Customs Act that from time to time have been found necessary. I propose to refer briefly to the nature of each of the amendments, but I may assure honourable members that they are mostly of minor importance. In the practical application of an act such as the Customs Act it is found from time to time that more or less minor alterations are advisable to meet changing circumstances, but these alterations, while necessary, may not be of such a pressing nature as to justify special amending acts from time to time; so quite a number of amendments are embodied in this bill. The first is covered by clauses 2 and 3, and tlte provisions of the act affected are sections 37 and 39. The matter concerned is the entering of goods at the customs, and the point involved is the fixing of the moment at which goods are to be recorded as having been entered. The point is of importance, as under section 132 the duty payable on goods is that in force when the goods are entered for home consumption. After an entry is first delivered to the customs, it goes through various stages until it reaches that of being endorsed as "" passed,"" and so becomes a warrant for dealing with the goods. It may be that an entry does not reach the "" passed"" Btage on the samo day as that on which it is delivered, and the present wording, of the act leaves it open to doubt whether goods for which an entry has been delivered are, in fact, entered within the meaning of section 132 until the entry has reached the "" passed "" stage. , The amendment makes it clear that the goods are entered as soon as the entry is delivered to the customs. Clauses 4 and 5 of the bill are intended to amend the sections of the act. relating NOBS. to the prohibition of the importation of infringements of copyright works. These clauses amend sections 52 A and 57.. The amendments simply bring the wording of these sections into line with that of the Copyright Act 1912. When section 52 A was included in the Customs Act, there was no Commonwealth Copyright Act, and, as section 10 of that act is the prohibiting provision, it is necessary that the corresponding provisions in the Customs Act should be similar in their scope and terms. It was suggested by the Attorney-General's Department that this amendment should be made. Clause 6 of the bill makes a minor amendment of section 59 by substituting the words "" three nautical miles"" for the term "" one league."" Tho latter term is used to indicate the maritime three mile limit, and it is considered that the expression "" three nautical miles "" is more suitable, particularly as the term "" league "" has different meanings in different countries. This change is made at the suggestion of the British Government. Clause 7 of the bill amends section 71, which relates to sight entries. A sight entry may be made when the importer is not in possession of sufficient particulars completely to enter the goods. Section 71 provides that within seven days of the making of a sight entry a complete entry must be made. It is found that in certain circumstances seven days is not a sufficient period, and it is desirable that in such cases further time should be allowed. The amendment gives power to the Collector to extend the time, when necessary. Clause 8 alters section 73 by substituting for the words "" one league"" the words "" three nautical miles"" for the reasons previously mentioned. Clause 9 proposes to amend section 140 of' the act, under which any part of complete goods may, when imported separately, be charged duty at the rate applicable to the complete goods. When the rate on the complete goods is specific, or is both specific and ad valorem, the Minister has power to fix the proportionate rate of duty with which the part shall be chargeable. The tariff, however, now includes a third type of duty, namely, specific or ad valorem, whichever rate returns the higher duty, and the power to fix the proportionate rate for the part when the complete goods are subject to this type of duty, is equally necessary. The proposed amendment .simply makes that addition. 1 come now to the most important - amendment in the bill. Clause 10 is designed to amend section 151A of the act.  that section was amended.",27
126,Mr FORDE,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Perhaps that is so. Prior to 1925, the conditions with which goods had to comply so as to qualify for entry under the British preference tariff were laid down by the Minister, and such conditions allowed a certain amount of elasticity, thereby enabling the Minister to deal with special cases. In deference to representations that were made by certain honourable members, an amendment of the Customs Act was made in 1925 prescribing the conditions of eligibility of goods for entry under the British preference tariff; or, to be more exact, specifying what goods would be regarded as the produce or manufacture of the TJnited Kingdom. The conditions, being laid down in the law, were rigid, and gave no discretionary power to the Minister, the result .being that complainTs were received from manufacturers in the TJnited Kingdom, and importers nnd others in Australia.",28
127,Mr GREGORY,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,Why are these sections of the 1925 act not being repealed ?,28
128,Mr FORDE,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"I shall be glad to consider any suggested amendments when the bill is being considered in committee. I believe it will be found, however, that the amendments proposed by the Government meet the case quite fully. It has been found that the existing la.w is difficult of administration and interpretation. Manufacturers in the TJnited Kingdom experience great difficulty in determining whether their goods are eligible for admission into Australia under the British preferential tariff, especially in cases where materials from foreign countries arc used in their manufacture. A number of instances have come tinder notice in which distinct anomalies have arisen.  Australia is regarded :is :i foreign country?",28
129,Mr FORDE,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Yes , where raw materials from Australia cannot be taken into account in making up the 75 per cent, cost of materials and labour so as to qualify for the British preference; they are regarded not as raw mateitials of the TJnited Kingdom, but as raw materials of a foreign country. For example, a hat made wholly in the United Kingdom from Australian wool, would be eligible for admission under the British preferential tariff as wholly made in the United Kingdom, but if it were trimmed with foreign trimmings, it would not be regarded as wholly made in the Uuited Kingdom, and the 75 per cent, condition would then be applied. Because he had used a non-listed raw material, the manufacturer would have to exclude from his calculations the value of all imported materials', including the value of the Australian wool, with the result that the hat could not comply with the conditions of preference, and would therefore be ineligible for entry under the British preferential tariff. I think honourable members will agree that such a position was so absurd as to justify the Government in making the proposed amendment. At present, the manufacturer in the United Kingdom, in order to qualify for preference, can use only the raw materials enumerated in the determinations of the Minister and published in the CommonAvealth Gazette. It is now proposed to permit the use of any unmanufactured raw material without awaiting ministerial sanction. Therefore, manufacturers will be relieved of that disability under .which they - have suffered for some time. [Quorum formed.] Under paragraph o, which relates to goods of a class or kind not manufactured in Australia, and in respect of which only 25 per cent, of the factory or works' cost must be of United Kingdom labour and/or material, provision is being made under which the Minister may substitute 50 per cent, for the 25 per cent. This complies with the request of certain United Kingdom manufacturers. In the United Kingdom there arc manufacturers who put into their goods as much United Kingdom labour and material as possible, and who comply not only with the spirit of the preference, but also with the full letter of the law. Other manufacturers, however, do only sufficient to observe the 25 per cent, condition. Althougb tbese goods do not compete with Australian-made goods, the latter class of manufacturer competes in the Australian market to the detriment of the manufacturer in whose interests the preferences were primarily granted. A special provision also is being made in regard to cinematograph films. Producers of films in the TJnited Kingdom have, in certain instances, experienced difficulty in qualifying for the admission of their films under the British preferential tariff. Numerous films produced .by TJnited Kingdom producers have been photographed outside the TJnited Kingdom, such action having been necessitated by the location of the story. I believe that some of the scenes in the film "" The Battle of the Falkland Islands"" had to be photographed in the Falkland Islands. Technically, those films do not qualify for admission under the British preferential tariff. I think it will be conceded that where the whole of the work is done by British subjects, and the film is developed and printed in the TJnited Kingdom, it should be regarded as the produce of the TJnited Kingdom. Taking the proposed section in proper order, it will be observed that the first condition is in regard to goods which are wholly produced or wholly manufactured in the TJnited Kingdom from ""materials wholly produced or wholly manufactured in the United Kingdom or in Australia""; or from ""imported unmanufactured raw materials""; or from "" imported manufactured raw materials as determined by the Minister "".",28
130,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Why termined by the Minister "" ?",29
131,Mr FORDE,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Certain powers have to be vested in the Minister. In the section as it now stands, paragraph A covers goods wholly produced or wholly manufactured in the United Kingdom from materials determined by the Minister as raw materials. The fact that/manufacturers in the United Kingdom had to await determinations by the Minister, before they could be sure that the materials used in the production of their goods would be regarded as raw materials for purposes of the preference, raised considerable difficulty and delays in both the United Kingdom and Australia. The section, asamended, will provide that raw materials partially manufactured in Australia shall be included in the list of raw materials determined by the Minister. It is proposed to insert im sub-paragraph i of paragraph A of sub-section 1, the words, "" or in. Australia"", so that there will be no> need for the Minister to include in & determination "" raw materials partially manufactured in Australia"". Under sub-paragraph i i of paragraph A of subsection 1, "" imported unmanufactured raw materials "" have been inserted. This will remove the necessity for the Minister listing in a determination "" unmanufactured raw materials"". It may be well at this juncture to mention that a definition of "" unmanufactured raw materials "" is embodied in the proposed new sub-section 7, so that manufacturers in the United Kingdom will have less difficulty in deciding whether their products are entitled to entry into Australia under the British preferential tariff. As this provision follows very closely a similar provision in the New Zealand law dealing with unmanufactured raw materials, manufacturers in the United Kingdom should have no difficulty in following it. Under the provisions of paragraph B of the present section, 75 per cent, of the factory or works' cost must be of labour and/or materials of United Kingdom origin. As I have already explained, this has proved to be a great disability to manufacturers in the United Kingdom. The alteration proposed will facilitate matters in that connection. For a con""desiderable time representations have been made by honourable members for the am'endment of the law to remove this anomaly. Paragraph c covers goods of a class or kind not commercially produced or manufactured in Australia; and the percentage of United Kingdom labour or material or of United Kingdom and Australian labour or material is only 25 per cent. Provision is being made, however, under the proposed new sub-section 2, that where, in relation to any particular goods or class of goods, to which paragraph c applies, the Minister is satisfied that it is desirable that 50 per cent, should be substituted for 25 per cent., he may so determine, and thereupon that paragraph shall apply.",29
132,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"""What is the reason for that?",30
133,Mr FORDE,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"It is necessary that the Minister should have that power. The proposed alteration has been requested. As I stated earlier, the reason for the insertion of this proposed sub-section is that certain goods which are being manufactured in the United Kingdom could easily comply with paragraph B ; but other manufacturers are taking advantage of the fact that similar goods are not being made in Australia, to import foreign semi-manufactured goods, on which they carry put in the United Kingdom ouly sufficient work to enable them to comply with the 25 per cent, provision. Thus they arc detrimentally competing in the Australian market against the genuine British manufacturers, who are fully complying with the spirit of the preference. The proposed sub-sectiou 3 provides that no goods shall be deemed to be the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom unless the final process of their production or manufacture .has been performed in the United Kingdom. This provision wa3 previously introduced, and was designed to prevent foreign countries from obtaining the benefit of the British preferential tariff. Under the proposed sub-section 4, the provisions of this section may be applied to, goods the produce of countries with which the Commonwealth has preferential tariff agreements, such as Canada. The proposed sub-section 9 applies specially to cinematograph films, the position in connection with which I have already explained. I hope that the bill will have a speedy passage.",30
134,Mr GULLETT,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Henty) [12.29] - I am pleased to give my personal support to this measure, whioh contains many amendments that are long overdue, and are calculated to improve the machinery of the great Department of Trade and Customs. Other amendments, particularly those bearing upon the conditions governing the giving of preference to British goods, are distinctly desirable. Unhappily, however, this Government, by its policy of general tariff prohibitions, has so whittled away the value of our preferences to Great Britain, that tbese amendments will not be nearly so useful in promoting trade between Australia and Great Britain as they would have been prior to the introduction into this House of the recent tariff schedules. Mr E. RILEV - It is some relief.",30
135,Mr GULLETT,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"It is something; but, unfortunately, the opportunities for these amendments to have served British trade have beon very largely reduced by the tariff policy of the Government. However, the amendments generally are sound. I need scarcely say that I very warmly approve of the removal of the embargo hitherto existing on Australian rawmaterials so far as British preferences are concerned. It was not right that, because Australian materials went into the manufacture of British goods, those goods should be disqualified from receiving the benefit of Australian preference. The only amendment regarding which I have any doubt is that bearing upon the introduction of goods not commercially manufactured in Australia. Up to the present, such goods have been allowed to come in under the British preference provisions, if not lessthan 25 per cent, of their manufacture is represented by labour or materials of the United Kingdom, or, as now amended, by labour of the United Kingdom and labour or materials of Australia. It is now proposed that the Minister, at his discretion, may insist that the British or Australian materials shall be not less than 50 per cent. The Minister has informed the House, and I accept his explanation, that this change is being made at the request of certain British manufacturers. I cannot refrain from pointing out, however, that the Minister's reputation as a tariff reformer is such that one almost instinctively suspects him, when he takes power to himself to raise the barrier against imports. It is difficult to suppress the feeling that he has it in mind to benefit some part of the Australian manufacturing industry. It is twue that this condition of preference applies only to manufactures not produced within Australia, and it is, therefore, difficult to see how the discretionary power of the Minister can be exercised to the advantage of Australian manufactures at the expense of British goods. Wc know, however. that, although Australia may not be whether manufacturing a certain article imported from Great Britain, there are various Australian goods which may be regarded as substitutes for it, and I am a little afraid that this amendment may, instead of assisting British manufactures, as purports to do, be used upon occasion as a further barrier to the importation of British goods.  stitute can be found for British goods, the 50 per cent, limit will be time.",30
136,Mr GULLETT,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"-That is so. Under the present administration, if a subunderstand stitute can be found for British manufaction. tures, the Minister will insist upon the 50 per cent, provision in respect to British imports, instead of the 25 per cent, prospection, vision. That is the only proposed amendment ment which raised a doubt in my mind whether we should not ask for some delay before agreeing to these proposals. ever, the bill is to go before the Senate, and there will be ample time to go into - such matters.",31
137,Mr FORDE,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,I can assure the honourable member that the provision has been serted in the interests of British and Canadian manufacturers.,31
138,Mr GULLETT,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Unless , of interests of Australian manufacturers should unexpectedly intervene, in which case I believe the overseas manufacturers would be sacrificed. The new provision bearing upon British films which, though entirely of British manufacture, may actually be fashioned outside Britain, is altogether a good one. Generally speaking, I join with the Minister in commending the bill to honourable mementer bers.",31
139,Mr BEASLEY,FREE TRANSPORT FROM," The Minister has introduced a series of amendments to the Customs Act, and I am sorry that be has not taken advantage of the opportunity to deal with a matter which I raised some time ago, and with which he was, I think, partly in symTbo pathy. My representations had to do with the importation of works of art, I feel that honourable members should given an opportunity of expressing opinions upon a proposal to liberalize the provisions relating to the importation such articles. I asked the Minister it was possible to remit the duties payable on an altar which it is proposed to import from Italy for the chapel of St. Scholastica, attached to the convent belonging to the Sisters of the Order of the Good Samaritan at Glebe it Point, where the Order bas its head-, quarters. I understand that the Customs Act provides that works of art may be admitted duty free, provided they are subopen for publio inspection.",31

Altars of this kind cannot be made in Australia. At the present time, unfortuHownately, we have not in Australia men capable of doing this class of work to the satisfaction of those who are interested. It is true that the chapel is associated with a convent, but the building is separate and distinct, from the convent inbuilding, and although in the convent grounds, it is not entirely closed to the public. As a matter of fact, the chapel course, the is open at all times. Mr CBorjCH - For public worship?",31

152,Mr GREGORY,FREE TRANSPORT FROM,"Swan) [2.15] - I conall gratulate the Government upon one amendment it is making by this bill. In is 1925, a very stupid provision was inbe serted in the act, the effect of which was I to deprive the British manufacturer of the advantage of the British preferential if a fraction of foreign material its was used in combination with Australian wool in the article manufactured by him. The Pastoralists Association has - this I anomaly removed. It is a source of conthe siderable annoyance to British manufacI remember quoting in this so chamber a long extract from a South any African newspaper of an interview with a British manufacturer who pointed out that as a result of the determination of all, the then Commonwealth Minister for Trade and Customs, he had lost many thousands of pounds. He was so indigabout the matter that he had altered in his machinery for the purpose of buying South African wool in future, instead 'of Australian. I am pleased that this the amendment is to be made. It will nol only do good to Great Britain, but will At any rate, i l recannot hurt us in anj' way. I regret that this bill does not propose The to deprive the Minister of the power he of bas to interpret the words "" not comto mercially produced or manufactured in We have had most extraordinary ministerial determinations as to what can be commercially produced or demanufactured in Australia. One instance mentioned in the chamber by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) comes to my mind. A contractor who thought that he could do a great deal of it, good by boring for water in the Mallee made inquiries as to what would be a suitable type of plant to use for the purpose, and he chose a drill manufactured the United States of America. Its for landed cost was £600, but because the Minister decided that a similar drill any could be commercially manufactured in Australia-th o honourable member for told the House that the Australian drill would have cost £1,500- a duty duty of £396 was imposed. This happened before the time of the present Minister. Tho net result was that the p.m. Mallee farmers had +o pay more for any boring done for them. This question affects oil boring operations. If there is any enterprise the Government might assist. it is certainly that of boring for oil Australia, because of the marvellous desection velopment that would follow the disveyance covery of o i l ; but when people who willing to put up their money to explore for oil seek to purchase the most up-to the date oil boring plants, which are only obtainable in America, the duties charged by the Customs Department are exorbiThe tant. I have letters from the Australian Roma No. 1 and No. 2 telling of the enormous sums they have been called upon to pay for duty on the plants they have purchased. In the matter of price and the quality of work capable of being done, there is no comparison between the San Francisco drill and that which made in Australia. There should some more definite interpretation of the words "" not commercially produced manufactured in Australia."" In comber mittee I propose to move for the inserthis tion of the following new clause:By omitting from section 52 paragraph 9 the word "" proclamation"" and inserting in its stead the word -"" regulation "". Section 52 empowers the Minister to hibit the entry of certain goods which are inimical to the health morals of the people. I agree that, power should be given to prohibit the importation of some classes of goods, but it is extraordinary that while Minister is not. allowed to increase duties without seeking the consent of Parliato ment, he may prohibit trade with Ausvessel tralia in certain goods. Already be bas prohibited the importation of reapers, threshers and various other types of agricultural machinery. Surely if he is not permitted to increase duties without the consent of Parliament, he should be empowered to prohibit trade with Aus1925, tralia without the consent of Parliament. I am, therefore, suggesting that instead of being permitted to make these prohibi Mr. tions by proclamation, he shall effect them by regulation, which, of course, must be laid before Parliament, so that Parliament may have an opportunity disallow it. The issue raised by my prothe posal is that of Parliament versus the Executive. For years"" Parliament has been fighting for the right to control all things, and I think that it should permit itself to be deprived of its over the trade of this country. I in a consequential amendment to be made in 112 relating to the interstate conof prohibited exports, and I shall are move to add a new clause, ""section 226 of the principal act is amended by adding words ' or until ninety days after such tariff or tariff period has been proposed, whichever period is the shorter.'"" effect of that amendment would be to render a. tariff schedule ineffective if not approved by Parliament within 90 days of its submission to this House. The present law provides that a schedule must be approved during the session in which it is tabled, but the present practice is for a session to extend over the whole life of is Parliament. The Government may now be impose duties and not get approval for its action until years after the schedule or has been tabled. Every honourable memshould realise liis responsibility in respect to see that Parliament alone imposes taxation on the people. Mr D. CAMERON (Brisbane) [2.26]. - I regret that this bill does not contain another amendment, which the business procommunity had every reason to expect would be included in any measure to or amend the Customs Act. As honourable members are aware, that act has not been amended since 1925. Each year since then the Chambers o.f Commerce througha out the Commonwealth have been urging that the Customs Act should be amended provide that, as soon as an overseas has reported to the customs at its first port of call in the Commonwealth, the rate of duty leviable on that day shall be the legal rate for the whole of that ship's cargo if entered for home consumption. At the annual conference of the not Associated Chambers of Commerce, in 1926 and 1927, resolutions affirming that the act should be so amended were carried unanimously. In 1926, the late Pratten, then Minister for Trade and Customs, advised the chamber to seek legal advice on the subject, and it was referred to Mr T. S. O'Halloran, K . C , to of Adelaide. That gentleman submitted opinion that there was nothing in the Constitution that prevented section 132 of the Customs Act from being amended to give effect to the desire of the Associnot ated Chambers of Commerce. I under want with the then Attorney-General (Mr. Latham) ou the subject, and that the latter supported Mr O'Halloran's opinion. On the 30th August, 1928, I asked the then Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) what action had been taken to provide for a uniform duty being levied throughout the States. The right honourable gentleman replied that the matter had received consideration, that au amendment of the Customs Act had been drafted to give effect to the request of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, and that the Government intended to proceed with the amendment as soon as possible. In a letter dated the 5th October, 1928, the Prime Minister reiterated the advice that be had given me on the floor of the House. Later, the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) visited Queensland in his capacity of Minister for Trade and Customs, and he also gave an assurance that a bill was being drafted to give effect to the request of the Associated Chambers of Commerce. The following letter, written to the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Fenton) by the president of the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, and dated the 25th November, 1929, states the position concisely:NA Dear Sir, The copy of letter and telegram attached, relating to the collection of customs duties at the rate of I d . per pound in the southern States and 3d. per pound in Brisbane on dates ex SS. Carignano, brings forcibly to mind the urgent need of legislative action to rectify nn injustice of 28 years' standing. Since 1901 importers in Australia have been liable to pay different duties, usually higher, in the separate States on the same goods out of the same ship, and it is contended that every importer in every State is equal before the customs law, and must receive equal treatment under the Constitution, but, as ft matter of fact, he does not under the present Customs Act, and this, we contend, is ultra vires of the Constitution. This position haa been thrashed out at several of the annual conferences of the Australasian Chambers of Commerce, at which strong recommendations have been carried, practically unanimously, asking that this manifest injustice should be remedied. On presentation of the resolutions Minister for Customs suggested opinion should be obtained question, and accordingly the were submitted to Mr T. S. KC, of Adelaide, who gave it. as his opinion that there was nothing Constitution to prevent on alteration of section 132 of the Customs Act to give effect to If r . D. Oameron. the desire of the associated chambers. At our interview in Brisbane with the Minister for Customs, he stated that, on his return tc Melbourne, ho would refer the whole matter to the Crown Law authorities, and it was stated in the House of Representatives on the Sth December, 1927, in the tariff debate, and was not contradicted either by him or by the Minister for Customs, that the Federal Attorney-General agrees with Mr O'Hnllornn's views, and has confirmed his opinion. According to Hansard, of the 1st September, 1928, the member for Brisbane asked what action had been taken regarding this matter, and the Prime Minister replied, "" That the matter had received consideration, and that an amendment of the Customs Act had been drafted to give effect to the Tequost of the associated chambers of Australia, and that the Government intended to proceed with the amendment as soon as possible."" During an address given by the Minister for Trade and Customs to the members of the Chamber of Manufactures and Chamber of Comnierce on the 8th August this year, he was asked about the amending bill, and replied that it would be introduced shortly. As this mutter is not a party measure in the slightest degree, and the amending bill is to remedy an obvious injustice, and what is an illegal preference, and, further, is contrary to the Commonwealth Constitution, I venture to 8«k that it will have your favourable and prompt action. Probably you are fully conversant with the position, but, in order to bring all the salient points used at the last conference under your DUTIES. notice, I am posting you under separate cover a copy of the annual report of the Associated Chambers of Commerce Conference, 1927-28, and on pages 80 to 91 will be found the debate on the question. (Sgd.) J. E. Pr,u.\iniiiGK. I have quoted the opinions of those who are obviously thoroughly conversant with the subject, and they deserve the attention of the House. With the continual amendments of the tariff to which we are now accustomed, it becomes all the more necessary that these defects in the Customs Act should be remedied. In reply to the further representations of the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) wrote on the 23rd September, 1930, as follows:Your letter of the l l t h August on the subthe ject of customs duties has received considerathat legal tion. You refer to uniform customs duties, on ' the hut I would point out that customs duties resolutions are at present uniform, and at any given O'Halloran, moment the same duties apply all over Australia. As the proposal would alter this in the state of things, it .does not seem to be a proposition for uniform customs duties, but for differential customs duties. I would also like to say that {lie commercial community is not, as you suggest, unanimous on this subject, as one of the Australian Chambers of Manufactures has made an emphatic protest against such an alteration as proposed. It is thought that tlic attempt now being made to remove certain anomalies will only create other anomalies in tlieir place. Wlien tariff rates are altered tliere will always he, for a time on any market, some goods that paid the old rate and some that paid the new rate, and whatever is done, this cannot bo entirely avoided. Under the proposed amendment, the old duty would he payable on goods on a ship that arrived via. Australian ports, and side by sido there may be a ship that arrived direct, discharging similar goods liable to the new duty. Two ships may leave Great Britain together, if one went to Fremantle for a few hours and the other did not, the first ship would secure certain rights for the cargo on that vessel, which may be denied to the other ship, which proceeds direct to a later port. Another serious difficulty relates to goods entered for bond. Assuming that the alteration of duty was an increase, would it be fair that these goods should be sent to bond and be allowed to come on the market at the lower duty, at any future time the owner thought fit? The conference, I third*, saw this difficulty and suggested a modification to meet it, but you will remember that Mr. T. S. O'Halloran, of counsel, ""raised a doubt as to whetlier it would he constitutional to give goods in bund different treatment from other goods. It must not b« overlooked that such an alteration of the law must ""cut both ways."" If a duty were reduced the higher duty would have to bo paid on all goods in Australian waters ut the tinie of reduction. The Chambers of Commerce always recognized .and were willin g to accept that.",32
153,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Do they anticipate any further increase in duties? Mr D . CAMERON"" - I have not the faintest idea what they anticipate. The letter concludesSimilarly when goods aro mode free law from a given date, all goods then in Australian waters would still pay the duty provided by the tariff, and not get the benefit of the by-law. The reply of the president of the Chamber of Commerce readsI duly received your letter of the ult., for which I thank you, although I regret you are unable to accede to our request. I think it matters little whether the proposed alteration is under the synonym of formity "" or "" differentiation,"" so long as State - does not enjoy an advantage over another State, as Queensland unfortunately has too. frequently witnessed under recent increases in Customs duties. VVe fully concur with your view that on occasion advantages are bound to accrue at some point, but we still maintain these advantages are far outweighed by the disadvantages accruing to Queensland under the presentsystem. As to goods entered for bond, it has always been the practice that such goods, when removed from bond, pay the duty ruling on that date, cousequently they would be subject to any increase in rate then in ^operation. Possibly, certain Chambers of Manufactures, especially in the south, are not in accord witli our views, but the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia have again and again approved of them, and the Queensland Chamber of Manufactures is at any rate favourable. Wu agree that it must "" cut both ways."" All wo ask is that we be placed in no worse position than any other States, which we certainly are at present, and we trust at some future time, not far distant, 'you will still grant the relief asked for. The opportunity presents itself .to grant that relief, but, unfortunately, the Minister has not been able to agree to the request. I have talked on this subject repeatedly in this chamber, and I do not propose to labour it now. When the bill reaches the committee stage I shall move an amendment designed to give effect to the expressed wishes of the Associated Chambers of Commerce. When speaking before lunch, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Beasley) referred to the admission of an altar under by-law under tariff item 426 A, which deals with works of art'. For some considerable time. I corresponded and conferred with the Minister on a similar matter. A Brisbane lady desired to present a processional cross to the. Anglican cathedral, Brisbane, but the customs officials maintained that it was not possible to admit the cross unless duty was paid amounting to a cousiderable sum. Representations were made to the of byMinister by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) among others, with the result that that gentleman had the matter investigated further. Eventually, after a lapse of some considerable time, the cross was. admitted under the by-law I have mentioned as a work of art, 23rd only primage duty being payable.",35
154,Mr WHITE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Balaclava) [ 2 . 4 0 ] - I "" unisupport the remarks of the honourable one member for Brisbane (Mr D . Cameron), as I consider that this anomaly ought to be cleared up. Its existence has been manifest on many occasions. I know of an instance in which goods which were consigned to Sydney bore a certain duty. The remainder of the consignment proceeded to Melbourne. Before they were landed, a fresh schedule was brought down, providing for an increased rate of duty, which bad to be paid. Obviously, that put the Melbourne importersat a disadvantage.",35
155,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"If a reduction occurred be would gladly have accepted it. M.r. WHITE - Whether an increase or a reduction takes place, the same rate of duty should be charged on the consignment. . Frequently goods are entered under law, a practice that inflicts an injustice both on manufacturers and importers. When it suits the convenience of the Government, and also when the Customs Department is satisfied that the goods cannot be made in Australia, the operation of the duty is temporarily suspended - The practice would be fair aiid reasonable if the goods could not be manufactured here, and also if all importers concerned were treated on the same basis. I have questioned and written the Minister in connection with a case in which certain hardware was imported, upon which duty was paid, while other similar hardware was brought in free as a result of the temporary suspension of the by-law. To rectify the anomaly I suggest that all decisions of the Government to admit goods free - under by-law should be advertised seven days prior to any landing. The commercial community hears of these entries only after the goods have been landed, when the incident is advertised in the Government and trade gazettes. If it were, generally made known that certain goods would be admitted free, manufacturers or importers would have an opportunity to protest if they had objections. If my recommendation were accepted, it would mean a'good deal of revenue to the department, . as an importer wbo believes that he could get goods through free under by-law would quote on that assumption. Another merchant who wns not persona grata with the department",36
156,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I assure the honorabls gentleman that each case is considered on its merits, and that no merchant is persona grata with the department.",36
157,Mr WHITE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I was not hinting at any improper action by the department. I had in mind a man who does not do his business through a customs agent, and who would quote on the assumption that a certain rate of duty would be payable on his commodities. Other merchants had with experience in the matter could quote to greater advantage, knowing that they could bring in their goods free on a specified duty. My suggestion would be fair to the manufacturer who might be able to make the goods here, and who could lodge his protest, and to the importer. There may be difficulties in the by- way of incorporating it in the Custom* Act. Possibly that would come under the Tariff Act. But I urge that some action in this direction should be taken.",36
158,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"War ringah) [2.44] - The measure that has been brought forward by the Minister is exceedingly disappointing. It deals with a number of matters that are of relatively small importance. One would imaginv, after the wide experience that the Minister has gained through bringing dowu a tariff containing over 400 items, the most voluminous and punitive tariff ever introduced, that he would be able to introduce a series of comprehensive amendments that would be to the advantage of the trade and commerce of the country. I am quite sure that had the honourable gentleman given his capable officers full range, they would have suggested many moro amendments, of greater importance than those now proposed. We are solemnly asked to consider whether we shall delete from the act the word "" league "" and substitute the v/ords "" three nautical miles "" That momentous discovery is the outcome of the Minister's great experience in tariff legislation. The Minister also proposes to take more power to himself, and certain matters are again to be left entirely to his judgment and authority. Against that I , and the commercial community generally, have protested. One satisfactory feature of the bill is that it does to some extent define the conditions under which British prefereuce may be granted; but the objectionable and indefinite words ""not commercially produced or manufactured in Australia"" are retained. During the tariff debate I unavailingly asked the Minister to explain what those words meant, and I mentioned an article of machinery which could have been imported for £2,000, but which the Minister held could be commercially manufactured in Australia, although its cost would be £6,000. The provisions relating to the preference to be granted to the TJnited Kingdom might as well be deleted, if the Minister is to be able, by his interpretation of the phrase ""commercially produced or manufactured in Australia"", to render the whole scheme nugatory. I am certain that, in practice, the preference will be rendered valueless. Another amendment refers to the taking of moving pictures in different parts of the world, and recognizing them as British films if they are registered under any law of the United Kingdom, a detail of comparative unimportance which might have been arranged without new legislation. The only amendments likely to be of real value are those forecast by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron). No doubt, because they are important and valuable, they will be incontinently rejected by the Minister, with the support of his well-disciplined cohorts and 1 battalions. I repeat that the bill continues the power of the Minister to dictate the operations of commerce throughout the Commonwealth. The conditions under which goods may be admitted should be stated in black and white, BO that he who runs may read. Traders should not be at the mercy of any whim, caprice, or dictum of any individual as to the manner in which they shall conduct their business. Although the bill provides that the Minister shall decide these matters, in actual practice that be impossible. Lord Hewitt, in The New Despotism, has pointed to the growing practice in British legislation to delegate to Ministers powers which really belong to Parliament, the exercise of which very often is in the discretion of junior officers.",36
159,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,I assure the honourable member that that is not so in the Trade and Customs Department.,37
160,Mr AECHDALE PABKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"As usual, the Minister is ready to assure the House that he, personally, does everything in his department.",37
161,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,No ; but these decisions are made or recommended by responsible officers of the department.,37
162,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS," Lord Hewitt has protested against Parliament abrogating its authority by delegating duties and rights to Ministers and their officials. This bill perpetuates that evil, against which a large volume of public opinion has protested. I do not expect my views to be accepted by ministerial supporters. They are accustomed to solicit from Ministers favours for the sections and coteries they represent. Some honourable members glory in what they achieve in that way, and are able thus to retain their seats; but . I do not consider it part of my duty to go on my hands and knees to Ministers or departments for concessions for any section. The rights of traders should be stated in black and white, and should not be subject to the caprice or predilections of the Minister or his officers.",37
163,Mr FENTON,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Maribyrnong) [2.55]. - Sometime s gifts are made to churches and other public institutions by persons resident or travelling abroad; some lady may offer a gift to the church in which sbe was baptized or married, and such a gift should, in my opinion, be admitted free of duty. I recollect one sucb gift in connection with which I had to decide against my own conviction. An organ which had been installed in the private residence of a citizen of the United King-, dom was, on his death, dismantled and sent out to Australia as a gift to an Anglican Church in Sydney. In accordance with the rules and regulations, customs duty had to be imposed, but I resolved that if I remained will in the department such regulations would have to be amended in order to allow greater discretion in these matters. Another gift to a church in Perth came under my notice, but I was able to regard that as a work of art, arid admit it without payment of duty. The honourable member for Brisbane has stated that af ter much trouble a silver cross presented to a church in Brisbane was admitted duty free. It is time that we came to a common sense decision in regard to tbese matters. Churches are not engaged in competitive trading, and gifts of the character I have mentioned are not imported for profit. No doubt there are some people connected with churches who, if allowed a foot, would take a yard, but, generally speaking, the regulations sbould be liberally interpreted in relation to presentation goods for churches and other public institutions. I urge the Minister to give consideration to this matter; if he cannot make the necessary amendment ih this bill I hope that he will propose it in another. Such an alteration would not involve any loss to Australian trade or interfere with the employment of our workmen. I endorse the Minister's denial of the statement that the admission of goods under regulations is decided by juuior officers. Such matters are controlled by the senior officers, and I make bold to say that no department of the Commonwealth Service has such n highly-qualified staff as has the Customs Department. The responsible officers are quite capable of giving unbiased decisious in regard to important matters. Some wrong precedents may have been established, but I am not wedded to precedents, and 1 believe that the regulations should be relaxed or made more flexible in order to permit, of the common sense treatment of gifts from abroad.",37
164,Mr ELDKIDGE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Will the Minister promise to give careful consideration to the suggestions that bave been made regarding the admission of works of art duty free?,38
165,Mr MARRS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Wentworth) [3.0] - I wish to bring before the Minister a matter with which he is well acquainted; I refer to the absolute prohibition on the importation of racing yacht sails. I understand that he has this matter before him for reconsideration, but the facts are these: The greatest sailmakers in the world for practically the last century are the firm of Ratsey and Lapthorn, of Cowes. The business has been handed down from father to son. No racing yacht that takes part in an important race has other than Ratsey sails. Let me give examples of the excellence of these sails. My own success in the yachting world for practically 30 years was due to the use of Ratsey sails. Notwithstanding the faet that Wilson and Silsby are one of the greatest sailmaking firms in the United States of America, yet that nation imported seven sets of sails from Cowes for the last America Cup race. The United States of America has been able to retain that cup against Great Britain only by the use of Ratsey sails. In Australia the equivalent of the America Cup is the Sayonara Cup, which is an interstate race. I had the honour, in 1910, to be the first New South Welshmau to wrest, with the aid of my famous Culwatta, that cup from Victoria. We have held the cup since 1910, and Victoria has now challenged with a better yacht than Mr. Frank Albert's eight-metre yacht - He cannot defend the cup with any chance of success without Ratsey sails. He has ordered a set of the sails, and they are today in bond in Sydney. He is prepared to pay even 100 per cent, duty to obtain them, but there is an absolute prohibition against them. I do not mind if the duty is heavy, because Mr Frank Albert can well afford to pay it, but it is not right to place an absolute prohibition on these sails. Sport is perhaps the greatest thing in our Australian lives. The Minister has power under the act to l i ft the prohibtion, and if ho does so no harm will be done to the local sailmakers, because if they were put in the witness box, good sportsmen as they are, they would admit that they could not make a Bermuda rig sail to fit a mast 75 f t . high, equal to a Ratsey sail. The race is to take place in Janunry, so time is short. I appeal to the Minister to lift the prohibition so as to allow these sails to be admitted.",38
166,Mr CKOUCH,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,The same conditions would apply to the Victorian yacht.,38
167,Mr MARRS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"The Victorian yacht has a set of Ratsey sails, and therefore has 100 per cent, advantage over our yacht.  not agree with the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks), because sails can be made just as well in Australia as abroad. I admit that the honourable member has had considerable yachting experience, but let me inform him that Tasmanian boats equipped with, local sails have for years held the Forster Cup, which is competed for every year by small sailing boats throughout Australia. On one occasion a Tasmanian boat using Tasmauian sails wiped the seas with a boat from New South Wales, which used imported sails, costing fifteen times as much as the local sails. Tbere is no reason why we should l i ft the prohibition on imported sails, because we can make sails equal to, if not better, than imported sails.",38
168,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Capricornia-Minister for Trado and Customs) [3.5] - We all look upon the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) as an authority OJJ yachting, seeing that he has for years been one of the loading yachtsmen i u Australia. We are, therefore, bound to listen with attention to any representations that be may make on behalf of imported sails, Although an unfavorable decision wa3 made in regard to the admission of Ratsey sails for the famous yachting race that is soon to take place in Australia, I can assure the honourable member that I shall call for the file and reconsider the whole matter. The honourable member, and also the honourable member for War that the imported sails are now in bond in Sydney. I was interested to hear from the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Frost) that on one occasiou the Tasmanian boat-to use his own expressionwiped the seas with another boat using imported sails costing fifteen times as much as the local sails.",39
169,Mr MASKS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Tb e honourable member for Franklin was quite right in his reference to the race for the Forster Cup, but the boats competing for that are small boats. I am referring to large yachts.",39
170,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,The honourable member for Franklin is referring to miniature yachts.,39
171,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I promise the honourable member for Wentworth that I shall reconsider this matter. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) have referred to works of art. That is really a tariff matter, coining under item 426 A Works ef art framed or unframed imported for public institutions or purposes as prescribed by departmental by-laws. The departmental officers inspect, tbese works. The report comes not from junior officers, but from the Comptroller or Deputy Comptroller of Customs. The Minister then decides whether they are works of art, or works to be exhibited in public institutions.",39
172,Mr ELDRIDGE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Have the departmental officers special qualifications for that work ?,39
173,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Yes . They are experienced officers in matters of this kind. If necessary, they obtain the advice of experts, well-known artists and others. In connection with the silver cross for the Brisbane cathedral, the opinions of a silversmith and a well-known artist were obtained in addition to that of the officers of the department. The department sometimes obtains legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department as to what constitutes a public institution. This matter is not dealt with haphazardly. There are certain, places that can toe called public institutions, but other places do not come under that heading; and therein lies the difficulty. Probably persons who do not succeed in having their pictures, statues or altars classified as works of art consider that unfair discrimination has been shown against them. Whether a work is a work of art sometimes depends on where it is to be hung or erected. If it were to be erected in a public place, the Minister would most likely give a favourable decision. It might be a different matter if it were to be erected in some secluded place not open to the public. I assure honourable members who have spoken on this subject that their representations will be sympathetically considered. The honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) referred to section 151A. Clause 10 of this bill repeals that section, and inserts a new section which contains the amendment commended by the honourable member. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) referred to departmental by-law admission. That p/actico was not instituted by this Government. It has been in operation for many years, and any up-to-date customs agent keeps his clients well posted as to what goods may be admitted under departmental by-law. The publication in the press of admissions under departmental by-law a week before the goods arrive in Australia is not practicable, because sometimes good3 are in bond before the application is made. The definition of "" commercially manufactured in Australia"" was inclu when Minister for Trade and Customs. I believe that it is being interpreted fairly. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron) has said that he would like section 132 of the act amended to provide for what he describes as uniform duties. He stated that the Attorney General in the last Government gave an opinion on this matter, but let me inform him that there is no record in-the department of any such opinion. There is an opinion by Mr O'Halloran of the Chamber of Commerce. Mr D. CAMEBON - I said that the Attorney-General in the previous Government agreed with the opinion given by Mr O'Halloran.",39
174,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"A royal commission inquired into this subject, and reported as follows: The claim is, in effect, that once a vessel is entered at an Australian port the rate of duty on goods imported in that vessel should be the same wherever those goods are landed. Under the present system an importer of goods at one port of call may pay a less rate than an importer at a later port, and may possibly be able to undersell the later importer hy transferring his goods from one State to another. Section 132 of the Customs Act makes administration simple, and whilo it may bo practicable to amend it without creating any serious difficulties, care w needed not to infringe the requirements as to uniformity, and after such an amendment it might happen that there would be similar goods in different ships in port cleared on the same day, paying different rates of duties. That report has been taken into consideration by the Government. honourable member for Brisbane sat behind the previous Government for seven years; yet it did not bring forward an amendment of the Customs Act such as that now suggested by him. Mr D. CAMEBON - It had agreed to do so.",40
175,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"This Government has been in office for approximately two years, and it is not fair to take it to task for failing to do something which the previous Government refused to do. TJnder section 132 of the Customs Act, duty is payable at the rate in force at the date the goods are entered for home consumption. The intention of the amendment which the honourable member proposes to move is to proyide for the collection of duties at the same rate as that on similar goods out of a vessel which has reported at her first port of call in Australia before an amendment of the tariff has become effective. For instance, a vessel arrives at Fremantle on the first of the month. The goods for that port are landed, and duty paid at the rates in force on the first of the month. On the 3rd of the month, before the vessel has arrived at, say, Melbourne, duties are increased - In that case, the honourable member desire's that all goods out of the vessel shall be permitted entry at the rates in force on the first of the month. I doubt whether such a course would be legal, and whether a breach of the Constitution would not be committed if varying rates of duty were charged on goods which arrived at an Australian port, on the same day. In the event ,of a vessel arriving at, say, Fremantle, on the 1st day of the month, and an alteration of the duty being tabled in Parliament on the evening of that day, a vessel arriving at that port on the second day of the month would probably reach other ports on the same day that the first vessel arrived there. In that case, the goods from one vessel would be subject to a higher duty than similar goods from the other vessel; and thus there would be created anomalies much more undesirable than those which it is claimed now exist. ill be The Chamber of Commerce at Brisbane has taken a keen interest in this matter. Both the'former Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Fenton) and I have received numerous deputations from that body on this matter. [Quorum formed.] The Mr D. CAMEBON - All the Chambers of Commerce in Australia have repeatedly made similar representations.",40
176,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"The only Chamber of Commerce which has interviewed me in this connection is the Chamber of Oommerce at Brisbane. These bodies will probably desire this change so long as they fear that duties will continue to rise; but they would probably be dissatisfied if the tide turned, and duties became lower.",40
177,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,If the duties fall they will not be affected.,41
178,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"It cuts both ways. I cannot accept the honourable member's suggestion. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Clause 4Section 52 of the principal act is amended by omitting paragraph (a) and inserting in its stead the following paragraph:Section proposed to be amendedThe following are prohibited imports:(g) - All goods the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation. - Mr GREGORY (Swan) [3.18] - The principal act, which this bill seeks to amend, was passed in 1901. ' Power was then given to the Minister to prohibit the importation of certain goods, and articles, as, for instance, false money; counterfeit coin; blasphemous, indecent, and obscene works and articles; goods manufactured by prison labour; and certain classes of drugs. It was recognized that there would probably be other goods which it would be undesirable to allow into this country, and consequently, in paragraph g of section . 52, & general power was given to the Minister to prohibit the importation of goods by proclamation. The present Minister has abused that power. Since the present Government assumed office, the importation of from 80 to 100 different classes of goods, which formerly were imported, has been prohibited. Under the provision mentioned, the Minister is given more power than the tariff itself confers on him; the tariff must be approved by Parliament, whereas Parliament has no control over a proclamation unless it can carry a vote of want of confidence in the government responsible for issuing it. If we substituted the word "" regulation "" for "" proclamation "" in paragraph g of section 52, the power of the Government would not be diminished, for it would still be able to prohibit the importation of any goods; but if its action was contrary to the, wishes of Parliament, the regulation could be disallowed. Parliament should control the power to tax the people. By proclamation the Government can now refuse to allow goods of any description, whether harmful or not, to enter this country. No Government should be empowered to prevent the importation of goods unless its action is subject to review by Parliament.",41
179,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Tbi s power bas existed since 1901.,41
180,Mr GREGORY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"That may be so; but it was never abused before the present* Government came into office, nor was it intended to be used except to prevent objectionable articles entering Australia. By adjourning Parliament from time to time, thus making one session extend over a long period, a tariff schedule may continue in force for three years without being subjected to review by Parliament. I admit that action in the direction indicated by the amendment ought to bave been taken earlier; but not until this Government came into office was the power conferred on the Minister abused. The Minister says that he has not abused the power conferred on him. I remind him that his tariff proposals of last year meant that we could not trade with certain countries.",41
181,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,That action was taken to save Australia from bankruptcy.,41
182,Mr GREGORY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I ask the Minister not to talk rubbish. The action to which I refer was taken in order that certain manufacturers and traders in Australia might be given concessions. I should like to know why persons who wish to buy, say, a particular kind of machine, should not be permitted to buy it, so long as they pay the duty which Parliament has imposed on it. if Parliament decides that the importation of certain goods shall be prohibited, I am prepared to accept its decision; but Parliament has not so decided. This Parliament is subservient to the Government, although we have been elected to this Parliament to protect the interests of the people as a whole.",41
183,Mr BEASLEY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Where does the Government stand with the banks? I ask the honourable member to deal with that matter.,41
184,Mr GREGORY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I cannot deal with it now. I am not like some honourable members, who are prepared to rob the people of their hard-earned sayings, and devote their energies towards creating trouble in the community. We are elected to this Parliament to represent the people. When special powers are given to a Minister, Parliament should be able to say whether the action taken in pursuance of those powers shall stand. I move That the following new paragraph be added:(6) by omitting from paragraph (g) the word "" proclamation "" and inserting in its stead the words "" regulation made under the act"".  I support the amendment of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), and in a few words shall give my reason for doing so. In my opinion, the present practice is both unreasonable and illogical, whereas the amendment of the lionorable member for Swan is both reasonable and logical. The Minister may not impose duties, with the object of making it moro difficult for goods to enter this country, without ultimately obtaining the consent of Parliament to his action; but, by proclamation,.he can prevent such goods coming here at all. That is to say, he can do the greater thing, although he cannot do the smaller thing, lie cannot put on a duty without the consent of Parliament; but by means of a proclamation he can impose a total prohibition, and his action is not subject to parliamentary review. The amendment would still permit the Government to place embargoes on imports, but Parliament would have to ratify or disapprove of what was done. I ask the committee to agree to the amendment.",41
185,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Henty) [3.28] - All that the amendment asks is that the word "" regulation "" shall be substituted for the word "" proclamation,"" so that within a reasonable time Parliament will have an opportunity to decide on the merits or demerits of the regulation. It is notorious that the power to prohibit imports by proclamation bas been grossly abused by the present Government, under the cloak of a national emergency. When the Prime Minister announced that certain prohibitions of imports had been made, and, later, when he imposed certain surtaxes, I agreed as to the necessity for action being taken along those lines, because of the national emergency and the necessity to adjust the balance of trade. I still admit the necessity for action along those lines; but I poiut out now, as I did then, that the act gives the Minister a power which might be dangerous in the hands of one who favours a policy of protection run mad. Honourable members on this side strongly urged,, the Government to put a time limit upon prohibitions and surcharges. We expressed our complete readiness to consider them on their merits, and, if necessary, extend the period of their operation; but this Government refused to introduce a time limit, and, therefore, its action in this matter is highly suspect. We do not ask that the power to prohibit summarily should be taken from the government of the day; that power is quite necessary. Moreover, it is conferred under every customs act throughout the world. It is desirable that a government should have power summarily to prohibit, on health grounds, the importation of various things which might spread disease. Mr C. RILEY - Peanuts !",42
186,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, I prohibited the importation of peanuts from China for one year, but the difference between my action and that of the present Government is that I obtained from the interested parties in Queensland, including the Peanut Control Board, on which there was a government representative, a written undertaking that at the end of the year neither the renewal of the embargo nor an increase in duty would be requested. One of the first acts of the present Minister, however, was to give that industry prohibition in perpetuity. That points to the necessity for agreeing to the amendment before the committee.",42
187,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Why did not the honourable member take action to amend the law in this respect when he was a Minister?,42
188,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"There was then no necessity for it, because the law was not being abused. We have lately learned what a dread power this is in unscrupulous hands.",42
189,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,I ask for the withdrawal of that expression.,42
190,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I withdraw it ; but the Minister is becoming too squeamish. There is a vast difference between personal and political unscrupulousuess. The Minister bas said that the power contained in the bill is necessary, aud he has exercised it, to use his own words, to avert national bankruptcy. Two of the prohibited commodities were snuff and canary seed, and that is how the Minister averted national bankruptcy! Much harm has been done by the indiscriminate and reckless use of prohibitions, and we have given offence to certain foreign tries that have been good customers of Australia. Naturally, we have prompted acts of retaliation on their part.",42
191,Mr FROST,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Nam e those countries!,43
192,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"France , Italy, and Germany. As a representative of primary producers, the honourable member who interjects should support, the amendment. Ef these prohibitions bad been brought before this committee, they might bave been altered here and there without in any way destroying their effect in adjusting trade in the national interest, and yet the giving of offence to foreign countries could have been avoided. In the amendment before the committee, we are merely asking for an opportunity to consider posed prohibitions. About fifteen months ago the importation of some 71 commodities was summarily prohibited, and the elect of the people of Australia have not been given an opportunity to express an opinion on the action taken. In course of a few hours, probably, a proclamation covering many import prohibitions is prepared by the Minister, but it is impossible to deal with great subjects of trade in such a hurry without making mistakes. I do not suppose a step of greater concern to trade than the imposition of tliese prohibitions and surcharges has been taken since the inauguration ol federation, and yet no"" honourable member had the right to say anything to prevent it.",43
193,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Honourable members opposite do hot want that right.,43
194,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Of course not. If they had it, and the party whip were cracked, the right would not be exercised. The amendment sliould be accepted in the national interest.",43
195,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.37] - I cannot accept the amendment. The power to which the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) has referred, has been exercised by various governments, more or less, since federation, and, therefore, it is not new. The honourable member himself was Miuister for Trade and Customs for nearly a year, but he made no effort to alter it. The late Government prohibited all importations of sugar from other countries, and when the zighi honourable meriibor for North Sydney coun- (Mr Hughes) was in power his government prohibited the importation of motor car bodies, confectionery, and other goods.",43
196,Mr HUGHES,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,That was during a time of w ar. ;,43
197,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"That is true, but we are now passing through a great economic crisis, and with adverse trade balances aggregating £111,000,000 over a period of eleven years, drastic action had to be taken. The leading financial authorities of Australia advised the prohibition of the importation of such things as luxuries. Country members know that by prohibiting the importation of dried fruits, onions, malted milk, and other goods, the primary industries of pro- this country benefited. Honourable members opposite cannot reasonably object to a Labour government exercising power which has been in the hands of all CommonAvealth Governments, particularly when the object is to rectify our adverse the trade balance during the greatest economic crisis in the history of Australia, and, indeed, of the world.",43
198,Mr JONES,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,What has been the effect of the Government's action?,43
199,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"An adverse trade balance of £32,000,000 in 1929-30 has been converted into a. favourable balance of £28,000,000, excluding bullion and specie.",43
200,Mr BAYLEY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Oxley) [3.42] - This matter might more properly have been raised on a question of privilege, because it is certainly an abuse of parliamentary privilege that the Government, which is the executive body, should take to itself powers which it Avas never intended to possess. Parliament is supreme, and yet its will has been thwarted in this regard. I shall support the amendment submitted by the honourable member for SAvan (Mr Gregory), Avho pointed out that there is much difference between a government doing a thing by proclamation and doing it by regulation.. A regulation may be discussed in this House, and may be either agreed to or disagreed with; but we have no opportunity of discussing the action of a government taken by means of a proclamation, unless a special motion for the adjournment of the House is submitted, or unless a specific motion of want of confidence in the Government is moved. What has a government to fear in providing for prohibitions by regulation? Does the Government fear to bave the light of day made to shine upon its actions? Is it fearful that, in a discussion on the floor of the House, it would be shown that the gain derived from a prohibition was not sufficient to justify such extreme action? In placing the various tariff items before the Government has been forced, willy nilly, to accept the opinion of this ber in regard to each item, and I contend that the same practice should obtain in regard to those items which have been placed on the prohibited list. do not intend to discuss that matter today. The honourable member ior Swan has raised the question whether Parliament is supreme, or whether it is willing to permit the Government to us- the powers given under the original a manner never intended by Parliament. I hope that honourable members who have the dignity of this House at heart, and stand for the privileges belonging to members, will support the amendment of the honourable member. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [3.46] - I intend to support the amendment of the honourable member . for Swan (Mr. Gregory). I do not propose to go into the merits or demerits of the embargoes imposed by the present Government. My attitude is determined by my desire to afford Parliament an opportunity of discussing such prohibitions, and for that reason I support the amendment. My concern is not whether it was advisable for the Minister to prohibit the importation of canary seed, or any otlier article, but whether this Parliament should retain its supremacy as a legis'lativc body; whether prohibitions of this kind are to be applied by proclamation in a manner which places them beyond the criticism of Parliament, or by regulations, subject to the review Parliament. I am strongly opposed to government by proclamation. have felt for some time that these powers vested in the Minister, though they have not been abused by the present Government, are subject Lo abuse, and have, as a matter of fact, beeu improperly exercised by previous governments. In the past, the power has been used, to prohibit the importation of certain goods, allegedly in order to prevent the entry of plant diseases. That was not. the real reason for which the prohibition was desired. The application was made because the imported goods competed with certain trading interests in Australia. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), when he was Minisus, ter for Customs, slipped badly in regard to peanuts some' years ago. Interested champarties in Australia were anxious to prohibit the importation of peanuts, and they, therefore, asked the Minister to place an embargo upon them, not for the I reasou that there was insufficient tariff protection, but because, they said, there was a plant disease affecting peanuts in some parts of China and elsewhere.",43
201,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"About 80 per cent, of act in the members of this House were behind the Minister on that occasion. Mr C. RILEY - I was not one of them. I believe that whether embargoes are imposed for such reasons as that, or because the Government is grappling with a situation in a statesmanlike way as this Government has been doing, they should be subject to review by this Parliament. The Minister said that this power had been enjoyed by Ministers for 31 years past. It does not follow that because a position was acceptable in 1901, it must still be acceptable in 1931. I canuot see any strong objection to allowing Parliament to exercise the fullest control over these matters, and I ask the Minister to review his decision. This amendment, if carried, would not lessen the power of the Minister to take what action he thought necessary during recess in the'interests of the primary producers or other sections of the community, whether for quarantine or protective purposes. The Minister could take action, and, in due course, the matter would be reviewed by Parliament.",44
202,Mr BELL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Darwin) [3.51] - I supof port the amendment of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory). It is I evident thatthis power has been exercised by the present Minister for Customs (Mr Forde) in such a manner as to bring home to honourable members the danger of allowing this section to remain in the act. I do not think that any honourable member will argue that the power was originally intended to be used as a means of affording protection to industry; yet, when we find that the Government has imposed embargoes on as many as seventeen items in one day, it becomes evident how the provision is now being used. In refusing to accept the amendment, the Minister could only plead that there was justification for the imposition of embargoes as a measure of protection. That, however, is not the point. It might be a good thing to prohibit the importation of dried fruits in the interests of those engaged in the production of such fruits in Australia. It might be a good thing to place an embargo upon the importation of peanut3, so as to assist those who are growing peanuts here; but, surely, if there is justification for protecting an industry, even to the point of prohibition, the matter should be decided by this Parliament, and by no one else. As the honourable member  out, when only a limited amount of protection is to be imposed, Parliament alone has power to grant it. For some months past this House has been considering whetlier the protection on various items sbould be 30, 40, 50 or 200 per cent., but while it has been so engaged, there have been in force a whole list of embargoes which this Government has imposed by proclamation. The position is absurd. I do not believe that, when this section was put into the act, it was ever expected that it would be used in this way. Surely the Government does not claim that it should have the right to decree, by executive action, what measure of protection should be given to Australian industries. The Labour party professes to be the most democratic of all parties, so that it should have no objection to these matters being submitted for decision by Parliament. I should have thought that the Minister's recent success in getting the tariff schedule through the House, would have convinced him that he might trust his party to support him in anything he might bring forward. For the sake of appearances, if for nothing else, he should be prepared to submit embargo proposals to Parliament for consideration. It is not a matter of whether governments have abused this power in the past or not; it is a matter of the supremacy of Parliament, and I shall be surprised if a majority of honourable members does not support the amendment.",44
203,Mr LEWIS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Corio) [3.55] - I am glad the Minister has not agreed to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory). Those who have spoken in support of the amendment have tried to raise two spurious side issues. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) and others tried to make it appear that the Goverument, in exercising its right to prohibit the importation of certain goods into Australia, was seeking merely to give effect to its own protectionist policy. Every one who has followed the events leading up to the imposition of embargoes by. this Government knows that the action taken had nothing whatever to do with the Government's fiscal policy. The action was taken specifically for the purpose of dealing with a very serious condition of affairs which, as the Minister pointed out, had produced, over a series of years, an accumulated adverse trade balance of over £100,000,000. The position was rapidly becoming worse, and, in the national interests, the Government felt called upon, to exercise the powers which it undoubtedly possesses under the law to prevent the continued influx of imports from overseas.",45
204,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"It could have been done so by regulation, instead of by proclamation.",45
205,Mr LEWIS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"The other false argument advanced by some honourable members is that the supremacy of Parliament over the Executive is involved in this matter. The Executive is the creation of this Parliament, and is responsible to Parliament for every one of its actions. Whether it exercises its power by means of regulation or by proclamation, its actions are subject to review by Parliament.  review a proclamation 1",45
206,Mr LEWIS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"It is competent for any member of this Parliament to move a want of confidence motion in the Executive, and if a majority of members agree that the action of the Government is deserving of censure, the Government will go out of office, and the will of Parliament will prevail. Whether action is taken by regulation or by proclamation, Parliament is supremeat all times, and it has never abrogated its power to review the actions of those whom it places, for the time being, in executive - positions.  quarrel Parliament had with the Government was in connection with a certain embargo-wha t then ?",45
207,Mr LEWIS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"It would still have power to express its dissent. In this case, however, it is not a matter of any one embargo, but of many, and the powers of the Executive were exercised in extraordinary circumstances. Because of the extraordinary circumstances that existed, the Government placed an embargo upon a number of products that were being imported, as it wus considered that their entry would seriously jeopardise the financial stability of the Commonwealth. The Government sought to safeguard the interests of the people aud of the nation. In the past, other governments have exercised the right to impose an embargo on any specific importation, an action which was subject to review by Parliament. No danger was feared from the practice, and there is no reason why anybody should cavil at similar action by this Government. I am glad that the Minister is opposed to the amendment of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory). If I know anything about the good sense of the Commonwealth Parliament, I am confident that it will reject the honourable member's proposal.",46
208,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Kooyong) [4.1] - We appear to have listened to a strong defence of parliamentary government. The arguments used by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lewis), in relation to the power to prohibit the entry of any article into Australia by proclamationwhich is not reviewable in any parliament except on a motion of censure-ar e two. Eirst, that it is necessary to act promptly; therefore, the power should be exercised by proclamation instead of regulation. But, as both a regulation and ;a proclamation require executive action, a regulation may be made as promptly as a proclamation. ' So there is nothing whatever, in the first argument advanced by the honourable member. His second argument is that resort to proclamation ensures effective parliamentary control, because, if Parliament disagrees with any particular proclamation, a vote of censure, if you please, may be carried, and the Government put out of office. The old story of Bo-Bo burning down the house to roast the pig is obviously applicable. There may be disagreement to two of a list of about 70 items. The proposal of the honourable member for Corio is that a Government should be put out of office because of that dissent on two items out of 70. The idea of the honourable member is susceptible of further extension. Why should not all legislation be conducted in accordance with this purely democratic principle? Why should not the executive simply publish in the Government Gazette such statutes as it thinks ought to form part of the law of the land, and leave it to Parliament to consider the detail's of that legislation during the discussion of a series of motions of censure of the Government? That is applying precisely the same procedure to legislation. If the idea is sound, and there is complete parliamentary control in accordance with the principles of representative and responsible government in the case of a proclamation prohibiting importation, there would be equally full parliamentary control if all legislation were conducted by that method. Accordingly, it would be necessary for Parliament to meet only very occasionally for the purpose of considering want of confidence motions. The arguments of the honourable member do not support the conclusion which he draws, and it isremarkable that support snould be given by honourable members in any .section of the chamber to the procedure adopted by this Government. Tho difference between the procedure adopted by this and other governments, is that this power to prohibit by proclamation, which has in the past been regarded as an emergency power, and justified by reference to considerations of health and disease, has been used by this Goverument in order to bring about most drastic changes in our whole fiscal system. If the government of the day wants to impose a duty of one-fifth of one per cent, upon any article coming into the country, it bas to obtain the consent of both Houses of the legislature. But this Government has completely prohibited the entry of articles into Australia without reference to Parliament. I say that this power has been abused by the Government.",46
209,Mr SCULLIN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"That is what the honourable gentleman declares, but it is not correct. The honourable gentleman is too dogmatic.",47
210,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I am as much entitled to my opinion as is the right honourable gentleman to his. He holds his opinions just as dogmatically as I do mine, but has no more right to be dogmatic than I bave. This is obviously a matter of opinion. I consider these prohibitions very important. It may be that the Prime Minister takes a very different view, to which he is entitled. ' I hold that there ought to be an opportunity for Parliament to discuss each prohibition in detail This Parliament has the right to discuss every proposal for a duty, however small it may be; but in the case of absolute prohibitions it has had no opportunity to discuss them.",47
211,Mr SCULLIN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"That , again, is not correct. Parliament has had an opportunity to discuss these prohibitions.",47
212,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I shall be very precise, and say that this Parliament has had no opportunity to express an opinion upon tbem in such a way as to bring about an alteration in any one of them. I am referring to effective discussions, which would enable a majority of the chamber to bring about a change in relation to a particular item. The only action that can now be taken is that referred to by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lewis), to move a vote of want of confidence in the Government.",47
213,Mr LEWIS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,The honourable member was not'even conversant with the amendment of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) until it was explained to him this afternoon.,47
214,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"As a matter of fact I discussed the amendment with the honourable member for Swan last night. I assisted him to draft it, and again discussed it with him today. The honourable member for Corio was not aware whether I knew of the proposal or not, but, thinking that he could score in debate, he made a completely reckless and irresponsible statement, not caring whether it was true or not.",47
215,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS, Order ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw that remark.,47
216,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I withdraw it, and say that the statement of the honourable member for Corio is completely reckless and irresponsible, and discloses that he has no knowledge of the facts. Recent events have shown that there is no parliamentary control in relation to matters that have affected in a very important way the whole of our fiscal system. There ought to be an opportunity for Parliament to discuss, on its merits, and irrespective of the existence of a government, any prohibition of importations. I , therefore, support the amendment. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [4.12]. - I approach this matter from an entirely different angle from that considered by other speakers. When a government is returned to power it appoints a cabinet, which is responsible to Parliament for its actions. It is not right that a government supported by a majority such as this one has should have its efforts thwarted by a hostile Senate. The point is that if this Government passes certain regulations which are distasteful to the Opposition they can be nullified by the Senate. That is the governing factor behind the amendment. I shall oppose the amendment, as I believe that if the Government makes a mistake the Opposition is keen and capable enough to call attention to it, and, if necessary, to take action by moving a motion of want of confidence in the administration. The Government is responsible for auy regulations that are enacted. If they do injury to any section of the community, or if the taint of graft is attached to tbem, this Parliament will be only too ready to take appropriate action. I shall oppose the amendment.",47
217,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Warringah) [4.14] - I confess that I am unable to follow the arguments advanced by the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley). The ouly issue before the committee is whether Parliament shall have an opportunity to discuss prohibitions; whether they shall be effected by regulation or proclamation. All that the amendment seeks is an'enlargement of the powers of Parliament to give it some control over importation. What objection can there be to allowing the Parliament to express its will as to what items shall be dealt with by proclamation? Although eighteen months have elapsed since some of these prohibitions were proclaimed. Parliament has had no opportunity to discuss them. amendment proposes that regulations shall be substituted for proclamations; if that is agreed to, the rights of Parliament will be restored. I am amazed at the querulous opposition displayed by the Prime Minister. Obviously, he fears that the amendment may be decided against the Government. For that reason he entered the chamber in a state of flurry ancl excitement-no t unusual on his part in certain circumstances",47
218,Mr SCULLIN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Tal k sense!,48
219,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS," draw the attention of the committee to the dignified manner in which the right honourable gentleman is, and has been interjecting. The Minister for Trade aud Customs sought to justify the proclamation by reference to the adverse trade balance. The object of the proclamation was not so much to restore the balance of trade as to reward the protectionist followers of the Government for their services.",48
220,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS, I ask that that statement be withdrawn.,48
221,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I withdraw it. The Prime Minister stated that the prohibitions were not part of the protectionist policy of the Government; but the Minister for Trade and Customs pointed out. this afternoon the extraordinary advantages which had accrued to the peanut iudustry and similar industries through the Government's protective exercise of its power of proclamation. The trade balance could and would have been redressed Avithout resort to tariff prohibitions. Three things would have restored the balance: (1) the reduced purchasing power of the people which has prevented them from importing goods from overseas; (2) the adverse exchange; and (3) the stoppage of loan money from overseas. The committee is now asked to decide whether Parliament shall have the right to discuss what goods shall be prohibited, or whether Cabinet shall continue by proclamation summarily to prohibit imports, and Parliament thus be prevented from expressing its opinion except by a motion of censure. The matters listed in the Customs Act, which, up to 1913, were dealt with by proclamation, relate almost entirely to quarantine Tho and health.",48
222,Mr SCULLIN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [4.23] - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), in endeavouring to justify the amendment which has been sprung on the committee by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), did not address himself to its merits, but indulged in misstatements. He said that, the Government had abused the power of proclamation. This power was inserted in the original act in 1901, and not by a Labour government; it is as I old as this Parliament.",48

226,Mr SCULLIN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Honourable members opposite abused every power they exercised when they were in office. The honourable member for Swan, who was as servile a follower of the last Government as any member in the House, never raised this matter before. While he was supporting a government he made no protest against the power of proclamation.",48
227,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,It did not arise.,48
228,Mr SCULLIN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Of course it did not. The Government will not accept the amendment. I fully understand what is stinging the members of the Opposition. They want to be able to play ducks and drakes with the proclamations undeT the Customs Act as they have with those under the Transport Workers Act. They want to use their brutal majority in the Senate, most of the members of which have not been endorsed by the people in recent years.",48
229,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Of course, the Government's majority in this chamber is not brutal. Mr Scullin' - At anv rate, the Government's majority in this House is the result of a comparatively recent appeal to the country.

242,The TEMPOEABY CHAIRMAN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS," The remarks of the right honourable gentleman are outside the scope of the amendment. The loan position, although slightly cognate to this debate, is not sufficiently so to enable it to be discussed.",49
243,Mr SCULLIN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"The power of proclamation vitally affected the development, of our favourable trade balance, and it saved this country from insolvency.",49
244,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,It had nothing to do with it.,49
245,Mr SCULLIN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"There had grown up iii this country an extravagant system under which not only the governments of Australia but also private people were buying oversea goods on borrowed money. They were building up a huge debt in respect of oil and motor cars, and absopawning this country to foreign traders. We came into office facing the worse economic and financial position in Over the history of this country, with an had accumulated adverse trade balance of over £100,000,000. In .1929-30, when we took office, the adverse trade balance, apart altogether from gold and bullion, £32,000,000, and in that year we were unable to borrow money overGoseas. Imports were flowing in, and we had to check them at once. This year, because of the action taken by the Government, we have a favourable trade balance of £28,000,000.",49
246,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Nonsense ! It is due mostly to the reduced purchasing power of the community.,49
247,Mr SCULLIN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"It is true that our ability to import was affected, not only by the reduced value of our exports, but the also by the decline in the purchasing get power of the community. The value of our imports in the last financial year £45,000,000. The power of proclamation, which we have exercised, bas enabled us to regulate the classes of goods imported into Australia. Honourable members seem to have lost sight of that fact. We wera importing millions of pounds worth of goods that should never have been admitted into this country. I refer to luxury lines, such as tinned meats 'and vegetables, even dairy products. We were rapidly approaching the position in which we would not have had sufficient credit from our exports with which to pay for imported lines that were necessary to carry on industry in Australia. There was no money for imported raw materials or essential machinery. There was no money for the essential things that we needed, but there were millions of pounds available for luxury lines that could be manufactured successfully in Australia. We have turned an adverse trade balance into a favourable trade balance by the use of the power of proclamation. Set within one month of exercising that, power, another place would have robbed us of it.",49

255,Mr SCULLIN,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"This power of proclamation has beeii most useful to this country. Without it we could not have prevented the export of stud sheep.

256,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Henty) [4.38] - The Prime Minister has not given one reason for not accepting the amendment. At the risk of repetition, I wish to make clear not only my attitude in regard to these prohibitions, but also the attitude of every honorablo member on this side of the chamber. I subscribed absolutely to the application of prohibitions as an adjuster of the trade balance. When the Government proposed to take the power of proclamation I spoke after the Prime Minister and pointed out definitely that there was danger in the free use of prohibition by proclamation. I said that it was calculated to antagonize certain foreign countries which are great customers of ours, and unless applied wisely with great discretion, would draw from, them active retaliation. I pointed out that we had much to lose as great exporters of primary produce, by the careless, if not reckless, use of prohibitions by proclamation. I , therefore, urged the Prime Minister to put a time limit upon tbem. At the same time. I said that we, as an Opposition, were prepared, when the time limit expired, to consider any proposal from the Government to re-impose certain prohibitions should there be no alteration in conditions.  amendment was moved for a time limit of six months.",50
257,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"l t was definitely moved. I am sorry to charge the Prime Minister with misrepresentation, but he .certainly misrepresented my attitude. It is very evident that the speech of the GoWhip this afternoon has caused Government supporters to lose complete control of their tempers. The Prime Minister himself has never given a worse exhibition of loss of temper and loss of control in this chamber. The spectacle was painful. He claimed that this Government, by taking action under the power of proclamation, saved - Australia from insolvency; but the people of this country think differently. If the GoAusvernment believes that, why this reluctance to face the electors? Why does it not ask for the re-endorsement of its policy ?",50
258,Mr LEWIS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,I rise to a point of order. Is the question whether this Government should go before the electors relevant to the amendment under discussion ?,50

260,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I trust that the people, whom this Government considers sbould be grateful to them, will soon have an opportunity of expressing their gratitude. The sooner the election takes place, the better it will please honourable members on this side of the chamber. I believe in the imposition of prohibitions, within reason. Prohibitions have been a contributing, factor in .the falling off of imports, but not to any great extent. The main factor has been the reduced purchasing capacity of the community. If that were not so, the reduction of imports would have beeu attended by an increase of employment. The people would have manufactured goods which could be made here, and to which the Prime Minister referred, or they would have manufactured substitutes. They have done neither. We all know that, side by side with the falling off of imports there has been a terrible decline in employment. The correction of the trade balance has been brought about mainly by our relative poverty, and it would have taken place largely even without the use of this power of proclamation.

261,Mr GEEGOEY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Swan) [4.51] - Will the Minister arrange for the inclusion in the bill of a definition of the term "" not commercially produced or manufactured in Australia"". The decision in so important a matter should not be left to the favour of the Minister- I do not say that offensively. It would be well if the recommendations of the Tariff Board were published, so that the public would know what goods are considered to be commercially produced or manufactured in this country. We are now dealing with an amendment of the Customs Act, and the time seems opportune for this matter to be cleared up. Before the bill was introduced, the Government's proposals should have been referred to the various Chambers of Commerce in Austraha, with a view to obtaining their advice as to alterations which would be advisable in the interests of trade generally. I know that it is useless to move 21 an amendment unless the Minister is pre28 pared to accept it. I hope that he will accede to my request. Clause agreed to. AYES. Clauses 5 to 17 agreed to.",51
262,Mr GREGORY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Swan) [4.56] - In view of the decision which the committee has just recorded, I do not propose to proceed with proposed new clause 8A., but I desire the insertion of a new clause to follow clause 13. I therefore move That the following new clause be inserted:13A. Section 226 of the principal act is amended by adding the following words: "" o r uut.il 00 days after such tariff or tariff alteration has been proposed, whichever period is the shorter "". The law provides that a tariff schedule shall be void unless ratified during the session of the Parliament in which it is laid on the table. In recent years, it has been the practice to adjourn Parliament from time to time, so that it is possible for oue session to extend over the whole life of a parliament. I want to ensure that a tariff schedule shall be dealt with by Parliament within a certain definite period after it has been tabled, and that if not so dealt with, it shall cease to have effect. We have to decide whether taxation is to be imposed without the consent of Parliament.",51
263,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"What connection has the proposed new clause with section 226 of the principal act, which deals with the protection of officers?",52
264,Mr GREGORY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Sectio n 220 of the principal act readsNo proceeding, whether against an officer or otherwise for anything done for the protection of the revenue in relation to any tariff or tariff alteration proposed in Parliament shall except as mentioned in the next section be commenced before the close of the .session in which such tariff or tariff alteration is proposed. I propose to add to that section the following words: ""or until 90 days after such tariff or tariff alteration is proposed, whichever period is the shorter "".",52
265,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,I am advised that the honourable member's proposal is out of order.,52
266,Mr GREGORY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"My advice is that it is in order. It is the only clause in the act which refers to the right of the payer of customs duties. In any case, if am wrong, the matter could be rectified later. Parliament should have the right to say whether a tariff schedule shall be permitted to operate for nearly three years . without parliamentary approval, and be ratified only a few months before a new parliament is elected. Customs taxation is the only taxation which is levied without the approval of Parliament. Neither laud tax nor income tax can be collected without parliamentary approval. In the United States of America, a tariff schedule is not operative until it has been approved by Parliament. I wish to test the feeling of the committee, and to ascertain whether it considers that any government should be permitted to put a tariff schedule on the table, and allow it to operate tbroughout the whole life of the Parliament without parliamentary approval.",52
267,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Warringah) [5.0] - I support the amendment, and see no objection to requiring that a tariff impost shall be considered by Parliament within three months of the tabling of the schedule. Mr E. RILEY - There might be a war in progress.",52
268,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"In that case we could wait until the war wa* over. It is not reasonable that the business of the country should be held up by a tariff of 400 items, operating for two years during which the business community does not know whether or not they will be ratified. The proposal of the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) is that, within three months of the schedule being put into operation, the Government should have the items discussed by Parliament, and decisions upon them made. What objection can there be to that? It is not a matter of flooding the country with imported goods, but of giving the public a fair deal. The only objection that the Minister seems to find to the amendment is that it is proposed to be inserted in the wrong place. If so, he might suggest for the benefit of the committee where it could be appropriately included. What objection can there be to the public being treated decently, and tariff imposts discussed and got out of the way? Although the present tariff has been in operation for practically two years, it still has to be dealt with in another place. The first schedule was brought, down in November, 1929, and I shall not be surprised if a general election intervenes before the tariff is disposed of by both branches of the legislature.",52
269,Mr THEODOBE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,That is a serious reflection on another place.,52
270,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I do not think so. The other chamber bas equal rights with this House in discussing the tariff schedule, and it is equally entitled to stand by its objections.

CAMEEON (Brisbane) [5.10]. - I move That the following new clause be inserted:"" 8 A. Section 132 of the principal act amended by adding at the end thereof following proviso:-Provide d that goods ported on any vessel shall, upon entry for consumption at any port after the first of call in Australia, be dutiable at all ports at the rates of duty in force on the date vessel carrying the goods first reported Australian port of call."" I foreshadowed this amendment during eight, or even ten years ago. the second-reading debate. The Minister Minister theu expressed the opinion that the repreincluding sentations which bad been made in port of the change proposed have chiefly or entirely from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce.",52
271,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Chiefl y from that body. Mr D . CAMEBON - This amendment has been approved of unanimously by the Associated Chambers of Commerce 18 of Australia at each of their annual con29 ferences for several years past. The Brisbane chamber has, no doubt, been the 11 most active in the matter, because Queensland has suffered more disability than the AYES. southern States owing to the absence of the provision contained in my amendment. The Minister also said that, if by any unfortunate circumstance-other s might regard it as a happy circumstance W - a change of government sliould take place, and a reduction were made in the tariff, importers in Queensland might suffer by this change. But all these points have been considered, and the one desire NOBS. is to have the matter adjusted on an equitable basis. I hope that, even now, if the Minister is unwilling to accept my amendment, he will himself bring down an amendment to meet the repeated request of the chambers of commerce and the trading community throughout Australia.",53
272,Mr BAYLE Y,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Oxley) [ 5 . 1 2 ] - I support the amendment. The point that it raises has been discussed on numerous occasions. So far as my recollection PAIBS. serves me, each Minister for Trade and Customs, in turn, when waited on by deputations in Brisbane, has stated either that the Government intended to amend the Customs Act to enable this alteration to be made, or that he would at least give it sympathetic consideration. I think that that was the position in which the present Minister found himself wheu he was waited on in Brisbane a few weeks ago; but, despite the statements by is various Ministers, no alteration has been the made, and I am compelled to think that imthe officials of the department are opposed home to any alteration. I can understand that, port because in the past Parliament has dealt the with every individual item, in the tariff, at. an and the average rate of duty today is much higher than it was, say, seven or Each for Trade and - Customs, the present Minister, has, as I suphave said, promised sympathetic concome sideration of this matter.",53
273,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,We promise that with regard to.all requests.,54
274,Mr BAYLEY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"But the present Minister,, by the tone of his voice, and by his facial expression, did more than that. Those attending the deputation in Brisbane went away convinced that he, at least, was on their side, and would use every eudeavour to bring about the alteration provided for in the amendment now before the committee. I contend, therefore, that the. finaucial aspect has been the chief consideration in the past. The Customs Department, and each succeeding government in turn, has been loath to give up that proportion of reveuue which would have been lost had the proposal embodied in this amendment been put into effect at any time within the last ten or twelve years. The position has altered today, however. I say, unhesitatingly, that the Australian tariff today is at its peak, and, if any alterations are made, they will be in the direction of reducing it. Consequently, neither the Government nor the department need fear any loss of revenue as a result of this amendment being accepted. There can be no argument whatever as to the justice' of the proposal. Why should the people in the eastern States-no t those in Brisbane alone, but in the other eastern cities, also-be penalized because a ship happens to call first at Fremantle? There are Bome ships-thoug h not so many as in former years when the old B . I . vessels 1*3X1 by way of Torres Straits?which call first at Townsville and Brisbane, and then go on to Sydney, Melbourne and other ports. For a long time past, people have felt the injustice and inequality of the regulation as it is now framed, and now that financial considerations no longer enter into it so far as the revenue is concerned, there is no reason why the amendment should not be accepted. The Minister < should consult with his colleagues in the Cabinet to see whether it is not possible, when the bill reaches another place, to have this amendment incorporated.",54
275,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Henty) [5.18] - I support the statement of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron) that it was the intention of the last Government to make this change. The Minister said that the request has come, in the main, from Queeiisland. It is rather remarkable to bear the Minister dismiss a request on the ground that it comes only from Queensland.",54
276,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I take a broad, national view, not a parochial one.",54
277,Mr GULLETT,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Yes , as on cotton. The question whether a change should be made is, I admit, highly controversial, and the senior officers of the Customs Department, for whose judgment on technical matters I have the greatest respect, have been in favour of the retention of the present practice. After having given full consideration to the matter, however, I have come to the conclusion that this practice is distinctly unfair to trading interests in the ports at which a ship may call after having first touched at Australia. I believe that, on the whole, the arrangement outlined in the amendment would be more equitable than the present one, and I therefore support the amendment.",54
278,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.20] - I u my reply, during the second-reading stage of the debate, I said that I could not accept .this amendment, which had been - foreshadowed, because its constitutionality was in doubt. It is true that one Kong's counsel has expressed the opinion that it would be constitutional, but others have said the opposite, and a royal commission which inquired into the matter stressed the administrative difficulties which would be raised if such a change were effected. There are some arguments in favour of the proposal; but, on the other baud, it would mean that, if duties were reduced after a ship had called at Fremantle, traders in the eastern ports would not obtain the benefit of it. Those who favour this proposal have askod that, instead of there being a uniform rate of duty all over Australia, duty shall. be payable at the rate applicable to the goods at the time they first arrive in Australia. Under such an arrangement it would be possible to have two ship3 discharging at the same time similar goods upon which two dif-r ferent rates of duty were payable. Such a situation would be fantastic, and I cannot accept the amendment. {Quorum formscl.']",54
279,Mr BELL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Darwin) [5.22] - I support the amendment. The Minister has said that its constitutionality is doubtful, but objections of that sort are. frequently raised by Ministers when they do not want to accept an amendment moved by a member of the Opposition. I clo uot know whether the amendment is constitutional, nor, apparently, does the Minister. The position, in any case, can be ascertained whether the amendment is passed or not. The Minister has stated that the demnud for this change comes principally from Queensland. I remind him, however, that for years past the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce has advocated an amendment on the lines of that now before the committee. Tasmanian merchants have suffered from the present arrangement to a greater extent, probably, than those in other States. Ships coming from overseas discharge part of their cargo at Victorian ports, and then go on to Tasmania, perhaps only a day or two later, to discharge more of it. In the meantime, however, increased duties may have been imposed by this Parliament. The merchants in Tasmania are in direct competition with those in Victoria, because a great deal of trade is carried on between Victorian merchants and the people of Tasmania, so that the Tasmanian merchants, who have to pay the higher rate of duty, are at a disadvantage as compared with their Victorian competitors. In some cases, the duty may ho increased by as much as 50 per cent., or, as has happened within recent months, by as much as 200 per cent. Indeed, this matter affects Tasmania probably more than Queensland. ""Wliether the change can be made constitutionally we cannot determine now, but the fairness and equity of the proposal must be oh-, ious to every one.",55
280,Mr WHITE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Balaclava) [5.25] - The Minister stated that Queensland was most concerned in this matter, but that is not rrue. The Minister must know that ships bringing goods from America usually call first at Sydney, and afterwards go on to Melbourne, while shins from Great Britain call first at Fremantle. In the case of American goods, therefore, Sydney profits at the expense of Melbourne, while, in the case of English goods, Western Australia profits at the expense of the Eastern States. I know of an instance in which a firm, which is acting in Australia as agent for an American vacuum cleaner, actually unloaded a consignment of goods in Sydney at the lower rate, while Melbourne firms were compelled to pay th* higher rate of duty which had been imposed after the goods were discharged at Sydney. That is not fair; there should bo uniformity. Whether the proposed change would be constitutional seems to be a moot point, but the Minister has had ample time to learn the true position.",55
281,Mr AECHDALE PABKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Warringah) [5.27] - The Svdney Chamber of Commerce has been unanimous in its request for this reform, and recently a conference of business organizations asked that it be brought about. The change would mean merely that, when a ship arrives at the first Australian port of call, the duty on the goods it carries shall be fixed as from that time, and shall be the same at all ports. I cannot accept the arguments of the Minister, and I strongly support the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron). Proposed new clause negatived. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.",55
282,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,I ask for leave to move that the bill be read a third time.,55
283,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I object. - Standing Orders suspended and bill read a third time. WINE EXCISE BILL. SECOND BEADING. Debate resumed from the 9th October (vide page 624), on motion by Mr. FOBDEThat the bill be now read a second time.  This is a machinery bill, and has apparently been introduced with the object of changing the method of imposing taxation on wine. I understand that, so far as a large part of the wine industry is concerned, there is no great objection to this, although there may be objection from other quarters. At the present time, taxation is imposed only on the fortifying spirit contained in the wine. There is no excise tax on wine as wiue. Under the proposed method it is intended to impose the excise tax on the wine itself as wine, at so much a gallon. There is something in the nature of a ""pig in a poke"" about this legislation. Tbere is no indication as to the extent of the future taxation, nnd we shall uot know what it is to be until an excise bill is brought down to impose it. The bill merely indicates that it will be applied in a way different from that which obtained in the past. It appears inevitable that, when this bill becomes law, taxation will be imposed on wine regardless of whether it is sweet or dry, although the same rate will not necessarily apply to each. At present only sweet wine is taxed. It may be that some honourable members are curious to know why that is so, and what is the real distinction between dry and sweet wino for taxation purposes. I admit that probably no one in the House knows less than I about wine as a potable liquid, but I know a little more about the method of taxation of the different types of wine. When the grapes come in from the vineyard and are placed in vats at the winery, fermentation immediately begins. If that fermentation process is permitted to continue without interruption, the whole of the sugar content of the grapes is converted into alcohol, which results in a dry wine, containing between 20 and 2S per cent, alcohol. That dry wine is not taxed, as at present excise tax is levied only on fortifying spirit, none of which is introduced into dry wine. If the grapes are put into the vats at the winery and the process of fermentation is arrested at a certain point by the introduction of a quantity of fortifying spirit, the result is a sweetThere wine. The wine retains some of its original sweetness, because a portion of the grape sugar remains unconverted into alcohol. Sweet wine usually contains from 34 to 40 per cent, of alcohol. If the change contemplated by this bill is brought about, and excise tax is imposed on wine as wine, without taking into consideration the fortifying spirit that may be used in it, it appears to me  that the taxation must apply to all wine at so much per gallon. If , despite thi* legislation, it is the intention of the Government to confine taxation to sweei wines, wine-makers will take advantage of the opportunity, and mix the two classes, using a quantity of sweet Avine containing as high a percentage as possible of grape sugar and spirit. The practice Would deprive the Customs Department of a considerable amount of revenue.",55
284,Mr CROUCH,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Is it not done at present ?  same incentive to do it at present. Supposing that a Avine-maker takes a wine, showing a very high sugar content, and a 40 per cent, alcoholic content, and mixes it Will an equal quantity of dry win* 1 Will an alcoholic content of 28 per cent., on which there is no taxation, the resul' Would be a blended sweet Avine Will an alcohol content of say, 34 per cent. Thai would considerably reduce the duty chargeable. For that reason, it seems to me that, if this system is folloAved of imposing taxation on wine as such, at so much per gallon rather than ou the spirit, and dry wine remains tax free the Customs Department must inevitably lose a certain amount of revenue.",56
285,Mr JOJJSS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Is the honourable member serious when he states that there is no incentive at present for makers to mix the two types of Avine?  much incentive to do so HOAV, because taxation is imposed only on the spirit content of the Avine. It may be the practice to mix the two types of Avine, but the profii to be gained thereby is nothing compared with Avhat it Would be if taxation were applied to sweet wines at so much per gallon, and dry Avines left free of tax. are relatively feAv persons making fortifying spirit. It is produced by tb»distilleries. On the other hand, there are a great many Avho make wine. I understand that Aery excellent wine is made r by persons who OAATI only a modest plant and operate on a small scale. If the taxation is going to apply to all wine as such, rather than to the fortifying spirit content, the measure will need additional policing. I take it that that is the reason why the Government proposes that the producer must be registered, and the wine-maker licensed. The registration of the grape-grower is to be free, but there is to he a nominal charge to license a wine-maker who has a small output, and a greater one for the man who is operating on a bigger scale. [Quorum formed.] At present an excise tax must be paid on sweet wine that is to be exported. When the export occurs, a drawback of that tax is obtained, and a bounty is paid on the wine exported. There are really three operations. TJnder the proposed scheme no tax will be paid on the wine exported, so that there will be no drawback. In that way the new system will effect a simplification. Clause 24 readsLicences may be cancelled by the Minister hy notice in the Gazette if the licensee victed of any offence against this act or any other act relating to excise. Tliat is a very great power to give to the Minister. I do not suggest that it will be unwisely used. Nevertheless, if some future Minister were to use that power drastically, and cancel the licence of a wine-maker who employed a great number of men, because his manager or> some other employee had committed a technical breach of the law, the result would be very serious, indeed. I imagine that there must be a certain amount of apprehension among wine-makers as to what might result from the bestowing of primitive power upon the. Minister. Some of that apprehension might be removed if the Minister would assure the Honse that the powers conferred in this clause to cancel licences will be used with discretion and moderation. there be any right of appeal against the delicensing of a wine-maker, or will the Minister's decision be final? I assume that the delicensed person will have recourse at law against the decision of the Minister.",56
286,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"The clause provides only for cancellation after conviction; there can be no doubt as to the fact of conviction.  could take away a lieence after only one convietion, which may have been for a more or less technical offence. That is a great power to give to the Minister. Clause 62 providesXo person shall after any wine has been delivered for home consumption mix that wine with any wine which at the time of its delivery for home consumption was liable to a different rate of excise duty. I'could understand this proposal if the Government intended to tax at a flat rate per gallon only the heavier wines and exempt light wines. There would then be an inoentive to blending, and it would ba exceedingly difficult to prevent such a practice. But if the Government intends to impose the same taxation on all wines, whether dry or sweet, fortified or unfortified, there is little need for the clause. If taxation were imposed on a scientific basis, rising gradually with the increase in the strength of the wine, little relief from tax would be gained by blending, or if blending took place, little or is con- no loss of revenue would result.",57
287,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Angas) [5.49] - I . am pleased that this bill was circulated in sufficient time to give honourable members an opportunity to consider it ; aud not, as happened last night with the Wheat Charges Bill, only a few minutes before it was to be passed through all stages. Another gratifying feature is that the machinery provisions are set forth in such plain language as to be understandable by any person of ordinary education and intelligence. This is mainly a machinery measure for the levying of excise on wine instead of, as previously, merely on the fortified spirit contained in wine. The Minister has been in full consultation with the Viticultural Council which now represents, I believe, all the big wine makers. : They have had Will an opportunity to consider all aspects of it. For that reason there is no particular call upon me to speak on behalf of the wine-makers, especially as several distinguished representatives of the industry are in the galleries at this moment. But has the Minister taken pains to ascertain the views of the growers? When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) asked that question, the Minister did not answer it, beyond saying that he had received no protests from the growers. Will be inform the House what growers or associations of growers have been consulted in regard to the bill?",57
288,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"The Honourable John Gunn, Director of Development, and Mr. Gollan, Senior Excise Inspector, conducted an inquiry into the industry extending over nine months, and consulted «11 interested parties.",57
289,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Does the Minister suggest that Messrs. Gunn aud Gollan intimated to the growers the nature of this legislation 1,58
290,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"No officer can know what the final decision of Cabinet will be on any matter; therefore, Messrs. Gunn and Gollan could not tel! the growers what form this legislation would take. They could only recommend, and this bill is founded on their report.",58
291,Mr GARB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"The Minister is skilfully evading my question and is trying to throw the responsibility on Messrs. Gunn and Gollan. The bill is supposed to make easier the policing of the excise law in relation to the manufacture of wine. I question whether it will do so, but I do not pit my limited knowledge against, that of experienced officers. There .is no doubt, however, that the field to be supervised is being extended. Formerly the excise officers had to deal with the manufacturers of fortified spirit; now their supervision will apply to all makers of wine. The sphere of their duties is being widened', and the number of men who may be inclined to adopt doubtful practices will be proportionately greater. This legislation will ease the position of wine-makers; they will have greater freedom in their industry, and will not require to send frequently for the excise officers to release this thing and that thing from bond. Requests for drawbacks also will be obviated; but any increase of convenience to the department and the wine-makers will be at the expense of the growers. The Minister's statement that no protests have been received from the growers is an indirect admission that he has not actually consulted them. Those in my district are of opinion that the heavy excise duty on fortifying spirit, and resultant increase in the price of wine limited consumption, and to that extent was detrimental to their interest. ""Whilst the method of collecting excise does receive some consideration from them, they are more concerned with the amount of excise. We do not know yet what the rates will be. Messrs. Gunn and Gollan suggested an excise duty of 2s. a gallon.",58
292,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Their s was only an advisory report; the Government was not bound to accept their recommendations.,58
293,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I recognize that, and the Minister may treat their report as he treated those of the Tariff Board, which did not suit him.",58
294,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,The report of Messrs. Gunn and Gollan is one of the finest I have read on any industry.,58
295,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,I admit that it is very helpful in many ways.,58
296,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,There are reports and reports.,58
297,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"If the Minister is implying that the reports of the Tariff Board with which he agreed are reports, and those with which he did not agree are not reports, I resent that reflection upon a very able body.'",58
298,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"All roses are sweet, bui some are sweeter than others. [Quorum formed.] Motion (by Mr E. RILEV) negativedThat the question be now put.",58
299,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I thank those honourable members who voted against the application of the gag. Unfortunately, the grape-growers of Australia have too few representatives in this House, and 1 want honourable members to be in attendance, so that they may fully understand the position of the industry. For that reason I called for a quorum. The bill provides that a fine of £20 shall be imposed upon any person who, without being registered, sells, grapes for making wine. I protest .against this penalty. The Minister, when moving the second reading of the bill, said that gold producers who benefit under the Gold Bounty Act are called upon to register. The argument that he used in favour of registering grape-growers was that the winemakers are receiving an export bounty from which the grape.growers benefit. It the' is true that the gold producer has to register if he desires to participate in the bounty, but there is no penalty if he does not register. The linseed and flai growers also receive bounties under certain conditions, but there is no necessity for them to register: Of course, I should not expect the. Minister to agree that the cotton-growers of Queensland should be registered. They are able to obtain all the benefits of the bounty without being obliged to register.  able member think that it is necessary for the grape-growers to be registered?",58
300,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I shall deal with that later. I am opposing, not so much the registration, as the penalty of £20.",59
301,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Bot h tobacco-growers and gold-producers must register.,59
302,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"That is so, but there no penalty if they fail to register. The Minister has said that it is usual for sugar-growoi-3 to register their names. might be taken to task by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) i I said that there was a bounty paid sugar, but there is in existence a sugar embargo which has all the benefits of generous bounty. I have searched the Queensland acts, and I cannot find that the sugar-grower is compelled to register. I am open to correction on that point. In any case, if registration is necessary on the part of the sugar-grower, there no penalty for failure to register. The Minister's bost argument is in regard to the tobacco-growers. Under the Excise Act, it is necessary for tobacco-growers to register, and there is a penalty for failure to do so, but I still contend a penalty of £20 for failure to register on the part of both the tobacco-growers and the grape-growers is unjust. Any lightening of the burden of the wineI maker and the excise officer will be at the expense of the grape-grower.",59
303,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"No fee is charged registration, and the grape-growers required to furnish a return once a year only.",59
304,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Accordin g to the Miniswhich ter, the grape-growers should be thankful that they are not being called upon a registration fee. I find no provision in the bill relating to dealers who purchase grapes for winereturn. making. For several years, dealers in South Australia have travelled through Adelaide and its suburbs purchasing grapes grown in backyards, and selling them for spirit and wine-making purschools poses. This year it seems there will be plenty of grapes in South Australia meet the demand, and it will not be additional expenditure. profitable for dealers to purchase grapes in the suburbs, but the position may be different in the future. I admit that it is better to sell the grapes grown honoriu backyards in that way than to leave them on the vines to ferment and become a nuisance. Honourable members may not realise how prolific grape vines are in South Australia. I trust that in the interests of the grape-growers it will again be necessary for the dealers to purchaso grapes in and around the city of is Adelaide, and that better times are in store for the industry, particularly under the the Canadian Trade Agreement, which I will permit the entry of our wines into Canada. I also hope that the British f preference will be retained. If the on exchange remains as it is at present, we shall have a decided advantage over a South Africa. I am looking forward to an extension of our trade in sweet wines on the other side of the world. Tbis bill should contain a provision enabling dealers to purchase grapes grown in and around the suburbs of Adelaide and elseis where for wine-making purposes. Are these dealers, if they purchase grapes without being registered, to be liable to a penalty of £20? I think that the Minister should give consideration to that question. It would be ridiculous to impose a that penalty of £20 upon me just because I have four or five vines in my backyard and sell the grapes to a dealer who sells them for wine-making purposes. t would be equally foolish to contend that I should be registered before I could make such a sale. A dealer, of course, could be registered or licensed. for The Minister has ,said that it does are not cost the grape-grower anything for registration. That is quite true, but he fails to realise that unless the return must be supplied by the growers is simple-and I fear the red tape of Goto pay vernment departments-man y of tbem will be put tc> the expense of paying 10s. 6d. or £1 Is. for the compilation of the In South Australia many grapegrowers, especially those of the older generation, are conversant more with the German than with the English language. They have been brought up in Lutheran in which the German language was largely taught. If the return is comto plicated, they will be forced to incur They have already been hit hard enough, and I contend that they should not be asked to suffer any further burden. I , therefore, urge the Minister aud his officers to make this return as simple as possible. In my electorate a number of people >grow currants, aud, according to the .market or the season, those currants are - dried or sold to the winery or distillery. .In the districts where these currants are grown-Angastown , Eden Valley, Springton, in the hills-sometime s the season is wet, and the currants are not able to be dried.",59
305,Unknown,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Sitting suspended from 6.15 - to S p.m. {Quorum formed.},60
306,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"When the Minister replies, I hope that he will make clear the position of the currant-growers. As 1 bave already stated, the prices for dried fruits and the climatic conditions in certain districts cause growers to dry their fruit in some seasons and to take it to the 'wineries in other seasons. Olause 11 provides thatA registered producer who celiacs to produce grapes at any premises in respect which he is registered, shall forthwith notice to the Collector, and the Collector shall thereupon cancel liis registration in of these premises. 1 draw attention to the words "" who ceases to produce grapes "". As this deals entirely with grapes grown for production of wine, I should like to know whether a grower wbo sells grapes to a winery one year, and the following sells them as currants, will have to restricted. deregister each time that he passes from a grape-grower for wine-making purposes to a grape-grower for the purpose of producing currants. I do not want my stituents to have any doubt about this matter, and, therefore, I should like a taken ? definite reply from the Minister so that it can be recorded in Hansard. Since it is evident that the Government intends that the growers of grapes shall be registered, any protest which I might makers, some of whom, I make would be unavailing. If the growers of grapes for wine-making purfully poses are to be registered, hope that, if constitutionally postion sible, new growers will be prevented from entering the industry until the demand overtakes the supply. report of the Minister's speech, as recorded in Hansard, I am credited with having interjected, "" I hope that the object is not to prevent new growers from entering the industry"". The word "" not"" should not be there. I said "" I hope that the object is to prevent growers from entering the industry "". Unless the recent frost in South Australia has beeu particularly severe, there is every likelihood that large quantities of grapes will be left ou the vines in the coming grape season. Unfortunately, that condition of things may continue for some years. There is room for a difference of opinion on this matter; but I am inclined to think that only gradually will conditions improve. Since 1924 I have done my best to discourage the planting of further areas with grapes for wine-making.",60
307,Mr HUGHES,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Does the honourable member suggest that the board should issue licences for fresh vineyards?,60
308,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"This bill provides for the registration of all persons who grow grapes for the production of wine. As there is a glut in the wine market, I suggest, in the interests of the growers themof selves, that further new registrations be give refused for the time being.",60
309,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,Did not the honourable respect member say that he is opposed to the registration of the growers?,60
310,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,I did not say that. I am bill opposed chiefly to the heavy penalty the provided for failure to register.,60
311,Mr HUGHES,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,In the sugar industry year the registration of new growers is,60
312,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,I suggest that the same thine be done in this .industry.,60
313,Mr MCNEILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,What period does the conhonorable member think will elapse before further planting should be under,60
314,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"In that matter the Minister may safely rely on the advice of his senior inspector. I urge bim not to act on the advice of the big wineam afraid, are looking forward hopeto the time when the smaller I grape-growers will be in. the posiof serfs. It is because I want to prevent that position from developing that I make' the request which I now In the submit to the Minister. I should also like to know whether it instill the intention of the Government that one-half of the amount derived from the excise shall be placed in a trust account. from which the bouuty will be paid. That is the position today in connection with the excise on for t if y in g spirit. I regard this measure from the point of view of the growers of grapes. The big winemakers have been so well represented, and are in receipt of so much inside in formation, that I do not feci called upon to speak on'their behalf. At an earlier stage, when the Minister was asked to give the name of one grower or organization that he had consulted, he fell back on Mr Gollan, the senior inspector, and Mr Gunn. Mr CBOUC.II - The Minister has interviews with several growers, and has received a number of deputations. introduced one deputation to him.",60
315,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I am glad to know that the Minister has consulted with other growers. He has, however, not consulted with the growers in South Australia, in which State is produced SO per cent, of the wine of this country. I wish to make it clear that I did not intend to reflect on Mr Gollan in any way. Nothing was further from my mind than that. On one occasion, wben a deputation of grape-growers waited on me, I had to defend Mr Gollan from an attack by a big wine-maker, who said that he was standing in the way of the growers. I have found the senior in spector to be wise and tactful in defiling with the difficult problems which he has bad to face; he has not favoured either the growers or the makers of wiue. Naturally, he considers the interests of the department of which he is an officer, and does what he can to protect the revenue of the country. I intend to move for a reduction of the heavy penalty on those who grow grapes for wine-making without being registered, but I do not wish it to be thought that in so doing I am ont to encourage sly grog-selling.",61
316,Mr BEASLEY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"""What is the penalty for non-registration ?",61
317,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Clause 7 provides thatNo person shall produce grapes for use in the manufacture of wine unless lie is registered pursuant to this part. Penalty: £20. As a layman, I take it that the penalty is £20 in all cases.",61
318,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,That is the maximum penalty.,61
319,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) for making the position clear. I have already said that the report of Messrs. Gollan and Gunn contains much valuable information, but I wish to make it cleax. that I clo not agree with their recommendation to reduce the wine bounty to. Is. 3d. a gallon. Already it is only about. Is. 4d., and probably the Minister will be satisfied with that. I hope that iie,will not further reduce the bouncy I have always found the senior inspector optimistic in regard to the prospects of the wine industry, but I hope that the Government will not go back on its had original intention to grant sufficient bounty to enable the glut of wine to be I sold. The ""Wine Overseas Marketing Board, in its annual report for the year ended the 30th June last, statedThere can be no doubt that the position from Australia's point of view in regard to increased shipments has been very substantially assisted by the rates of exchange ruling. Competition from South Africa has been growing in intensity and the decreased purchasing power of the English community at the same time was creating a position that would have been extremely difficult indcud for Australian wine exporters. '.Che present rate of exchange permits the English merchant to purchase Australian currency wherewith to pay the minimum fixed price, and the board is of opinion that it would be a mistake to endeavour to raise the price to the English importer at this moment, or to insist upon his rebating some of the exchange. Such an action would be tantamount to throwing away a unique opportunity for clearing the great accumulation of stocks in Australia, and emptying our over-stocked cellars. It seems that Messrs. Gunn and Gollan took notice of that statement in regard to exchange, because I observe that in their report they remarkThe Britisli merchant has also taken advantage of the rate of exchange, prices in London having been reduced to the extent of the exchange premium. After a complete examination of the position it is considered that a reduction in the rate of bounty is justifiable. If the rate were reduced to Is. 3d. per gallon, it is not anticipated that the export trade would be seriously prejudiced. I hope that the Ministei' will not be influenced unduly by the optimism of his senior inspector regarding the future of the wine trade. It must be realized that once South Africa's disadvantage owing to the exchange rate is removed, the competition of the wine trade of that country will be serious for Australia. If , as suggested, there were a common currency standard for the whole British Empire, South Africa, with its cheap coloured labour and its proximity to the British market would prove a formidable competitor with Australia in'the export of wine. Some of our big wine-makers who have a home market are very little concerned about the export trade. The ACTING DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Keane) - Th c honourable member's time has expired.",61
320,Mr JONES,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Indi) [8.20] - I represent an electorate which produces a fair quantity of good wine. Messrs. Gunn and Gollan, who spent a considerable time in inquiring into the conditions in the wine industry, presented a voluminous and informative report, and I assume that this measure will provide the machinery for giving effect to some of their recommendations. The honourable member for Angas (Mr. Gabb) complained that the growers have not been consulted, but I take it that Messrs. Gunn and Gollan consulted the growers in every State visited by them.",62
321,Mr BEASLEY,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,He referred particularly to the growers in South Australia.,62
322,Mr JONES,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"I take it that Messrs. Gunn and Gollan conferred with the growers in the various States, as the members of the Select Committee on the Tobacco Industry conferred with the tobacco-growers, and that they took evidence from all angles, in order to get the views of the growers, the manufacturers and the consumers. The honourable member failed to give a single reason why the growers should not be registered. Clause 7 of the bill provides that no person shall produce grapes for use in the manufacture of wine unless he is registered. That does not mean that a person who has a. few vines at his back door must register. The registration of the growers of grapes intended for use in the manufacture of wine would be helpful to the statistiscians and for record purposes. Owing to the registration of tobacco-growers, I was recently able to ascertain from the Customs Department, by return post, the names and number of tobacco-growers throughout Australia. The registration of grape-growers will cost them nothing, aud the information obtained will be useful in consideriug any need for limitation of the acreage under crop. It costs a gold producer nothing to register his name, but if a man is not registered he cannot participate in the gold bounty. A tobaccogrower, even though he may not manufacture tobacco, is subject to a penalty for non-registration. Tbere is more to be said in favour of compulsory registration than against it. I was delighted with the homily of the honourable member for Gipps manufacture of wine. If he had been accustomed to sampling the finished product, he might have spoken of sparkling wines, and of ""beading bubbles winking at the brim"". He said that at the present time there was little incentive for the blending of wines, but I claim that there is much incentive in that direction, because the excise duty is on the fortified spirit content of wiue. The practice has grown of late years for some to blend dry wine with sweet wine, and sell the product as sweet wine, in order to evade the excise duty. If a fiat rate of excise duty were imposed on all wine, there would be no inducement to blend in that way. The honourable member for Angas complained of the penalties contained in. the bill, but I do not consider them to be too high. Heavy penalties act as a deterrent to those who may be disposed to transgress the law.' If the penalties were nominal, excise officers would probably have to deal with many complaints. [Quorum formed.] I remind the honourable member for Angas that some of the grape-growers are also winemakers. If he had his way, the grower wbo is also a wine-maker would have to bo licensed as a winemaker, but he would not have to register as a grower of grapes for use in the manufacture of wine, and that would create an anomaly. There is in my electorate a vine-growers' association, which is represented on the Victorian Viticultural Council, and I received advice only today that two delegates from the association were attending a meeting of the council in Melbourne. It is clear, therefore, that the growers had a say in these matters. The growers in my area are not prone to indulge in destructive criticism. They are appreciative of the efforts of this Government on their behalf, and recognize what it has achieved for the wine industry. Some time ago, the Minister for Trade and Customs accompanied me to Rutherglen, so that he might obtain afirst-handknowledge of the problems confronting the wine industry. It became evident to him that many of those engaged in it were in a desperate plight. previous Government had) reduced the export bounty on wine from Is. 9d. to Is. 3d. a gallon, and it did not then pay the wine-makers to export. Their cellars were full of wine, aud they could not buy any more grapes from the growers. Many hundreds of returned soldiers, who had been encouraged to go on the land to grow grapes, were faced with the prospect of seeing their crops rotting on the vines. The Minister immediately restored the bounty of Is. 9d. a gallon, with the result that the wine-makers cleared their cellars, and were able to buy the grapes which the growers had to offer. The Government is deserving of credit for that. To-day I received a communication from the Vine-growers Association at Rutherglen, extending a cordial invitation to the Minister for Markets to visit them, so that they might express their appreciation to him for his work in bringing about the trade agreement between Australia and Canada. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the invitation, and, if he does, I am sure the vine-growers will welcome him warmly. I am convinced that this measure will simplify the working of the Excise Act, and will safeguard the revenue.",62
323,Mr JAMES,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Hunter) [8.33] - I support the measure before the House. This bill, I understand, contains only the machinery clauses for the collection of excise duty on wine. The important measure-that fixing the rate's-ha s not yet been brought down. I am interested in this matter, because there are many vine-growers in my electorate. They have never approached me, and I have never come into contact with any of them. When it was suggested that they should get into touch with me, they said, "" All he thinks about is coal; he is not interested in wine."" I assure honourable members, however, that any industry in Australia paying a decent living wage to its employees, and certainly those in my electorate, will receive my support, whether those controlling it are supporters of mine or not. At any rate, they probably employ people who are supporters of mine, and that is the important consideration so far as L am concerned. The In my electorate, between 150,000 and 200,000 gallons of light, dry wine are produced each year. So far, this wine has not been subject to excise duty, because no fortifying spirit is used in its manufacture. It shows the quality of the goods they produce in that district wheu no fortifying spirit is needed. Our wines contain only the pure grape juice. Some of the wine is sent to other places, and used for blending in the preparation of other wines. I ask the Minister to exempt these light wines from excise duty. Many of the wine-makers have suffered severely as a result of the depression, and some of the firms are in the hands of receivers. In the report presented by Messrs. Gunn and Gollan, particular reference is made to light wines, and a plea is made for special consideration by the Government. At page 60 of the report it is statedIt is considered desirable that dry wines should be exempt from excise duty. It may, however, be neeessary to impose a nominal duty for purposes of control over all wines. The"" consumption of dry wines is not very extensive. They are the natural product of the grape, and it has been urged that the use of light dry wines should be encouraged in preference to other forms of alcoholic bevcrageei There are certain grape-growing areas which produce tbese wines uuder heavy disabilities, and an excise duty on a class of wine which has never previously been taxed would still further handicap their production. Ohablis, and other dry wines, arc manufactured in the Hunter Valley, aud arc sold at Is. 6d. a bottle, as compared with similar wines sold elsewhere at 4s. 6d. a bottle. I understand that the Minister proposes to apply a flat rate of duty on all wines, but I urge him to exempt light, dry wines of less than 23 per cent, of alcoholic content. If the same rate of duty is imposed on dry wines from the Hunter Valley as on sweet wines, the industry in that district will be ruined. I recognize that it is necessary to provide legislative machinery for the control of the wine industry. In this way some check can be kept ou the operations of illicit wine-makers, who are placing their product on the market in the cities. It is difficult to know whether some of the stuff so made is wine or dynamite. Judging by the effect it produces on some people, one would imagine it to be 100 per cent, over proof. I urge the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to my request.",63
324,Mr MARRS,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Wentworth) [8.42] - I admit, candidly, that I know nothing about the growing of grapes or the making of wine, but I do know a good deal about the drinking of it. I have drunk a considerable quantity of Australian wine-of course, under doctor's ordersa fact which is no doubt responsible for my magnificent physical condition. In other words, I am fully matured, as is the Australian wine I drink. I wish particularly to refer to the marketing of Australian wine in G-reat Britain. have made about eighteen or twenty trips to Great Britain, the last about two years ago. I have found that it is not possible to obtain Australian wines on any of the trains running between Southhampton and London, nor, for that matter, on the trains running north from London to Hull, Edinburgh and Inverness. Apart from such places as The Trocadero, and one or two others probably known to the Minister for Markets  possible to get Australian wines in any of the hotels in London. It cannot be obtained at The Savoy, The Ritz or The Cecil. I made inquiries, beginning at Australia House,, to find out the reason for this. bead waiters - on the trains and in tha hotels all told me the same thing. They seemed to know the word ""Australian"", but they knew little or nothing about the country or its products. When I pressed one of them, he told me that it was possible to obtain Australian wine> perhaps in April and May, but not in June, July and August. It generally became available about Christmas time-. Continuity of supply is essential if Australian wines are to capture a place for themselves on the English market. admit that, at the time of which I speak, there was some shipping trouble in Australia, which may have prevented supplies from coming forward, but it remains true that Australian wines do not reach England with sufficient regularity to keep the market supplied. I do not know whether the Minister for Markets went into this matter when he was abroad, but it is deserving of his attention. Our wines can hold their own with those of any other country in the world. The American wines most sold in England come from California, the "" Big Tree"" brand of sparkling hock being the most popular. Of that I have drunk a good quantity, but I do not think that either it or their Burgundy is a patch on ours. I went into the subject, and made a report to Mr. Bruce, who was then Prime Minister. To make a success of this, or of any other industry, we must put our best young Australians on the job, with a salary of about £1,000 a year plus a commission on the gross turnover. The salary would I allow them to dress and look well, take people to dinner, to the theatre, and to the pictures, while the commission would be an incentive for them to go their hardest and sell our goods. I admit that the Export Board at Australia House is doing very good work, but it is not all that I desire. You cannot get a body of men sitting around a table in a room at Australia House a few times a week to deal adequately with such an important subject as our export trade.  has been overcome by the formation of an Export Control Board, which has agents doing the very type of work to which the honourable member has referred. The Mr MARRS - I am sure that, as a result of the Minister's visit to Great Britain, our business will improve. I want him to accept cheers for the excellent work that he did over there. I know something about this business. His was a wonderful achievement. I trust that his visit to Great Britain will have a good effect in stimulating the whole of our export trade. I also hope that the Minister will exploit the markets in the East. I made a report on that subject to the GovernI ment of the day after spending weeks inChina and Japan interviewing governments and Ministers. Like all reports, no matter from whom they come, within a week after it was handed in, it was covered with two inches of cobwebs. That is a vast market to exploit, oue to which ihe Minister might well direct his efforts.",64
325,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade aud Customs) [8.48] - The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson) referred to the power that is being given to the Minister to cancel licences. It is similar to that provided in the excise and the beer excise acts, a power that bas never been abused, and is not likely to be abused under this measure. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) raised the subject of the registration of growers. A grape-grower has to register only when he produces urapes for rise in the manufacture of wine. If he produces currants that are to be used as dried fruits, he must register under the Dried Fruits Act, but he has not to deregister simply because he grows grapes that are used in the manufacture of wine. He pays no fee to register, but has only to fill in a simple form stating bow many tons he has sold and to whom rhe sale was made. Four-ninths of the money raised under the proposed flat rate will go into the trust fund, as was the case with the excise duty on fortifying spirit. As to conferring with the growers, the senior inspector of excise is constantly in touch with them in Soutb Australia and other States. I have received deputations from growers in the Great ""Western and Rutherglen districts, and from the Hunter Valley, and the views that they expressed taken into consideration by the Government when framing this measure.",65
326,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,The inspector would not disclose any knowledge that he possessed as to the contents of this bill.,65
327,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"As a good public servant he recognizes that he is an advisor to the Minister of the day; also that this bill concerns a matter of public policy, which he was not privileged to divulge. definition ? I regret that I cannot enlighten honourable members as to the rate of excise that will be charged. It will be broughl down in a schedule in the course of a few weeks.. I assure honourable members that their representations on behalf the producers of light dry wines will taken into consideration. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Jn committee: Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Olause 4 (Parts).",65
328,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,I should like to know whether it is any use my asking to have i user ted a part relating to dealers.,65
329,Mr FORDE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [S.54] - It was only in 1921, when grapes brought £14 a ton, that dealers became active and wont round to backyard growers and others to buy grapes. As grapes are down to about £7 a ton, it is highly improbable that we shall have any trouble of that nature in our time.",65
330,Mr GABB,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Angas) [8.55] - The information that has been given by the Minister is not correct. To my knowledge the dealers went round buying grapes for several years. Perhaps the grape-growing section of my electorate might not appreciate my bringing up this matter, but I have also to conserve the interests of the metropolitan district.

337,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Kooyong) [9.2] - The imposition of an excise duty on wine is a new departure. So far as I am aware uo such duty is imposed in any other wine-producing country. I suppose all countries collect excise duty on beer and spirits, and there must be some very general reason for the exemption of wine.  dom there is an excise duty on so-called "" British wine "".",66
338,Mr LATHAM,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Yes , and also, I think, on must; but I am referring to wine-producing countries. not yet seen the Wine Excise Duty Bill, but obviously it will impose a duty on wine, as such, instead of, as in the past, spirit used for fortifying wine. If the duty applies to all wine, the unfortified dry varieties, which are not so highly alcoholic as the fortified sweet wines, will be for the first time taxed, and the tendency will be to increase the price of them in relation to the price of the heavier brands, I would welcome any measure to increase the proportionate consumption of the lighter wines. It is questionable whether we are not taking a step in the wrong direction, having regard, not only to the ultimate interests of the wine industry, which I regard as secondary, but also to the interests of the people as a whole. Wliether the effect will be what I fear, will depend on the scale of the duties, but any tax that would increase the price of the lighter wines and reduce the consumption of them against the stronger wines would be inadvisable. This clause merely applies all the general proXIII. and visions of the Excise Act to wine; this obviously must increase the general expense of conducting the industry, but if an excise duty is to be imposed on wine, as distinct from fortifying spirit, some such provision is obviously necessary.",66

365,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Warringah) [9.33] - I shall not delay the House by making any lengthy observations on this bill. No honourable member in this chamber is more opposed to repudiation, or to compulsion, that I am; but, after all, the interests of the country are paramount. We have to consider the proposals in this measure from the point of view of justice to all classes in munity. The conversion loan was a magnificent success; 97 per cent, of our internal indebtedness has been voluntarily converted, leaving only 3 per cent., representing about £16,000,000, to be dealt with. In this legislation the Government proposes that the holders of that amount of stock or bonds shall be deemed to have converted their holdings. Considering the matter from every stand-point, I can see no alternative to the Government's proposals, notwithstanding that they involve a measure of repudiation, which One is, however, I think, merely a technical repudiation. [Quorum formed.] Although the conversion loan was dealt with on a voluntary basis, there was a general feeling that, in their own interest, as well as in that of the country, bondholders should convert their holdings. Throughout the campaign it was frequently stated that those who did not Gonvert could not expect to be treated more generously than those who did convert. I listened with interest to the various proposals to deal with the amount unconverted, but I have not heard a practicable scheme propounded. The statements of persons who are in a position to know the facts make it clear that the country cannot pay the amount outstanding, though it has been suggested that money should be obtained from various sources to pay the dissentients. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that there is a considerable amount of inflation going on at the present time. In the interests of the people as a whole, I have set my face against inflation; I shall not, therefore, be a party to inflating the currency for the purpose of paying off those who have not converted their ""holdings. The further suggestion has been made that a lpan should be raised to pay off those who have dissented. In my opinion, that is aiot a practicable suggestion, for I do not think that the people of this country would be willing to subscribe to a loan for that purpose. We have also to consider the effect of such a proposal on the interests of those who have already converted. I blame, to some extent, those who conducted the conversion loan the comcampaign for the fact that even £16,000,000 remains unconverted. At one stage the committee in charge of the appeal announced that advices had been received from various sources which ensured the success of the loan. The effect of that premature announcement was that some stock-brokers who were watching the position carefully advised their clients to dissent. It is probable that had the committee not made that announcement, a further £15,000,000 might have been converted. In these circumstances, I cannot see how we can allow the dissentients to be treated more generously than those who converted, especially when we reflect on the ship which conversion means in many cases. I submit that our first consideranot tion should be to meet, so far as possible, the needs of those who otherwise would suffer by reason of their patriotic action in converting their holdings. My concern converted, is chiefly for the small bondholders. think it is clear from the statement of Treasurer that the Government desires do something to assist them. I make complaint regarding the proposed ment of foreign companies which temlaunched. porarily put money into Commonwealth loans. They did so in accordance with aa arrangement with the Government which it was opened. and the Loan Council. From the inception of the campaign the conversion loan was regarded as loan of sacrifice. Bondholders were asked voluntarily to accept a reduction of interest. If the proposals contained in this measure amount to a technical repudiation of our obligations to those who dissented, what shall we say of effect on those who converted ? In to the 97 per cent, who agreed to accept the sacrifice demanded of them, I canNew not see how we. can allow the other per cent, to escape sacrifice. It was uot sacrifice on the part of 97 per cent, of the bondholders for the benefit of the per cent, who dissented. Nor can I see it would be possible to pay them, other than by inflating the currency or raising loan. In my opinion, the country canBank. not do more than this bill proposes do. I admit that the position is unsatiswith factory; but are not things in general unsatisfactory? We have been forced into a position from which we cannot escape. I desire to quote from the British Financial Times, which is probably the greatest authority in the world on finance.",69

It holds about £30,000,000 worth of government stock which it has and of that amount I £3,S00,000 represents Commonwealth the stock. The stock amounting to £1,000,000, to which was not converted, matured on the no 10th August, or about the time when the treatCommonwealth conversion loan was",70
368,Mr THEODORE,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,On the very day on,70
369,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS," Wben the Government Savings Bank of a New South Wales closed its doors, the Commonwealth Bank had advanced* to it £1,229,183, which it had paid out to meet necessitous cases while negotiations were proceeding as to whether the bank should be taken over by the Commonits wealth Bank or re-opened. I desire the justice House to remember that on that sum the Commonwealth Bank is charging the South Wales savings bank 5 per cent, 3 interest, which amounts to about £60,000 a per annum, and that liability is a first call upon the savings bank's assets. Before it 3 can do anything to assist needy deposibow tors, who - are suffering most harrowing privations, it must pay the interest on the a amount advanced by the Commonwealth It has been said that the State to Savings Bank has not had any dealings the Commonwealth Bank, but its credits with the Commonwealth Bank in its various accounts amount to just over £1,000,000, and it is not permitted to use that credit as a set-off against the £1,000,000 that it owes to the Commonwealth Bank. In those circumstances, I venture the opinion that there is a cousiderable volume of public opinion in New South Wales that the Government Bank is being unfairly treated, that it has a transcendent claim on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of its needy depositors to the redemption of the £1,000,000 worth of Commonwealth stock which it does not desire to convert. amount would go a great way towards setting the bank on its feet again, and assisting the depositors, who have £00,000,000 locked up in the State Savings Bank, by giving tbem access to a portion of their capital. The release of that money would make a tremendous difference were it in circulation in New South Wales. It is surprising to me that the people of that State have been able to carry on in these circumstances. E have no desire to go near the State Savings Bank so long as it remains closed, because there one hears the harrowing statements of women and others wbo are suffering acutely because they are deprived of their money. These people expected never to be hard up, ""but, owing to their money being locked up, they are unable to obtain a penny to meet their ordinary expenses. I urge the Government to endeavour to make available to the bank £1,000,000 in regard to the conversion, in order to relieve the position of these depositors. If that were done it would dissipate the feeling, which is fairly general in New South Wales today, that the Commonwealth Bank has been strangely indifferent to the sufferings of hundreds of thousands of persons who are not only depositors in the State Savings Bank, but also citizens of the Commonwealth. The feeling is fairly general that the Commonwealth Government is more concerned in obtaining control of the State Savings Bank than in assisting it to carry on its operations. I am not at the moment arguing the question whether the bank should be taken over by the Commonwealth Bank, or whether it should be rehabilitated. I simply make an appeal to the Treasurer to endeavour to make available to the depositors who are in need, the £1,000,000 which has not been converted to the Commonwealth loan.

370,Mr CUSACK,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"Eden-Mouaro) [9.54]. - It is gratifying to know that success has been achieved in the conversion of a stupendous loan, the like of which has not been known in the whole world. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Parkhill) bas insinuated that the Government which I support is, to some extent, responsible for the financial position in New South Wales, owing to the closing of the Government Savings Bank in that State. I congratulate the Government on the success of the conversion loan, and I think that it would have been recreant to its duty if it had not brougbt down a measure such as that now before the House, for the purpose of securing equality of sacrifice, and dealing with those bondholders who have declined voluntarily to convert their stock. In my electorate there are a number of small bondholders wbo will suffer great hardship under this bill; but I feel certain that the Government will show them all possible consideration. The Government, is in no way responsible for the attitude assumed by the Government Savings Bank of New Soutb Wales. The control of that institution has been handed over to a set of septuagenarian satellites of vested interests who are able to prevent the policy of the Labour party in regard to banking reform from being put into operation. Those men were appointed by a gentleman who is supposed to be a statesman. He bas one leg in the Premiers' plan and the other leg in the Lang plan. With the leg in the Premiers' plan he has kicked usurers and the rack-rentei""3, and has done good for the workers; and with the other leg he has kicked the workers, and reduced the basic wage, without submitting the matter to arbitration, and has kicked over the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. The honourable member for Warringah will be pleased to know that on Monday next a new publication, to be known as The World, will be launched by Senator Barnes. If it had been published two years ago, we should not have been called upon to pass legislation of the nature of this bill.",71
371,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS," The honourable member, must confine his remarks to the measure before the House.",71
372,Mr CUSACK,UNIFORM COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS,"The Government is prevented from carrying out its financial policy. That unscrupulous publication, the Lang Labor Daily has done considerable damage to the nation. By persistent praise of Lang it has placed that gentleman under the spell of a megalomaniacal obsession, an obsession tinged with anglophobia and chicanery. This journal has, in its political columns a kind of picture gallery, and it publishes portraits of the breakaways in the Beasley group. It boycotts members of our party who are loyal to the Government they were elected to support, and makes heroes of those who harass and embarrass Labour Government. There was. a time when the honourable member for Werriwa was a useful supporter of the Government, and, had he and others assisted the Government to carry out its policy, legislation such as that now before lis would not have been necessary. The honourable member for Werriwa was once regarded as a useful member of this House; now he has become an absolute pest to us. He has developed into a sort of supercilious nabob, who delights in preventing the Government from carrying out its policy. When this new newspaper is published, it will not heap laudation on the leaders in this House, or of any other house. The success of the conversion loan marks a new epoch in the history of financial affairs. No other country can claim sucb a wouderful achievement. When this Parliament agreed to legislation to reduce the wages of the workers, and to cut down social services, it was understood that stops would be taken to reduce the nation's interest burden. By means of the loan conversion, that has been done. I trust that the Government will do its best to relieve cases of hardship among small bondholders. Those with big holdings must be prepared to make sacrifices in common with other sections of the community. This measure,, when carried, will relieve the financial situation, and help us to meet our obligations. I suppose I should scarcely be in order, Mr Deputy Speaker, if I said that The World was going to be published on Monday next, just three days and five hours from now.

373,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"Dalley-Treasurer) the [10.8] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is consequential to the measure we have just been considering. It gives authority to the Commonwealth Government to provide for the statutory conversion of the internal portion of the public debt. As I propose to insert in committee an amendment to enable cases of hardship arising out of compulsory conversion to be met by the use of sinking funds, I take this opportunity briefly to refer to the resources of the sinking fund. The Deputv Leader of the Country party  and made certain suggestions as to how sinking fund moneys might be applied to the retirement, redemption, or purchase of securities held by persons suffering hardship through having to convert, or through having the maturity dates deferred for a longer period than they originally contracted for. When the matter was first considered by the Loan Council, and subsequently by myself ae Treasurer, it was thought that about £1,250,000 could be made available from the sinking fund for such purposes during this financial year; but after discussion with other members of the National Debt Commission, at a meeting which took place last week in Canberra, and a careful examination of the funds which were accruing, we decided that, the amount could be increased. [Quorum formed.] I shall now give particulars of the resources of the sinking fund for the current year. Balances carried forward for 1930-31 amount to £519,000, while the estimated contributions for 1931-32 are £7,036,000, making the total amount expected to be available, £7,555,000. The amount actually used for the redemption of State loans in July, 1931, was £370,000. Certain commitments have to be met with regard to loans, some raised by the States, and some by the Commonwealthtotalling £1,466,000-in London and New York. The-sum of £2,219,000 has to be found to meet commitments in Australia, including securities representing investments of trade moneys, whicn have been dealt with under the original conversion act, and the moneys required for cashing the securities paid over in connection with probate duties. This brings the total commitments up to £4,055,000. Two million pounds have been allotted by the National Debt Commission for the relief of cases of hardship among bondholders, leaving £1,500,000, which is regarded by the Commission as required for accruing obligations, other than those already mentioned, securities). that must be met before the 30th June, 1932. I am not able to give full particulars in respect of this amount, but it might be informative to honourable members if I indicated the nature of some of the commitments. The National Debt Commission believes it to be necessary to have some funds available for the support of the market month by month in Australia, and £100,000 a month has been tentatively allotted for that purpose. Moreover, it is asserted that it may be necessary, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Bank, to use a portion of the sinking fund moneys for the purpose of meeting maturities held by the Savings Banks of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales. A ll these banks hold matured securities which have not yet been met, and are pressing for some arrangement regarding them. The matter is under negotiation between - the Commonwealth Treasury and the Commonwealth Bank, and it is probable that a call may be made on the National Debt Commission to make funds available for this purpose. - touches on the point raised by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Parkhill) regarding £1,000,000 worth of - securities held by the Government Savings Bank of New Soutb Wales, which matured on the 10th August. In my opinion, it would be unwise and unjustifiable for either the National Debt Commission, the Commonwealth Treasury, or the Commonwealth Bank to discriminate between the various State savings banks in any allotment of moneys to meet matured securities. Honourable members will see that the commission has allotted just about the maximum available for the relief of cases of hardship. If it is found that more than £2,000,000 can be allotted from accrued sinking funds this year, then a greater allocation will be made, but bow much more will be available cannot be stated yet. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Clause 4 (Certain existing securities deemed to have been converted into new Kr. GABB (Angas) [10.15] - This is the provision against which many honourable members have protested, but upon which they had not the courage to register a vote. In effect, the clause informs dissentient bondholders that their "" no "" means ""yes"". In common with other honourable members, I have received a number of communications on the subject, which disclose how severely the proposal will affect many bondholders. Today, in very brave v/ords, the Prime Minister declared that the Government had saved Australia from insolvency. Why, then, should it be guilty of this dishonourable conduct to its bondholders? I know of the case of an old man of 81 who has South Australian stock to the value of £200 which matures ou the l l t h August next. I do hope that his case will be regarded as a necessitous one. Strangely enough, the honourable member  he is satisfied with the assurance of the Government in this matter. I am not satisfied. I am not unmindful that there This is an election in prospect. I wonder to myself whether the £2,000,000 that is to be provided from the sinking fund to redeem stock held by necessitous bondholders is merely a vote-catching device. What is going to happen the following year, when there will be no election? I am particularly apprehensive on that score. I received the following letter from a person whose bonds fall, due in 1933 :I write yon in reference to £400 I have in Commonwealth bonds maturing on the 1.5th February, 1933. I am a dissenter to the conversion of my loan for the reason that I shall require the money, when it becomes due, to live on. I wish to point out that the wife and myself are unable to work for onr living. The letter states that the writer is 74 years of age, and continuesI am suffering witli heart disease, and am unable to do auy work. In our young days we worked hard and lived hard, and denied ourselves the comforts that we should have had. By our thrift we managed to save a little money for our old days. .Now, it seems, we are to be done out of the use of our money. It is the hardest and most callous thing that oould possibly be done to a poor old couple; to make paupers of tbem in their old days. That man asks me to do what I can. I shall send him a copy of the Treasurer's speech. In spite of the promises of the Government, I am asked to say to that old man, "" It does not matter what you want or think. Your ' n o ' in this in stance means ' y e s ' "" . That I am not prepared to do. I know the country that this man lives in ; it would try out anybody. Will the fact that the person is ou a farm that cannot maintain him prevent him fro m obtaining money as a necessitous case?",72
374,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,No .,74
375,Mr G ABB,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"That cases the hardship. However, I cannot acquiesce in the proposal of the Government. I have a number of letters written in a strain similar to that of the one that I have read. I realise the need of those people, and I ' cannot bring myself to vote for this provision. I regret that lionorable members who have protested against the clause have not the courage to join with me in calling for a division upon it . Clause agreed to. Motion (by Mr THEODORE) posedThat the following new clause be inserted:5 - (I.) The National Debt Commission, if it thinks fit, may purchase uew securities at a price in excess of the market price, not being above par, with a view to preventing undue hardship, arising out of conversion under the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Act 1931 or this act, to persons beneficially interested in the securities. (2.) This section shall not be construed as limiting in any way the powers of the National Debt Commission under the National Debt Sinking Pund Act 1923-1030.",74
376,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"Swan} [10.25] - All along I have felt that it is f u t i l e to endeavour to resist the Government's proposals, but I do think that any money that is available fro m the sinking f u n d sbould be used to pay necessitous bondholders.",74
377,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,That is the intention.,74
378,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"In his speech today the Treasurer said that certain moneyswould be required to buy stock that wasoffering on the market below par. At a time like this we cannot, for our honour's sake, afford to go on the market and buy bonds at £82 and £84. We should first pay these people with the money that is available. I should like a definite in struction issued to the National Debt Commission in the matter.",74
379,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,It would be very undesirable to interfere with the free and unfettered judgment of the National Debt Commission. It might be taken as further interference with our loan contracts. 7,74
380,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"We are already breaking contracts. I know that that cannot be helped, and I do not wish to reflect on the Government. I urge that, if possible, the National Debt Commission should be compelled not to go on the market at this juncture.",74
381,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"This provision enables the Commission to purchase securities at a price in excess of the market price, so that the securities of those who are in necessitous circumstances may be taken over at full face value.",74
382,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"I should like the new clause to make it imperative that whatever money is available from the sinking f u n d shall be devoted to repaying bondholders who are in necessitous circumstances. pro- Mr CROUCH (Corangamite) [10.29]. - The bonds to be purchased by the Commission are to be not above par. but may be above the market price. Am I to assume that it is the intention of the Government thai the National Debt Commission shall make a profit out of those bondholder? who are in necessitous circumstances? 1 sbould like the Treasurer to influence the National Debt Commission to repay bondholders who are in necessitous circumstances. In 1893, when our banks were being reconstructed, there was a provision that all depositors with accounts up to £50 or £100 should be repaid. At the time. I was a young solicitor, and had £53 in the National Bank. It was repaid to me within a fortnight, which saved me fro m serious embarrassment. I ask the Treasurer for .an assurance that the National Debt Commission 'will not make any profit out of distressed bondholders by buying in their stocks at less than the amount they invested, plus interest.",74
383,Mr THEODOEE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"Dalley-Treasurer ) .[10.31] - The intention is to repurchase the bonds at full face value from tbose who require their money for their own maintenance, or to meet definite and immediate obligations, the withholding of which would impose a hardship upon them. The National Debt Commission was faced with the difficulty that under the act which governs its - proceedings a definite obligation was placed upon it to employ all its funds to the best advantage of the national debt-normall y to buy at market price, except in respect of matured bonds, which can be redeemed at full face value. The bonds uncler consideration are not redeemable in that sense, and must be purchased. The commission represented that unless it were given statutory authority it would be committing a breach of trust if it applied its funds to the purchase of bonds at a higher price than that ruling in the open market. Tbat is why Parliament is being asked to give to the commission power to use its funds for the purchase of bonds at their face value. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), suggested that the relief to be afforded by the National Debt Commission to bondholders should not be limited to £2,000,000, but that, in addition, funds already allocated for the purchase of bonds on the market should be applied to the relief of ship. The honourable member, therefore, proposed that the clause should be amended to give a mandatory instruction to the commission. The commission is set up under a specific statute, which gives a statutory undertaking to bondholders that the sinking fund will be managed in a certain way by an independent body. It would be unwise to interfere with that.",75
384,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,The course I suggest would not destroy the value of the bonds.,75
385,Mr THEODOEE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"The commission manages the sinking fund in respect loans, overseas as well as internal, we should be careful not to create any misapprehension amongst bondholders at home or abroad. I call attention to the personnel of the commission, nearly all the members of which hold office, ex officio-the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, a representative of the State Governments, wbo  of Victoria; the secretary to the Commonwealth . Treasury, the Solicitor General of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth Treasurer. The honourable member for Swau questioned the wisdom of ear-marking £100,000 a month for purchases ou the market. The commission realizes the extreme need"" to provide the maximum amount of funds for the relief of cases of hardship, aud, taking that fully into account, allotted this £100,000 a, month for market operations, but limited the allocation to three months, at the end of which the commission will meet again and further consider the matter. If it is thought then that further funds should be allotted, even to the exclusion of purchases on the market, I have no doubt that the commission will act accordingly.",75
386,Mr CEOUCH,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"Corangamite) [10.35]. - Nobod y can fail to respect the personnel of the National Debt Commission. As the Treasurer pointed out, the commission as a trustee for the nation has a fiduciary responsibility, and must acl in accordance with the law. It is in duty bound to buy at market rates. If a private trustee were to pay £95 for bonds that he could have purchased for £88 he would be held to have committed cases of bard- a breach of trust.",75
387,Mr THEODOBE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,And that would be the case with the commission.,75
388,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"That is so; therefore, it is necessary to give a mandate to the commission to buy bonds at. face value. The bill gives to the commission power to buy at a price in excess of the market rate, but not above par. Bonds can be bought in the market today for £S7; they may rise to £90. The obligation of the commission as trustee will be to consider how far this bill limits its obligations. The cases of hardship of all will absorb very much more than the and £2,000,000, which the commission will make available this year. If bonds are quoted in the market at £90, many people will be ready to sell their bonds for £91, and the commission will be compelled by its trust to buy at that price. The commission is a corporation and has to act legally. It cannot be influenced by sentiment. A corporation has been described as having neither a body to be saved nor a soul to be dammed. If I were the trustee of an estate, and my duty required me to buy bonds the cestui que trust could sue me personally, if I paid £100 for a bond which I could have bought for £91.  necessary authority.",75
389,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"The duty of a trustee is to do the best possible for the estate he is administering. If the market price for Commonwealth bonds is £90, the National Debt Commissioners, to avoid a possible charge of dereliction of trust, will be obliged to buy at £91, which, in the words of the bill, will be "" in excess market price",76
390,Mr GABB,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,Eo r whom are they the trustees?,76
391,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"They are trustees for the nation. I regret that the Attorney General is not present, because I should like to have his confirmation of my interpretation of the legal position. If the commission paid £100 for bonds at a time when the excess market price was ' £91, then, as trustees for the nation, they would be guilty of a breach of trust. I realise that it is useless for me to move an amendment, but I appeal to the Treasurer's sense of right in this matter, and suggest that he submit it to the law advisers of the Crown, and, if necessary, have the point reconsidered in another place. No distressed bondholder should receive less than par.",76
392,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"Dalley-Treasurer ) [10.45] - It is impossible for me to pretend to answer the legal point that has .been raised by the honourable member, but I wisli to assure the committee that it was very carefully considered by the National Debt Commission.",76
393,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,And by the Justice himself.,76
394,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"The Chief Justice, as a member of the commission, was particularly concerned to see that the commission was clothed with sufficient statutory authority to enable £2,000,000 to be allocated from the sinking fund to be administered for the relief of cases of hardship by enabling the sufferers to get. the full face value of their bonds.",76
395,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,Has the Chief Justiceaccepted this clause?,76
396,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH DEBT,"No ; but the Chief Justice was particularly concerned about the point which I have mentioned, and the National Debt Commission carried a resolution authorizing the use of £2,000,000 for this express purpose. As Treasurer, I discussed this matter with the National Debt Commission, which realized that the position would be met by inserting an amendment in the bill giving the commission the necessary authority. This amendment was drafted by the Solicitor-General, who is also a member of the commission. It was carefully considered by him, and discussed of the fully with his law officers. He has assured me that it does everything that is necessary. I must be satisfied with that advice.  - This clause simply gives the National Debt Commission authority to buy, at their face value, bonds for the relief of hardship case3. It would be unwise to insert in it any provision of a mandatory character, because, when the commission was appointed, it was clearly understood that it should be removed as far as possible from political control. If such an amendment as has been suggested were inserted, it would be mandatory upon the commission to do certain things which might be undesirable. I am glad we have had the assurance from the Treasurer that, if the necessity arises, and if the £2,000,000 which is being set aside for the purpose proves insufficient to adequately relieve hardship cases among both converters and dissenters, the commission may make an even larger sum available for the purchase of bonds at their full face value.

What is it in respect of government finance that makes it impossible to bring down 11 P . M . in 192S-29 the Supplementary Estimates for 1927-2S? It is a puzzle to me, and I should like an explanation from the Treasurer.",77
398,Mr THEODORE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"Dalley-Treasurer ) [10.52] - I am afraid that the Commonwealth Parliament has got into a rather bad habit of allowing Supplementary Estimates to accumulate for two or three years, and then to pass them without much consideration being given to them, but it must be borne in mind that the information contained in the Supplementary Estimates is always before honourable members prior to the introduction of the Supplementary Estimates, and that parliamentary authority is given by the appropriation in the Estimates in chief under the designation of Treasurer's advance. The details are £ .. 4,578 then set out in the subsequent Estimates. The actual amount expended 33,G30 is set out alongside the vote for the previous year, and it can be seen at n .. 56,478 glance whether the vote has been exceeded 14,908 and what call there has been on the Treasurer's advance.

399,Mr WHITE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"Balaclava) [10.54,] A discussion on the Estimates is an appropriate time to refer to civil avia294,748 tion, out as the hour is late, I shall be as brief as possible. I regret that 1 .. 318,567 cannot adjourn the debate, because air navigation is of the utmost importance. I refer to it under division 75, sub-division 4, miscellaneous-Civi l Aviation .. 2,667 .. 9.636 Branch. A i r navigation is a province of .. 1,562 the Civil Aviation Department and .. 1,634 the act is contained in one sheet of paper. It is the only legisla.. 15,489 tion dealing with air navigation in Aus.. 647,969 tralia. Section 4 statesThe Governor General may make regulations for the purpose of carrying out and giving effect to the convention and the provisionb of any amendment of the convention made under Article 34 thereof; and for the purpose of providing for the control of air navigation in the Commonwealth and the Territories. That provision ""was unsatisfactory, even in 1920, and aviation then had riot developed to the extent that it has now. Since 1920 great strides have taken place in aviation, particularly in the mileage and carrying capacity of aeroplanes. Civil aviation in Australia is controlled by departmental regulation, and it could hardly be expected that such a position would be entirely satisfactory. One honourable member today referred to Tha New Despotism, by Lord Hewart, which contains a description of the government of a country being carried out by departmental regulation. We have a similar position in Australia in which a whole province of aviation-the public side-is entirely controlled by regulation. The faul t is not with this Government, because it was found that the Commonwealth did not have power under the Constitution to legislate on aviation. The Royal Commission on the Constitution pertinently pointed out that the States should hand over to the Commonwealth their powers in relation to the control of aviation. That body made a definite recommendation which I shall read later. The following extract is taken from the Argus of yesterday:The managing director of West Australian Airways Limited (Major Brearley) said today that the eontrol of aviation was exercising the minds of those actively engaged in the advancement of air transport. Western Australia had not transferred to the Federal Government the powers desired by the Commonwealth to enable it to enforce laws relating to air transport, and it was evident that no proper authority existed hero to exercise that control. There had recently been cases in which machines outside the control of his company had been flown in a condition which involved very serious risk to the lives of the occupants, while the lives of those in other 'planes in the same locality had been jeopardized. So serious had the position become that his company had decided to give the Commonwealth an opportunity to test the position on ,: safe"" technical breaches of the regulations which lie had committed. I do not know how Major Brearley - intends to test the position, but the fact remains that the regulations air transport arc not satisfactory. Recently, the Air Accidents Investigation Committee, which was established under departmental regulation, into the crash at Temora of the Love Bird, a commercial air plane, and it came to a certain finding. I asked a question Mr White. in this chamber regarding that finding, with a view to having the inquiry reopened, so that other accidents might be investigated.",77
400,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER, Will the honourable member indicate in what way he.is connecting his remarks with the Supplementary Estimates?,78
401,Mr WHITE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"I am speaking in relation to division 75, sub-division 4, miscellaneous-Civi l Aviation Branch. The TEMPORARY"" CHAIRMAN That item is contained in Supplementary Estimates for 1927-28. The honourable member must, therefore, confine his remarks to that year.",78
402,Mr WHITE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"If I cannot discuss air accidents, I shall refer to the subject on another occasion. I wish now to call attention to the manner in which the Air Accidents Investigation Committee conducts its inquiries. The committee consists of three officials of the department, who do not sit in open court. It should sit in open court like the Marine Court, which is a court of record. It is high time that the Minister, and, in fact, the Cabinet instituted a thorough investigation into air accidents. This committee inquires into all cases of injury to aircraft passengers, forced landings, incompetence of personnel, and so on; but it is composed purely of departmental officers who, while desiring to do their work well and conscientiously, are in an invidious position, as only their finding and not the evidence is disclosed to the public. Such finding may be at variance with that of a coroner, as has happened, and is therefore not acceptable to the parties concerned or the relatives of the deceased. I therefore suggest that the Government should replace that committee by a body constituted on the lines of a marine court, on which a magistrate and other skilled persons would sit. [Quorum formed.] I point out that the Commonwealth Parliament has no express power governing under the Constitution to make laws in respect of aviation, although it has some power in this direction under its trade and purely commerce powers. It was only because the inquired Commonwealth was a party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation that it was able to pass the A i r Navigation Act, the onepage statute to which I have referred. The Royal Commission on the Constitution made the following specific recommendation in regard to aviation :We recommend that a power to make laws Part III - Territories with respect to aviation he conferred on the North Australia . . Commonwealth Parliament. All the expert witnesses on this subject who Central appeared before the commission were agreed Federal Capital Territory . . that the Commonwealth should have this power, and, as is shown elsewhere in this report, the State Premiers at one time passed a resolution that it was desirable that the power to make laws with respect to aviation, with certain reservations, should be transferred by the States to the Commonwealth. Effect could, we think, be given to recommendation by inserting in ""section of the Constitution the following paragraph:(viZi) Air navigation and aircraft. In all the circumstances, I ask the Government first to review the regulations under which the A i r Accidents Investigaciated tion Committee .was appointed, with object of appointing a court; secondly, to take steps to give effect to the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Constitution, so that an adequate statute may he framed; and, thirdly, to call a conference of those interested military, commercial, and amateur aviation with the object of ensuring greater safety for passengers, and thus encouraging the advancement of aviation in Australia.

In between those two items, is the proposed vote of £1,000 to Mr . in Brown. This is the first time that we have heard of this particular expenditure. The total of those three items is £3,221. I wish to know whether Mr Brown was interested in ouly the £1,000, or in the other two amounts as well.",79
404,Mr THEODORE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"Does the honourable member realise that the carrying of his granted amendment would amount to a vote of the censure on this Government for something done by a previous administration? It would mean that this Administration would be put out of office, and the previous Administration, which expended the £ money to which his motion refers, would . . 1,362 be put back into office. 10,695 Mr ELDRIDGE - I am taking the only means available to me to voice a pro11,288 test against this expenditure. We had no opportunity of making a protest against 4,571 it in 1928-29. Although we are now vir.. 2,375 tually at the end of a session, we have been bombarded with a volume containing the Supplementary Estimates for 12,612 three financial years, involving an ex862 penditure of £1,682,953 which was never authorized. The Temporary Chairman . . 5,613 (Mr Keane) is evidently desirous of rush. . 85,010 ing these items through the committee, for . . 61,470 he is keeping his eye on the clock. We . . 232,060 should do the work that we were elected to do, and not pretend to do it. I remind the committee that the officer in respect of whom this expenditure was involved is one whose maladministration has been the subject of strong protests by me on several occasions. "" This gentleman occupied a subordinate position in London * four or five years ago, but he was brought to this country, and immediately given a position at the princely salary of £50 a week.  bigger salary elsewhere.",79
405,Mr ELDRIDGE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"If that were so, he would have rushed away long ago. Soon after he began work here at the salary of £50 a week, he was given an increase of £30 a week, bringing his salary up to £80 a week.",80
406,Mr BERNARD COBSEB,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,He was offered a higher salary when abroad.,80
407,Mr ELDRIDGE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"If that were so, he could not get a steamer quickly enough to take him to it.  ber is unfair.",80
408,Mr ELDRIDGE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"I am not. This man is a real "" go-getter "". In 1928 the administration of the telegraph branch of the Postal Department, by this oflicer resulted in a loss of £312,075. In the following year the loss was £22S,134, a total of £540,209 for the two years. His administration of the telephone branch in those two years resulted in losses of £322,438 and £247,211 respectively, a total loss of £569,649 for that branch. Taking the two branches mentioned, we find that the losses in those two years amounted to over £1,000,000. Before his appointment the telegraph branch showed a small profit each year, but under his administration enormous losses have been incurred in both that branch and the telephone branch. This gentleman was sent abroad; but no one appears to know what he did during his absence from Australia. I have endeavoured to elicit information from the Postmaster-General on the subject, only to be told that the work upon which Mr Brown was engaged was of such a nature that his reports could not be divulged, even to members of this House. Even wben I asked questions regarding contracts of a suspicious nature, no information' was given me, because it was again alleged that secrecy must be maintained. This highly-paid official, after having been sent on a trip to Britain and the United States of. America, was paid £1,000 in addition to his salary. That was done behind the back of Parliament.",80
409,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"""Why has the honourable member such a grudge against this officer?",80
410,Mr ELDRIDGE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"I have no grudge against-him as an individual; but I feel that I am doing my duty in ventilating these matters. This afternoon references were made to robbery of various kinds: we heard some plausible remarks about political rectitude, and the sanctity of contracts. Surely this committee has a duty in connection with the expenditure of public money? In order to elicit information I desire, I now ask the Postmaster-General the following questions:(1) Is it a fact that the Imperial ""Wireless and Cable Conference of 192S presented a report of 26 printed pages which was laid on the table of the British Parliament in July, 1928? (2) Is it a fact that that report was printed by the British Government, and made available for public distribution? (3) Is this the report referred to by the Postmaster General in his reply to a question by me on 23rd July, 1931 (Hansard, page 2490) ? (4) If so, why does the Postmaster-General refer to that report as "" the secret report of the conference""? (5) Why was that report not laid on the table of the Australian Parliament? (6) Will the Minister now make that report available? (7) Did the Director of Postal Services, Mr H . P. Brown, who attended the conference referred to, concur in the recommendation for the handing over of the cable and wireless services of the Empire, including those owned by the British Government, to one new eompany apart from the British Postal Department? (8) If so, why did Mr Brown, after agreeing to the dissociation of the combined wireless and cable services from government control, so far as Britain was concerned, urge that such control, so far as Australia is concerned, should be vested in the Postal Department, of which he is secretary? (9) Will the Minister state plainly whether Mr. Brown made any report on his return to Australia from this conference? (10) If so, why has not such report been presented to Parliament? In the early life of this Parliament I obtained information that, since the appointment of this officer, contracts amounting to over £5,000,000 had been let overseas for goods the bulk of wbicb could have been made in Australia. Only this week the Minister admitted that since this Government has been in office Postal Department orders had been placed overseas for materials and supplies to the value of approximately £49,000, notwithstanding that they could have been manufactured in Australia, and that thousands of our people are workless aud in poverty. The Minister's reply to my question was most unsatisfactory: he gave no explanation whatever. The main reason given by this Government for placing orders overseas, is the high cost of the locally-produced articles. But in proof of this no information is given regarding the items. In fairness to the country, full information on these matters should be supplied to Parliament, t voice my protest against the highly unsatisfactory and. questionable administration of this official. Members are entitled to object when they find that for all they know £3,221 has been squandered, and no explanation given. should like to know why, in addition to being paid a high salary, this officer was granted an honorarium of £1,000 for work which after all was only part of his duties for which he received a princely salary.",80

No one will deny that Mr Brown is in receipt of a princely salary. I confess that I was astonished when I found that he receives about £80 a week. As in the case of other officers, his salary has doubtless been reduced under the Financial Emergency Act; nevertheless, we are entitled to refer to the salary set down for him in the Estimates. I feel sure that it will be interesting reading to the employees in the Postal Department that",81
415,Mr THEODOBE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,What will be interesting reading to them?,81
416,Mr BEASLEY,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"They will be interested to know that, in addition to hi3 high salary, Mr Brown was paid an honorarium of £1,000.",81
417,Mr THEODORE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,That information has been published in the Estimates and has been available to honourable members for over two years.,81
418,Mr BEASLEY,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,The information was probably available to the Treasurer; but that does not necessarily mean that it was available even to the other members of the Government.,81

420,Mr BEASLEY,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"Tba t is deliberately untrue. The Treasurer knows as well as any one that such is not the case. If the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lyons) here to-night, he could, if be desired, support the point I am making with respect to Mr Brown. He was one of the first officers whom I had the opportunity of putting to the test and I did so some in a room in this building, usually occupied by the Postmaster-General. Having been informed of different matters concerning certain negotiations in ' connection with wireless shortly after the Labour Government was formed, I was keen to get to grips with this particular official.",81
421,Mr CROUCH,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,Wit h what result?,81
422,Mr BEASLEY,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"Wit h the results that have been brought under our notice a ever since by the honourable member for He has Martin (Mr Eldridge). It' appears that this gentleman is capable of is exercising some extraordinary influence over Ministers controlling the Postal Department. They always seem to be in such a frame of mind that they adopt, without question or criticism, whatever proposals he places before them. There is no doubt that today certain members of the Government, including the Assistant Minister (Mr. Cunningham), who was one of the strongest critics in the party of his administration, could express their views in terms similar to those used by the honourable member for Martin on. the administration of this officer, if they had investigate the matter. the courage to do so. There are half a dozen otlier honourable members representing country electorates who would condemn in the strongest possible terms the ruthless way in which postal services in country districts have been restricted under his direction. It is also true that notwithstanding the high salary which he receives, the department which he has administered has showed a substantial loss during recent years. The figures quoted by the honourable member for Martin show that he has been a colossal failure. The Government cannot thrust' this matter aside, and sooner or later, we shall reach a stage, particularly with respect to the letting contracts, when the public will demand an explanation of what is going on. Such an agitation will be set up that the Government will be forced to review the position. The circumstances which at up. present exist can no longer be tolerated. It will be very interesting to certain members of the Public Service, particularly those engaged in the Postal Department, who have been seriously affected by the legislation recently passed by the vernment, to learn that this officer is ceiving such a princely salary. remuneration which be recei'ves is of partion ticular interest when it is remembered that the other day I had to approach the Postmaster-General on behalf of 30 returned soldier cleaners, who were to be dismissed from the Sydney General Post Office. It will also be of interest to them to know that notwithstanding the high salary which receives he has also been granted an honorarium of £1,000 in connection with certain services which he is alleged to have rendered to the Government. It is Mr Rcasley. true that the Postmaster-General said that he will do all he can to retain the services of the cleaners to whom I have just referred. The Minister doubtless realizes that he is confronted with an extraordinary handicap when it is pointed out that the department over which this highly paid officer presides is showing, such a tremendous loss. The position should not be tolerated any longer. Instead of brushing aside the questions submitted by the honourable member for Martin, the Government should fully The honor bill) said that the honourable member for Martin has an obsession in this matter.",81
423,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,So he has.,82
424,Mr BEASLEY,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"He has devoted special attention to the subject, and has been able to obtain information which should have been placed before honourable members",82
425,Mr ARCHDALE PAKKHILL,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,Supplie d by Voigt.,82
426,Mr BEASLEY,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"No . The Government will be compelled to give some attention to this matter sooner or later, because, in view of the facts placed before the committee by the honourable member of for Martin, it has reached the stage when the public will demand an investigation. I should like the Treasurer to explain how the item of £9,723 on page 90 for the British Economic Mission is made",82
427,Mr THEODORE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,I would be out of order in speaking on that item until the amendment now before the committee has been disposed of.,82
428,Mr BEASLEY,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"I support the Go- amendment moved by the honourable memreber for Martin, because I believe it will The have the effect of focussing public attenon the administration of this official. It will. also give the Postmaster-General an opportunity to explain the circumstances surrounding the letting of certain contracts. Mr A GREEN ' (Kalgoorlie- Postmaster-General) [11.26] - We have had the usual diatribe from the honourable this officer member for Martin.",82
429,Mr ELDBIDGE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"I rise to a point of order. My remarks cannot truthfully be referred to as diatribe. As the expression used by the Postmaster-General is not only unparliamentary, but is offensive to me, I ask that it be withdrawn. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Mr Keane) - I ask the Postmaster General to withdraw the remark to which exception has been taken.",82
430,Mr A GREEN,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"If the honourable member objects to the expression I used, t shall later substitute another term may be more fitting. I do not question the right of any honourable member to express an opinion concerning the administration of any public officer; but any unbiased honourable member will admit that for months past the honourable member for Martin has directed most of the criticism in which he has indulged in this House to the Director of # Postal Services, and has insinuated that there is something wrong with the contracts into which the Postmaster-General's Department, of which Mr Brown is the principal administrative officer, has entered. There is not a scintilla of truth in the honourable member's remarks, which would be regarded as grossly unfair by any public servant. It is not my intention to explain the circumstances under which an honorarium of £1,000 was paid to M'.r. Brown, as that was the act of a previous administration. The action of the honourable member who has repeatedly hurled questions at me, and cluttered up the notice-paper with similar questions, has not resulted in any service to the country. These questions bave beeu submitted at the behest of some obscure person. I am not a hero worshipper, but I have had sufficient experience to recognize a man's ability and to form an opinion as .to his honesty. For the honourable member to insinuate that the contracts let by the department, of which Mr Brown is the responsible officer, were in any way suspicious, is improper in the higbest degree. His insinuation savours more of cowardice than of anything else, because the gentleman against whom he makes the charge is not able to defend himself Mr ET.DRT.DQE - Hones t lago!",83
431,Mr A GREEN,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"I return the-compliment to the honourable member. There is no one to whom I could more appropriately apply that character than to the lionorable member. No unbiased person could possibly lay a charge agaiust 141 1 Mr Brown. The honourable member has for several months been trying to make a name for himself by pillorying public servants, and I denounce him for his cowardice. I am defending an officer who has rendered great service to this country. Reference has been made to the losses experienced in the telephone and telegraph which branches of the Postal Department. It is true that, in.common with all other business concerns, whether public or private, those branches of the service bave not paid directly, but, taking the Postal and Telegraph Department in its entirety, it has proved a good business proposition for Australia. Considering the sparse populatiou of Australia, compared with other countries, the telephonic, telegraphic, and postal services provided are relatively cheap. Telephonic and mail services are not expected to pay, the main object being to make life in the back countiy more tolerable than it would be without those services, and to give rural settlers means of communication with their fellow citizens in the more thickly populated areas. In some districts, the department gives services worth, say, £2,000 for a return of a few hundred pounds. The honourable member for Martin (Mr Eldridge) has made a great deal of the expenditure, during the present Government's term of office, of £49,000 on material of overseas manufacture which could have been made in Australia. In a department which spends over £12,000,000 a year, a paltry £49,000 is of small importance. As a matter of fact, it can be shown that the expenditure to which the honourable member has referred was justified. He made a considerable fuss about the purchase abroad of the material for two broadcasting stations. I think that the department was quite justified in placing the orders abroad, because the local tender was £56,000 for material which could be purchased overseas for £30,000. For substation protectors, the Australian tender was 25 per cent, liigher, or £2,271 over and above the duty on a job costing less than £4,000; and for porous pots, 85 per cent., or £1,276 liigher than the price paid. The honourable member did not mention that since the present Government has been in power it has reduced the proportion of material purchased abroad from 40 per cent, to 32 per cent.",83
432,Mr ELDRIDGE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,I quoted better figures than those.,84
433,Mr A GREEN,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"Tim e after time, the honourable member brings in this K in g Charles' head, but he has failed to substantiate his charges. He has attempted, by innuendo, to cast suspicion upon a most estimable mau, and one of the leading public servants of Australia. It is an entirely unworthy act, which I keenly resent.

Green) has indicated that his department desires to serve the public in country districts, even though the services provided may result in monetary loss. What about the tain portion of the cost.

434,Mr JAMES,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"Hunter) [11.36] - Judg ing by the Minister's reply to the honorfacilities able member for M a r t in (Mr Eldridge), one would imagine that the Director of Posts and Telegraphs had accomplished much; but the postal services have never been in a more deplorable condition than mittee divided. at the present time. Throughout Austi'alia, post offices have been closed. my electorate, at one time, they were being shut up at the rate of about four a week. When applications are made for telephone facilities for a town, the residents are required to guarantee a certain revenue, and if it is not forthcoming, they are obliged to make up the shortage.

Better facilities could have been made available than bave been provided by the administration since the present Government has been in power. It does not appear as though the department is desirous of catering for the needs of the people or of encouraging the flow of revenue to the Treasury. Although all postal matter is stamped with the injunction , "" Do it by 'phone"", in numerous cases persons who have made application for telephonic installations have been advised that this facility cannot be made available to them, unless they defray a cerI have urged the extension of many postal' facilities, but have never been able to satisfaction.

435,Mr WHITE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"Balaclava) [11.48] TJnder Division 79-Civi l Aviation Branch, Department of Defence-ther e appears the item "" Subsidy of aerial ambulance service, Queensland, £ 1 "" . That, in my opinion, is somewhat ironic. In the previous two years, a subsidy was granted to the Australian Inland Mission, which has performed a service of incalculable value in Queensland. base is at Cloncurry, and it subsidizes the Queensland and Northen Territory Aerial Service to transport a medical man to places where his services may be needed in cases of sickness. The Queensland Government has paid the mission a small subsidy and the balance of the money which it has needed has been subscribed privately, largely by the H . V . MCKay bequest. The contribution of the Commonwealth Government was very small, compared with the value of the service that was rendered by the mission; yet, for some reason that has not been disclosed, and that has not been satisfactorily explained, so far as I have £ .. 3,921 heard, no amount appeared on the Estimates this year for this purpose. 5,635 The board of the mission asked me if I would invitea delegation to meet the 8,530 Ministers concerned, and a deputation .. 8,656 waited on' the Ministers for Defence and Home Affairs and the Postmaster.. 7,459 General to ascertain whether, perhaps, £200 could be made available from the 5,546 contingency vote of each of those three 1,840 departments. The deputation received a 1,410 courteous reception, and was given a good hearing, but was informed that no amount 9,556 could be made available this year. The 301,181 .. 218,469 opinion was expressed, however, that next year something in the direction desired .. 017,325 might be possible. I think that some reply should be made as to why the money has not been provided. A definite service is being supplied from the 18,282 Home Affairs stand-point. I quote the following paragraph from a letter received .. 36,483 from one of the police stations in the 54,765 Far North. It is as follows:Situated as I am here on the junction of two great stock routes, along which every .. 376 yoar come many thousands of travelling cattle 74,181 with their attendant droving plants, I am in a position to receive many sick and injured .. 74,557 people in the year, and do so receive them. Most are received and treated by me successTotal .. 746,647 fully, but nobody hears of them. At times, however, comes a case with which I cannot cope, and it is then that the Flying Medical Service takes from my shoulders the responsibility sueh as it is in my opinion distinctly wrong for any layman to be called upon to bear. The Minister knows that the flying doctor recently visited Mornings ton Island, and dealt with an epidemic amongst the natives there which might have cost the Government Its many thousands of pounds. The service is a definite asset also to the Postal Department. The mission has issued wireless sets to stations within a radius of 4.00 miles of Cloncurry. I have a list of twenty stations which take telegrams from the cattle stations round about, and transmit them to the department. It is not necessary to dilate on the advantages of the service from a defence point of view. It ensures that a trained pilot is in commission, it serves to make the people airminded, and induces them to look upon the humanitarian side of aviation. It is no exaggeration to say that this service has saved each year as many lives as are lost in aviation, and yet the Government cannot find a paltry £600 for its support. Yet in the same Estimates the Government enters into a contract with a private company-!-Wes t Australian Airways Limited-in nexion with some advertising work, and arranged to pay it £3,000. The Government did not go on with the contract, but it has paid the company £657 l is . 9d. I asked a question recently whether a payment had been made to the West Australian Airways Limited by way of compensation, and was given the following reply:- No payment has been made to West Austhe tralian Airways by .way of compensation. may say, however, for the honourable ber's information, that the sum of £G57 Us. 9d. was paid to West Australian Airways Limited, in full and final settlement of a claim for reimbursement of expenditure incurred by the company in connection with a special mail publicity campaign for the Kast-West service. This campaign was proved by Cabinet as a joint effort by the Commonwealth and the company to attract u greater volume of air mail traffic to this service, and consequent benefit to Commonwealth in surcharge air mail postage, lie incurred by Commonwealth and company on a £1 for f i basis. Subsequently, however, and before the Commonwealth had incurred any expenditure, the matter was reviewed in the light of the adverse financial situation, and the arrangements cancelled by the Commonwealth. The suspension of the campaign its early stages deprived the company of any financial benefit from it , and ing various factors, Cabinet approved of the refund to the company of all expenditure incurred which was deemed to be a reasonable charge against the publicity scheme. This excellent medical service has been assisted by government funds in the past. It is undenominational in its work, deserves assistance now, yet of the Supplementary Estimates it appears that the sum of £1 is being granted as a subsidy.",85

437,Mr WHITE,OPPOSED BUSINESSAFTER,"Yes ; but the service received no subsidy this year.

Had this matter been brought before the attention of the Minister at the proper time, I believe that he would have granted the request.
