1,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,Unknown,"As the House has recently been sitting any. number of hours, from twelve upwards, and the Prime Minister has expressed the determination to make us sit still longer, I ask him whether we may take it for granted that the Government and the Labour party have abandoned their belief in the eight hours principle, Mir. FISHER - The Government has not abandoned its belief in the eight hours principle for others, but Ministers are prepared to sacrifice themselves when necessary in the interest of the country. SEARC H FOR DERELICT .",13
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It is stated in the newspapers that the trawler Endeavour has returned to Port Adelaide after an unsuccessful search for the reported derelict, and that the Minister has not given in structions for sending her out again, although the derelict has again been reported within the last few days, and is a great menace to shipping. I ask the Minister if he will reconsider the matter, and give instructions for a second search.",13
3,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Endeavour made an exhaustive search over r,7oo square miles, according to the best system that could be followed, and it is reported to me that there is no chance of seeing the derelict unless one is within half-a - mile of it.",13
4,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Othe r ships have seen It.,13
5,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Not one of every forty ships that have passed it has seen it . it is so great a menace to shipping, it strange that some of the vessels which have sighted it have not towed it in.",13
6,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the Minister not regard it as a matter of importance that the derelict should be removed from its present position? Do I take him to sugwhat gest that the only persons interested in removal are the shipping companies? it not a fact that the lives of the passengers carried by their vessels are of importance?,13
7,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The fact that I sent out the trawler is a reply to the honourable igu. member's sneer.,13
8,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Has the duty of searching for derelicts now devolved on the at 10.30 Commonwealth Government, and, if so, whose duty was it prior to Federation ?",13
9,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The duty has not devolved on this Government, but as the derelict in question is considered a menace to life and property, I , after consultation with the Cabinet, sent out the trawler Endeavour to search for it . Were there any likelihood of finding the derelict, I should not have the slightest hesitation about sending the trawler out again. Some of the States which are complaining should be able to do something to assist in the search.",13
10,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"When the derelict was first reported, I asked the Minister of Trade and Customs if he did not consider it advisable to offer a reward for its discovery. I ask him now, whether if that had been done the derelict would not have been found ?",13
11,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not think it would.,13
12,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Is it not a fact that the derelict was sighted again the other day, and its latitude and longitude correctly ascertained, and is it not possible, by comparing these data with the first position given, to ascertain its drift , and to search for it with some prospect of success ?",13
13,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I can show the right honourable member a chart on which is marked the position of the derelict when first seen, and the second position in which she was noted. The third position now given shows that she has apparently driftP'-t back almost to the place at which she was when first reported. NA LABOUR COUNCIL.",13
14,Mr RYRIE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"It is stated in this morning's Age that at a meeting of the Port Melbourne branch of the Political Labour If Council, held last Saturday,.it was unaniis mously resolved that the conference of the Political Labour Council be asked to pass a resolution requiring the Parliamentary Labour party to consult the central executive whenever an interpretation of policy was necessary. I ask the Prime Minister answer he will make when that resoluits tion has been passed and conveyed to him ? Is Mr FISHER - I have neither seen nor heard of the report, nor shall I hear of it officially. If the honourable and gallant member wishes to know how I would treat such a resolution if it were presented to me, let me say that I would treat it as I would treat a similar .application from him.",13
15,Mr RYEIE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I do not know now how the Prime Minister would treat it. PUBLIC WORKS.,14
16,Mr FULLER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I understand that the Minister of Home Affairs proposes to have works carried out by the Commonwealth, instead of by the State officials who have hitherto supervised them. In what States does he propose to establish the new system? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Onl y in New South Wales and Victoria.",14
17,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Will all Commonwealth works undertaken in these States be supervised by Commonwealth officers, or in outlying districts will inspections be undertaken by State officials co-operating with Commonwealth officials? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Where possible we shall use the State officials if that should be necessary. COMMONWEALTH BANK.",14
18,Mr THOMSON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has l>een called to a Melbourne telegram in Monday's issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph which refers to the position of the Commonwealth Bank in regard to private institutions, and concludes in these termsAs the Commonwealth Bank cannot be taxed by the State or municipality, it should deduct from its earnings the sums it would have to pay to taxpayers if it was a private institution. The Prime Minister says that he does not think much of the suggestion. "" We have not provided for any such thing in the Bill , "" he said, ""but he was rather surprised that the Opposition did not make the point. The only comment I need give is that the Commonwealth Bank will be the people's bank."" Does not the right honourable member recollect that during a speech which the honourable member for Darling Downs delivered on 24th November, he made reference 'to this matter?",14
19,Mr SPEAKER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Is the honourable member asking a question ?,14
20,Mr THOMSON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I am, sir. Does the Prime Minister recollect that during that speech the honourable member for Darling Downs stated that the matter of the bank having to pay taxes and the unfair competition had been thought out? he correctly reported as having stated thai the Opposition had never raised the point ?",14
21,Mr FISHER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I absolve the Opposition from all blame in the matter. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE.,14
22,Mr SPEAKER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I would point out to the House that if questions of this nature are permitted, there will be no finality to them. I ask honourable members generally to put their questions in a more direct manner.",14
23,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"On a point of order, sir, may I ask what chance Oppositionists will have of correcting statements of alleged fact made by Ministers of the Crown in regard to our procedure in the House, unless we can produce public records to show that we have taken the steps which we are accused of not having taken ? Mr SPEAKER^-Order ! I would point out to the House generally, and it will apply to the honourable member's question, that if I were to enforce strictly the rules of parliamentary procedure many ot the questions which are asked would be ruled out of order. For instance, honourable members have no right to found questions on paragraphs in the press. The honourable member has asked me to state what opportunities honourable members would have to correct any statements which might be made. I would point out that if an honourable member is affected, he can take the proper course of making a personal explanation, which gets over the whole difficulty. It appears to me that a bad practice is growing up. A question is asked without notice, and a reply is given, and then a number of questions are founded on the reply. So far as I have been able to gather from reading and the records of the Parliaments with which I have been connected, I have never known so many questions to be asked without notice, nor have I found a record in any Parliament of so many questions being asked without notice, as are asked in this Parliament. I must confine honourable members to asking questions in a legitimate way.",14
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I rise to a point of order, sir. I hope that this statement is not intended as an intimation that you propose to curtail the rights and privileges of honourable members so long as they are in order. I take it that an honourable member may ask as many questions as he chooses for as many hours as he pleases; And is that it is' for the Ministers themselves to say whether they will answer them or not; and that your function in the chair ceases when you see that they are in order. have yet to learn that we may not ask questions concerning current events.",14
25,Mr SPEAKER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member for Parramatta only entered the chamber when I was finishing my remarks, and therefore he could not have heard all that I said; otherwise, I do not think that he would have raised this point of order. Every honourable member will have the fullest possible latitude to ask any question which he may desire. It is not my intention to curtail the right of asking questions in the slightest degree, but it is a function of my office to see that the privilege is not abused. In such circumstances I must intervene.",15
26,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Following up your ruling, sir, I wish to refer to a matter by way of personal explanation. morning's Age, I am quoted as having stated, in the course of the speech of the honornhle member for Bendigo yesterday, "" Will the honourable member be able to show us what dividends were paid by the companies that imported the articles?"" I did not say that, but the contrary. I asked the honourable member whether he was in a position to show us what dividends were paid by companies manufacturing in Australia under the protection of existing duties where the imports had been increased.",15
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,That is right.,15
28,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"That is my explanation, sir. Shall I be in order in asking a question ?",15
29,Mr SPEAKER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Order !,15
30,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I shall resume my seat, sir, and ask a question later. Later",15
31,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"W it h a view to facilitating public business, I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether, during the consideration of the Tariff, he will be in a position to inform honourable members of the actual profits now derived by companies which are operating under the duties recently repealed, and, further, what conditions of labour have applied in connection with the industries for which further duties are asked?",15
32,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I shall be pleased to give the House all the information that I have. I have not the dividend list showing the profits that have been made by any companies in Australia which are manufacturing here or importing. [152] I NORTHERN TERRITORY : RAILWAY.,15
33,Mr GORDON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"the Attorney General, upon notice I. Has he, as stated elsewhere, "" informally expressed the opinion"" that under the Northern Territory Acceptance Act the Commonwealth Government can deviate the proposed Transcontinental Railway into Queensland ? 2. Has he read the opinions on this subject given by Mr E. F. Mitchell, KC., Melbourne, and the Crown Solicitor of South Australia, together with a concurring statement made by Senator Sir J. H . Symon, KC. (Hansard, 17th August, rgio, page 1591); and will he inform the House whether, in his opinion, the proposed railway line can be constructed outside the boundaries of the Northern Territory, now the property of the Commonwealth?",15

35,Mr WEBSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the tentative arrangement of staff hours in the Sydney Telegraph Branch has been re-arranged? 2. Is it a fact that since the re-arranged arrangement officers have had to work for twelve and a half hours without a break? 3. Are any arrangements being made to provide additional officers on the staff, temporary or otherwise, to meet the Christmas rush ? 4. Is it a fact that the re-arranged arrangement further lengthens the hours of duty?",15

In Committee of Ways and Mians (Consideration resumed from 12th December, vide page 4183) on motion by Mr. TUDOR: That Schedule A to the Customs Tariff 190819.10 be amended as hereunder set out, and that en and after the first day of December, One thousand nine hundred and eleven, Duties of Customs be collected in pursuance of the Customs Tariff as so amended.",16
41,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Corio) [n.50] - Not withstanding the fact that there are some seventy items of the Tariff of a technical character included in the amended schedule submitted by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and that they have been classified in their proper sections, the amended Tariff proposed is not quite so innocent as it looks. I stand here as an out-and-out Protectionist, even to the point of prohibition, and as such, though it is rather late in the day, I welcome the amendment of the existing Tariff which has been proposed. It is agreed that Australia has endorsed the Protectionist policy, and I venture to say that there is no member of this House who has the courage to object to the principles of the new Protection. The honourable member for Ulawarra has claimed that the Liberals are entitled to be considered the fathers of all the advanced legislation passed by this Parliament. I remind the honourable member, however, that if it had not been for the support given by the twenty-seven Labour members to the Liberal party much of this Liberal legislation would not have been passed. The Leader of the Liberal Government had only twelve direct folwho was lowers, but with the support of twenty-seven Labour members he commanded the necessary numbers to carry this advanced legislation. The measure to give effect to the principle of new Protection was one of the most important measures passed by the Liberal' and Labour forces combined.. It is remarkable that, although the Government party was composed of many men of legal ability, they were unable to foresee that the High Court would later on decide that the principles of new Protection were ultra vires of the Constitution. My idea of scientific Protection is that, as industries grow under its operation, the reiceipts per head from the Customs should decrease. We find that the contrary has followed the operation of our Tariff. In 1904-5 our receipts from Customs amounted to over .£8,000,000; in 1905-6 TARIFF. they were increased by .£300,000. They were further increased in 1906-7, and in 1910-n they had increased to over £12,000,000, whilst for the current financial year the Prime Minister has estimated the receipts from Customs at £13,800,000. From the Protectionist point of view, therefore, there must be something radically wrong with our Tariff. Either our manufacturers have been unable to get the necessary labour to extend their industries or our Protection has been ineffective. Last year our imports reached a total value of £60,014,000, or an average per head of the population of the Commonwealth of £ 1 3 . Such a record of importations is absolutely absurd for a Protectionist country. If we turn even to Free Trade Great Britain we shall find that the imports per head of the United Kingdom amount to only £ 1 1 19s. n d . In the United States of America, a highly protected country in which a permanent Tariff Board is established to look minutely into all questions affecting the Tariff, the imports average £ 3 3s. 4d. per head; in Germany, the average is £0"" 6s. id. per head; Austria, £ 2 2s. i d . ; Italy, £ 3 9s. 5d.; and France, £ 6 18s. n d . We naturally expected that under the operation of a scientific Tariff our revenue per head would decrease. As a matter of fact, whilst six years ago it was £ 2 3s. 5d., last year it was ,£2 18s. 9|d., and during the current financial year, according to the estimate of the Prime Minister, it will be £ 3 2S. 4^d. I am anxious that Australia should be self-contained. In order that she may become so we must establish our own industries, so that we may be able to' make in Australia all that we require to supply our wants. We can do so if we apply ourselves to the task. We have the ability, the land, climate, and natural resources necessary for the purpose, and it is absolutely essential that we should place our Tariff on such a basis as will encourage our manufacturers to extend their industries, and, at the same time, see that the workers engaged in them are given a living wage. The honourable member for Parramatta told us that when the present Minister of Customs was not in office his chief concern was the Tariff. I think that today the honourable gentleman is just as anxious as he ever was that we should have an effective Protectionist Tariff. From conversations I have had with him, I believe that he has a very thorough grasp of the situation, and I know that he is very anxious indeed to see the principles of the new Protection fully carried out. Whilst I do not agree with all that he has proposed, I am satisfied that he is still trying to do his best in the interests of the manufacturers of Australia. The honourable member for Parramatta told us that protection was granted to Mr MCKay, of the Sunshine Harvester Works. He pointed out that the endeavour to bring him under the operation of the principles of new Protection would be a failure. agree that Mr MCKay absolutely broke an honourable promise given to the Tariff Commission, but we should not sacrifice the innocent with the guilty. There are numbers of manufacturers in Australia who are dealing fairly and honestly with their men. I know, from conversations with men engaged in industries in my own district, that they are getting a fair deal from the employers. I say that we should not sacrifice manufacturers who treat their men fairly because one manufacturer broke his word.  tories in Geelong?",16
42,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Yes , .plenty of them. Let me say that even the duty imposed to encourage Mr MCKay to establish his industry on a better basis has served a useful purpose. It is only necessary for honourable members to travel on the Bendigo line to see the gigantic works established by Mr. MCKay. The protection granted under the Tariff has enabled him practically to establish another town in Victoria.",17
43,Mr RILEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,At the expense of his workers.,17
44,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"It is all very well for the honourable member to talk in that way, but at the present time the men engaged in the works referred to are being paid the wages fixed by a Wages Board. I have admitted that Mr MCKay did not keep his word, but I still contend that if we had not granted the protection which was given to the industry it would not be in the position it occupies today. The honourable member for Parramatta appeared to be very, anxious about the welfare of the workers. It is remarkable that when these gentlemen are in opposition they suddenly awaken to the fact that the workers of Australia are the producers of the Commonwealth, and should be recognised as such. It was all very well for the honourable member to speak sarcastically of the efforts made by the Minister of Trade and Customs on behalf of the workers; but when the honourable member for Parramatta was in office, he seemed not only to forget that we require a Protectionist policy, but to overlook the needs and requirements of the workers themselves. The policy of Protection has an important bearing on that of immigration. 1 endorse the view that we need a larger population. Australia, which is a continent as big as Europe, has a popuI quite lation of only 4,500,000, whereas she ought really to be carrying a population of over 80,000,000. If we are going to endorse Free Trade principles, however, our population, instead of growing, must decrease. There is one matter which, if dealt with in a scientific manner, would tend to increase the number of our manufacturers. We have in force a Patents Act, in which it is provided that if an article patented in Australia is not manufactured here within four years of its registration, it shall be open for any person, irrespective of the patent so granted, to enter upon 'its manufacture in Australia. A large quantity of goods now coming into Australia might well be made here, and next year perhaps we might take steps to make our patent laws still more stringent so as to compel those who obtain patents in Australia to manufacture here the goods in respect of which those patents are granted. In that way we should keep the money in the country. Notwithstanding the opposition of some honourable members, I believe that we are taking a step in the right direction by imposing a duty of 25 per cent, on flannelette. We have in Australia a number of woollen mills with whose output flannelette is a serious competitor, and, as a matter of fact, I do not think die duty is yet high enough. In order to give effective protection to some of our local industries, it may be necessary to raise the duty to 50 per cent. The cement industry is making rapid strides in Australia, and the proposal now before us to impose upon cement a duty of 2s. per cwt. will, if adopted, lead to its making still greater strides. Then, again, the proposed duty of 25 per cent, on oil paintings, whilst not affecting the importation of real works of art, will have a very valuable influence in shutting out the "" daubs "" which are being introduced at the present time, and are purchased by many men who, by reason of their training, are unable to distinguish between them and true works of art. This duty will confer a benefit on Australian artists, and will enable them to obtain a fair return for their work. I am pleased that it is proposed to increase the duty on strawboard to 2s. per cwt.",17
45,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The proposal is an outrage.,18
46,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"In common with other honourable members, I have received a circular from P. J. Firth Limited, cardboard box manufacturers, of Sydney, who, instead of seeking to advance good reasons why the duty should not be imposed, make a scurrilous attack on local manufacturers of strawboard. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Surely the boxmakers have as much right to be considered as has a strawboard manufacturer down Geelong way.",18
47,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Certainly . But the point I make is that this firm which objects to the imposition of the duty, instead of attacking a local industry, should have attempted to show good reasons for its opposition to the proposal. In the circular before me it is stated by P. J. Firth Limited that a local firm which is desirous of receiving this protection would not concede to its employees the principle of the new Protection. That is a reference to an occurrence of some years ago. briefly explain the reason why the proprietors of the Australian Paper Mills then opposed the granting of a Wages Board in respect of their industry. At ""the time in question they were the only manufacturers engaged in the industry in Victoria, and therefore under the State Act would not have been entitled to representation on the board proposed to be appointed. In other words, the employees would be represented, hut the manufacturers, since they comprise only one firm, would not.",18
48,Mr RILEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Do the workers want a. Wages Board now?,18
49,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Yes , and they are going to get one.",18
50,Mr RILEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,That shows that the conditions are not too good.,18
51,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The men are receiving a minimum wage of 7s. a day, even although there is no Wages Board in the  Wages Board was not appointed years ago, and why a certain proprietary petitioned the Legislative Council of Victoria against the appointment of a Wages Board. I was present at a recent meeting of the proprietors and the men of the Australian Paper Mills, at which the employee's said that they weresatisfied with their present condition, believing that the industry was paying then as much as it could pay under existing conditions. With this duty, however, it would be possible for the mills to pay a higher wage, and the proprietors have no objection to their emploves forming a union, and obtaining the appointment of a Wages Board.",18
52,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,How many men are there in the industry?,18
53,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I admit that there are not very many. Mr J. H CATTS - There are not fifty men in the industry, and yet the duty will prejudicially affect .5.000 employees in other industries.",18
54,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,This increase of duty will cause the indtistry to expand.,18
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Does the Victorian Wages Board system carry out the honourable member's idea of the new Protection ?,18
56,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"During the recent referenda campaign the honourable member for Parramatta toured New South Wales in opposition to our request that the Parliament should be granted power to carry out the policy of the new Protection, and since we have not that power, the next best thing I may for us to do is to accept the Wages Board system. I believe that Wages Boards have done a vast amount of good.",18
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Do they carry out the honourable member's idea of new Protection ?,18
58,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,They do not; but we must be content with them until the people of Australia give the necessary power to carry out the principle of new Protection.,18
59,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"What is the substitute the (honourable member proposes for the Wages Boards to carry out the principle? . Mr OZANNE - The substitute is arbitration. There is one item I am pleased to see in the Tariff, but at the same time. I think the Minister has made a slight mistake in regard to it. Gramaphones are protected to the extent of 35 per cent., but all machines under £ 5 in value are admitted free. It is possible, in my opinion, to manufacture gramaphones in Australia, and those in more general use are the cheaper varieties. I do not believe in making any class distinction, but such a ^distinction is certainly made in this instance ; and all these machines ought to be subject to. the duty. Pianos and pianola pianos are dutiable in the general Tariff, and subject to a duty of £ 1 4 and £ 7 , or 35 per cent., whichever rate returns the most revenue; and the Minister was wisely advised in having a fixed duty, though it is possible that it is not high enough. The other day 1 saw in an English journal an advertisement-that of new pianos, which looked very well indeed in the illustrations, at £ 1 0 each, walnut overmantles at 12s. 6d., suites at 30s., and extension tables at ios. UndeT our Wages Board system and the conditions here, it is absolutely impossible for any manufacturer to compete with such cheap productions; and it is necessary that our protection should be - made effective. The Minister has, however, taken a step in the right direction, and, perhaps, next session he will find it advisable to increase the duties. Another item of importance to Australia is that of hides, which, limed, fleshed, or snlit, are subject to a duty of 5s. each. This is a heavy impost, but it is necessary; and in this connection I have received a circular from the J. P. Howe and Companv Proprietary Limited, containing the following :the imposition of a duty such as is proposed will prevent the further importation - of anv hides in the condition above referred to, regardless of the consequences. In my opinion we ought to absolutely prohibit the importation of hides Mr Knibbs informs me that in 1909 there were imbook covers, and so forth. ported into Australia 136,375 hides, and in 1910 .the number was 119,408. It will 'be seen that, notwithstanding the fact that ally driven out of the market. Australia is one of the leading countries for the production of hides, the importabers tions are very large. The circular further points outwe can assure you that the cost of unhairing, fleshing, and splitting hides does not exceed the sum of is. gd. per hide, and this work could be carried out. by our present staff. If all this work were done in Australia it would certainly be necessary for those engaged in the industry to increase the number of their employees. At present, throughout Australia, there are only 179 tanneries employing 2,980 persons; and that seems ridiculous in a country of the size and possibilities of Australia. Notwithstanding the heavy importations, Australia, in 1909, exported hides to the number of 286,973, valued at £239,539; and it ought to be possible for this raw material to be turned into the finished article in Australia and sent out to compete with the productions of other countries. We have only £484,859 invested in plant and buildings in connection with the industry; and the total number of hides dealt with last year was 1,148,000. As a matter of fact, there ought to be £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 invested, seeing that Australia is considered one of the chief countries in the world for the production of hides. Another item to which I desire to refer is that of Kraft brown paper, which does not appear in the Tariff proposals before us. The honourable member for Ulawarra pointed out that whereas a few years ago about 150 persons were employed in this industry, there were now over 200, and submitted the fact as proof that this could not be said to be languishing. In my opinion, however, the small increase in the number of employees shows that there must be something radically wrong. In Geelong, owing to the insufficient protection, one mill, where this brown paper was manufactured, has already been closed down; and the output of the Australian Paper Mills Company has decreased from 1,800 tons to 1,400 tons. I can assure the Minister that if sufficient protection is not afforded Australian Kraft brown paper will be driven out of the market.",19
60,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What sort of paper do those mills manufacture?,19
61,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Ordinar y white paper, such as that used in the Electoral Branch, Only a limited quantity of brown paper is manufactured, but, as I say this is being graduIt has been complained by several honourable memthat they are practically in the dark in dealing with this revision of the Tariff; and in that I have to agree with them. The Minister ofTrade and Customs circularized all the manufacturers asking them to provide him with certain data; and while some complied, others absolutely refused. However, I have the data in connection with the manufacture of this brown paper. So far as the Australian Paper Mills Company is concerned, the paper is manufactured out of imported pulp. The cost, delivered to the mill in Australia, is made up as follows:-Cost , insurance, and freight, pulp, jQ8 ios. per ton; wharfage, ios. per ton; other costs, 5s. per ton.",19
62,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Where does the pulp come from ?,20
63,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Fro m Scandinavia. So that the total cost of the raw material delivered at the mill is £ 9 5s. per ton. The cost of production per ton is as follows :-Pulp , £ 9 5s.; wages, jQ$ 7s. 6d.; other costs, £ 5 17s. 6d; total, £ 2 0 ios. Now the Australian paper mills are selling their paper at £ 2 3 per ton. The imported Kraft brown paper pays in freight 22s. 6d. per ton of 40 cubic feet. On the other hand, a ton of pulp occupies 80 cubic feet, which is equivalent to 2 tons ot space from the stand-point of thefinishedarticle. Thus the cost of the pulp in Scandinavia is 5 - per ton. s manufacturers pay in wages and all other expenses £ 1 1 per ton. Deducting the cost of the pulp, their expenditure is £ 4 15s. per ton. That covers .everything, so that our mills pay in wages alone 12s. 6d. per ton more. But when we take into consideration that in Australia ,£5 17s. 6d. per ton has to be expended, upon coal, starch, colouring, & c , it will be seen that goods. we are in a worse position than foreign manufacturers of Kraft brown paper by £ 6 ios. per tori. When we realise that we are importing 6,000 tons of this paper annually, it will be seen that if we had' an no authority to do so. effective duty upon it, we should be able to keep in Australia £36,000 a year which would be divided amongst the workers, to the great benefit of the industry. The existfor ing duty is £ 5 per ton, which makes the total cost of the Scandinavian finished article £ 2 0 11s. 9d. per ton. That article is sold in Australia at ,£22 ios. per ton, so that, practically, the Scandinavian manufacturers, notwithstanding that they pay only half the wages that are paid by our manufacturers, are making less than £ 2 per ton profit. There are a great many other matters connected with the Tariff with which I might deal.",20
64,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Thes e are matters which should be sifted by a board.,20
65,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I agree with the honourable member. There are a number of items in the schedule before us which I ' intend to support simply because I am a Protectionist and have confidence in the Ministry. But, as I have already pointed out, the protection which is afforded to certain industries is not sufficient. We have heard a good deal about Wages Boards and the new Protection. We have been told that the Wages Board system has not resulted in any good. But whilst that system may not be perfect, I claim that it has brought about infinitely better conditions than obtained in Australia prior to its introduction. Despite the fact that Wages Boards have increased the cost of production, I believe that the condition of the worker in Australia today is 25 per cent, better than it was ten years ago. If one travels round Melbourne he cannot fail to be impressed with the fact that it is a paradise now compared with what it was then. These improved conditions are the result of the introduction of the Wages Board system and arbitration. Of course, we cannot hope to secure perfection in a day. I would rather see the The Scandinavian workers of Australia in receipt of good wages and paying big prices for their commodities than I would see them getting poor wages and cheap goods. No body of workers is justified in complaining of the cost of production in other industries while they themselves are getting high wages. No body of employers is justified in sweating their workmen in order to produce cheap I know that in many industries> manufacturers are making a larger profit than they are entitled to make. At the referendum we were refused power to deal with them, so that, at present, we have The honourable member for Parramatta referred last evening to a delegation of British workmen which visited the town of Gorz, in Germany, the purpose of inquiring into the conditions which' obtained there. He stated that one section of that delegation had reported very adversely upon those conditions. I wish to say that I saw the report of a section of that delegation, and it was of a very eulogistic character indeed. It practically endorsed the statement of the honourable member for Melbourne that"" it was impossible to find slums there, and the workers were living in comparative comfort. Of course, we must all recognise that the Tariff is a very complicated piece of mechanism. We cannot hope to sift all the questions relating to it in a day and to arrive at a correct conclusion. Although we may have every confidence in our Minister, it is absolutely essential that we should have some body which can watch the operations of the Tariff, see if the protection is effective, or if it is too great, take care that the manufacturer is not fleecing the public, and that goods are not being dumped into Australia to the detriment of our own industries. We, as members of Parliament, cannot know all about these things. Personally, I have done my best to ascertain what anomalies exist in regard to the various industries mentioned in this schedule. In some cases I have succeeded, but in the great majority I am working in the dark. To the Geelong Chamber of Commerce I sent a letter asking to be provided with a list of anomalies, but even that body could not name one. We should follow the example of America, which has a permanent Tariff Jioard to go into all these questions. So successful has it been that, whereas in Australia the value per head of imports is £ 1 3 on a very small population, in America it is only £ 3 odd with a population of about 110,000,000. It would be to the interest of the Government and the people to have a board with the Minister as its head, to sift Tariff evidence, and place it before members, as I Have done in the case of Kraft brown paper. I have here quite a number of letters from manufacturers, particularly in Victoria, one manufacturer making one statement, and another making a statement diametrically opposed to it. When manufacturers disagree in that fashion, it is no wonder that honourable members, not having the information, cannot arrive at a just conclusion. Members sitting on this side are absolutely in favour of the principle of new Protection, although some of them may be divided regarding the old Protection. When the Leader of the Opposition the other night stated as a Protectionist that the Tariff now before the Committee did not go far enough, the honourable member for Lang, the Opposition Whip, absolutely repudiated the Protectionist principles of his leader. He was very honest in his announcement that he would not accept from the Leader of the Opposition dictation as to how he should vote. Subsequently the honourable member for Ulawarra and others with Free Trade views also attacked the Tariff amendment now before us. The honourable member for Wilmot interjected last night that all the members sitting on the Government side of the House were "" drivers."" I agree with him' to this extent, that we have no time for a "" passenger."" Notwithstanding the taunts of the Opposition that we simply follow the dictates of our leader, and must do whatever the Government tell us to, the fact remains that every man on this side of the House is entitled to express his own opinion on all questions outside the platform. I have this morning endorsed the Advisory Tariff Board principle. A number of other members may not favour it, but I believe it is absolutely essential in the interests of the Protectionist policy of Australia. I hope the Minister before the Tariff passes from this Chamber will take into consideration the item of Kraft brown paper which I have brought before him. I am specially interested in the matter from a Protectionist stand-point. It means much to the industries of Australia, and the industry in my electorate.",20
66,Mr FAIRBAIRN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,That is where the shoe pinches.,21
67,Mr OZANNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I believe the industry also exists in New South Wales. I may tell the honourable member for Fawkner that I want to see our own men employed, and not walking about the streets doing nothing, while men in Scandinavia are getting the benefit of the energy of the Australian public. We want to see the population of Australia grow. Instead of being a little over 4,000,000, we want to see it 80,000,000, because it is absolutely necessary if we desire to keep our own country that we should build up manufactories and secure a large population. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [11.38] - Fro m the nature of the proposals which we are now considering one would imagine that we were at the beginning of a parliamentary session instead of nearing the close. I do not think there is another instance on record of a Government introducing a new Tariff measure, ripping up whole sections of the Tariff under the guise of rectifying anomalies, and thus creating material for an extensive debate, in the closing days of a session. The Government appear to have gone out of their way to invite those who hold differing fiscal opinions to extend the session far' beyond the date on which they have declared their intention of closing it. Ministers must not complain if honourable members on both sides, of opposite fiscal opinions, who object to the re-opening of the'Tariff at this stage, are forced into the position of attacking these proposals and trying to prevent further injustice being flicted upon the whole community.",21
68,Mr FENTON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"You do not call this a reopening of the Tariff, do you? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I do. It is practically a ripping up of the whole Tariff, because the whole Tariff may come under review. The Minister may not have had that in his mind at the time, but as soon as we begin to rip open the Tariff, even under the guise of correcting anomalies, what happens? The Minister himself has had some experience. He has been deluged with deputations. They have come upon him like an avalanche, asking that this little industry or that big one, as the case may be, shall receive special consideration. There is no end to the appeals that will be made for alterations of duty through the Tariff. We might very well be kept employed for twelve months dealing with nothing else than the correction of anomalies. But the Labour party at the present time, I suppose, wants to maintain the unenviable reputation that it has succeeded in establishing all over Australia as the heavy taxation party. It is astonishing that a party which might reasonably be looked to, if we may judge from its name, to lighten the burdens upon the people, has, in our experience of it, always been the party that has been associated with the imposition of the heaviest burdens upon those who are least able to bear them-the workers of the community. On every side we hear protests and agonizing cries going up about the increased cost of living. That heavy cost has been brought about by the Labour party in this House. Yet we have proposals made now which will certainly not tend to diminish the cost of living, which has been increased to its present limit largely through the action of those who were returned as the direct representatives of Labour. If it had not been for the votes of members of the Labour party we should not have had the present Protectionist Tariff in operation.",22
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Hear , hear.  candid admission. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - And . if, again, it had not been for - the Protectionist votes of so-called Free Trade members of the party the cost of living would not have increased to the present abnormal proportions. The workers have little to thank the Labour in- party for in so reducing the purchasing power of their wages, that today it costs 30s. to buy goods which a few years ago would have cost only a pound or a little less. A man or woman-and , unfortunately, it is the housewife who feels the pinch, because she has to manage the domestic purse - find s as a consequence that the weekly earnings do not go nearly so far as they did before the cost of commodities was increased all round.",22
70,Mr ROBERTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member had better square his opinions with thoseof his leader. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - My leader has his own opinions on these matters, and they are diametrically opposed to mine. Honourable members opposite, however, are in the same unenviable position. Some of them hold extreme views on the fiscal question, which are directly opposed to those of other members of the party. Even members of the Ministry are in that position. Some are extreme Protectionists, and others are extreme Free Traders. Yet they sit side by side in the same Cabinet, and are co-responsible for bringing in these alleged protective duties. I say "" alleged "" advisedly, because Protectionists say they fail in their object, and we have here Tariff proposals which are repugnant alike both to honest Free Traders and honest Protectionists.",22
71,Mr HIGGS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Will the honourable member give us some items in regard to the cost of living? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member has only to examine any grocery and clothing lists, for example, to find sufficient facts to satisfy even his rapacious appetite. The party in power, notwithstanding that there' are intheCabinet men holding opposite fiscal views,, are responsible for this attempt, which I am afraid will be only too successful,, still further to increase duties which are already abnormally high. Protectionists and Free Traders, if they arehonest, must alike be opposed to such, proposals. Those who, like myself, believe in Free Trade as a principle, and others who look to the Customs House merely as - source of revenue, must dislike ing Tariff; Protectionists also must dislike it, because they object to the Customs House as a revenue-raising institution. a Free Trader is true to his principles he has no use for the Customs House for revenue. He has no use for .it as means of imposing duties on commerce, the tendency of which must, in proportion to the rise in duty, be to make trade intercourse less and less free. Protectionwent ists, on the other hand, if they are true to their principles, can have no use duties which simply extract revenue from imports, and do not give the desired protection to local industries which is basic idea of their policy. Honourable members who reflect must see that Protecthough tion itself is an anomaly, because it differfor entiates between one class of citizens and another. It gives to one class an advantage which the rest of the community do not - enjoy, but for which they have to pay. mission. Not only is it an anomaly, but it necessarily gives rise to innumerable other omalies, and the more we try to correct them as they become apparent the greater - the number of anomalies which we create in the process. It has been pointed tunity. - out by a number of those who are interested in the various items of the that fresh anomalies will now be created by the action of the Ministry in this amateurish attempt to correct what are alleged to be existing anomalies.  orable member favour a Tariff Board? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I be should like to call attention to the attitude which the Age newspaper has taken up in regard to the matter suggested years. by die interjection of the honourable ber for Indi. It will be remembered that a proposal was made by the vernment for the appointment of an Inter-State Commission-practicall Board-to make inquiries into the whole ramifications of trade and commerce and their bearings in connection with profits, wages, and all industrial considerations which arise out of a Tariff. newspaper at that time very severely - demned the proposal. But I observe that within the last two or three days it - taken up the idea. It is now urging, its usual forceful way, the very proposals - which it condemned in no unmeasured a terms at the time when they were originthis amendated by the late Government.",22
72,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I never could understand why the late Government did not carry out If that Inter-State Commission idea. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Be cause the late Government were turned out a of office, and had not an opportunity.",23
73,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Why did they not go on with the proposal when they introduced it ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - They to the country with their policy and were not returned with a majority. Consefor quently they had no opportunity to carry those proposals into effect. The Age even attacks the honourable member for Hume the this morning, and strips from his shoulders every shred of Protectionist reputation, if any man has tried to do his best Protection it is the honourable member.",23
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The Age was of the same opinion as myself when it referred previously to the Inter-State ComMr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Now it anturns on the honourable member. While I am opposed to his fiscal principles, I give him credit for trying to carry out his Protectionist views when he had the opporUnder this very high Tariff",23
75,Mr SAMPSON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Would the 'honourable Tariff, member call this a high Tariff? . Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is one of the highest known to the world, but notwithstanding the duties, our imports have been increasing yearly by leaps and bounds, and are still doing so. The Customs revenue for 1904-5 was about £8,600,000, and for the present year will about £13,800,000, and next year propeculiar bably £15,000,000. There has been an now increase of about £5,250,000 in seven During the same period the Cusmemtoms revenue per head of population has increased from £ 2 3s. 3$d. to ,£3 2s. 4jd., Fusion Goor nearly £ 1 a head.",23
76,Mr FENTON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"That shows that more y a Tariff protection is needed. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The logical Protectionist must be a prohibitionist. The only way in which Tariff anomalies can be effectually removed is by abolishing The Age duties. Directly you impose duties to protect conlocal industries you create anomalies, and the more you tinker with Tariffs, and the has higher you make the duties, the greater in and more numerous these anomalies become. If it is bad to have trade with other countries ' it should 'be prohibited altogether, but if it is good there should be the greatest freedom for it. I am a Free Trader because I believe in freedom to produce and exchange. Free Trade is the policy which I have supported ever since I began to take an interest inpolitical questions, and I stand for it now. I have no use for the Customs House; I would sooner see all revenue raised by direct taxation. That is the more honest and proper form of taxation. Under it every member of the community knows what the Government of the State costs him, but with indirect taxation, although the people know that money is niched from them, and that at the end of the year they are poorer than they were at the beginning, they do not know how much they lose, because it is taken from them by stealth in purchasing commodities.",23
77,Dr MALONEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Did the honourable member vote against the land tax? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I do not consider that a land tax should be imposed in addition to Customs taxation; it should be in substitution of it, and that is the only land value taxation I favour.",24
78,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"And should not be a class tax. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is so. No one has the right to answer for me on the fiscal question, nor to control my speeches or votes in regard to it or any other matter. Every man on this side is free. No doubt on the other side there are wide differences of opinion on the fiscal question. That is made evident when we see the honourable' member for Calare and the honourable member for Capricornia sitting together, or the Attorney-General and the Minister of Trade and Customs. Yet the Minister, speaking the other day for his Government and party, declared to a deputation that they were Protectionists. That makes me wonder whether the Free Traders in the Labour party have recanted their fiscal opinions. If he spoke for the whole of his party, I take it that they must have recanted their Free Trade principles, notwithstanding that they had been very strong. I desire to refer to some statements which have been made by honourable members on each side. In the course of his speech the honourable member for Kooyong said he thought that there should be an inquiry into the operation of the Tariff. We had a Royal Commission appointed for that very purpose. It sat for a great many months, went carefully into the pros, and cons, of almost every industry in Australia, and drew up a voluminous report. But with what result? Although the report was made available before the revision of the Tariff in 1907, and had cost the country an enormous sum, yet the Ministry of the day set it on one side, and took its own course, with the honourable member for Hume in charge of the Trade and Customs .Department. I do not know whether if another Royal Commission were appointed we would get a different result. The honourable member for Kooyong also said that the revision of the Tariff is neverfinishedwith, but that rectifications must go on all the time. That shows very clearly that there is no finality to this Protection. When first we heard the cry for Protection the argument used to induce Free Traders to vote for Protectionist duties was, "" We only want a small amount of protection just to give the industries a start. As soon as they get a fair start they will be able to stand alone, and to be quite independent of the Tariff, and then we can afford to get rid of the duties."" The cry used to be the same when proposals for the grant of bounties were brought down. A bounty was only wanted for the purpose of tiding an industry over the preliminary stages, and then it could be done without, but in both cases our experience, and, I believe, the experience of the world, has been that, so far from' any industry being satisfied, the Tariff protection which it received in the beginning has always created an appetite for more assistance, so that there never was any limit to the protection which an industry, - once it was stimulated and spoon-fed by a Customs duty, would be able ultimately to demand and absorb. Duties have been raised and raised until the power of the public to bear further taxation is pretty well exhausted. I think it will only be a very short time before we shall find that the whole of the public will be so incensed at this continual increase in the cost of living which is so largely contributed to by Tariff protection that there will be a reversion once more to something in the nature of Free Trade, at any rate there will be a pretty universal demand by the consumers-by the term consumers I mean largely the wage-earning classes who after all are the majority of the consumersfor at least a very substantial reduction in the rate of duties.",24
79,Mr ROBERTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I have just looked up the division. The honourable member did vote against the land tax. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Ver y likely, against the Labour party's apology for a land tax. My speech would show my attitude arid explain any vote of mine.",25
80,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I thought that the honourable member walked out as he usually does. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - If I did not vote for the discriminating and emasculated land tax it will be found that there was a good and substantial reason. I shall not depend on the honourable member for Adelaide, but will look it up.",25
81,Mr ROBERTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I have marked it for your special' benefit. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am extremely obliged to the honourable member. I shall have a look at it presently.,25
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If you did vote for a land tax you would have voted against your lifelong professions; but that was not a land tax. - Mr W;. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am quite sure, that I made my attitude quite clear. The honourable member for Hume stated that if we did not have Protection we should approach to the level of the blackfellow. might remind the honourable member of the days when he was a Free Traderthough not, of course, since he has been in the House-and held very different views. When Sir GeOrge Reid was Premier of New South Wales he practically abolished the Customs House j he only retained the duties on narcotics, stimulants, and a few other items. During his tenure of office we had as near an approach to absolute Free Trade, coupled with the principle of land value taxation as has ever been known in Australia. There never was up to that time a greater period of prosperity. People got more for their sovereign then than they can possibly get today. There was a general lowering of prices, a general increase of the amount of employment available, a general increase in wages, and a very much greater degree of domestic comfort, especially among the poorer sections of the community than can be found anywhere in Australia today. That is my answer to the honourable member for Hume in that regard. Furthermore, I would call his attention to the fact that Free Trade British wages are very much higher than Continential Protectionist wages. compare wages in Great Britain with the wages, not in a new country like Australia, America, or Canada, but in some of the older countries in Europe, where the comparison will be much fairer; if we compare the conditions, the wages, the general cost of living, and the general comfort of the working classes of Great Britain with those of the working clasess in the most highly' protected Continental countries, the answer is one unmistakably in favour of Great. Britain and her policy of Free Trade.",25
83,Dr MALONEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I strongly differ with you. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member has not travelled all over the Continent, but h'e has merely travelled in one or two countries, and taken one or two cities. Last night he spoke particularly of Berlin, but I saw by a recent cable that at the present time no fewer than between 80,000 and 90,000 artisans and mechanics , are unemployed in that city. So much for that illustration.",25
84,Dr MALONEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"In London alone there are 1,000,000 people within reach of starvation. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I saw as much of London as the honourable member. I regard his statement as I a fanciful exaggeration. Speaking just now, the honourable member for Corio said that if it were not for the monopolies existing in Australia we could manufacture more cheaply than is done. I would remind the honourable member that the way to establish monopolies is to create vested interests, and that we could have no better way of creating vested interests than that of giving Customs Tariff privileges to certain manufacturers, who will profit thereby at the expense of the rest of the ccanmunity. Protection is the father of monopolies, trusts, and combines of that injurious character which the honourable member himself so heartily condemns, and he is helping to build up monopolies in Australia by supporting the imposition of protective duties. What is the underlying principle of Protection, save that of preventing free competition? If free competition is destroyed, monopolies must be created, and the more we increase our protective duties the greater will become monopolies in Australia. The honourable member, and those associated with him, in helping local manufacturers to secure a monopoly of the home market, are doing their very best to build If we up the very monopolies against which they are making such an outcry.

He went to* that country to show us 'how a monopoly could be destroyed, and told us that Japan' was the only nation that had been able to successfully attack the American Tobacco Combine. It was able to do so, however, only by adopting the very process that tends to build up ""monopolies' in America. It defeated the operations of the combine within its own borders by increasing, from time to time, Customs duties on cut tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes until they reached a level of 355 per cent.

What are the workers to receive as the result of this Tariff revision? What is the consumer to get out of it? The consumers generally, whether; they are. workers or not, are going to pay more than they pay already for their goods. Unless prices are to be increased, the imposition of these duties cannot be of any; advantage to the rnanufacturers concerned, This is, therefore, a proposal to take more money out of the pockets of the workers .to benefit the manufacturers. There is no stipulation that any portion of the benefit to be conferred on the manufacturers, by means of this Tariff, is to. beshared by the workers. What are the Ministry going to do about it? Despite their professions of friendship for. the worker, all' that we find in. this Tariff is an advantage to the employers and absolutely none for the employees.",26

I ha-ye always demandedr that there shall be equal freedom for all and special privileges to none. Those are the principles for which 1I have always stood and which I am still supporting. I am fighting now, and intend to continue to fight, against any attempt to give one section in the community an advantage at the expense of the rest. In my opinion, it is not the function of any Government or Parliament to legislate in the interests of any one section or class in the community. It is their function, on the contrary, to see that no obstacles are placed in the way of equal opportunities to all to earn a living, and to carve out their destinies in the way which may seem to them best. But the party at present in power in this Parliament are prepared to go out of their way to use their powers to legislate in the interests of one class in the community at the expense of all the rest, and to depart from those sound principles of freedom by which I have always been guided in connection with any legislation m which I have taken a part. In order to give honourable members opposite an opportunity to rectify an oversight- I trust it is only an oversight, and not the result of deliberate action on their part-in excluding the workers from any benefit under the Tariff now proposed, I intend to move later on an addition to the motion now before the Committee in the following words:Provided that increased rates of duty shall cease to operate after a period of three months from the date of their imposition unless satisfactory evidence shall be forthcoming that have been increased in industries in respect to which increased Tariff protection has been indicated. I have no wish to restrict discussion at the present time, but later in the debate I intend to move this addition to the motion now before the Committee.

I quite agree with the honourable member for Lang, that if we were to do that we should have to consider that Protection is really a breach of the general principle of human freedom. It is an attempt to control people in the expenditure of their own money, by saying that if they spend it outside their own country, as distinguished from inside the country, they must pay a penalty. I agree that it is inopportune now to go into the principles of Free Trade and Protection, and that at this stage of the session it would be merely a waste of time, but I wish to say, in answer to a number of statements made as to the conversion of the Opposition to Protection, that I do not give up one jot of my convictions as a Free Trader. Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and Professor Fawcett are just as sacred to me now as embodying the truth in human affairs as they ever were. I can say candidly that if I had an opportunity tomorrow, without injuring vested interests, to bring about a return to absolute Free. Trade in Australia, I should take advantage of it. I believe that every country passes through a series of stages, beginning with the pastoral and agricultural, and passing when that has been exhausted to the manufacturing stage. England did not become a manufacturing country until she had almost ceased to command the market as a pastoral and agricultural country. She resorted to manufacturing, which draws the people from the free air of the country into crowded towns, very much to the detriment of their health, when the great territories of America and Russia had flooded the world with agricultural products for the wages production of which they offered such splendid facilities. England then resorted to manufacturing, with the result that the people, instead of living in the free air of the country, were brought into great .towns like Manchester, Liverpool, and London, where, amid the smoke and fumes of manufacturing industries, their vigour and physical condition generally became enormously deteriorated. I recognise that for a time Australia is committed to Protection, though I remain as ever true to my own convictions. Just as we all have fiom time to time become reconciled to the existence of a popular opinion different to that which we entertain ourselves, so T have to be reconciled to the popular view on the fiscal question. I befieve that the fiscal belief of the people of Australia has been largely influenced by .what I shall always characterize as a great breach of faith on the part of the first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. Everyone will recollect that when Mir., now Sir Edmund, Barton went to Maitland before this Parliament first met, he assured the people that we could have neither the Tariff of New South Wales, the oldest State in the Common-, wealth, nor that of Victoria, but that we must adopt some compromise between the two as the ultimate policy of the Commonwealth. - He came down to Melbourne, and told the people of Victoria that it was quite impossible to adopt the Tariff of either State referred to, and that we should require to adopt a compromise between the two. At that time. I know, from personal acquaintance of the men connected with Sir Edmund Barton's Ministry, that the inclusion in the first Government of the Commonwealth of as many Free Traders as Protectionists was contemplated. But the honourable member for Hume, who had the first call on the position of Prime Minister of Australia, handed over the commission to Sir Edmund Barton, stipulating that he should have a place in the Ministry. We all know very well that the first Prime Minister of Australia chose for his Government the strongest Protectionists in the Commonwealth, including the honourable member for Hume, who had been Premier of New South Wales, Mr Kingston, who had been Premier of South Australia, and Sir John Forrest, who had been Premier of Western Australia.",27
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,He is not a Protectionist.,28
90,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"He is not a prohibitionist, but he is a Protectionist in the sense in which some of the great Protectionist writers are Protectionists, because none of them is a prohibitionist. Sir Edmund Barton included in his Government the strongest Protectionists in Australia, and"" introduced a Tariff which, as I showed in TQ02, was 6 per cent, higher than the highest Protectionist Tariff that had ever been passed in Victoria. It is impossible to go back to the figures now, but I laid myself out to show that, instead of compromising between the Free Trade to which the people of New South Wales had been committed for so many years, and the Protection of Victoria, he had gone one better than the Protection of Victoria. I charged the honourable member plainly on the floor of the House with having obtained his majority by political false pretences.",28
91,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Which wrong 1,28
92,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I remember the incident as if it were yesterday, though it is ten years ago.",28
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,But it was not true!,28
94,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member knows that I said it, and he then, as now, - said I was wrong. He is consistent in contradicting me; and I shall now leave the matter as ancient history. I have a keen memory for details, and the facts are as fresh in my mind today as they were then.",28
95,Mr ARCHIBALD,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The people of New South Wales have changed' since then.,28
96,Mr BRUC ESMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I . can tell the honourable member that in New South Wales there are just as many staunch Free Traders now as there were then, with the exception of a number, who were importers and who have found themselves forced by the Tariff to become manufacturers, and have set up their personal interests against the interests of the country. A few months' ago I said to one of the largest manufacturers of New South Wales, "" Have you changed your politics""? He replied, "" No ; if you ask me what I am from an Australian point of view, I am a Free Trader, but if you ask me what I am from the point of view of my own pocket, I am a Protectionist.""",28
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,That is what most people are !,28
98,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I hope there are a few-indeed , I think there are a great many-wh o look at public affairs apart from the interest of their pockets. God help the country in which the conduct of public affairs becomes a scramble for the pocket as against the interest of patriotism! I wish to remove an idea that some honourable members opposite seem to have obtained from observations made on this side, that Free Traders here have become Protectionists.",28
99,Mr FENTON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Does the honourable member desire to convey that Free Trade and patriotism are synonymous terms?,28
100,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I think they are. However, I do not desire to go into the philosophy of the question. My general view of politics is that life is a race, and that if our race, in the other sense, is to be dominant amongst the races of the world, we must cultivate the best form of citizenship. In order to do this we must avoid all legislation which forces the was superior man to keep back until the inferior man comes up to him ; we must cultivate a condition of things in which the best man. wins, no matter what the industry or business is. Such proposals as we have had lately, by which men are kept back and told that there is no work for thern because they do not happen to join a particular union, are detrimental to the interests of citizenship in every possible way.",28
101,Mr RILEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What about the barristers' union ?,29
102,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member always looks through a knot-hole; he can never open his eyes wide. Indeed, I doubt if the honourable member has two eyes, for he sees everything from a narrow stand-point because of his party. I know from my experience of himi in another capacity that, if he could open both his eyes, he is as capable as any one of seeing everything from a broad national standpoint. However, I am not going to embark on a broad discussion. rightly or wrongly, wisely or unwisely, has adopted a Protectionist policy. created vested interests, which, however, I think can be got rid of gradually, and will be got rid of some day. The consumer has never been properly considered in this country. When Sir George Reid, as Prime Minister, was proposing to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the anomalies of the Tariff, I asked what care he was taking to see that the consumer was represented. After all , the consumer ought to be our first consideration, but it is the manufacturer who has been our care on all occasions. Honourable members will recollect that, notwithstanding the findings of that Royal Commission, the honourable member for Hume, as Minister of Trade and Customs, over and over again proposed duties recommended by the Protectionist minority, and announced them to us as the recommendations of the Commission itself.",29
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,That is not true 1,29
104,Mr BRUC ESMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I think the time will come,29
105,Sir WILLIAMLVNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,It is not true!,29
106,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I charged the honourable member with it at the time, and I continue to charge him with it . The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. W. ELLIOT JOHNSON) - The member for Hume must withdraw the expression "" That is not true.""",29

110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Then I withdraw the expression, Mr Temporary Chairman. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. If the honourable member for Parkes has made any statement which is offensive to the honourable member for Hume he must withdraw it. Mr BRUC E SMITH - Certainl y I withdraw it , Mr Temporary Chairman. I believe, with the honourable member for Lang, that the time will come when the consumers Australia, of commodities produced in Australia will realise that they are simply being milked We have for the sake of the manufacturers of the country, and when they will rise and demand substantial reductions of the Tariff. I look forward in my own lifetime to the occasion when we shall get back to what are called revenue duties; that is the hopeful view I take. I listened to the honourable member for Corio with some interest, because he represents a type. He says that he is not only a Protectionist, but a prohibitionist; and when we remember the attitude he takes up on this question, one can see that, had he lived in China some years ago, he would have assisted in building the Great Wall. He would have helped, in the first place, to shut out all the products of the outer world; and, as a party to this Tariff, he would have assisted to keep the Art of other countries out of Australia. He would have kept everybody out who was not prepared to join the particular union to which he belonged; and, in fact, he would have gone back to that condition which has made of the Chinese a thoroughly effete people. The honourable member, as I say, is a type, but I do not think it is a numerous type, because the bulk of Protectionists are rational Protectionists. They base their belief on the honourable well-known theory that it is necessary in a new country to place some restrictions on the importation of. goods from other countries in order to give local industries a chance to get on their feet. We often hear M ill talked of as having justified Protecshall withdraw tion. I think I know M ill as well as most people; and what he said was that it might be necessary in some young countries to judicial. afford Some protection by means of modequirement, rate duties on imports. But he went on to say that there should come a time, not very far ahead, when the industries of a young country had organized their and modernized their machinery; and then the duties should be gradually reduced, and ultimately withdrawn, so that the young industries might be called upon compete with the industries of the older countries in order to give the people their commodities at the cheapest possible price. But the idea of building a Tariff wall as the honourable member for Corio sugneither gested, is one - which does not occur to very large number of sane people out doors. He endorsed what seems to have become a rather popular idea, and one which I approved many years ago-that appointing a Tariff board.",29

112,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable lieve member for Hume knows that I did.,30
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable member would approve of the appoint of ment of a board at any time in order to rid of responsibility.,30
114,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I would do so in order to get rid of a function which it impossible for Parliament to We might just as well call upon Parliament to determine the living rates of wage for all about it. the industries of Australia, as to require it to decide the duties which ought to be levied upon the thousand and one commodities which come into this country. essentially the work of an outside mission. We cannot ask Parliament to manage our railways. That work delegated. We are here as legislators, and we cannot enter into all the details connected with the imposition of the different duties which spring from the laws that we enact. The honourable member for Hume stated the other day that Bismarck evolved a Tariff from his own brain. I have a work here, however, which shows that the German Tariff was the result of many years of thought and investigation on the part of a commission. Writing of the system adopted in framing a Tariff in the United States as well as in other countries, the author refers to the preparajournal tion of the German Tariff in this wayThere a body of twenty experts worked years in the preparation of the German Tariff, consulting in that time 2,000 other experts. inquiry was exhaustive, non-partisan, and No proof, no Protection, was their rethe nicest possible balance was made between all interests, domestic and foreign.",30
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Le t the honourable member quote Bismarck's old speeches and labour he will see what he did.,30
116,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"It is quite possible that Bismarck possessed some qualities similar to those which are possessed to by the honourable member, and that he was prepared to boast of having done something which it took five menfiveyears to accomplish. I have no hesitation in saying that such the honourable member for Hume has the time, the knowledge, nor the a ability to evolve a Tariff from his own inner of consciousness. He would have to depend upon Commonwealth officers if he underof took such a task. I believe that a comof mission ought to be appointed, consisting of men unconnected with any business which is likely to profit as the result of the I have always favoured such a commission, and I bein the general principle of Parliament delegating details-whethe r they relate to railway management or the management a bank, or of a note issue-to outside get bodies so that we may devote ourselves entirely to the more abstract questions of legislation.

117,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I am not happy,30
118,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I was not thinking of him. I know that three or four years ago, when the Age opposed the apThat is pointment of a Tariff Commission, he also comopposed it.

120,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Exactly . When a man is constantly reminding one that he has always said a certain thing, one begins to wonder how long he has said it. Similarly, when I read the article which' appeared in the Age yesterday, I would have been suspicious as to how long that has held its present opinion if I had not known. But I do not intend to discuss all these abstractions. One might five speak for days upon this subject, but Their towards the close of the session to do so semiwould be out of place. Only a few weeks .ago the Minister of Trade and Customs told us that he had issued an invitation the manufacturers of Australia to supply him with statements of their financial posithey tion. I was Very glad to hear that; cause when the last Tariff was under conpretty sideration I made certain quotations in gard to the hat industry with a view .showing that a certain company was paying a 10 per cent, dividend, putting aside per cent, to a reserve fund, and that its £ 1 shares were quoted on the market 38s. Yet it was crying for more protecof tion, otherwise it would be ruined.",30

122,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I am speaking - of the Denton Hat Mills, whose balancewishes sheet I had in my hand at the time. That - company's shares then stood at almost per cent, above par, and yet it claimed - considerable increase in the measure of protection extended to it, notwithstanding that it was getting sufficiently high to enable it to make these profits. I heard the Minister say that he vited our manufacturers to supply with their balance-sheets, I was extremely pleased, because I recollect that the last to know them.

132,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I admit that to that is a fair question, but I do not think honourable members opposite quite realise this aspect: When you establish, in a country like Australia, Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts in each State, and also a Federal Arbitration Court, all with the one objective-to see that the men have a living wage-wha t more new Protection can you want? Supposing that Judge Higgins has been empowered by this Parliament to inquire into the MCKay industry, what more could he have done than to give a fair living wage? Surely the House would not entertain the idea that wages are to be regulated by the profits of an industry? If they are, they would also have to be reduced whenever there was a loss in the business, because you cannot have your cake and eat it too. Judge Cohen undertook the first arbitration case in New South Wales some years ago, he discovered at the end of his inquiry that the Steamship Company with whose affairs he was dealing, had ,£2,000 to the credit of some of their reserve funds. He said, "" If that is the case we shall have to go into the matter further,"" but it was pointed out on the other side, that if he were to raise the wages in that particular business because the employers had made more profits, it would be necessary to lower wages when he came to his next arbitration case, if he found that the employer was losing. The result would be the fixing of a different scale of wages in different kinds of business all over the country. He then recognised that the living wage must not depend either upon the profits or the of a business; that if the business could not pay a living wage that was its misfortune, and that if it could pay a living wage and make a profit, it was its good fortune. I come back now to the question of what better new Protection we can have than that which is granted to the workers of same. Australia by the Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards .of the different States and the Arbitration Court of the Commonwealth. The ground has been taken from under the feet of those people who are constantly clamouring for new Protection.",31
133,Mr ARCHIBALD,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Where does the consumer come in?,32
134,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I am not dealing with the consumer just now, but the worker is a very large consumer, and if he is given good wages it means giving him some consideration with regard to the Tariff because he is given an increased purchasing power.",32
135,Mr WEBSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The Wages Board came to a determination in the MCKay case, but it had no effect.",32
136,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The case of the men-in MCKay's industry could come either under the State Wages Board or under the Commonwealth Arbitration Court.,32
137,Mr SPENCE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"It came under the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which could not enforce its .decision.",32
138,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Because the attempt was made under a totally different Act, which was held to be ultra vires. I cannot see where the new Protection is coming in if we have effectual Arbitration Courts or Wages Boards in the States and When an effectual Arbitration Court in the Commonwealth, all having for their objective the giving of a living wage. I do not see where we could go any further, even if we had some further idea called new Protection.",32
139,Mr FENTON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What about the differing wages in the different States?,32
140,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The previous Government proposed to vest the Inter-State Commission with power to assimilate the wages fixed by the different State tribunals. The differences are not very great at present. If they were I should endorse any attempt to bring about some assimilation according to the conditions of each State. In Tasmania, for instance, people can live just as happily, and much more cheaply losses and simply, than in some of the more closely-packed States, and it would be obviously unfair to handicap a State of that sort.",32

We are within ten days of Christmas, and we have not yet started upon the consideration of the details of the question. The Tariff is much like the chain stitch in a sewing machine.

Why has one of the amusements of the people been singled out ? - I remember being told, not personally, but by deputy, that one of the manufacturers of pianos in this country, when embarking upon the industry, wanted no duty at. all. However, he has not only taken the 20 and 25 per cent, but wants more now. Why should the duty on pianos be increased?",33
151,Unknown,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m.,33
152,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"To my mind, it is of great importance that we should, so far as possible, have certainty in regard to the Tariff; it is undesirable, in the interests of importers, manufacturers, and the community generally, that the duties should be constantly changing. I remember a great Judge once saying that it is more important that the law should be certain than that it should be wise, the logical application of the remark being that when a law is certain the people get to know it, and understand it, and adapt themselves to it. The observation applies with great force to a Tariff. Bearing in mind the myriad ramifications of trade and commerce, and the enormous trouble involved to all classes by alterations of duty, we should hesitate before amending a Tariff. The schedule now under discussion may be divided into two parts: the proposals for the correction of anomalies, to which, if they are obviously needed, there can be no objection, and the proposals relating to a number of items which have been picked out of the former Tariff to be altered, as though the industries to which they relate have special claims for consideration. In regard to the timber duties, I happen to know that, by reason of the difference 'between the duty on dressed timber, which is 2s. 6d. per 100 feet, and that on undressed timber, which is 6d. per 100 feet, a large number of persons are now engaged in this country in dressing imported timber for the various purposes for which it is used.",33
153,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The duty on dressed timber is 2s. 6d. super, face, which is equivalent to 5s.",33
154,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The effect of increasing the duty on undressed timber as now proposed will be that 200 or more men in New South Wales alone employed in dressing timber will be thrown out of employment. Whether a difference should have been made originally between dressed and undressed timber is a matter that does not concern me now; I merely point out that the effect of increasing the duty on undressed timber will be to throw a large number of persons out of employment, and to largely disorganize trade between New Zealand and Australia. No doubt 'many arguments can be advanced in support of the proposal of the Government, but a great many more can be urged in rebuttal of them. With regard to anomalies, where the Minister satisfies me that adjustments are required to give consistency in the administration of the Tariff, I shall vote with himj but I shall oppose all alterations of items not involving the rectification of anomalies.",33
155,Mr ARCHIBALD,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Hindmarsh) [2.35]. - It is to be regretted that the Government did not introduce this Tariff schedule earlier, to give honourable members more time in which to make personal inquiry regarding its probable effects. Of course, we have been deluged with, information, from many sources, but men of experience know that such information must be taken with a pinch of salt, and I shall hesitate to support proposals of the reasonableness of which I am not firmly convinced. Probably it would have been well for the Government to confine its attention this session to the rectification of anomalies. Where a Customs: officer finds it extremely difficult under the law as it stands to deal justly with importers and the public, there should be an alteration of the Tariff, because our law should be as clear as possible, in the interests of the community and of the revenue. Not much is to be gained by an abstract discussion now of the merits of Free Trade and Protection. .One's fiscal views depend largely on environment, wealth, and other considerations, and I therefore shall not enter upon a discussion for which I am not now in the mood, and which you, sir, would probably not relish. There are, however, one or two items to which I wish to draw attention. In the first place, 1 desire to point out that the manufacture of superphosphates is not .sufficiently protected, local factories not being kept fully occupied. That is the case in South Australia.",33
156,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The owner of the Adelaide Chemical Works, has. made an enormous fortune, which the honourable member would make still bigger. What aho.ti;t those who have to pay the duties?' Mr ARCHIBALD,-The importation of superphosphates into South Australia amounts to 35,000 tons, 11,000 tons coming from Japan, the value of the importation being £41,000; 7,000 tons, valued .at £28,000, coming from. Holland; 1,000 tons, valued at £4,000, from Germany; and 16,000 tons, valued at £60,000, from the United Kingdom, making in all 35,000 tons, valued at £133,000. This is nearly double the capacity of the South Australian works, of which there are two in Adelaide. The local product is worth to farmers from 5s. to 7s. od. a ton more than the imported article,- because it. is free running, is put up in new bags, and is manufactured, from a higher grade of phosphate rock than is used in Europe. The wages paid in the industry in Japan some time ago was rod. a day, and is now is. 3d., as against a minimum of 8s. a day here, and an average of os-. Themoney invested in works and stock in Australia is over j£i ,000,000, and the objection of the Country party to an increase of duty can be met by a guarantee that prices will not be raised. Victoria imports from 4,000 to 5,000 tons of superphosphates annually, the value of the importation being from £r6,ooo to £20.000. New South Wales imports 5,500 tons from Japan, valued at £18,000; and fromGermany 2,000 tons, valued at £ 7 , 0 0 0; or, altogether, 7,500 tons, valued at £25,000. Western Australia imports 14,000 tons from the United Kingdom, valued at £52,000; 1,000 tons from Holland, valued at .£3.625 ; and roo tons from Sweden, valued' at .£375; or; altogether 15,100 tons, valued at £56.000. The Victorian plant of the Mount Lyell Company is: a paying concern; because it is worked up ,to iits full capacity; but the South Australian works have an output equal to only half itfaeir capacity, and as one of the conditions of success in manufacturing is the keeping of plant fully employed, they are not so profitable as .they should be.' I would not be a party to increasing prices to the farmers. With me the interests of the consumers, as well as those of the workers, have to be protected. In the days of Gladstone and Bright, and the great Free Traders of England, it used to be said that a study of the interests of consumers would settle this question.. The founders of Free Trade laid that down as a dictum, but it is one with which I do not agree. The interests of the workers are surely of some importance,, and we have to remember that all consumers are not workers. If they were there might be some force in this FreeTrade dictum-.",34
157,Mr ROBERTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,As a rule the man who consumes the most works the least.,34
158,Mr ARCHIBALD,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Quite so. As Bismarck accurately put it on one occasion, all that the man who consumes the most usually does is to cut coupons and sign receipts. He may be in some cases avery hard working man, but as a rule he is not. I do not say that the Government should deal today with the Tariff as a whole, but these piecemeal alterations are very unsatisfactory. I should be disposed to support part of a. session being set aside for at thorough consideration: of. the Tariff, and I certainlythink that thesehomoeopathic doses of Tariff revision are most, undesirable. I acquit, the Minister of Trade and Customs of any but. the most honorablemotives in attempting, to deal with what is undoubtedly one of the most difficult problems that a man could be called upon to solve. In. dealing with the Tariff he hasmy full sympathy. I know the difficulties with which he has to contend, and am inclined to consider that having regard to those difficulties the schedule which he has presented to usis not wholly unsatisfactory. I think, however, that he has beenguilty of an error of judgment in trying to obtain accurate information regarding the position of manufacturers and their need of Protection by inviting them to furnish the Department with returns. There may. be in any industry in Australia two large companies carrying on business and three or four proprietary, companies. A public company is required, to furto nish every year a balance-sheet - for the information of its shareholders, and under the Companies La\y has to that make returns from time to time as from to its position. While those returns not furnish all the information that should like to have, we know that producted prietary companies-and their name is legion-d o not publish balance-sheets. Where they do I would not say that they are "" fakes,"" but they are sometimes leading from the point of view of the public.",34
159,Mr ROBERTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The Argus recently published an article to the effect that such balance-sheets are sometimes "" faked.""",35
160,Mr ARCHIBALD,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I do not say that that industry. proprietary companies "" f a k e "" balancewhich sheets, but ^ is. possible that, in some they do, and their doings are certainly sealed book to us,. A ' public company, wbjsn asked, for information by the MinisWhilst ter, w.ou.id readily furnish hjrn with a of its balancei-sheet, but when a, similar peal n> made to a proprietary company the reply generally received is, "" We are doing yery \yel.l;.l bother, you,, and don't you, bofiher us."" \Ve as a Parliament, (^sequent 1-y -,faav.enot die information concerning many industries that we-ought to hav.e, and I think that effort should be made in future to overwell came this, difficulty. More than, one indusbrick try could make out a prima facie case for Protect-iprj or for an iipesease of Protection, but for the action of proprietary companies engaged in them which decline to furnish returns. I aril pledged to the new tection, and regret that the referenda against wha.fc I believe tp be the best terests of the country. I trust that at next referendum Australians will recognise the. absolute necessity of enabling monwealth Parliament to. deal, with a quesshould t-ion of this kind on a truly sound basis. 1 do not dispute the right of my fellpw citizens to determine who shall sit. in Parliament, and what powers shall be given tp it, but I respectfully differ from and Customs. the conclusion at which the majority arrived last. April. The fact that our referenda proposals were defeated does not absolve board of trade wereappointed. us f r p m dealing with tfie question of tection. It may hamper us, but would not justify, 'us in putting aside question. The Leader.,of the Opposithe tion: w r y naturally strongly favours the appointment qf; aBoar,d of Trade collect information for our guidance in dealing with the Tariff ; but while such a Board might be of some use to us, I think we should obtain still better resultsthe creation ,o.f some such tribunal as may that presided over by Mr Justice Higgins, we orthe Arbitration Court which was conin New South Wales under an Act that recently expired by effluxion of time. A Wages Board means a "" h i g g l e "" and a "" haggle"" between representatives of themisemployers and 'he employees. The average working man is not fully competent to go' into the question of the profits of an individual firm, and until we know what are the profits, of any particular enterprise we cannot be in a position to do justice indetermining what wages should be paid in Such a tribunal as that to I have referred, however, would be cases able to furnish the Government with in a formation as to profits, as well as to the wages, that could be paid by any industry. I am in favour of the payment of copy good wages, I certainly object to an emapployer being allowed, on the plea that he is paying good wages, to plunder the public. Wages, Boards, give us industrial peace from We do not wafft to day to day., but the tribunal that I have in mind w.ould give us, in addition, valuable information that would enable us to frame a Tariff on sound lines. The Arbitration an .Coui?t of New South, Wales was all very so long as it confined its. attention to works and kindred industries, but as soon as it began to inquire into the profitsof su.ch leviathan business, enterprises asHordern's andi Lassetter's it was time to wipe it off the face of the earth, and it was Proaccordingly wlpe.d off ! Arbitration Court went Judges are sworn, to secrecy, and they inlearn, much. from, the books, of various firms the as to their actual position. Information so obtained is for the guidance of the prethe Comsiding Judge in determining what wages be paid in an industry, but it would, be a good thing to pass legislation providing that the Judge of such a Court should, this under the bond of secrecy, convey information so obtained to the Minister of TradeThe Minister would then be in a much better position to deal with Tariff questions than he would be if a RecogPronising that we have to build up this country it on protective lines, we want reliable in this formation that will enable us to work, in first, place, in the interests.of the public, private interests receiying only secondary I 4274 consideration. I trust that the Minister will not condemn an industry merely because of the silence of any proprietary company interested in it concerning its profits. I have no desire to talk at large on this question, but there are in this schedule one or two items which I cannot support. For instance, I object to the proposed duty on American stoves and heaters. When a man is able to say of his own knowledge that the course proposed by the Government in respect of one item is wrong he might be inclined, following a rule of thumb, to say that he can place no reliance on other proposals affecting matters of which he knows nothing. Whilst I do not take up that position, I should like to know on what grounds this duty on American gas stoves and heaters can be justified. They are not made in Australia, but are imported very largely. It is quite likely that they marJe by the Standard Oil Company of the United States of America, but they are used for cooking purposes in nearly every small household during a season of the year when a fire is not required to warm a room. Every economic housewife knows their value, yet it is proposed to impose a duty upon them because in some obscure part ot Australia there may be four men and a boy employed in making a certain class of stove. I am not now referring to the stoves m which wood and coal are burnt, or which might be more correctly described as consuming wood and coal, and consuming them with a vengeance. I do not object to a duty in order to protect an Australian industry, but where there is no competition, and the proposal amounts to a revenue impost, I regard it as a big mistake. As to flannelette, I should like to see the last yard of it imported, because I regard it as the mostdangerous fabric that could possibly be worn, and in our climate it is absolutely necessary that woollen garments should be worn next the skin. We are told that there has been discovered a process to makeflannelettenon-inflammable.",35
161,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Onl y until after the flannelette is washed.,36
162,Mr ARCHIBALD,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Althoug h I should like to see the importation of flannelette prohibited, we have to recollect that, it is worn by the poorest of our brethren; and, therefore, I shall be no party to any increased duty. Personally, I should not, under any circumstances, wear a garment made of flannelette; but I refuse to inflict a great injustice on the poorest of Australians, because of my strong opinions or prejudices. There are other items to which I might refer, but I have no desire to prolong the debate. I hope that, in the future, the Minister, when seeking information, will see that no industry is handicapped by the withholding of Protection or increased Protection, simply because no representations are made to him by those concerned.",36
163,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Darling Downs) [3.3] I regret that the Minister of Trade and Customs did not introduce this Customs schedule at a much earlier stage. He has had some eighteen months in which to investigate the matter; and, as a fact, inquiry into Tariff anomalies was begun immediately after the passing of the Tariff of 1907-8. Inquiry has proceeded continuously ever since; and, under the cirare cumstances, this proposed revision of the Tariff should have been submitted, at the very latest, at the beginning of this session. Its introduction at this late hour is unfair both to the industries concerned and to the members of this Parliament; and it is particularly unfair to the people of the outlying States. In Victoria, when a revision of the Tariff is introduced, those engaged in the industries affected are able, in a day or two, to come here and interview members personally; but the case is very different with Western Australia and Queensland. I doubt whether in the northern State the people have yet realized . that the new Tariff is in operation. In Brisbane the fact may be appreciated, but those concerned in the tropical industries far north and west, may not understand the effect of the new proposals for weeks to come.",36
164,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Did they not get notice that the Tariff was to be submitted?,36
165,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The only notice was that in the Governor General'= speech, to the effect that Tariff revision was receiving consideration. And when we are given any information it is in the form of the schedule now before us. It was introduced only about a fortnight ago; and we are plunged immediately into a discussion of how it affects related industries-ho w industries may be handicapped by the taxation of their raw materials, and a multitude of otner phases. It is utterly impossible to expect anything of suBstance to be done in the time at our disposal. If honourable members would honestly slate their minds they would declare that, until the Minister explains each of the items and its effect, they are not in a position to form any final opinion upon all the varied subjects submitted. I franky admit that I approach this question considerably, handicapped in the absence of any material on which to come to a conclusion. How can honourable members be omniscient in regard to the importations and manufactures of a continent? The Minister is not able to give us that fair judicial determination suggested by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, with whose utterances I find myself very much in agreement. That honourable member declares that what is required for the discussion of the Tariff is the judicial determination by some body empowered. to make investigation ; and I am sure that honourable members on both sides would welcome a non-partisan inquiry of the kind carried out on some definite principle. In this connection I should like to refer honourable members to the experience in the United States. There the Republican party as protectionists set themselves to define some definite guiding principle for the Tariff, and this is what they arrived atIn all Tariff legislation the true principle of Protection is best maintained by the imposition of such duties as will equal the difference the cost of production at home and abroad, gether with a reasonable profit to American dustries. That, I think, is a principle that would guide any judicial body which set itself to investigate Australian industries on tective lines. We have to consider the States. cost of production abroad and in Australia, the relative wages paid, and forth. As soon as Congress met in 1909 was sought to apply this principle, with the result that great difficulties were with - Where had the information to be obtained ? How could Congress investigate the cost of production abroad? means was there of estimating that cost, even within her own borders? Congress then turned to a suggestion, which has made in Australia before, to appoint non-partisan judicial body to make an vestigation. Australia, as a whole, has decided on a protective policy; and question is now the fair and just tion of that policy in the interests concerned.",36
166,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Claim s ought submitted to a tribunal before which jectors can come.,37
167,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Possibly ; and in United States the suggestion was to point a permanent non-partisan judicial commission. A proposal to that effect came before Congress, but, unfortunately, no definite Act was passed giving the complete powers desired. Congress contented itself with giving the President authority to appoint persons to assist him in the application of the maximum and minimum provisions of the Tariff and in the administration. This was followed by the appointment of the Tariff Board, consisting of Mr., Emery as chairman, and Messrs. Reynolds and Saunders as members. This arrangement, though] not so complete as that intended, represents a considerable step forward in the direction of an investigation, for the first time in the history of the United States, on definite scientific lines. The members of this Tariff Board have travelled abroad in their search for information; and certainly, if local industries are confronted with serious competition from over the seas, such an investigation comes within the scope of a body of the kind. In the discussion of the Tariff here we have vague statements of an ex parte character from one side or the other as to wages and conditions abroad; - and it was with a knowledge of this that between the late Government proposed to hand over to the duty of investigation to the Inter-State inCommission, which is contemplated by the Constitution.",37
168,Mr ARCHIBALD,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The Inter-State Compromission does not do this work in the United,37
169,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"That is so, but the late so Government proposed to ask the Inter-State it Commission to do it in Australia. As a matter of fact, the Inter-State Commission met in the United States does make investigations in relation to transport and other phases of trade and commerce, and the late GovernWhat ment proposed to empower the Australian Inter-State Commission to inquire as to the way in which various organizations carried been on their operations. Certainly the Intera State Commission, as suggested, would inhave had all the necessary powers of adjudication and administration, seeing that the it would be able to call witnesses, and applicawould preserve trade secrets, and so of all forth. Under our Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the President of the Court to be is empowered to keep such matters .obsecret if necessary. The honourable member for Hindmarsh very properly pointed the out that in dealing with the Tariff we aphave not only to regard the putting on or taking off of duties ; we must consider dustries in their relation to other industries pairs. and to trade and commerce generally. We can, under the Constitution, give later-State Oarnrnission definite powers with respect to trade and commerce, and if it had been given the powers that we suggoing .gested it would have been quite able sist us in that respect. We were quite preinformed pared to entrust the Inter-State Commission ithardly with powers of admrnistration and adjudirepresents cation in relation to trusts and combinaTariff tions, which are really the particular form of action in relation to trade and commerce by which the consumer is most affected. Had the .scheme we proposed been carried out honourable members on both sides would have had all they have been asking for this debate.",37
170,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Why did you not carry it out?,38
171,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The electors were against it.,38
172,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Excus e me.,38
173,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable member and those with him were against us.,38

175,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The Bill was introduced in the Senate.,38
176,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,And deliberately dropped there.,38
177,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I do not wish to go into controversial matters, but during the few months we were in office we passed corresso pondingly as much useful legislation as was action. passed in any preceding session. We could not accomplish everything. Will the honbefore orable member for Gippsland find fault with the present Government because in the four months of this session they have not carried out everything they promised in jGovernor-General's speech?",38
178,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,No ; but I find fault,38
179,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Of course, the honourable member will not find fault with them; but I must not continue that theme. I believe honourable members opposite will ultimately - come round to the idea of the appointment of a Tariff board ",38

181,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I recognise that the hon the - orable member has just as much ability the Age has. We are all agreed regarding the necessity of this tribunal. Our ficulty is that the Government now ask us - to deal with a Tariff schedule which inpossibly create more anomalies than it re,38
182,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,A good reason for the leaving it alone this session.,38
183,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I say that if you are to do it, it should be done thoroughly. to asThis in only patchwork, and we are tentatively, or by suggestion, that is only a first instalment. Perhaps it is fair to ask the Minister whether it his complete programme of reforms? So defective is the information supplied to us, that we are not even .given the statistical returns showing the amount of importations in the case of each industry. The Minister proceeded in a very proper way when dealing with the in sugar industry, which is affected by the Customs and Excise duties. He appointed a Commission to inquire into all its ramifications, and it will take that body nearly nine months to finish its task. ' The method of procedure in that case was that of judicial investigation and determination in order to .give the House the requisite knowledge to enable it to act with understanding. That is the right way to go to t work; but this Tariff is simply thrown upon the table, with the most fragmentary explanation by the Minister, and members have to express opinions upon it very tentatively, or wait until the Minister is pleased to explain which of the items are anomalies and which have a Protective incidence, and what industries, if any., are languishing as to necessitate immediate All that sort of thing has to be dealt with on the spur of the moment just we go to a division. This puts us at a .great disadvantage, and I hope the Minister will try during the recess to devise a .scheme by which the House will be able in the future to legislate on these matters with knowledge, and not in the dark as we are now doing.",38
184,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Gippsland) [3.20] - It is needless to say that, being a thorough believer in the policy of Protection, I am very dissatisfied that we have not had a complete revision of the Tariff'this session. At the time. I recognise that it is of no use to cry over the matter at this stage of the session, and that we must 'be thankful for small mercies we have received in the as Tariff now before us. I cordially endorse the hope of the Leader of the Opposition, difwho spoke, no doubt, for himself and not for his party, that there will foe a thorough may - revision of the Tariff next session.",38
185,Mr ROBERTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"He said he spoke for his party, but they have all denied it.",39
186,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Eve n if he said so, we all know that he could not speak for his party on the fiscal issue. It is interesting that several Free Trade members on the Opposition side have stated that they recognise that Protection is the settled policy of the country. At the same time. I hope that Protectionists will not be lulled by those remarks into any false sense of security, because the honourable member for Parkes, for instance, afterwards said he hoped in his day to see Australia practically return to a revenue Tariff. If the honourable member has such a hope, he will, no doubt, endeavour to give effect to it. It simply means that the Protectionists have to trust to themselves and not to Free Traders in the administration of the Tariff, or in giving effect to the policy of Protection.",39
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable member is trusting to a Free Trade Administration just now.,39
188,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member must know that I am quite as dissatisfied with the fact that there are Free Traders on this side as with the fact that there are Free Traders on that. But the present Government are doing a little, whereas the last Government did nothing. They told us that they would deal with Tariff anomalies, but they did not do it, and had they remained in power we should have still been in the same position. Something has been said about the appointment of a board, but we must be very careful how we hand over the government of the country to board after board. If we do, there will be no necessity for Parliament at all. While a Tariff board might be able to gather a good deal of information, I should like to know where their duties would begin and end. The honourable member for Darling Downs spoke of a. non-partisan judicial commission, but no one imagines that we could obtain any non-partisan board on the fiscal question. Every man who becomes a member of it will be originally a Free Trader or a Protectionist. What is the board to do? Is it to follow the American idea, which, by the way, the American Board did not carry out? Is it to inquire into all the minute details, comparing the effect of one duty with another, and then go to other countries to take evidence? I could quite understand a Free Trader supporting such a proposal, because it would simply mean that we should never have any revision of. the Tariff. How much of the evidencegathered by the board would be placed before the House? We are told that its to note members should be at liberty to take evidence on oath, and be sworn to a certain amount of secrecy; but is not that just the trouble with the present Minister ? Did not the honourable member for Ulawarra attack him last n^ght on that very ground? The honourable member asked, "" Where is the evidence on which the Minister hasbrought in this Tariff?"" The reply was that the Minister had obtained it confidentially, and the honourable member then asked: ""Are we not to hear it ? "" The same thing would be said when the Tariff board brought in its report. All that the board would do would be to bring in certain findings, and we should never be able to see the most important part of the evidence taken by them. If the Government accepted thefindingsof the board, we should have everybody who was dissatisfied with them hunting us in the lobbies and the halls, as they are doing now. I should be quite prepared to support the appointment of a board in order that it might get us some information, but I do not see how it is to take the place of this Parliament, or how it can take away from the Government of the day the responsibility of recommending a Tariff to this Parliament, or take away from this Parliament the responsibility of passing it through.",39
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,No one has suggested that.,39
190,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If we are to canvass and dispute the findings of the board, and are to have people waiting upon us to lay before us evidence that those findings are incorrect, while we cannot get the confidential evidence which enabled the board to make those findings, where are we to get finality ? I am sorry the honourable member for Darling Downs is not present, because I wish to refer to the question of the Inter-State Commission, regarding which I interjected, when he was speaking, "" Why did not your Government appoint it?"" The honourable member for Lang and others have spoken about what the Opposition proposed to do in vesting the I'nter-StateCommission with the powers of a Tariff' board. Why, then, did they not appoint the Inter-State Commission? That has been my puzzle to this day, and I have never heard it solved. The previous Government not only failed to deal with the Tariff, and even with anomalies, but they did not appoint this precious Tariff board or Inter-State Commission, which is the only means they can propose for settling Tariff matters. The honourable member for Darling Downs said, in reply to my interjection, as did the honourable member for Lang, that they were defeated at the elections. I am referring to the time when they were in power before the elections, with majorities in bodi Houses, and passing anything they liked, while curtailing all discussion by the use of the "" gag."" What is the-use, then, of their saying they could not appoint the Inter-State Commission? The Inter-State Commission Bill, which provided for all the things for which they say they want to provide now, was read a first time in the Senate on the motion of the honourable member for Kooyong, who was then a senator, and Vice-President of the Executive Council, on the ist October. On the 6th October he moved the second reading, and fully explained its principles. It was then debated for one hour and forty-five minutes. On the 13th October it was further debated for three hours thirtyeight minutes, and on the 14th October it was considered from 6.13 p.m. until the Senate suspended its sitting at 6.30 the same night. After that it was never heard of , although Parliament sat until the 8th December-two solid months. Plenty of important matters were in the meantime forced through both Houses, by the Government then in power by the use of their majority and the ""gag,"" yet this Bill was never touched. What is the good of their saying that they could not have put it through if they liked? If they were sincere or earnest in what they say today, the Inter-State Commission would have been an accomplished fact in 1909, but they did not pass the Bill, and now they tell us, ""We would have done it if we had been returned to power after the elections."" Judging by what happened that year, if they had been returned to power we should have been no further forward than we are. I mention these facts because I am tired of hearing of what they are going to do. It is useless to prolong the present discussion. We cannot cure the position, but must deal with the proposals before us. The honourable member for Darling Downs said that the schedule is so unsatisfactory that we might as well leave it alone, to which two pronounced Free Traders on this side of the House said, "" Hear, hear."" They are in favour of any course that means leaving the Tariff alone. I agree Mr Wise. that the schedule is unsatisfactory, but we ..must either make the best of it or throw it aside. Personally, I am thankful for small mercies, and I shall be very much surprised if next session a thorough revision of the Tariff is not proposed. When that revision has been made, the Inter-State Commission can be appointed, with authority to watch and investigate the operation of the Tariff, so that in the future Parliament may have more information. To-day we are dealing with the Tariff as we have dealt with former Tariffs, introduced when some of - those who are now in Opposition were in power. This Government has not acted differently from its predecessors.",39
191,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"We admitted the difficulty, and we wished to remove it.",40
192,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The intention was never carried out.,40
193,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable member recognises the need for what we proposed?,40
194,Mr WISE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"It would be advantageous to have more information, but Parliament cannot shift its responsibilities on to a commission. It is not to be expected that the finding of any commission or board will be accepted as absolute by Parliament or the people.",40
195,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Wentworth) [3.35] - The honourable member for Gippsland is always interesting upon these occasions, because he can always be counted on to hide the reasons why he supports a Government which is doing nothing by asserting that if the other party were in power it would do nothing. I shall not address myself to this question from a party stand-point, because its consideration breaks up the normal party divisions. On the Government side, the most intelligent member of the Ministry claimed, a year or two ago, to be a Free Trader. Other Ministers, only less intelligent, have similarly described themselves, while others again are Protectionists. We have the same differences amongst the rank and file, getting down to those who, like the honourable member for Melbourne, proudly vaunt themselves as prohibitionists. On the Opposition side, different Tariff views are held, but the opinions are not so extreme. Here there are no such wild prohibitionists as the honourable member for Melbourne announced himself to be, and none so hopeless of Government action as to suggest, as do Ministerialists, that it is impossible under the existing Constitution to do anything in regard to Tariff management. Some honourable members who are normally sane become mad at the mention of the exorbitancy or insufficiency of a duty. I do not claim that nothing can be done to develop industry by means of a Tariff. You can get almost anything done, if you pay for it, though it is rarely worth paying excessive prices. For that reason, I have always resisted the proposals of prohibitionists and high Tariffists, and see no reason at this juncture to alter my attitude. The discussion on a Tariff is sometimes made an opportunity to denounce the country in which we live as incapable of anything, or to denounce that Old Country from which our people have sprung as decaying, because of its faulty fiscal system. I am an Australian, and hope much from its development and increasing prosperity. infinite faith in the natural ability of our citizens to increase our resources without the assistance of the heaven-sent legislators to be found in this Chamber; and I ami proud that my people came from that tight little kingdomi, which hag done more than any other country for the spread of civilization. On recently visiting it again, I realized that it is not decaying. Its people are as keen, as active, and as able as those of the country which we have the honour to represent, and the level of its parliamentary and Ministerial Intelligence is quite as high as ours. Great Britain's industrial and commercial development and social organization is superior in many respects to ours.  submerged tenth, or submerged sixth, as it ought to be called ? Mr KELLY , - I ' do not think that its submergence is due to fiscal considerations, seeing that the people of Great Britain, as a whole, are the most prosperous nation on the face of the earth.",40
196,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the schedule.,41
197,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"My excuse for referring to the condition of Great Britain is that similar discussions have been permitted by you, sir, without question. «",41
198,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member must hot reflect on the Chair. Whenever an honourable member has 'gone beyond the limits of an incidental reference to a subject which is irrelevant, I have drawn his attention to the fact. Mr KELLY,-The honourable member for Melbourne last night spoke for forty minutes almost wholly upon such subjects as that on which I have just touched. It is difficult to ascertain whether this schedule has been introduced for the protection of industries', or the increasing of the revenue. There are proposals for increasing the protection of highly successful industries, while other proposals jeopardize industries. I believe that no Ministry will ever be able to pass what has been spoken of as a scientific Tariff. Three Tariffs have been passed since I became a member of the House, but never before has a Tariff been introduced at the close of a session, Ministers having to rely on the shades of night to clothe their actions in a suitable darkness - Hitherto Tariff discussion has been in the light of day. Measures involving I have the taxation of the people have never before been forced through in such a manner as to make it impossible for their criticism to be heard and felt. Parliaments are not fitted to deal properly with Tariff revision. Especially can this be said of a Legislature in which every member is paid, and in which Tariff questions must be considered largely in the light of votes. An industry may be important to the country, and yet have few votes, whilst another, absolutely unimportant to the country, may have manyvotes. What happens in such circumstances ? We find that the industry having the votes gets the most Protection/ whilst the industry that has the greatest claim upon the country gets none. Mr HIGGS.^What industry is that?",41
199,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"When I 'want to be buried I shall appeal to the honourable member for help,, but until then I hope that he will allow me to proceed.",41
200,Mr HIGGS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,There is no wit in that remark.,41
201,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member, by constantly interjecting, has been trying to turn my remarks into a little pleasantry. I am anxious to make them as brief and as useful as possible, and I shall be much obliged",41
202,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Order !,41
203,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If you, Mr Chairman, will see that I have a fair run. The existing Tariff proves conclusively the truth of the remarks I have just addressed to the Chair. Some people hold that Protection is right in principle, while some hold that it is wrong, but if we are going to have Protection it should be commenced on scientific lines. It is of no use seeking to do things for the country in this regard, unless you start from the absolute basis of the raw material. The existing Tariff does not start on that basis. Looking through its innumerable items, one finds countless items dealing, for instance, with the iron and machinery trades, and yet the machinery trades are importing almost every pig of iron used in these protected industries ! The machinery trades employing men in handling iron imported from oversea can bring influence to bear upon these great Australian patriots, who now talk of prohibition, to make them keep a duty off pig iron, because pig iron from oversea, if you please, is the raw material of the Australian ironworker 1 In the same way we find the man who is working in woollen mills-and in my humble judgment the wool of Australia ought to, and would under natural cond'tions, leave Australia's shores in finished form-gettin g 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, on the product of his labour, whilst evervthing that he has to huv-fro m hoots and clothing for himself, and swaddling-clothes for his children, down to coffins for his parents-is taxed at infinitely higher rates. Thus, on the net balance we find that by giving 40 per cent, duties on everything that a woollen worker wants, and 25 per cent, on the product of his toil, we are actually hampering one of the great industries within the Australian Commonwealth ! Generally speaking, we find throughout the Tariff what I might call the raw materials of the worker-hi s actual living necessities-invariabl y taxed up to the hilt. Tn the proposals now submitted to us, not only is there no provision for the alleviation of that position, but we are to go a little further down the bad road of unscientific Protection, along which we have hitherto travelled. In the past, I believe an effort-if I may associate that term with the honourable member for Hume-ha s been made to arrive at a scientific Tariff. The honourable member for Hume brought in. the existing Tariff, and I am the more ready to believe that there was, perhaps, something sensible in it, because he had such infinite difficulty in explaining it to the Committee of those days. If it was a perfect instrument, as first introduced, it had - certainly ceased to be anything better than a mere nest of anomalies by the time it left this Chamber. That was due to the fact that the same persons were not dealing with the Tariff from the time that it was introduced until it left our charge. Honor- Mr Kelly. able members who are new to this business will see the same thing occur again in connection with the schedule now before us. Afull Committee deals with one item, and the will of the Committee is therefore obtained in regard to' it.. On the next item, which, perhaps, is closely related to it, however, a catch division is. taken-and so the clumsy machinery of Government control of Tariffs goes stupidly upon its way. The pressure sought to be exercised by mere voting strength upon what ought to be the national intelligence of this Chamber blocks a scientific Tariff in one direction; and parliamentary methods of procedure have blocked a scientific Tariff in another. In my humble judgment we shall never obtain from a House of Parliament anything approaching a scientific Tariff, even if the whole of the people of Australia unanimously declares that Protection is the only salvation of this country. This question needs to be dealt with by a board whose whole business in life it shall be to examine into what industries require; a board that can be relied upon not to divulge trade secrets; whose integrity can be relied upon not to give undeserved profits to manufacturers at the expense of the people, and whose fairmindedness can be relied upon not to be swayed by mere hatred of oversea products. Such a board would inquire constantly into what was necessary if we wanted Protection for some of the industries of the Australian people. Such a board would send out a Tariff based upon an analysis of human reason, and not Tariffs as those now submitted to us aremere playthings of party prejudice and catch divisions in this House. This Tariff is, in a sense, something worse than anything we have had before. It is a small, puny thing, but is handled worse than any Tariff has been dealt with in the memory of honourable members. It has been introduced practically without explanation. The Minister is unable to tell us whether the industries helped really require these duties; he is unable to tell us whether the industries helped merit that help, or whether the men operating them are observing - good conditions 'of labour and paying good wages. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - He will tell us that later on.",41
204,Mr K ELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"After we have dealt with the Tariff? That is the way honourable members opposite have of dealing with public business, and it shows a contemptuous disregard of the possibilities of this House as a debating chamber.",42
205,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member is not in order in referring to honourable members as showing a contemptuous disregard for the House. - Mr KELLY . ^ - Then, to prove my complete obedience to your wishes, sir, I shall say that the Government sought to show its tremendous appreciation of the high dignity Of Parliament; its overwhelming sense of responsibility as His Excellency's advisers in this Chamber, and its extraordinary sense of the eternal fitness of things, by introducing, this Tariff Bill without any explanation whatsoever ! We now have the promise of the honourable member for Robertson Mr W. J. JOHNSON - I did mise; I only anticipated that .the items would be explained when we came to deal with them individually.",43
206,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member anticipates, but cannot promise, that after the whole matter has been dealt with we shall have an explanation from the Minister. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - I said that the Minister would, I supposed, explain eachitem as we came to it.",43
207,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,That is where the honourable member is wrong. 1 suppose the Chairman will keep the Minister just as strictly to each item as he is now keeping me to the second-reading consideration of. the Tariff.,43
208,Mr HIGGS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,B e respectful to the Chair.,43
209,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If the Chairman keeps the Minister religiously to the consideration of the item immediately before the Chair, how shall we be able to understand how one item is inter-related with another, as we should have been if the proposals had been dealt with now as a whole. I am willing to discuss the items seriatim later on, but if the honourable member for Robertson finds in this Tariff schedule before us two items, one of which relates to the finished product and the other to the raw material of the finished product, surely he will want to know from the Minister--and we ought to know now-ho w those two proposals affect each other. The Minister in introducing the Bill , should have taken it item by item, and have said, "" We want a duty on this item, but not on such and such an item, which is the raw material of the finished product covered by such and such another item,"" and in that way he could have run broadly through the whole gamut of human industry represented in theseproposals. Asit is, the Minister will not be able to give us later on - a comprehensive explanation of every separate item in this Tariff in such a way as to commend' it to equity, and; I tRink I may say, without offence, to good conscience. The honourable member for Capricornia, who is so persistently interrupting, was at one time in a position of some prominence in another place. Since then, he has consistently endeavoured to outrage every standing order of this House, and to prevent honourable members from proceeding with this debate.",43
210,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What has that to do with this question ? The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. not proCHANTER) - The honourable member must not refer to what occurred in another place.,43
211,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I quite agree with you, sir, but I have every right to expect you, and especially the Minister in charge of the measure, to assist me by discouraging not reasonable interjections, but the zoological noises coming - from the honourable member for Capricornia. I do not mind interjections, especially from the Chair The TEMPORAR Y. CHAIRMAN - I ask the honourable member to discuss the Tariff.",43
212,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If permitted, I shall be only too happy to do so. The proposals before us are of many different kinds, and we seem to have tumbled into this business without any close investigation. Only this morning, I was inquiring why the Government proposed to place a tax on the tyres of the bicycles used by the members of the Australian Workers Union?",43
213,Mr HIGGS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"How "" about motor-car tyres ?",43
214,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The motor-car tyres are not so much affected, because, the. poundage gets smaller as the tyres become heavier. I naturally thought that, before the Government tried to place, say, an additional 150 per cent, of the duty, at current prices, on the tyres used by the members of the Australian Workers Union, they would have found out whether the industrywas languishing and required assistance. So far as I can find out from the public press and from the Stock Exchange list,, there seems to be no ground for that apprehension, for the big company manufacturing tyres in Australia has recently increased its capital, and is doing very well. One lot of £ r shares in the Dunlop Rubber Company is quoted, sellers 27s. and buyers 26s. 3d.; cumulative preference £1 shares at 35s. od.; and deferred cumulative preference £1 shares, buyers 27s. od., and sellers 28s. od. It would appear, therefore, that the company is making reasonable profits. I desired to know what share in the Australian trade was being done by this company, and I ascertained that some 20 per cent, of the tyres used here for motors, and over 80 per cent, of the bicycle tyres, are made locally. If we suddenly increase the duty, not by a straight-out ad valorem duty, but by the devious poundage means proposed, I suppose an opportunity will be afforded for honourable members opposite to pretend to their supporters in the Australian Workers Union that the duty has not really been raised, although this monopoly will practically be given vastly enhanced profits. This is a company of which we ought to be proud, but it is not necessary to load its shareholders up with wealth at the expense of the Australian people, and especially of the members of the Australian Workers Union. I made further inquiries, and found that the company does business beyond the Commonwealth. I was unable to obtain the information I desired in regard to the prices of bicycle tyres, but I can submit some comparisons in relation to motor tyres. These will show conclusively that the company can export and pay freight and sell motor tyres in New Zealand at a much less price than they ask in Australia. Why could not the Minister have found out these simple facts for himself? The price-list shows that for one of the smaller tyres sold here at £5 7s. 6d. the people in New Zealand are asked to pay only £4 16s. 6d; for a tyre which costs here £7 4s. the New Zealand people pay £6 2s. 6d. Another tyre is sold here for £8 2s., and in New Zealand for £7 5s.; and a large tyre sold here for £10 7s. 6d. is sold there for £9. Perhaps the motor tube may give an indication of the possible comparative prices of the bicycle tyres. A small inner tube for a motor tyre is sold here at £1 12s. 6d., and in New Zealand for £1 11s. j another is sold here for £2 3s. 6d., and in New Zealand for £1 17s. 6d.; another is sold here for £2 3s. 6d., and in New Zealand for £2 os. 6d.; another is sold here for £2 15s,. and in New Zealand at £2 12s. I naturally wondered what had persuaded the .Government to give this deservedly successful company additional Mr Kelly. fits. I had heard it whispered about that the proprietors of the Age were very heavily interested in the Dunlop Company. I could not believe that a company of this standing would be a party to anything of the kind suggested, but I did know that my honourable friends opposite are burning with an anxiety to conciliate the Age. However, I tendered my shilling, and examined the share register of the company; and I am glad to be able to inform honourable members that I do not think there is any justification for the rumour I have indicated. I did not look right through the share register, but I saw that one of the proprietors of the Age-the only one, I believe, who is a shareholder-hold s 5,500 shares. I cannot think that such a holding would in any way influence a man of his position with regard to the views of his newspaper.",43
215,Mr RILEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What are the shares worth ?,44
216,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Fro m 27s. to 35s.,44
217,Mr RILEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,That is worth considering.,44
218,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I do not desire to make any charge in connection with the matter. I was still curious, and I saw the secretary of the company. I asked him, "" What is the meaning of these duties ? '' and he replied, "" Well, we do not know."" Neither the 'board of directors nor the secretary had asked for the duty, or had made any representation in regard to them; and yet this tax is placed upon the backs of the bike riders of the Australian Workers Union. I commend that fact to the honourable member for Darling.",44
219,Mr SPENCE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The members of the union are not the only people who ride bicycles.,44
220,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"But they ride bicycles very consistently, and this duty will make their riding cost them a little more. If the company does not want the duty, and the facts do not appear to warrant it, why impose it? I presume that somebody has misled the Minister-that some "" expert "" on whom he reliecl has proved to be no expert. There must be some ground for the duty in the Minister's mind, unless the absence of grounds was the excuse he had for not addressing himself to the items when introducing the Tariff. The one item I have referred to shows the extraordinary carelessness with which these proposals are introduced. I find, further, that the Government propose, by means of this Tariff, to interfere pro- with the raw material of this industry-to dictate to the rubber factories throughout the world as to the condition in which they shall' send their finished article to Australia. An attempt is now being made to define some artificial difference in the types of rubber supplied by the various factories. Peruvian rubber usually comes out in a big round ball, and, though we do not know, that apparently is to remain untouched. Then there are what the Customs Department calls "" masticated "" rubber, and a rubber of a smoother type. This ""masticated"" rubber is prepared between rollers with rough edges, and hence the appearance which gives rise to its name, while the other is prepared between smooth rollers. The Customs Department has found out some extraordinary difference between the two, and is going to endeavour, by means of a duty, to arrange that all the rubber from the Straits Settlements shall pass through one patricular sort of rollers. I suppose that Australia takes under 1 per cent, of the total rubber output; and yet every factory in the world is to be called upon to install new and uniform machinery for the sake of a share of this 1 per cent. The thing is ridiculous! This is not only to the damage of an industry, but, worse of all, to the damage of an industry that is centred in Melbourne. Surely honourable members opposite will pause before they take such a step. Here is a deservedly successful industry, worthy the equitable consideration of this Chamber, and yet, owing to the inability of the Minister to acquire reliable information, to be hit through its raw material, while it is given a duty Which is not asked for, and which it does not need. I place this proposal before honourable members in all its native ugliness. Every single item of this Tariff must be carefully scrutinized if that is the way in which the Government have proceeded in regard to one which affects the members of the strongest union supporting my honourable friends opposite. Another extraordinary proposal is shown in the item of strawboard. Some 5,000 persons in Australia make their livelihood by manufacturing boxes and other articles of this material, and some fifty people, in what I may call the national city of the south, are engaged in making strawboard. I am told that the strawboard manufacturers cannot supply the orders they have now; but, because they live in the south, or, perhaps, because they happen to be in the Minister's constituency, this duty is to be imposed. There must be some reason, good or bad, for this item. We find now that 5,000 men are to be driven out of employment for the sake of fifty in the city of Melbourne.",44
221,Mr RILEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I think most of the 5,000 are women.",45
222,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"There must be some women, of course, for one of the features of all protected industries is the large number of women employed. I suppose that about the same proportion of the fifty employees in Melbourne are women.",45
223,Mr RILEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,They are mostly boys.,45
224,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"My honourable friend will, I hope, give us a lead on the subject of strawboard when the details are reached. We find the same sort of foolishness in connection with white pine, and even the realm of music is not left untouched. We are to have a big duty on talking machines, which is arrant selfishness on the part of my honourable friends. They are flourishing here without any protection at the hands of the State, and they might have left untouched these talking rnachines which, after all, are almost as necessary to the man in the back blocks as is the telephone which we have heard ought to be laid on to every settler's door. The Government are going to make gramophones, pianos, and other things which tend to solace the settler's evenings after the labour of the day, more difficult it is for him to obtain. In their anxiety to get a catch vote or two, ' they have actually invaded the sacred sphere of art. Pictures are to be prevented from coming here. This question of artists' productions is really most amusing. The item previously read: "" Pictures, n.e.i., including Scripture cards of all descriptions, Free."" Now it is to read: "" Pictures, n.e.i., including Scripture cards, Free. Oil and water colour paintings other than those by Australian students, 25 per cent."" The best of our artists have gone abroad to study, and the Government are going to prevent their works being sent to Australia. We are to have here only the works of art of the Sydney Bulletin and of the Labour weeklies! This is surely another bribe for support, but I cannot understand the proposal from - the point of view of the public interest. Why should we keep out pictures? How are we to have standards of comparison if we cannot have free imports of pictures? The Government are going to stifle art, which is now in its infancy in Australia, by keeping out the pick of the world's productions, including the works of Australian artists abroad.",45
225,Mr DEAKIN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The Victorian Artists' Society have protested against' it.,46
226,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"There has also been great trouble in Sydney, where it was intended to hold an exhibition of the works of Lambert, Streeton, Tom Roberts, and other Australian artists living abroad. All these are. have been held up by this laudable anxiety to benefit the artistic productions of the Sydney Bulletin, and will have to be sent back to Europe unless the proposed duty is taken off. I have not gone generally into the items of the schedule, because I refuse point blank to do so at this stage, until we have had from the Minister some explanation of how their effects are inter-related. I have shown conclusively that the Minister is imposing duties which have not been asked for by any Australian industry, that he is detripower mentally affecting Australian industry by means of some of his proposals, and that Parliaments generally, and this Parliament under present management in particular, are not capable of giving the country a scientific Tariff. I appeal now to the Government and to the Committee to say that the next Tariff introduced must give us the combined wisdom of persons specially appointed to consider the needs of Australian industries. I appeal to the Committee to see that the Australian people have a chance to realise that their Tariffs must not be the mere playthings of catch divisions and party prejudices in this Chamber, or of influences even less worthy. The whole question must be looked into scientifically and seriously, and the result of the investipracticable gation must be placed before the Australian people. The policy of this country has been declared by an overwhelming majority to be Protectionist, and I appeal to honourable members, if they wish to give effect to the people's will, to give effect to it sanely, after mature, impartial, expert consideration, and not in the ineffective, helpless, htipeless manner in which these proposals have been submitted by the Government.",46
227,Mr SPENCE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Darling) [4.23] - If this debate convinces the Government that it would be very unwise to touch the Tariff at all next session, the time may not be wasted.",46
228,Mr DEAKIN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Why not ? We shall have plenty of time next session.,46
229,Mr SPENCE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I am opposed to touch* ing the Tariff at all until we can do justice all round. I am not surprised at the atiiture of ithe Opposition when we remember the names of the gentlemen who took a hand in welding them together. Naturally, the manufacturers, having secured a very fair Protectionist Tariff, and having rendered new Protection unattainable, are quite content and happy with things as they It is not on that ground that 1 oppose dealing with the Tariff. We have learnt, since the Tariff of 1907-8 was introduced, that the Constitution does not give us power to protect the workers or the consumers, and that there are in existence monopolies, combines, honourable understandings, and similar schemes, which those who have the control of industries, and make things to sell, use in order to fleece and exploit the public, who, of course, include the wage-earners. I am opposed to touching the Tariff any more until we have to do all that Parliament can do to deal with the wages of workmen. Under present arrangements, I do not think we have power to do that properly, even by means of the State machinery. It has been said that the State tribunals should control wages; but I do not think that fair competition can be assured between manufacturers, except by a Federal tribunal. We want to give our Federal Arbitration Court power to deal with industries in the Federal sense. Those who want to prevent that Court being clothed with the powers which we seek to give it, and which the Constitution at present denies to it, always propose some other method. The Opposition now favour the appointment of an Inter-State commission ; but their scheme in that regard is imand unworkable, and not a live issue. We have the machinery of the Arbitration Court, which is well fitted to cope with that kind of work; but, at present, the Judge, able and fair as he undoubtedly is, is hampered by constitutional limitations. We spent a great deal of time on the previous Tariff, which generally turned out to be very workable from the .Protectionist stand-point. Honourable members will remember that afterwards a list of anomalies, from the point of view of the Customs officials, was submitted. More recently, the present Minister of Trade and Customs invited those interested to furnish him with information and show him any anomalies which they .wished rectified. 1 understand that only about a hundred replies were received ; and now the Minister has brought in a measure which does not appear to have given satisfaction to anybody. We have had the usual circulars sent to us, containing ex parte statements from those interested persons who, whenever a Tariff is before the House, tell us that they are going to be ruined if additional duties are not imposed. Some of them, to judge by their balance sheets, .are not in very much danger of ruin. Others are opposing the imposition of additional duties j and, altogether, the schedule now before us seems so unsatisfactory, that probably it is the most uncomfortable kind of measure that any. Minister could take charge of. Fortunately, both the Opposition, and members on this side, seem to have great faith in the Minister's ability to explain things. They confess that they do not understand the items, and. expect the Minister to explain every one of them satisfactorily as they are reached. Probably the Minister will be able to satisfy them. I have been surprised to hear some honourable members on this side apparently advocating the revision of the whole Tariff before we obtain power to deal with the many evils that undoubtedly exist in regard to wages and conditions of labour generally. I do not admit that the imposition of a duty necessarily raises the cost of an article. When in the Old Country, which is allegedly Free Trade, I found very few things that were any cheaper than in Australia. Therefore, we may dismiss the statement that Tariffs raise prices and Free Trade reduces them, since they are determined chiefly by other factors. Whether wages be high or low, and whatever the duties may be, sellers try to make the highest profits they can obtain. Our endeavour should be to protect the worker from the practical reduction of his wages by the increase of prices. He should be paid his share of the value of the production of the industry in which he is engaged, and as a consumer should not be charged so highly for the commodities which he uses as to cause his wages to be materially reduced. I do not agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh about Courts having power to hear evidence regarding the profits of industries. Mr Justice Higgins has very properly declined to accept such evidence. Following other Judges, he has expressed the view that if an industry cannot pay fair and reasonable wages, it should close. Profits are to be considered in connection with the Tariff, when it may [^53] be shown that, owing to the high rate of duties, or to some combination, they are unreasonable. Parliament has now no power to deal with combines, and I am opposed to any alteration of the Tariff until the people give us the power to deal with them. According to the Minister, who made a long and elaborate explanation of the schedule, most of the proposed alterations are required to improve the administration of his Department. The debate may show that some of these alterations are unnecessary, and that the Tariff might very well remain as it is for a long while to come. My desire is that there shall be no alteration until Parliament can protect the workers and consumers, as well as the manufacturers. I shall be no party to legislation, which, while raising wages, say, is. directly, indirectly reduces them by 2s. 6d., and I hope that the Tariff will not be meddled with until the Constitution has been altered, so that we can deal effectively with economic conditions generally.",46
230,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Moreton) [4.36] - A Government that is afraid to face the fiscal question is not worthy of the confidence of the people. Australia has declared for Protection, but the schedule now under discussion, has been introduced at the fag end of the session, when matters of great, though not of greater importance, have to be dealt with, and there is not sufficient time for its proper consideration. Had it been introduced earlier, we should have been able to obtain more information regarding its proposals, and had an advisory board, or commission, inquired into and reported upon Tariff reform, we could have had a Tariff revision which would have done justice to the subject. While I believe in Protection, I do not hold the view that duties must be imposed on everything. We have to consider, not merely the benefits to be obtained by an industry by the imposition of protective duties in its interest, but also whether those benefits counterbalance the injury done in some other directions. In a young country like Australia, Tariff revision must be a periodical thing, because we are making such advances that we soon outgrow any given set of conditions. The object of duties is to encourage industries, which must subsequently be protected. We are not now in a position to give the people a fair and square deal. I am pleased that Queensland is to obtain a modicum of Protection, and that those interested in the canning of f r u it will receive some consideration, but I regret that the great banana growing industry has been overlooked, and will be forced to continue to compete with F i j i , where labour is cheaper, one of the States having committed the un-Federal action of subsidizing a line of steamers to bring cheap fruit here from that country. The alteration of the flannelette duties is absurd. The object of the Minister is to prevent accidents from the use of inflammable material, but, with a duty of 35 per cent, on ready-made clothing, it will be cheaper to import it than to pay 20 per cent, on raw material to be made up here. The alteration of duties may prevent the importation of piece goods, but will not keep out made-up goods, and an article which is used by thousands of persons will be increased in cost by about 2d. a yard. I have been informed that it is possible to treat flannelette chemically with alum, borax, and other things, so that it will pass the departmental test, but that these things are injurious to health, and that after repeated washing the treatment is likely to prove ineffective, and of no protection to the wearers of flannelette. If flannelette were displacing flannel, then, in order to protect our woollen industry, I should be prepared to support the imposition of a duty on it. But notwithstanding this duty, which, on the average, will mean an increased price of 2d. per yard, people will continue to use flannelette, and will still be exposed to the danger of wearing this inflammable material. I believe, however, that as a result of this impost the people will turn their attention to imported flannelette garments instead of buying the raw material, or flannelette garments made up here. Prior to the introduction of this schedule, leather cloth was free. I do not object to the proposed duty of 20 per cent., but it is just as well that we should know what the duty means. I do not know that leather cloth is being manufactured in Australia, but I do know that it is largely used by local manufacturers of furniture, buggies, railway carriages, &c. Recently I asked the Minister of Trade and Customs a question relating to patent leather, but he sheltered himself behind the wording of my question. - Mr TUDOR - There has been no alteration in the duty on patent leather.",47
231,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"There is no such thing as patent leather in the schedule; but leather cloth, which is the same thing, is cluded.",48
232,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,It is not the same thing.,48
233,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I am credibly informed that a Melbourne firm, in anticipation of the introduction of this Tariff, has imported leather cloth of the value of £20,000.",48
234,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I shall be obliged if the honourable member will give me further information on the subject.,48
235,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I make no charge against the Department. I simply mention that it has come to my knowledge that a Melbourne firm has recently imported £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 worth of leather cloth, and that fact leads one to suspect that they knew something regarding the introduction of this schedule.",48
236,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Will the honourable member supply me with the name of the firm in question ?,48
237,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I shall be pleased to supply the honourable member with the name when I can ascertain it. I did not think that the Minister cared to supply me with the information for which I asked. When he told me that I was in error, and that patent leather was not touched by the Tariff, I thought that he was trying to evade answering my question.",48
238,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If the honourable member knows that a firm has done what he suggests, he has a right to mention it , and not to allow the matter to stand where it is.",48
239,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I do not intend to allow the matter to stand where it is. I should like now to ask the Minister why vinegar has been selected for special treatment. In 1910 we imported 271,000 gallons of vinegar, valued at 2s. 5d. per gallon. Adding the duty we find that the price is 2s. n d . per gallon, whereas, the price of locally-made vinegar is only is. 3d. a gallon. A great proportion of the vinegar used today is a by-product, and it does not appear, from the figures I have quoted, that the local manufacturers require further Protection, seeing that the local article enjoys an advantage of something like 100 per cent, in price as compared with the price of the imported article. A duty of 6d-. per gallon is almost equal to 50 per cent, on the price of the local product, and I fail to understand why it should have been thought necessary to make this further imposition. The duty in the schedule now before us will not prohibit the importation of vinegar. It is not likely to reduce the quantity now coming in. It in- will simply act as a revenue duty, and will not benefit the local manufacturers, seeing that they did not take advantage of the old Tariff to increase their prices. Webster, of Brisbane, who are largely interested in the vinegar trade, have written to me protesting against this increased duty; whilst Mr Thurlow, who is a large manufacturer, does not approve of it. do not think that the re-arrangement of the timber duties is satisfactory. DD should be omitted, and should be bracketed with sub-item x. I should like to know what ""spokes in the rough"" means?",48
240,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I have a revised wording of the sub-item, which. I think, will clearly explain what is meant by the use of the words "" in the rough.""",49
241,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I am pleased to hear that the item is to be revised, because it appears to me that, under the schedule as it stands, spokes which have even been subjected to the sand-papering process might still be regarded as "" spokes in the rough."" Then the proposed duty on the lines included in paragraphs 2 and 3 pf sub-item D, which cover felloes and rims of hickory, should be at least 15 per cent. These felloes and rims can be made in the Commonwealth in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of the whole trade, and I do not think that a duty of 15 per cent, is too much to ask in support of an industry which has to work under Wages Board conditions ",49
242,Mr HEDGES,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Can we obtain hickory here?,49
243,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"There is plenty of hickory in Australia, and local firms are prepared to cater for the trade if they receive anything like reasonable protection. Considering that many of the industries which use spokes, felloes, and rims as their raw material are protected by duties ranging from 25 to 35 per cent., they should not object to the manufacturers of this class of hardware being protected to the extent of a duty of 15 per cent. At the very least there should be a duty of 10 per cent, in respect of imports from the United Kingdom, and a general Tariff of 15 per cent. I am afraid that the proposed alteration, making white paper dutiable, will lead to great hardship so far as many of the poorer classes are concerned. ' Mr TUDOR - There is no proposal for a duty on white paper.",49
244,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Whit e paper for printing is to be free under departmental regulations.,49
245,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Shoul d it be free when used for other than printing purposes? [i53]- 2 Tariff. [13 DECEMBER, IQII . ] Tariff. 4287",49
246,Mr SINCLAIR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If the printing trade Messrs. is to be considered in this way, why.should we not have regard to the claims of the hard-working man who needs white paper, commonly used for printing purposes, to wrap up meat? The newspapers I wrap up their wares in white paper, and the Government have decided that newspaper Sub-item proprietors shall be allowed to import that paper free under departmental by-laws. The provision in this schedule, however, will f all very heavily upon citizens using white printing paper for other purposes. It will mean that butchers, who find brown paper unsuitable for their requirements, will have to pay an increased price of about 5s. or 6s. per cwt. for the paper now USP H by them. Since this is the only class of paper dealt with in the schedule now before us, it is interesting to note the importations of paper under all other headings. According to the official statistics of Customs and Excise revenue in ioro, the importations of paper bags not printed, and which are dutiable at 8s. 6d. per cwt. under the preferential Tariff, were of the value of £ 1 2 , 6 5 4 ; £ 1 2 , 1 2 7 worth of bintting paper, dutiable at 4s. 6d. per cwt. under the preferential Tariff, was imported in 1910; whilst other imports of paper were as follow-Boards , coated, n.e.i., dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent., £ 1 5 , 6 7 9 worth; browns and sugar, f r u it bag paper, & c , dutiable at 5s. and 4s. 6d. per cwt., £ 8 9 , 7 5 4 worth; cardboard and pasteboard, dutiable at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and free in the case of imports from the United Kingdom, £ 2 0 , 6 9 9 worth; cartridge paper, dutiable at 5s. and 4s. 6d. per cwt., £ 7 , 3 0 3 worth; gummed paper, n.e.i., dutiable at 20 per cent., £ 4 , 3 3 0 worth; manufactures of paper, framed and unframed, having advertisements thereon, dutiable at 35 per cent., or 6d. per lb.. £ 5 9 , 2 5 7 worth; millboard, greyboard, leatherboard, Manilaboard. and woodboard, 5 per cent., and free, £ 3 6 , 7 7 4 worth; paperhangings dutiable at 20 per cent, arid 15 per cent., £6.1,701 worth; and printing paper, which was previously free, but which is now to be free subject to departmental by-laws, £ 7 3 1 , 1 9 6 worth. It will be seen that printing paper is very largely imported, but allowing for the enormous quantity which must be used by the daily newspapers, we find that the balance, compared with imports under other headings, is not such as to call for special attention unless the Minister can show that its importation is seriously affecting the manufacture of paper in the Commonwealth. That, so far, he has failed to do. Then, again, we find that in 1910 the importations of ruled and bordered paper, which was dutiable at 20 per cent., were only of the value of £ 8 6 . The duty on strawboard is, I think, is. 6d. per cwt., and there was imported £ 2 8 , 1 5 1 worth. On toilet-paper the duty is 25 per cent., and the quantity imported was £ 3 , 5 4 8 worth; on writing and typing paper, plain, in sheets, not less than 16 inches by 13 inches, the duty is 5 per cent, and free, and the importations represent £ 2 3 1 , 9 8 5 ; on paper n.e.i., including pulpboard, cloth-lined boards, cloth-lined paper, and floor paper, the duty is 20 and 15 per cent., and the importations represented £ 7 3 , 3 5 5 ; other paper is admitted at 5 per cent, and free, and the importations represented £ 1 1 5 , 6 5 8 . It will be seen from these figures that, notwithstanding the heavy duties, there are large importations, and that the white paper is not the serious competitor it is claimed to be, especially in view of the compensating advantages. It is evident that the paper mills of Australia are not yet capable of coping with the demand j and, if it is necessary to protect the mills against white paper, it will be necessary to protect them against other paper by increased duties all round. I am pleased to see that there are already two piano factories turning out splendid instruments, and, I understand, doing remarkably well. I am informed that, before there was any Protection at all, one of the firms managed to make a very decent return. I must say that I object to the fixed duties on pianos. If a man. can afford to buy an instrument at any price ranging from £45 to £100 he can well afford to pay an ad valorem duty; but there are many poorer people, who, perhaps, desire to have a piano, if only as a piece of furniture, at, say, £12, and they should not be called upon to pay an extra £6 or £7. I am a great believer in ail valorem duties, when they can be imposed without any serious difficulty in arriving at the values or in the collection. I have seen pianos exposed for sale at £6 in Melbourne; and-it is very hard that a poor person, who requires one of these, should have to pay an equivalent of the fixed duty. The only other item to which I desire to refer is one that does not appear in the schedule, but in regard to which some honourable member. may be Mr Sinclair. inclined to submit a proposal. I refer to cheese caps; and possibly each honourable member has received a circular dealing with this item.. Much as I am interested in all rural industries, particularly the dairying industry, I should not ask for any consideration that I would not support in the case of any other industry. There are factories in Australia manufacturing cheese caps at the present moment, and, amongst a few items of cotton goods which are protected, are cheese caps. These can be made with advantage here; and now it is proposed, I understand, by persons interested in obtaining a cheap article that the duty shall be removed. I hope, however, that, in all fairness, the duty will not be interfered with.",49
247,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Cook) [5.9] - I deny the statement that the last general election was fought on the issue of Free Trade and Protection, though I do not deny that some honourable members may have madeone or other policy the main plank of their platform, and have been returned to the House on the single issue. So far as my electorate is concerned the Tariff question was not raised to anything like the same prominence that other questions were; indeed, I cannot conceive of the Tariff being made the leading issue By members of the Labour party at a general election at any time. We are seeking to improve the position of the great bulk of the people, who are the workers; and we know that, under either Free Trade or Protection, they can be sweated, and have their conditions made most unpleasant. It would be foolish for honourable members on this side to imagine that there is any reality in that issue alone so far as the great bulk of the people are concerned. I admit that the fiscal question forms a subsidiary part of our general policy ; but I deny that at the general election it had any more prominence than had the nationalization of monopolies, the institution of a Commonwealth Bank, or the imposition of a land tax. As a matter of fact, we had just previously dealt with the Tariff exhaustively, and generally, satisfaction had, I think, been given to those clamouring for protection for industries said to be languishing. The proposal put forward by the Labour party was an absolutely national Tariff, based on new Protection. We were to take steps, side by side with the imposition of Customs duties, to provide that the workers should receive their share of Protection, and that consumers should be protected against the rapacity of combinations which were raising prices to the general community. The question was discussed on the Address-in-Reply and I stated my position then. In Hansard, of 8th July, 1910, page 224, I amthus reportedThe question of Tariff anomalies is, of course, - a non-party one. 1 do not wish to commit myself finally at this moment, because I may not have all the facts before me that I should have, - and the Ministry will perhaps have facts to put before the House, but I certainly do not feel favourable at this stage to any further Tariff Protection without new Protection. A number - of us voted for high duties throughout the recent Tariff discussions on the distinct understanding, - and indeed on a pledge given by the late Prime Minister, that new Protection was to be associated with the Tariff, and that otherwise the Tariff would not be carried. I , for one, feel inclined to refuse to give Protection to a small section of the people, who in turn deny it to the great bulk of the workers in their factories, and am inclined to resist to the utmost any further Tariff Protection unless it is associated with new Protection. That was the position I placed before mv constituents at the general elections of 1906 and 1910. I am sorry that this Tariff revision should have been introduced, since it seeks to re-open the Tariff generally. It is quite justifiable to introduce a measure for the rectification of anomalies as shown in the definitions, and so forth, which harass, not only importers, but the Customs officers in the administration of the Department. A pure machinery Bill, designed to reduce friction, is, of course, acceptable; but, so far as the present proposals go beyond that, I regret they have been submitted. First of all, I contend that there has been no demand for a re-opening of the Tariff; and I represent an electorate in which there are as many factories and factory workers as can be found in any other electorate in the Commonwealth. But I have not received a single request from my electorate for an increase of duty. I therefore conclude that my constituents do not want it, because I cannot believe that the manufacturers there are dead to their own interests. Tariff matters stir up the liveliest feelings in those upon whom they operate, and the experience of all Parliaments has been that manufacturers and importers are not slow to place their interests before honourable members. I take it, therefore, that there is no demand in my - electorate, nor do I believe there is any general demand in the country, for a general re-opening of the Tariff and a general increase of protective duties. I honestly believe that the revision of the Tariff now before us, so far as duties are increased by it, has come about through the influence of a certain paper in Melbourne, which is, as it were, hanging over the House, and slogging, away at this joss of its own.",50
248,Mr BAMFORD,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,You do not mean to say that the Ministry are influenced by that paper? I hope not.,51
249,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"There are members on both sides who take a little too much notice of the Melbourne Age. The,. Leader of the Opposition is certainly affected by it. It has only to publish an article pulling him to pieces, arid his knees begin to knock, and he runs in, wanting to know what can be done. So far as the daily press, which is absolutely antagonistic to the Labour party, influences the party, so far, I believe, the party is wrong. The best thing we can do is to "" paddle our own canoe,"" without any reference whatever to these journals. The Melbourne Age seems to have no cry but "" more Protection."" For every ill that affects the body politic, its remedy is the same. Of course, it has its followers in the community who think that if high duties are imposed everything is right with the world, and that if low duties are imposed everything is wrong with the world, and destruction stares us in the face. Peculiarly enough, this very paper which is clamouring for higher duties, and more of them, admits, in this morning's issue, that there is a shortage of labour, that the manufacturers cannot supply the market, and that we depend upon importations. Referring to textiles, item 106, wool and silk, and to the increased duties proposed on them, the Age says The importation of this class of goods from the United Kingdom alone amounted last year to 192,000. An additional duty,_of 5 per cent, may exercise some check on this vast influx of ready-made goods, but local manufacturers are doubtful on the point. Wages of tailors and dress makers have gone up considerably during the last year or two; in fact, it is impossible to get hands to supply all the demand. Importation is inevitable to supply the requirements of the market. If importation is inevitable for that purpose, the increase of duties on those goods simply means increasing the price to the general public.",51
250,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,There has been no increase of duty on that line.,51
251,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The Age says there is an increase of 5 per cent., but I have not checked it with the schedule. There are other duties in regard to the textile industry, but I know for a positive fact that the distributing houses in Sydney and Melbourne are two or three months behind in the receipt of their stocks from the manufacturers. Recently a Royal Commission inquired in New South Wales into the question of shortage of labour, and the manufacturers of Sydney stated before that body that it was impossible to secure labour to supply the local market. The honourable member-for Hume, who is an extreme Protectionist, and will vote for higher duties on any pretext whatever-h e feels like going down on his knees to worship the mere name of Protection-state d last night that Vicars Woollen Mills, at Marrickville, found it impossible to fill the demands made upon them by the business houses. With regard to the Parramatta Woollen Mills, Mr Sparks, the secretary of the Protectionist Association in New South Wales, informed me only recently that it was impossible for them to get labour to fill their orders for goods. He said it was of no use their taking any further orders; they could not go looking for business, because they had not the labour to manufacture the stuff. That is the general position today in Australia. I have said before, and say again, to our friends on the Labour side in politics, who have had their misgivings with regard to the introduction of desirable immigrants, that it is of no use for us to carry our feelings in the matter to an undue extent. We are compelled to acknowledge that there is in Australia at present a general shortage of labour. I admit that we find men out of work, but that is caused by our unscientific system of managing the labour market. We have no machinery to bring men who are out of work in touch with the work that is waiting for them to do. They have to lose time looking for it, but I honestly believe that there is anotherplace vacant for every able-bodied man and ordinary tradesman in Australia who is out of work.",51
252,Mr CANN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,There is no shortage amongst coal-miners; they are not working more than half time.,52
253,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I am not talking about a particular class of labour. In every country, no matter how prosperous, it is always possible to find a calling in that position; but in other directions there is a shortage of labour, and, if it suited the venience of coal-miners to take railway construction or other work of that description,, it is certainly available for them. It may not be suitable for them to do, but there is work available for those who are able to adapt themselves to conditions a little different from those to which they have been accustomed. On the 12th October of this year, Hansard, page 1370, I discussed the question of the shortage of labour, and took up the position that I take up now. I have pointed out to several honourable members of the extreme Protectionist type that in the textile industry the distributing houses cannot get their orders filled. I put the question yesterday to the; honourable member for Kooyong, and to one after the other of what I call the extreme Protectionists, who will vote for higher dutieswithout any justification, and they had no answer to it. In fact, it cannot beans wered. An increase of duty on those lines where manufacturers are unable to supply the local market means nothing but. raising the price to the users throughout Australia. The Minister of Trade and Customs asks me to point some out. I can refer him for the facts to my brother, who is connected with the London Stores down the road. I understand that the Minister admits that the factories in Australia really cannot supply the local market.",52
254,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I do not say that; but there has been.no alteration of duty in the line of which the honourable member speaks..,52
255,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I understood that there had been. My first point is that there has been no demand for the re-opening of the Tariff in the direction of .increased protection, and my second is that, if it is re-opened in the peculiar circumstances in which the manufacturers find' themselves in regard to the labour market, the only effect of increasing the duties must be to increase the price of commodities to the consumer. I disagree with the increasing of any protective duties at present, for the further reason that it is bad policy for the Labour party. At the last general 1 election we asked the country for authority to place upon the statute-book a thoroughly national Tariff on the basis of the new Protection. We said that if we could carry out the new Protection idea we wereprepared to give this country such a Tariff that the most extreme Protectionist would: never complain about it. Personally, I would have been prepared to go as far as absolute prohibition of those goods that con- we can manufacture, but, of course, the labour v-vild have to be supplied to> - enable the orders to be filled. Then, of 'course, I should have liked to see the revenue duties wiped out altogether. were returned oh our general programme, including that question, with an absolute - majority in both Houses, but soon found that we had not the authority under the - Constitution to give effect to the new Protection. We took the earliest opportunity - of submitting the matter to the electors at -.the recent referenda. It was a most unfortunate time for us, because it sent us off on an electioneering campaign in between the general elections.",52
256,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,You selected lime yourselves.,53
257,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"We were in such ;a hurry to give effect to our policy that we did not want to wait' until the next general election. We wanted the Constitution altered to enable us to give effect to the new Protection during the lifetime of sthe present Parliament. The referenda were defeated, and we know the factors that operated to secure that defeat. the light of that knowledge, we are not justified in increasing the old Protection. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were - spent by manufacturers in defeating the new Protection, and preventing the workers and cons.umers from sharing in the benefits - of the Tariff. If we increase duties under present conditions, we shall encourage the manufacturers to continue their fight against the new Protection. If they get all that they need from us now, they will, at the 'next election, spend the money obtained from the higher duties in bringing about the defeat of our policy. We should show them that their interests are linked with those of the general community. they find that they cannot get higher duties - unless they consent to the protection of the wage-earners and consumers, they will not oppose the alteration of the Constitution necessary to provide for it. Therefore, the proposed alteration of duties is a mistake - from the point of view of policy, as well as being without justification for other reasons. I am prepared to go before my constituents at the next election in advocacy - of a Tariff on new Protection lines. I do not feel upset because the referenda were - defeated in my electorate. I should prefer to be out of politics to having to legis'late 011 lines which I considered 'wrong. If the referenda vote represented the mature opinion of the people of Australia, and is confirmed at the next election, my opponent will probably succeed in winning the seat which I hold. We The appointment of a tribunal to investigate the claims for higher duties has been proposed,' and without committing myself to details as to constitution and powers, I am in favour of the proposal. Parliament is not capable of dealing on lines of equity and justice with alterations of duties, not because of want of intellectual capacity, but because its constitution prevents it from judicially examining the facts, and determining how alterations will affect industries generally. the Of course, Parliament must in the end be responsible for every Tariff. It cannot hand over its legislative power to a tribunal, and must be responsible for the exercise of that power. I should like to see the manufacturers placed in a position similar to that of the workers. They demand that bodies of workers, claiming increases of pay, shall submit their claims to a Court, and justify them by evidence, which is subject to cross-examination. The eviIn dence for and against is sifted by a Judge of expert training and judicial mind, and judgment given accordingly. Similarly, manufacturers asking for increases of duty should submit claims for judicial investigation. As things are, Parliament is told that industries are languishing, and workers out of employment, but no investigation of these ex forte statements is possible. We legislate, therefore, on lines of prejudice,, and not in accordance with evidence. - Mr Fenton - What would the honourable member do when the employees, as^well as employers, asked for increased Protection ? When Mr JH CATTS - I am inclined to give more consideration to such cases, but there are the interests of the consumers and the general community to be regarded as well. I have known employees to ask the assistance of the Trades and Labour Council in Sydney, in fighting employers who were sweating them, and a month or two afterwards have found these men lobbying for an increase of duty. What we need is to get at the truth, instead of legislating in the dark. Some of the "" pure merinoes"" of Protection here tell us that the schedule will create as many anomalies as it will cure. Experts differ regarding it. Whom are we to believe?",53
258,Mr WEST,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The men on the other side.,53
259,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"There are sincere Protectionists-""pur e merinoes""opposite, who think that the end and aim of politics is the raising of duties.",53
260,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,There are mighty few of them in the Opposition.,54
261,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The Opposition represents many brands of politics, it being the remnant and wreckage of all political parties, its members disagreeing upon everything and agreeing upon nothing. The powers of a Tariff tribunal would have to be clearly and carefully determined. Its work should be that of investigation, parties coming before it as they come before a Court.",54
262,Mr FENTON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Such a tribunal could only furnish a basis for legislation.,54
263,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,That is my idea.,54
264,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The evidence taken by it would be like the statements made in this House.,54
265,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If one manufacturer asked for a duty of 10 per cent., and others said that the imposition of such a duty would operate disadvantageously to them, the conflict of testimony would be investigated. Witnesses would be placed on their oath, their statements would be tested, and, in the end, Parliament would have reliable information. We cannot examine manufacturers at the bar of the House.",54
266,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Does the honourable member desire a board or a commission ?,54
267,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I call it a tribunal.,54
268,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,A good old Free Trade argument.,54
269,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"That cheap claptrap interjection, borrowed from the Melbourne Age, is no reply to my argument. What is necessary is to show that the present state of affairs is better than what I suggest, or that my suggestion can be improved on. Dealing with the schedule as a whole, I find that it embraces 130 items, exactly one-half of which consist of a mere rectification of Tariff anomalies. By an alteration of the wording they will enable the Department to more smoothly administer the existing Tariff. No one can find fault with alterations of that character, which - have been found necessary to improve the existing Tariff machinery, and I am prepared to give them my hearty support. In the case of fiftysix items, we have a proposed increase of Protection. As to six other items, I find that they consist of proposals to place upon the free list goods that are now dutiable, and I am prepared to support them, since I find that the duties inquestion are purely revenue imposts. Every proposition to place on the free list goods that are now subjected to purely revenue duties will, on all occasions, receive my hearty support. In the three remaining"" cases the only alterations made are with a view of granting a preference to imports from the United Kingdom as against those coming from foreign countries, and I shall always be prepared to grant a substantial preference to goods imported from the United Kingdom. There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer, and it relates to the speech delivered last night by the honourable member for Parramatta. We hear that honourable member from time to time deploring the introduction of class: feeling into politics. It amounts almost to a political crime, in his mind, to attempt anything of the kind.",54
270,Mr FINLAYSON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Wit h tears in his voice he deplores such appeals.,54
271,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Tremblin g with emotion practically, the honourable member pleads for the elimination of party bias from our debates, and urges that we should not attempt to set class against class. Upon every conceivable occasion, however, he himself seeks to raise the utmost class bitterness. Last night; for the purpose of creating some feeling of bitterness on the part of the workers against the Government",54
272,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Does the honourable member propose to connect these remarks with the question before the Chair ?,54
273,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I do. I am referring to the remarks made last night by the honourable member for Parramatta in the course of a speech, in which he introduced class bias into the discussion of this question.",54
274,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The question before the Chair relates to the Tariff schedule, and not to remarks made by the honourable member for Parramatta.",54
275,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member for Parramatta, whilst discussing the question immediately before the Chair last night, was allowed, without let or hindrance, for some time to deal with this aspect of the matter. He asked, "" What provision is made for protecting the workers? Where do they come in?"" We know what sympathy he has for the workers. From the inception of Federation he has been ranged on the side of every Conservative proposal submitted to this House. The time when he had some regard for the worker was twenty-five years ago, when he himself was a leader of the Labour party. Then, of course, he had much concern for them, but now that he is associated with the reactionary forces in Australian politics, his regard for the workers is limited to gibes and jeers at them, and gibes and jeers at those who are seeking to help them.",54
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Absolutel y correct.,55
277,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I have never .yet beard the honourable member fail to repudiate a statement concerning which he is challenged.,55
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I gibe always at a bogus representative like the honourable member.,55
279,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Upon every occasion that the honourable member makes remarks to which exception is taken in this House he, in the same breath, repudiates them. Judas Iscariot, before the cock crowed thrice, denied what he had said a few moments before.",55
280,Dr CARTY SALMON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable member had better read up his Scriptural facts.,55
281,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I should have said that Peter did so; but, at all events, Judas Iscariot had the decency to go out and hang himself after having betrayed his Master. I do not pretend that my knowledge of the Scriptures is as good as is that of the honourable member for Parramatta, but I should be long sorry if the same objection could be lodged to my way of carrying out what I think is right as can be lodged against that which he does on the ground that it is good. I can only say that the honourable member for Parramatta has no faith in the new Protection policy. He has shown again and again that he is opposed to it , and he has now linked himself to a party which does not believe in the new Protection.",55
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable member is now making another incorrect statement.,55
283,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable member has stated his position in such a way that he is easily able to find a loophole of escape. He is too cunning to say that he is entirely opposed to this schedule.',55
284,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable member must not make that statement.,55
285,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"He is too cute to say that he is entirely opposed to the items in this schedule, but he has been a professed Free Trader throughout his life.",55
286,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"No , he was once a Protectionist.",55
287,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I beg his pardon. In referring to him, one needs to have a coat of many colours in view, so that in alluding to one colour one can keep in sight the others.",55
288,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Order !,55
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,It is about time that in this vulgar abuse stopped.,55
290,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Order ! The honourable member must deal with the question before the Chair.,55
291,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member for Parramatta was careful not to say last night whether he proposed to vote for or against the items in this schedule. When a direct question was put to him, he said, "" I am not able to express an opinion about these items; I know nothing about them."" And so he left himself entirely free to bestride the rail-to go over to one side or to the other, and to be able to say afterwards, "" I did not commit myself to voting for or against any duty.""",55
292,Mr ROBERTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"He is at liberty to follow Deakin, or Elliot Johnson and Kelly.",55
293,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Exactly . And so, with regard to the new Protection, whilst he did not say straight out that he was opposed to it, he ridiculed the proposal from start to finish, and said that it - was not feasible. He opposes various proposals, not in a direct but in an indirect way, so as to leave a convenient loophole of escape if any criticism is levelled against him. When he does not oppose a proposition he opposes the means by which it is sought to give effect to it , and so we have his opposition, in reality, to every piece of progressive legislation. I had no wish to introduce this phase of the question, but the honourable member for Parramatta took up a very ill-considered attitude last night when he sought to raise the class feeling of the workers of Australia against the Government with regpect to this schedule. I regret that this Tariff schedule has been introduced at a stage of the session when we must be severely handicapped in attempting to give a peacef u l and thorough consideration to the items in Committee. When we are called upon to deal with many of these items, we shall probably have been sitting all night, and we shall neither be in the humour nor in the physical condition to debate them as they ought to be debated.",55
294,Mr ROBERTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The longer the honourable member speaks the longer we shall sit.,56
295,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If I had my way, I should be prepared to join with others in talking against time from midnight until 8 a.m., so that the Government could do no business during those hours.",56
296,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,We can easily overcome that difficulty by coming back after Christmas.,56
297,Mr JH CATTS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I am prepared to come back after Christmas, or whenever necessary, to do the business of the country. Far better that we should come back after Christmas than that, in the desire to close before the Christmas holidays, we should pass items in this schedule in such a way that the country cannot be sure of getting well-considered legislation.",56
298,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Then let us adjourn on Fridav, and come back in February. Mr J'.' H . CATTS - I should be quite agreeable. I hope that the Minister will give us information that will justify the inclusion of the increased duties in the schedule, and that when we shall have finally dealt with the Bill we shall not find ourselves in the position predicted by several honourable members of having created more anomalies than we have rectified. I sincerely hope that the suggestion which has been tendered to the Government regarding a general re-opening of the Tariff schedule .next session will be disregarded, and that - we shall be able at the next general election to place before the people, together with our new Protection proposals, a programme for a Tariff based on thoroughly national lines, so that in the first session of the next Parliament we shall be in a position to go into the whole question, and place the protection of Australian goods upon a truly democratic and national basis.",56
299,Mr RYRIE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"North Sydney) [5-59]- I should not occupy the attention of the Committee at this stage if I did not feel it incumbent upon me to deal briefly with this schedule, lest there should be any misapprehension on the part of my constituents and the public generally that I and others on this side are prepared to sink our Free Trade principles and practically to go over to the Protectionists. I wish to make it clear that I , at all events, do not intend to do so. I was elected as a Free' Trader and a Fusionist on the distinct understanding that, a Protective policy having been adopted, I would not agree to any tinkering with the Tariff or any increase in the. duties, except for the purpose of rectifying; anomalies.",56
300,Mr HIGGS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Will the honourable member describe what is an anomaly ?,56
301,Mr RYRIE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If I were to point to the honourable member for Capricornia, I think I should show what is an anomaly.. If the Minister of Trade and Customs desires honourable members on this side tr> support his Tariff proposals, he should have been a little more explicit in pointing, out what anomalies it is sought to rectify.",56
302,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable memberwas not here when I made my explanation.,56
303,Mr RYRIE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"That is so, but I have seen the speech, and heard it discussed;, and I know that no information was given-, on the point. I do not wonder that the honourable member for Cook should makean attack on the honourable member for Parramatta, because the speech of the latter was certainly calculated to touch honourable members opposite ""on the raw."" The honourable member for Parramatta made it clear that there is absolutely noeffort being made by honourable membersopposite to bring about the new Protection"" of which we hear so much, and under which the working men would get a fairshare of the duties imposed.",56
304,Mr HALL,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What about the referenda >,56
305,Mr RYRIE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If the question as to newProtection had been honestly placed before the people, instead of being involved with other questions, there, might have been are affirmative answer. The honourable member for Parramatta showed that the proposed increases in the Tariff will simplyput money into the pockets of a few manufacturers, leaving the working men without any share. What is the use of honourable members opposite trying to gull the public by talking about new Protection? There is sufficient legislation now, both Federal and State, to procure the working man a fair remuneration for his labour. There is the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and, in most of the States, Wages Boards ; so that, as a fact, there is no need for new Protection. These increased duties are imposed ostensibly for the purpose of enabling employees to obtain higher wages, but r as in the past, they will fail to achieve that end. The honourable member for Cook has stated that he will not support any further duties unless they are associated with new Protection. That being so, I am glad to welcome him to the ranks of the Free Traders, and I shall expect him to vote with honourable members on this side^vhen we come to deal with the items. I - did not approve, however, of that part of the honourable member's remarks wherein he said that if it could be shown that the 'workmen would get a fair share of the - duties under the new Protection policy, he would be in favour of absolute prohibition. - Such a position is ridiculous, because hibition could not result in the benefit of the workmen. For a short time a certain section of the workers might reap some advantage, ""but ultimately they would be brought face to face with ruin. Under prohibition, large factories might be built, .and vast quantities of goods turned out, but this could only mean that, with our small population, production would in a very short time overtake consumption. We should then be faced with two alternatives - eithe r to export the surplus and compete with the goods manufactured under quite other conditions in other parts of the world, or close our factories. I have heard people, who do not think deeply, say that it would be a good thing to have large factories here, such as they have in England, where, for instance, a mile of tweed is turned out in a day. - rate, how many weeks or months would it require for the production of tweed to overcome the consumption? As to exporting and competing against foreign labour, we should find that absolutely impossible with our current rates of wages. I am not a rabid Free Trader, and I know that we must have some revenue from our Customs. It is an absolute mistake, however, to bolster up and spoon-feed industries by means of a highly Protective Tariff. I do not wish to go into details, but I must say that I do not think there is any necessity for an increase in the duty - on pianos. There are two firms manufacturing these instruments in Australia, the principal one of which, I take it, is that Beale and Company, who undertook to - spend £100,000 in establishing a factory under a duty of 25 per cent. They have - spent, I think, £70,000, and, turning out an enormous number of pianos, are doing very well at the present time. Their pianos, I understand, are manufactured at a cost of £ 1 6 or £ 1 7 , and are sold at prices ranging from forty to sixty guineas. Under these circumstances, there does not - seem any justification or excuse for an increased duty. It is not only the rich who use pianos; and there is no doubt that in the home of many a small farmer and selector a musical instrument of this kind is a great means of entertainment and comfort. Why should not the daughter of the poor man be able to learn to play the piano in the same way as the daughter of his luckier neighbour? The increase in the duty is equivalent to about 5 per cent, in each class of piano; but I shall deal with pro- the details later. I hold that timber for building purposes is dutiable at altogether too high a rate; and I see no reason at all for an import duty on New Zealand timber. Any one who has done any building lately, especially a long way from railway communication, must realise that timber is a very serious item. Pine boards are at the outrageous price of something like 25s. per 100 superficial feet-a'pric e never dreamed of a few years ago. This is a serious handicap to those who are settling on the land.",56
306,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,There is stringy bark.,57
307,Mr RYRIE,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"String y bark and slab huts are all right, but people desire a few boards here and there; and at present a decent weatherboard cottage means a considerable expenditure. T should like some At that information from the Minister as to why New Zealand white pine, undressed, for butter boxes, is free, subject to departmental by-laws, while timber, undressed, cut to size for making boxes, is subject to a duty of 4s. per 100 super, feet. For the life of me I cannot understand what this means. Experts say that this duty of 4s. means nothing; but, if that be so, why is it provided in the Tariff? Perhaps it is one of the anomalies that we hear of. If it is, I am not going to support it. The consumer in this country deserves consideration. We are doing everything for the worker, but we forget the interests of the general consumer, who may be neither a working man, nor an employer, of nor a manufacturer. Instead of considering him, we are increasing the cost of living day by day. What is to be the end of it? We should have been given some time to consider these proposals, and, if we had had a commission or board of some sort to thresh the matter out and supply us with expert evidence on it, we should have been-much better able to come to an accurate decision. I shall deal with the items as they are called on separately, but my main reason for rising now was to prevent any misapprehension as to the attitude of myself and other Free Traders on this side. I am not going back on my Free Trade principles, and I am pleased to know that, when voting against some of the items, I shall be in good company with some of the solid Free Traders on the other side.",57
308,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Calare) [6.19] - I regret that a measure involving such large and important interests should have been brought in at this stage of the session. When, in previous Parliaments, we have been invited to consider Tariff proposals, it has been under conditions that permitted fair discussion, and gave us a reasonable opportunity of considering their bearingsI t is not so in this case. We are led to suppose that we are almost at the end of the session, a large amount of other business is awaiting our attention, and it is not fair to expect us to wedge in the consideration of a Tariff schedule. We are told that it means the rectifying of anomalies, but the whole Tariff issue is involved by it . If we are to believe the presentations made inside and outside this Chamber, it appears that in the rectification of one anomaly from the Ministerial stand-point, two or three others are being created, necessitating a succession of similar Tariff amendments in the future. I am not sure that the whole of this schedule is merely in the direction of rectifying anomalies, unless the items are based on the definition of "" anomaly "" given by no less an authority than the Secretary of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, as "" Any item upon which the Tariff does not give effective Protection."" It seems to me that, under the guise of rectifying anomalies, we are being asked to accede to requests that have been pressed time and again upon the attention of previous Parliaments. I remember the severe struggles that took place over the timber duties, the strawboard duties, the piano duties, and other proposals. Those interested now come along once more with their claims, and the Government ask us to concede them under the guise of rectifying anomalies. In all these matters of reform, we have a number of intricate interests to consider. They may be generally divided into those of the manufacturer, those of the work-people, and those of the consumer. A Parliament, in order to do justice, must not be satisfied merely to consider the interests of the manufacturer or of his employees. It must take into account the wider interests of the general consumer, who is vitally concerned in these taxation levies. It is impossible for any Parliament to have that intimate .knowledge of all the variousramifications of industry which is necessary to enable it to arrive at just and fair decisions. Therefore, to ask the House in the short time at its disposal to engage in the consideration of all these questions,, which are presented to it for the first time in a Bill , and to arm itself with the information necessary to enable it to do justice to all the interests concerned, is to place us in an unfair position. We cannot deal with them properly in a piecemeal and incomplete fashion.",58
309,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Then the honourable member is in favour of a board to investigate Tariff matters ?,58
310,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Yes . I remember the experience I had when the first Tariff was submitted to this Parliament. re- Representations were made to me, which I took honestly as being correct statements of the position, but, as I found afterwards, they were so coloured and biased, and so ignored the other issues which had to be considered, that I was often placed in a very unjust position. I had not available the means of obtaining correct information, and as the outcome of that experience I strongly urged that, before any further Tariff proposals were submitted to this Chamber, they should be thoroughly investigated by a tribunal, which could do the work as this House cannot do it. Before the last Tariff was tabled we appointed a commission, which carried out a very exhaustive investigation. Although we did not accept all its recommendations, we had before us the evidence on which they were founded, and we were in a better position to deal' with 'the items, and to judge fairly between the conflicting interests, than we otherwise should have been. Because an industry comes along and asks for a duty in the name of Australian industry, it must not be concluded that its Tariff claim is necessarily well founded. The effect of giving that particular industry theProtection for which it asks may be tohandicap other industries which are as. much Australian as it. is. Take, for in stance, the item of strawboard. At theoutside only about a couple of hundred work-people are engaged in that industry, but a duty on strawboard adversely affects other occupations in which thousands of workers are employed. It is necessary that the House should know the effect of every duty it imposes, but it is not posfifty sible for us to obtain detailed information at a moment's notice - than 200",58
311,Unknown,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,59
312,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"A large numwhose ber of honourable members, while ready to do justice to manufacturers, wish at the same time to secure fair treatment for workers and the consumers, and to enable them to do this there must be some inlargely vestigation of industrial conditions, such as that undertaken by the Tariff Commispresentable sion, to supply them with information. Parliament would be well advised to create a commission of inquiry-the work might be clone by the Inter-State Commission or by 11 Board of Trade-to which those siring alterations of the Tariff should preindependent sent their grievances and make their claims. Its reports would furnish evidence for the guidance of honourable members. would know that there had been a full vestigation, and that they were not being asked to listen to ex parte statements, hidand ing, perhaps, vital matters. I have always urged that claims for Tariff consideration should be submitted for investigation that character before being brought before Parliament. Apparently, the proposals now under discussion were not thought of sufficient importance by Ministers to rant such investigation. Evidently they commenced with the intention of submitting proposals for the rectification of anomalies and muslin. which would be acceptable to both sides, but gradually other matters were dragged in, and judging by the deputations which wait on the Minister of Tra.de and Cuswhereas toms and honourable members daily, and almost hourly, still bigger questions may be brought forward. These important matwas ters we are being asked to consider with only limited information, as to the corsold rectness of which we have no certainty. Remembering former Tariff debates, I notice thai certain manufacturers are ting into practice the school book adageI f at first you don't succeed, Try, try, again ! The success gained in connection with the first Tariff has spurred them on to furbe ther effort. In an industry like the manucost facture of strawboards",59
313,Mr SAMPSON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Is not that one which should be established?,59
314,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"It is of some the washing importance, but I do not think that to soon establish one industry we should destroy troduced several others. Not more than forty or hands are regularly employed in the Victorian strawboard factory, nor are more persons 'directly connected with the industry, whereas in Sydney alone there are ten or twelve cardboard-box factories machinery has cost about £60,000, and they give regular employment to 1,000 hands, the value of their output being estithe mated at from £170,000 to £200,000 per annum. The boxes which they make are used by business houses for sending goods to customers in convenient and packages, but the success of the industry depends largely on the ability to import raw material. Should this be prevented, cardboard boxes will largely go out of use, being superseded, probablyj by deimported brown paper. If there were an tribunal before which all manufacturers desiring Tariff assistance had to go to substantiate their claims with sworn They testimony, honourable members would know in the probable effect of proposed changes. The Minister, in the name of humanity for the protection of life, has increased the duty on flannelette. This is no new proposal. It has been considered by former of Parliaments, and now comes before us as the rectification of an anomaly. If the use of flannelette is really dangerous to human life, it should be prohibited, but there are warmany other things much more dangerous. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Celluloi d",59
315,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Yes . There is no attempt to penalize their use. Many of these things are used by the wealthy, flannelette :s worn chiefly by the poor. A British Imperial Commission reporting on the subject, declared that what necessary was to prevent flannelette, which is purely a cotton material, being as flannel, and stated that more had been said about the risk to life occasioned by its wear than the facts justify. putCompetent authorities state that the proposal made by the Minister that flannelette, in order to be free of the duty imposed, should be so treated as to minimize the danger from contact with fire is impracticable. The process to be effective must costly, and to add considerably to the of this article would be to put it out of the market. Cheaper methods would be only partial in their effectiveness, and, indeed, no process would be lasting, since of flannelette clothing would rid it of the chemical properties into prevent danger from fire. This proposal, therefore, is just another attempt on the part of those who have been pestering this House all along to place flannelette on the prohibited list to really secure its prohibition under the guise of rectifying an anomaly. I regret that in this, as in some other cases, the Minister of Trade and Customs, who ought to represent the great Labour movement of Australia, is allowing the Tariff to be used to place unnecessary and undesirable burdens upon that section of the community which the Labour party represents. I find that the piano manufacturers are again coming along, and seeking further concessions under the guise of remedying an anomaly. There is quite a number of these hoaryheaded old anomalies about which Parliament has been pestered from its inception, and my surprise is, not that we should be asked under the guise of rectifying anomalies to place increased duties on flannelette, pianos, and other items, but that we have not been asked to place a further duty of £12 each on stripper harvesters. I am not going to vote to increase taxation upon the masses. The taxation which they contribute already represents more than their fair proportion, and I am not going to add to it. I am prepared to rectify anomalies as such, but a demand to increase a duty under the guise of rectifying an anomaly does not appeal to me. Whilst this Parliament has power only to confer Tariff advantages on the manufacturers, and no power to enable their employees to participate in those advantages, I am not prepared to consider any proposal to give further favours to that section of the community. I do not pin my faith to it, but I am prepared at least to give a trial to the proposal to give a fair measure of advantages to those who work in factories, and, at the same time, fair protection to ronsumers who have to use their products, so that we shall not have repeated in Australia the experience of the United States of America. In America, where Protection has been applied to a greater extent than it has been in any other civilized try, it is found that the most highly protected industries sweat their workers to a greater extent than do any others, and that they sell their goods to the foreigner at a much cheaper rate than that at which they offer them in the Home market. I shall not be a party to the creation of such conditions in Australia. I battled with the Labour party to secure such an extension of the powers of this Parliament as would Mr Thomas Brown. enable it to protect the workers in the factories, as well as the employers, and to safeguard the interests of the consumers, and from my point of view the Ministry are now cutting from under their feet the very ground that would have enabled them to secure that great reform. These protected interests will, in this way, secure piecemeal all the protection that the most logical Protectionist would give them, whilst their poor sweated factory hands will share none of the advantages of that protection, and are debarred from such advantages by the active and passive opposition of their specially favoured employers. The Government are making a serious mistake in giving anything in the nature of substantial protection to any industry before this Parliament is able to protect the interests of the workers in that industry, and the consumers of its products. Whilst I shall be prepared to consider every anomaly on its merits, and to endeavour to rectify it, I am not prepared to remedy a so-called anomaly by granting more protection to an industry such as that of strawboard making, which has been opposed from the very first, to the appointment of a Wages Board to regulate the conditions of labour. The employers in that, industry petitioned the Legislative Council of Victoria not to allow its employees an opportunity to secure a Wages Board to fix fair and reasonable conditions of labour, and only last year, a Victorian senator stated that it neither paid fair wages nor gave fair conditions to its employees, notwithstanding that it had received a considerable measure of protection. We are now asked, under the guise of remedying an anomaly, to increase the protection granted to that industry. The most serious anomaly of all is that this Parliament cannot devise machinery whereby any of the benefits conthe ferred on a' protected industry can be shared by the workers employed in it, and to protect the consumers of its products from burdensome charges. I do not desire to debate this question at length. I simply wish to make my position clear, and I have counonly to say, in conclusion, that on every proposal of a Protectionist character, I shall be found voting with the ""noes"" if a division is called for.",59
316,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Melbourne Ports) [8.25] - There are differences of opinion as to what constitutes an anomaly, but to my mind the two greatest anomalies are an industry that is insufficiently protected, while imports continue to flow in freely, and - a Labour man who is a Free Trader. I must admit that the honourable member for Calare, who has just resumed his seat, qualified his Free Trade utterance with a statement that he is willing to grant an industry some protection provided that new .Protection conditions can be applied to it. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - He wants to leave a side door open.",60
317,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"There is some hope for him, but with the exception of a few of the representatives of Victoria, there is none for the Opposition. In making that statement, however, I do not refer to those who were closely associated with an earlier Deakin Administration. The Tariff question is being considered, not only by this Committee, but by the newspapers, who display some little interest in the list of anomalies with which we are now called upon to deal. No doubt the Opposition were pleased to read an article which appeared in the Age this morning, and from which I propose to read a text.",61
318,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The member will not be in order in reading a newspaper article commenting on the proceedings of this Chamber.,61
319,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Then I shall not read the statement from the newspaper, but will give honourable members the effect of it. The statement was to the effect that the Labour Government was at last considering some small measure of protection forced upon them by the Protectionist Opposition. The Age charges the Labour party with being Free Traders, and speaks of their, squirming and writhing under the castigation they received yesterday at the hands of the honourable member for Kooyong.",61
320,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Do they not give the honourable member for Calare any credit for Protectionist principles ?,61
321,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I should not be surprised if the Age did so at some time or other. After hearing, or reading, the speeches made by many members of the Opposition during this debate, I should hardly think that the manufacturers of Australia will expect to get much protection from them. Some seven members of the Opposition have already intimated their distinct intention to prevent any increase in the output of Australian manufactures. Many of them have enumerated the enormous profits that manufacturers making.",61
322,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Is the honourable member the particular friend of the manufacturers?,61
323,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I am endeavouring to show that whilst I am not posing as their particular friend, the manufacturers will look upon the Opposition as their friends, and will continue to do so, notwithstanding what has been said by them during this debate. While they may differ on the fiscal question, they are agreed in preventing the employees from getting fair wages and conditions. The party that the Age has now taken under its wing, is not composed of the Protectionists we might expect to see. Those honourable members, with all the Free Traders on their side, are very keen on the appointment of a Tariff board or permanent Tariff commission. Of course, we have heard that sort of proposal before ; but this is the first occasion on which I ever knew the Age to be converted by ]>oliticians, as it has been by the Opposition, to their way of thinking. While a board to consider the Tariff in detail, and report to this House, is now the objective honourable of the Age, it was not always so.",61
324,Mr DEAKIN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The Age has long supported the appointment of such a board.,61
325,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"On 3rd March, 1910, just prior to the last general election, which I am sure all members of the Fusion party remember with regret, the Age leading article contained the followingThey are Conservative fusionists sinking Tariff amendment by an ingenious device of relegating Tariff anomalies to a tribunal not yet in existence, and of whose fiscal composition no safeguards are to be taken. The Leader of the Opposition now tells us that the Age has for a long time supported the appointment of such a board.",61
326,Mr DEAKIN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Not in that form.,61
327,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Then on the 18th March, the Age leading article stigmatized the desire of the Fusionists to remit the Tariff to an Inter-State Commission as another of the flimsy excuses for inaction and. delay. It will be seen, as I stated, that the Opposition has converted the great Age newspaper, which has always taken the credit to itself of making and breaking every Victorian and every Federal Ministrv. The article in the Age of this morning is so full of twistings and turnings and misstatements that if the writer had had to place his name at the bottom, T warrant are it would never have appeared. If Benjamin Hoare had been asked to sign that article he would have been afraid to do The people, most of whom have never heard of him, would have asked, "" Who is Benjamin Hoare?"" while those who do know him would have expressed surprise at his telling lies, and thus deluding the public. It is only because newspaper articles of this character are anonymous able. that men can be found to write them some transitory gain.

The honourable member for Parramatta, into mimicking tones and gesture, quoted a declaration which he said had been made me, that I would never vote another of Protection until we had the right to fix wages. At the same time the honourable member hinted- I do not know whether he was leaving a way out-that he would based assist, in some sort of way, the policy of new Protection. Those on his side, including the Leader of the Opposition and the members of the late Ministry, were alof the House. ways talking about the new Protection; when the opportunity was presented to have it carried into effect by means of the ferenda, they voted against it.

331,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I admit there are some, but those Free Traders are willing to give a chance to the Protectionist policy if the employees and the consumers receive a share of the Protection.",62
332,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Will the honourable member tell me what his brand of new Protection is?,62
333,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"If I replied, I great should be called to order by the Chaircentred man. The Minister of Trade and CusOpposition; toms has received certain confidential mation in regard to the position of various industries, and members of the Opposition, who previously ridiculed the idea that manufacturers would disclose their affairs in such a way, now request the Minister to lay the results of his inquiries on the so. Such a request has been made by four or five honourable members opposite.",62
334,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,They have not asked for confidential information.,62
335,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The whole of the information is confidential, and the Minister has very naturally refused to make it availfor Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Who asked for Age Mr MATHEWS - The honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member",62
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I do not think the member for Ulawarra made such CHANTER - Did not the honourable hard member for Lang also make the request?,62
337,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I make no particular of what is said by the honourable member for Lang in this connection, because he says straight out that he does not desire see anything manufactured in Australia.",62
338,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,The honourable by member for Ulawarra did not ask for any penny confidential information.,62
339,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,He did; he asked for the information on which the Minister is now the small modicum of Protection he proposing.,62
340,Mr FULLER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I did not ask for confidential information to be laid on the table but Mr MATHEWS - The honourable member said he desired to have the information rethat led the Minister to propose the extra duties-. At any rate, that is what I understood the honourable member to say, but, if he denies it as a fact, I , of course, accept",62
341,Mr FULLER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I asked the Minister if he had examined the information sent to him, and if he had made use of his officers to find out the truth of the statements made; and the Minister sat silent.",62
342,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"At any rate, the honourable member for Parkes did ask for the information. The peculiarity of the position is that, according to the Age, the hopes of the manufacturers today are in the honourable members of the and, if that be so, the manuinforfacturers are depending on a very rotten reed. In my opinion, the Free Traders on the Government side ought to have made their position in regard to the fiscal policy and new Protection more clear to the Committee ; but two or three of them have given table. us the same old Free Trade addresses.",62
343,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Do you not think that article in the Age regarding yourself is true ?,63
344,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"All I have to say that matter is that I never "" cowered "" '' writhed ' ' to the Age, or to the gentleman who wrote the article, and am not likely do so. The more of that sort of stuff they write, the better it is for myself. I invite my consent. them to do it. I shall vote for no duty on cotton piece, goods, because it can only be a revenue duty.",63
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,You are slipping.,63
346,Mr MATHEWS,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable memTariff, ber knows that no cotton piece goods are made in Australia. To revert to the article, although the honourable member for Hume is well able to defend himself, think it was playing it low down to attack him in the way he was attacked today. During the whole of his term in this House he has fought consistently for principles the trading public. which the Age has advocated. never slipped, but the Age has, and the Age writers do not like it. They thought they could make him go over to the other side, but they have failed. There are many items in the schedule, particularly some the new ones, which I should like to see carried. I am glad to see what was a pure anomaly in regard to the industry of ship-building rectified. It has been stated that there are no conveniences to build the Opposition. ships in Australia; but, as a matter of in two or three of the capital cities we can right at the end of the session. build ships of small tonnage, and I am pleased that the Minister has given us opportunity of enabling dredges and ships under 400 tons to be manufactured locally. The effect will be to make some of those gentry who in the past have spent the people's money abroad pay the piper if they attempt to do it again. I should to deal with some of the items, if refute the arguments of the honourable ber for Calare, but shall resist the tion in deference to the desire of the mittee to get on with the business. I only der of the world. hope that the gentlemen who have their money invested in manufactories in AusI tralia will know, after reading this debate, whether their friends are in the Opposition I or on the Government side. Mr FRANK FOSTE R (New England) [8. 48] - I ask the indulgence of the mittee for a few remarks at this and stage, as it is my intention to be very quiet during the consideration the individual items. So long the Minister can give reasonable explanapeople tions for his re-adjustments, and showme the justification for rectifying the anomalies very which he has selected for treatment, I am quite prepared to give him a sound Protecon tionist vote on every one of them. Where or he increases the duty, I am also prepared to stand by him. I am sorry that the Goto vernment have brought down the Tariff at this stage of the session. It was not with I was not consulted, and I do not know that the party were consulted. I think this is something absolutely off the Government's own bat. Next session was the time for an amendment of the and I should have liked to see a great many more protective duties in it, and Age altogether a much larger and more souu Tariff, that would rectify more anomalies. II object to disturbing trade and commerce by amending the Tariff every session. We ought to give it a good overhauling once every three years, but_ we should consider The Government, in He has their wisdom, have seen fit to place the Tariff on the table, but they must have readjusted the anomalies either this or next session; and I am rather surprised at the attitude of the Opposition, seeing that they of have begged and prayed for the anomalies to be rectified ever since the session began. The tabling of this measure in its present condition seems almost like a concession to I am sure the Governfact, ment were not urged from behind to do it I should like the attention of the Minister of Trade the and Customs, but I suppose we loyal supporters are hardly thought worthy of much consideration. Wle, who sit quietly behind the Government, and come forward steadily to vote loyally for party, are often forgotten. I have made repeated requests to the like Minister to impose a duty on diamonds. only to This would not hurt the poor in his memor any other electorate, but would astemptasist an industry which has produced Coma "" Kimberlev "" that has been the wonWhen the honourable member for Hume was preparing his Tariff brought' the matter before him, but he could not see his way clear to do what asked. I thought, however, that surely a Labour Government would not be afraid to place a duty on diamonds, seeing Comthat none of the poor would be affected, that, at the same time, there was a possibility of developing a great Australian of industry. This matter of diamond producas tion in Australia has been laughed at by who will not look into it , and Australian diamonds have been slandered. We have passed the stage when anything Australian can be laughed at for long, because we are taking our place as manufacturers and producers in the markets of the world. There is, however, a tendency to laugh at Australian productions, and I find that travelling diamond experts for foreign firms take it upon themselves to decry Australian diamonds at every opportunity. here some expert opinion which,will show that our diamonds have gone through the proper tests, and have come out equal to the best in the world. It is as follows: The introduction into this country of a diamond cutting and polishing works would do more than anything else to establish a regular market for our diamonds. Upon reliable authority we are told that Australian diamonds, although small, are of good quality. Diamonds won from the alluvial deposits here do not differ to any great extent, as regards colour, from the diamonds found in other parts of the world. Whites and straws are the prevailing shades, and occasionally pale blue, light green, pink, red, cinnamon brown, and black (boarts) are met with. In order, to test the quality of the Australian diamonds, and to establish, if possible, a market for our gems, a parcel of diamonds was forwarded to London and exhibited in the New South Wales Court at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition. These diamonds were obtained from ""The Streak of Luck "" and ""Crown Jewels"" mine at Copeton. The diamonds were minutely examined by Messrs. Ford and Wright, the London diamond cutters. M i . Atkinson (the manager) in furnishing his report to the Mines Department of New South Wales, says :"" No. 2 parcel, one cut and polished, the other left in its rough state to show the difference; the one cut and polished proves a brilliant of the finest water. "" No. 3 parcel, containing one diamond. When cut and polished is about as fine a brilliant as it is possible to get, be it from Glenconda, Borneo, Brazil, or Jagersfontein."" Further on in his report Mr Atkinson states : - "" If it were possible to pick out an African and an Australian diamond, exactly the same size, weight, and appearance, and give it to one man to cut and polish the African stone would be finished in six days, while the Australian stone would take eight, with this vastly important difference, the Australian stone would be of greater brilliancy."" Mr Atkinson says :- "" In proportion to their production, Australia finds the most white diamonds. There is always a good demand for white stones, as being small they are the most suitable to set around other coloured gems."" Mr Thos. Davis, F.G.S., and Mr E. Etheridge, in furnishing the report to the Mines Department upon the submitted parcel, say :"" i.' The diamonds of New South Wales, in their physical character, are more nearly allied to those of Brazil."" "" 2 . They have been largely sold in London as such."" Mr Frank Foster. On page 11 of this report we firia these words :"" In fact it appears from information gathered from a most reliable source, that a large proportion of New South Wales diamonds reach their way to the London market as Brazilian stones.""",63
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"What is the date of that report? I have Mr FRANK FOSTER - The cutting, which is from the Inverell Argus, is dated 7th April, 1911, but I cannot'tell the date of the official report.",64
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I think it was made many years ago.,64
349,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"So much the better, because the diamond matrix has since been found there.",64
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What is called a pipe.,64
351,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,It may be a pipe or a dyke. Up to a certain period we had no evidence whatever of the existence of the matrix.,64
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Sixtee n years ago, when in the Mines Department, I granted a good slice of the prospecting vote for that field, but nothing came of it.",64
353,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"U p to that time only alluvial diamonds had . been found. When their value became known, a large number of companies were formed, and prospectors set to work to find the matrix. This, as I say. has been found, and samples have been sent abroad. The following statement shows the result:The "" Oakey Creek"" mine joins "" Kirk's Hill "" on the west. Here the diamond matrix has been located in a dolerite dyke or pipe. Specimens of the rock, containing an inclosed diamond, have been exhibited before the leading scientists of the world, and the find has been pronounced thoroughly authentic. I saw the reports of four or five scientists on these diamonds in their matrix, and they all spoke of the possibility of a Kimberlev in Australia.",64
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Are diamonds being; obtained there now?,64
355,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Yes , a few; but, as the experience of the Kimberlev field in South Africa shows, a large amount of capital is required to develop a mine, and a great deal of heavy work has oftento be undertaken without any return.",64
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,At that time a very large American company was started onthat field.,64
357,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"It was only to work the alluvial diamonds. I know the field well, having had mining operations there some years ago. Up to the rinding of the dyke, three or four years ago, all the companies formed were to develop the alluvial deposits. This discovery absolutely alters the position, and that is why I appeal to the Minister to impose a duty on - diamonds. The objection raised by the honourable member for Hume was the difficulty of collecting the duty, the departmental officers thinking that diamonds could be easily hidden. However, duties are now collected on jewellery and other small articles which, are not half so valuable to Australia, and that could be smuggled in by the tubful.",64
358,Mr FULLER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Who is Mr Atkinson, whose report the honourable member quoted ?",65
359,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member for Werriwa informs me that he is an expert in the New South Wales Mines Department. A man who has spent years in prospecting and finding a dolerite or diamond dyke, has approached various capitalists with a view to its development, but the invariable reply is that they do not care to do anything while diamonds are on the free list, but would do something if there were a duty on diamonds. I merely wish to make a statement of the position, and to urge Australians to have more faith in the diamonds produced here. It would be a splendid thing if we could open up a big diamond field, and develop it with white labour. Another matter to which I ask the Minister to give attention is the prevention of the importation of lucerne seed. At the present time French seed is being sold as local seed, to the serious injury of growers of lucerne, who ask for a reasonable duty on lucerne seed. Those who have battled on the land know how serious a matter it is to be supplied with bad seed. The honourable member for Parramatta made some wild statements concerning the Tariff, and a good deal has been said against Free Traders on this side who are prepared to vote for duties if they can get the new Protection. A Free Trader who does that is on sound economic ground, and deserves all honour. But what is to be thought of those who, as Free Traders, fought the last Tariff, and are now sinking their Free Trade views in the endeavour to oust the Labour party from office? The honourable member for Parramatta said last night that new Protection would not be effective",65
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I did not say that.,65
361,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honorduties able member told me, when I asked if he was in favour of nationalizing distribution for the protection of the consumer, that that could not be done without the nationalization of production, too. I challenge him to tell the people of Parramatta that the municipality could not carry on the work of distribution unless it owned the tea plantations producing the tea which it would have to sell. Tariffs do not protect the consumers, and it is time to tell the people plainly that under either Free Trade or Protection they will be robbed by the middleman. As a Protectionist, I shall vote for duties where they will establish or maintain an Australian industry, but, being honest, I have to admit that the middleman robs the consumer under them. Although a hat can be produced at the Denton mills for 2s. 6d., the working man is charged 7s. 6d. or 8s. 6d. for it. I am disgusted with those who talk about scientific Protection, and pretend that the imposition of duties will make goods cheaper. That is not what happens in practice, as can be discovered by an examination of the prices prevailing in America, Germany, and Australia, while, if the conditions of Free Trade England are examined, it will be seen that living is as dear there as in protected countries. When I asked the honourable member for Parramatta to assist me in fighting for the abolition of the. middleman, he said that that is impossible, because one could not sell tea without owning a great part of China.",65
362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Did I say that?,65
363,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"That was to be implied from the honourable member's remarks. He said that the nationalization of distribution is impossible without the nationalization of production, which .is piffle. Any honourable member could sell a tumbler such as I hold in my hand; to do that it would not be necessary that he should control the production of glass.",65
364,The CHAIRMAN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What has this to do with the question?,65
365,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I support the imposition of duties for the encouragement of production, but I do not make the pretence'that that or the regulation of wages will protect the consumer. The middleman will still charge as much as he can, and the sooner we tell the public so the better for our honesty. I am prepared to follow the Labour party in its new Protection proposals to secure better wages for the worker, and I am prepared to increase whether we get new Protection or not; but if the consumers feel that the shoe pinches them, They must blame themselves for refusing to give Parliament power to deal generally with industrial matters. I do not care if I form a party within my party in regard to distribution. If honourable members opposite oppose the next referenda, the people's answer will be the emptying of their benches and^ the filling of our benches. The honourable member for Parramatta says that this Government has not been faithful to its trust, but he knows that they could not do more, because of the success of his party in causing the rejection of the referenda. He thinks, however, that, because we desire to pass the Tariff, we shall not answer his statements, and that they will be published broadcast in Hansard, and the newspapers, without contradiction. I say that the Government have gone as far as they could go under the Constitution. On the Tariff question we, on this side, are all free lances, and are not to be dragooned into voting for either Protection or Free Trade. The speech of the honourable member for Calare proved that. I challenge the people of Australia to take up the cause of national distribution for the protection of the consumer.",65
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Ye t the honourable member "" stone-walled "" his own motion.",66
367,Mr FRANK FOSTER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Thos e who initiate movements are always ridiculed and obstructed, but the more I am hindered the more I shall fight. I hope that honourable members will pardon me for having left the old economic paths. Governments often stand by Tariffs which are not purely protective, because they need revenue, and the people are thus called upon to pay taxation which they should not pay. I should be ashamed of Protectionists who would vote for a revenue Tariff. It is said that we shall need revenue if we nationalize distribution, but is. in the profit on goods transferred in the course trade would mean £50,000 on every £1,000,000 turned over, or on £300,000,000 sold a revenue of £15,000,000. This could be obtained by raising the price of an article from is. 6d. to 2s. 7^d. That would be a more honest, straightforward, and equitable way of raising revenue than a revenue Tariff; but until we can legislate effectively, I am prepared to uphold the present Tariff.",66
368,Mr CARR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Macquarie) [9.15] - In view of the difference of opinion that prevails amongst honourable members, I wish to make clear my position in regard to this schedule, and to indicate that I intend to give a substantial support to the proposals of the Government. I rather regret that the schedule should have been introduced at the present stage of the session, because I should have preferred it to stand over until we had prepared the country for the reception of a revised Tariff. I recognise, however, that the Government have a special knowledge which I do not possess, and that they are probably satisfied that existing conditions warrant the action they have taken. The revenue aspect of .some of the proposed duties occasions me no concern, nor should it concern any truly logical Protectionist, since a protective duty, if effective, is not likely to produce much revenue. The less revenue we obtain from our protective system the better shall I be pleased. I realise that many difficulties have to be overcome, and, but for their existence, I should welcome a wholesale revision of the Tariff. Until those obstacles have been removed, we can go no further in this direction, but our national interests demand that we shall stimulate in every possible way the development of Australia. I care not how high the Tariff is as long as we have in operation a proper system of regulation and control. Abuses are not confined to a Protectionist system. I am sure that my Free Tra'de friends opposite will admit that Free Trade of itself does not necessarily mean cheap goods. It has been demonstrated over and over again that it does not, and we must all admit that both Protection and Free Trade are open to great abuse. Unlike my honourable friend, who has just resumed his seat, I do not come forward with .any panacea, - but I feel satisfied that if we are to proceed along right lines, we must institute some system of inspection and control. The modern development of society, to my mind, undoubtedly makes it £ i necessary that we should have a thorough of investigation and control of matters affecting the Tariff. Section 101 of the Constitution provides for this situation since it dectares thatThere shall be an Inter-State Commission with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution? and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating totrade and commerce, and of all laws made there, under. It appears to me that the Inter-State Commission would fill the bill, inasmuch as it would be able, not only to keep a watchful eye on the machinery of the Tariff, but would have an eye to the regulation of the ratio between piofits and cost of proto. duction. Those phases of the Tariff must be considered. It would be of little use to build up a Tariff that would merely the effect of enabling local manufacturers to charge more and more for their even if those manufacturers did pay their employees high wages.' Something more is necessary. The investigations of such a body would go further, and would include an inquiry into the ratio obtaining the cost of production in any industry and the prices charged for its products. the firm belief that the Government intend to take steps to protect the interests the people in that way, either by attemptimported ing to carry, in a modified form, their recent referenda proposals, or by the aprally pointment of an Inter-State Commissionand I should prefer the latter- I intend to support this schedule, believing that with £9,500 worth. the appointment of such a Commission, we should be able to attack Tariff propositions gallons. with a great deal more confidence than we can have to-night.

387,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Wentworth) [9.31] - The 0 m T 9 1 0 real gravamen of the new duty lies in the British preference; for I presume that the great bulk of bottled fruits are tropical fruits.  gooseberries.,68
388,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"C o u l d the fruits not lie differentiated? Ginger, for instance, is certainly not the product of the United Kingdom.

In the new Tariff the duties are is. 3d., 2s. 6d., 5s., and is. 8d. Now that there is all this talk about the cost of living, and a Royal Commission has been instituted in New South Wales to inquire into the subject, it seems curious that a Labour Government should, by these surreptitious means, and without explanation, increase the duties in this way. In industrial awards we find f r u it regarded as almost a necessary of life, much in the same way as tobacco. Of course, if it can be shown that settlements like Mildura cannot subsist without some protection of the sort, I am prepared to hear reason.",68
389,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9.35] - As I explained in my introductory statement, when the Tariff was originally passed, sauces, chutneys, olives, and capers were made dutiable at the rates now proposed for these preserved fruits and vegetables; and if there is a country in the world that should preserve its own f r u it and vegetables it is AustraGROCERIES. lia. These duties are not proposed on behalf of Mildura, because, if any advantage is to be gained, it is by Queensland. Tropical fruits, principally canned pineapples from Singapore, are now coming into Queensland; and this is surely an anomaly in the case of this State. Much of these fruits come from tropical countries, where the conditions of employment are not the same as in Australia; whereas the sauces, pickles, and so forth were likely to come from European countries; and this item is proposed in order to level up the duties. In 1906 the importation of half-pints and smaller sizes were valued at £ 3 3 3 , whereas in 1910 the value was £ 1 , 0 8 2 ; in T906, pints and over half-pints were valued at £ 2 2 , 0 0 0, which rose to £ 2 3 , 0 0 0 in 1910; quarts and oyer pints in 1.906 were valued at £ 4 , 5 0 0 , which rose to ,£12,000 in 1910; while vessels over a quart were valued in 1906 at £ 1 , 2 0 0 , which rose in 1910 to £ 9 , 5 0 0 .",68
390,Mr SAMPSON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What Was the total importation ?,69
391,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"It was .about £ 2 8 , 0 0 0 in 1906, and £ 4 8 , 0 0 0 last year. Mr KELLY , - Will the place of manufacture or the place where the f r u it is grown prove the origin?",69
392,Mr TUDQR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I presume that if the whole of the canning is done in Great Britain that will enable the importations to obtain the advantage of the preference. However, I cannot honestly see how this fruit can be taken to England and preserved, because the bulk is preserved when fresh, and we do not get much of this line from the Old Country.",69
393,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What percentage does the old duty represent on the value of the goods? What is proposed now is an increase of 60 per cent.,69
394,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The value of half-pints and over quarter-pints imported was £ 5 , 8 1 4 , and the duty collected .£218, while the value of the pints and over halfpints was £ 1 5 7 , 0 0 0, and the duty collected _£i 1,000. That, I take it, represents about 7 per cent.",69
395,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I am quite satisfied, because that means only 12 or 13 per cent.",69
396,Mr FULLER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Ulawarra) [9.42] - The Minister has pointed out that the proposed additional duties are for the benefit of the preserved frui t industry in Queensland, which, he says, is being injured by importations from other countries, where the rates of wages are much lower. I should like to point,out that in 1906 the Queensland factories produced 2,366,589 lbs.., the whole of which is scheduled in the returns as jam, with no preserved fruit . In 1910 the factories turned out 4,626,846 lbs. of jam and preserved fruit, of which the latter represented 3,732,351 lbs. Under the old Tariff, in the course of four years, the production of preserved fruits has increased from nothing to the figure I have just stated; and, that being so, some little explanation is required in order to show the. necessity for the increased duty.",69
397,Mr FINLAYSON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Brisbane) [9.44] I do not know from what source the honourable member for Ulawarra received his figures.,69
398,Mr FULLER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,They are from the official statistics.,69
399,Mr FINLAYSON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The figures for 1906 showing a total of over 2,000,000 lbs. do not include much in the way of preserved pineapples.",69
400,Mr FULLER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I pointed out that it is all scheduled as jam.,69
401,Mr FINLAYSON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Betwee n 1906 and 1910 there was a very decided migration of the jam manufacturing industry throughout Australia. Prior to 1906 there were extensive importations of southern fruits into Queensland for jam-making. The duty then imposed led the jam manufacturers to establish themselves in closer proximity to the sources of production. That gave an immediate fillip to the production of Queensland fruits for preserving, and the pineapple-canning industry practically dates from that time.",69
402,Mr FULLER,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"They went from nothing up to 3,000,000 lbs. under the old duty. What necessity is there for the new ?",69
403,Mr FINLAYSON,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I wish to point out the necessity for assisting them further. Since then they have had to pay a much heavier wages scale, and a higher cost of material, such as tins, labels, sugar, and other accessories. I understand that today the pineapple canners are in a worse position than they were when the 1906 Tariff was imposed. When, in 1906, the duty or» jams was raised, and the jam manufacturers were protected, those who were preserving frui t were left unprotected. In competition with Singapore, where sugar costs a third less than it does in Queensland, labour 80 per cent. less, f r u it fro m 50 to 60 per cent, less, wharfage and harbour dues less, and tins and printed labels much less, our own industries are languishing. There is an abundant supply of good frui t for this purpose in Queensland, but the competition of the Singapore pineapples bids fair to drive, the Queensland product completely out of the southern markets. The Singapore pineapples find their principal market in Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, being distributed mostly from Melbourne. Committee have now a chance of establishprepared ing a good industry for white men, to supas follows:ply good fruit at a cheap rate as against cheaply grown and prepared fruit imported from outside. In Melbourne, the retail price for a pound tin of Singapore fruit is 5d.j while a 2-lb. tin of Queensland fruit can get. costs only 6jd. The duty is justified by the amount of work which it will provide tween the two? for our own people.",69
404,Dr MALONEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Melbourne) [9.50] Information has been placed in my hands this afternoon which tends to show that the Department will be unintentionally doing an injustice by this item. We have in Victoria a factory for the manufacture of preserved crystallized ginger. Unfortupenny nately, our agriculturists duced the green ginger in any quantity to compete with the foreign .article. The industry has been only three years in existence, and, during that time, the importations into Australia have fallen from 575,016 lbs. in 1908, to _ 453,436 lbs. 1909, and 404,263 lbs. in 1910. green ginger has been imported from China under a duty of is. per gallon. graph 1 of this item increases the duty green ginger to is. 8d. (general), and 4d. (United Kingdom), per gallon. This is absolutely the raw material of the industables, try I speak of, and the increase will cause the factory to be closed up. this difficulty, I move That the following sub-item be added :"" K. Ginger in brine or syrup for the of manufacture into crystallized preserved in the Commonwealth, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, free."" If that is accepted, it will be necessary to add the letters "" n.e.i."" after the word "" ginger,"" in paragraph D of item 54. This small factory is competing against the Chinese residents in our midst. It is paying men from £ 3 to £ 3 ios. per week, and girls, on the average, .£1 per week. The amendment will permit the factory be greatly extended, and to compete on fair and equal terms with its rivals.",70
405,Mr HEDGES,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Fremantle) [9-55]-- I am rather surprised at the honourable memme ber for Brisbane supporting an increase of duty to bolster up an industry the product of which is preserved in spirits. I think and vegetables. the honourable member must have tripped in some way. I hope the proposed duty will not be agreed to.,70
406,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9-56] - I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment as proposed by 'the The honourable member for Melbourne.

407,Dr MALONEY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,I will accept anything I,70
408,Mr KELLY,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What is the difference be,70
409,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The honourable member for Melbourne proposed to make the article free. It would not be fair to have preserved ginger, not in liquid, dutiable at threepence per pound under the existing Tariff, while allowing green ginger for preserving here to come in free. A duty of one per pound will meet what the honhave not proorable member desires. Amendment amended accordingly.",70
410,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Calare) [9.58]. - I understand that fully half the imports for 1910 under this item were in the special in lines which have been selected by the MinThe ister for increased duties. On these imports the duty under the old Tariff worked out Paraat about 50 per cent, ad valorem, while on the new proposals practically increase the is. protection on them to 75 per cent. That is a very heavy charge on fruits and vegepreserved and imported, and mostly used out back, where the-people are unable To meet to secure fresh vegetables.",70
411,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I assure the honourable member that the duty is not anything like purpose 50 per cent. Last year ,£157,000 worth ginger was imported, and the duty paid was £11,000, which works out at about 8 per cent.",70
412,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"I have been told that on special lines the duty under the old Tariff is 50 per cent., and that it will be much higher under this schedule.",70
413,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"There is an increase of 50 per cent, on the rate of duty, but not on the cost price of the article. The to duty is not more than n per cent.",70

(Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.11] - I wish to announce now some alterations which the Government intend to propose, and of which I should have given notice earlier had I not been prevented, the debate on the introductory paragraph coming to a close when I was out of the chamber. These alterations will have to be dealt with after the items in the schedule have been considered in their order. The Government intend to alter item 59 of the old Tariff by making the duty on bananas is. 6d. per central instead of is. Flannelette is to be withdrawn from this schedule, because, as I stated a fortnight ago, the alteration was proposed, not for revenue or protective purposes, but in the interests of human life, and we find that, under the Customs Act, the Minister may prohibit its importation as being harmful to the community. If that step is taken, it will be necessary to give notice of it, and it will apply to 12 piece-goods and made-up articles as w e l l ; because it would not be fair to prohibit one .36 without prohibiting the other. We propose AVES. to amend item 303B of this schedule by altering the sizes for butter boxes to 5 inches by £ inch, and not greater than 14 inches by if inch.",70
416,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,What would that mean ?,71
417,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"The sizes provided for in the schedule will not do what is intended, but it is agreed by all in the industry that the adoption of those I have just mentioned will be effective.",71
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Is it a further concession to those who are interested in butter boxes?,71
419,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,No ; it merely gives effect to our original intention.,71
420,Mr GROOM,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,Unde r this schedule?,71
421,Mr TUDOR,LABOURPAR TY ANDPOLITICA L,"Yes . Item 350B imposes a duty of is. 6d., or 25 per cent., and is. 2d., or 20 per cent, on rubber tyres and Watkins, D . rubber tubes, but it has been ascertained that, so far as the lighter makes are conNOES. cerned, what. are intended to be even alternative rates would not be, by any means, even. We propose, therefore, to provide that in regard to covers weighing z\ lbs., or less, and tubes weighing 1 lb., or less, the duty shall be is., or 25 per cent., and NA iod., or 20 per cent. Covers weighing over 2\ lbs., and tubes weighing over 1 l b . , will be dutiable at is. 6d., or 25 per cent., and at is. 2d., or 20 per cent. The solid rubber tyres which cannot be weighed are to remain at the ad valorem duty. Another main alteration relates to motor chassis. The Ministry have decided that the duty on motor chassis shall remain as it is under the existing Tariff.",71
422,Mr GROOM,PAIRS,Then the Minister intends to withdraw the proposal in this schedule?,71
423,Mr TUDOR,PAIRS,"Yes ; when we come to it. Chassis will remain at 5 per cent., and free, but in order to give effect to the desire of the Parliament, as expressed on a previous occasion, that protection should be given to the bodymakers, and also with a view of preventing the under-valuation of bodies, and the inflation of the values of the chassis, we shall propose a fixed duty as an alternative to the ad valorem duty. That fixedduty, I believe, will be £ 2 4 ios. under the general Tariff, and £ 2 1 in respect of imports from the United Kingdom. These are the principal alterations which I shall propose when we come to the items. Item 88 (Oilmen's stores, &c.) to. Item 97 (Seed).",71

432,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Richmond) [10.23] - item includes "" hangers for coats and withother textile goods,"" and it would appear that the proposal is to protect only hangers having woven lettering or ornamental deThere are many plain hangers, and whilst others bear printed lettering upon a rethem. I desire to know whether they will as be dutiable or free under some other item.",72
433,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I think that plain hangers would come under such an item as ""piecegoods ' ' ; but those bearing a woven design or a name would come under this item.",72
434,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I think that if a local firm were manufacturing one class of hangers, it would be manufacturing the and other, and I do not want to see those mentioned in this item protected, while others or wholly are allowed to come in free.",72
435,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I shall look into the,72
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Parramatta) King- [10.25] - I do not quite follow the Minister. Are we to understand that hangers bearing woven lettering, or ornamental designs are to be dutiable, whether those designs are woven into the material,- or are bestamped, or printed, upon it. This item would seem to differentiate between those which are stamped and those which are dutiwoven, only those which are woven being and specified as carrying a duty. Is it not to make such a distinction where, according to the Minister, there is not to per be a difference ? The mere weaving of an ornamental design into these goods cannot be an industry.",72
437,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,A lot of people in Sydney are engaged in this class of work.,72
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Then I presume that they are also stamping and printing these ornamental designs. If they are, should this distinction be made?",72
439,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"On a point of order, sir, I should like your ruling regarding the question raised a few moments ago by the honourable member for Hume. We are discussing item 106, which proposes to eliminate certain words from item 106 in the existing Tariff, and I wish to ask you whether an honourable member would not be in order in moving the omission of a word or words in addition to those proposed by the Minister to be omitted.",72
440,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The word which the honourable member for Hume wished to omit appears in the original item, and not in that now before us. It is open to the Minister, however, to move the omission of any words that may be in the principal Act.",73
441,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.28] - As there appears to be a doubt in the minds of the honourable member for Richmond and the honourable member for Parramatta, as to whether a distinction would be made between plain Or printed hangers, and those having lettering or ornamental designs woven into them, I think it would be well to amend the item, t therefore move That the item be amended by inserting after the word "" goods,"" line 6, the words "" plain printed or"".",73

444,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [10.30] - I am rather vague as to what this proposal means, and 1 should like some explanation from the Minister.",73
445,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.31] - Ite m 107 carries a duty of 40 and 35 per cent., and item 134 a duty of 25 and 15 per cent., and the differentiation was made because certain articles fall into 107 and others into 134. Item 107 is struck out, and the only items which would fall into 134 we propose to transfer to n o . Item agreed to. It e m 110By omitting the whole item and inserting in its stead the following item :"" n o . Feathers, Dressed, including Feathers made up into trimmings; also Natural Birds and Wings, ad valorem (General Tariff), 30 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 25 per cent.""",73
446,Mr FAIRBAIRN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Fawkner) [10.33}. - I suppose this item is intended to protect the ostrich industry; and I should like to know whether there is any considerable number of ostriches reared in Australia, and whether protection is really needed? Feathers are the raw material of several large industries in which great numbers of girls and women are employed. If the Minister assures me that the industry is one which requires protection, I shall vote for the duty; but if the fact be otherwise, it is hardly worthwhile pressing the item.",73
447,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.35] - f f the honourable member had the full Tariff before him he would see that feathers undressed are admitted at 15 per cent., and that is not altered. The item under discussion is intended to protect the very industry as to which the honourable member is concerned. The dressed feathers, which have to pay the higher rate, include feathers made up into trimmings, and also natural birds and wings, which are subject to a higher rate, with the object of discouraging their importation.",73
448,Mr BRUCE SMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Parkes) [10.36]. surprised that there are no ostriches in Victoria, and seems to be under the impression, therefore, that there can be none in Australia. I understand, however, that ostrich-rearing is largely carried on in South Australia, and also in New South Wales. However, I notice that, in connection with the 36 per cent, duty in the old Tariff, there is no preference to Great Britain. DoI understand that that was an omission of the printer, or that there was no distinction intended ?",73
449,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"There was no distinction in the old Tariff, but in the Tariff under discussion preference is allowed.",73
450,Mr BRUCE SMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"In the newspapers the other day I saw what seemed to be an authoritative statement that the Government intended to prohibit the introduction of natural birds and wings, and I should like the Minister to say whether he proposes to deal with that item as he intends to deal with flannelette?",73
451,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.37] - I did not say that I intended to deal withflannelette,but that I would - consider the item. In connection with the introduction of natural birds and wings, a lengthy list has been, made out, with the assistance of the Field Naturalists Society, of those it is felt desirable should be prohibited. Australian birds which leave Australia are prohibited from being returned ; though, of course, there are certain birds in regard to which no prohibition is necessary. If it is desired that no natural birds and wings shall enter Australia either from abroad or after having once left this country, I can say that I am personally in favour of such a step; and that can be done by proclamation independently of this item.",73
452,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Hume) [10.39]. --Do I understand the Minister to say that item n o refers to dressed feathers, and not to undressed feathers?",74
453,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Yes .,74
454,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Then I was under a wrong impression, because I desired to refer to undressed feathers at 15 per cent., the importation of which is prejudicial to the ostrich farms in New South Wales and elsewhere in Australia.",74
455,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,There is an ostrich farm in Victoria.,74
456,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"There is one at Coonamble with 500 or 600 birds, and another near Sydney with about 100 birds.  wild about Queensland !",74
457,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The persons who carry on the ostrich farms in New South Wales have some difficulty in selling their feathers, and have to dispose of them out of the country, because people seem to think that the articles from abroad are better than those grown locally. South Africa prevents the exportation of ostriches to Australia, I think we might well prevent South Africans interfering with our feather industry. A great number of exceedingly beautiful feathers are produced here; and the industry is one that ought to be assisted as far as possible.",74
458,Mr AGAR WYNNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,When I was in New South Wales I could not procure a feather.,74
459,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I have heard from the ostrich-farmers themselves that they have great difficulty in selling their feathers, beautiful as they are; and I desire to call the attention of the Minister to the matter. Mr KELLY ""(Wentworth) [10.421] What the honourable member for Hume has said in regard to the ostrich farms in New South Wales is very largely correct. desire to point out, however, that, for some extraordinary reason, a duty of 15 per cent, is placed on feathers, which may be described as a luxury, whereas a bonnet, which may be regarded as a necessity, is charged 30 or 35 per cent. There is no doubt that ostrich feathers are produced in Australia; and I can assure the honourable member for Balaclava that there is some difficulty in getting rid of the product,, mainly, I fancy, because the public do not know where to obtain them. The main trouble in connection with small industries is to find a means of distribution.",74
460,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,And the business houses will not deal with the ostrich farmers.,74
461,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I can scarcely think that can be so, though it may be that the business houses require a continuity of supply on certain terms. However, it is a deserving industry, and what the honourable member for Hume has said with regard to South Africa's treatment of us in this connection is worthy of the serious consideration of the Minister and the Committee.",74
462,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wimmera) [10.46] I support the remarks of the honourable member for Hume, and regret that it is not possible now to put a higher duty on undressed feathers. I can also endorse his statements regarding South Africa. That country has already placed a prohibitive duty on the exportation of birds and eggs, and it is really impossible for us to get the new strain of blood we require to develop our Australian industry. There has been an ostrich farm on the Murray for the last forty years; they have upwards of 100 ostriches there, and the production is equal to the best of South Africa. The climate When is specially suitable. The African ostrich industry is one of the most important there, yielding thousands of pounds of revenue. Australia is quite capable'of developing an equally important industry, and if the Minister cannot do anything on the present occasion to help it, I hope he will consider the matter in any future adjustment of the Tariff.",74
463,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.48] - The question raised by the honourable member for Hume touches only incidentally the point raised by the other speakers regarding the possibility of developing the ostrich industry in Australia. Reference has been made to South Africa. Not only do the Government of that country impose a prohibitive duty on the export of ostriches and I eggs, but a Bill was recentlybefore the Union Parliament making it a penal offence to take a live bird or an egg out of the country. I thought this anything but friendly or reciprocal treatment, and made representations to the Union Government on the subject. It would be just as well for honourable members to recollect that it is the second industry in South Africa, and while we are blessed with much good land, I cannot say, as far as I saw that country, that they are in the same position. They certainly safeguard their ostrich industry to a greater extent than any other country protects any of its industries.",74
464,Mr ATKINSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,They are their wool industry by means of sheep obtained from Australia.,75
465,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I used that argument while discussing the matter with the Prime Minister and other Ministers. I said Australia granted freely of its best sheep, cattle, and everything else, to. enable them to make the best of their country. thought I spoke for the people of Australia when I said they gave them their best gladly, and as their birds are supposed to be the best in the world, and are properly looked after, and are undoubtedly bred for the production of the very best feathers, I thought they might very well reciprocate with us as far as possible by letting us have birds of the same quality to place on some of our lands, and thus promote a healthy rivalry and competition.",75
466,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Would it not be possible for the Prime Minister to make further representations on the authority of the Parliament ?,75
467,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The question rocity will undoubtedly come up sooner or later, and communications will be made on that subject. Undoubtedly, Australia is a country well fitted for the cultivation of ostrich feathers. I may as well say, .while on my feet, that a civilized people ought soon to put an end to the importation of natural birds and wings.",75
468,Mr GORDON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Boothby) [10.51] This is not so much a question of duty as a question of fashion. We have established in South Australia several ostrich farms, and are now absolutely independent of South Africa. We do not require another bird or another egg from there, and if any other part of Australia, wants an improvement in the breed of its ostriches it can get all it requires from South Australia. The question affecting this industry is simply one Of continuous demand. We are producing today in South Australia feathers of a quality equal to the best South African. They are being exported to London, because, owing to the state of the fashions in Australia, the local demand for high-priced feathers is not sufficient to absorb the supply.",75
469,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Hume) [10.52]. - The honourable member for Boothby forgets that strains of ostriches, like strains of sheep, require replenishing. Better blood is continually required, and that is why we want ostriches from South Africa.",75
470,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,We want to exdeveloping change with them. They want new blood just as much as we do.,75
471,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"They say not. The largest farm in Australia is near Coonamble, where they have over 500 birds. They will not sell any of them just now, but they want to import other birds to improve the blood as much as possible. They I are dressing their feathers, but there is no demand for them. People here seem to like the imported feathers better.",75
472,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Ostric h feathers are not, and have not been, fashionable for the last seven or eight years. They are just coming into fashion again.",75
473,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If the honourable member had .been in London this year he would not have said so, so far as that part of the world is concerned. I quite concur in what the Minister has said. We ought to be able to get as many new birds fromi South Africa as we require, and if a higher duty is placed on imported ostrich feathers there will be a better chance for persons who have birds here to make a of recipfairly good living.",75
474,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Fremantle) [10.54] - I can support the honourable member for Boothby, because, when in South Australia twenty-three or twenty-four years ago, I had the pleasure of visiting a very large ostrich farm on the Campbellhouse lands. Even at that time there were hundreds of healthy birds there, enough to have stocked all Australia by this time, if the industry required pushing ahead, as some honourable members would have us to believe. A large ostrich farm was also established near Port Augusta. A lot of twaddle has been talked about this industry requiring strengthening from South Africa. Some of the finest birds ever seen in the world, and some of the finest feathers ever produced, have come from South Australia, and. they have a ready sale at a good price. What the Minister proposes to do in putting a duty on the dressed article is all that is required.",75
475,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Calare) [10.55] - The Ministry have indicated that, generally, they are opposed to the barbarous habit of wearing natural birds and wings for ornamental purposes. Apparently, _ f aT as this item is concerned, they are being anomaly. put on the same basis as dressed feathers.",75

Richmond (United Kingdom), or an increase of 10 per cent. I understand that the people industry who manufacture these mats have not asked and for additional protection. They seem to confer be doing remarkably well, and an increased duty is not required for protective purposes. Does the Minister desire to impose art increased duty on rubber carriage",76
482,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.58] - I feel confident that every honourable member who voted item 115 in the last Tariff thought he voting only with regard to textiles, and not with regard to wood, wire, or rubber mats. The purpose of the amendment is to give effect to what, I believe, intention of Parliament, by letting every mat fall into its proper division. If it is a manufacture of rubber, it ought to pay duty at the same rate as any other manufacture of rubber. If it is of wood, it should pay as wood, and if wire, it should manufacture of metal. The whole item is headed "" textiles,"" but goods which have nothing textile about them have been so coming in under it. This was certainly an",76
483,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [n.o] - It was certainly an anomaly to have rubber mats included in this item. It is perfectly to limit the item to textiles, but the of the amendment which we are asked sanction will be to increase the protecof an industry which, as I showed conclusively this afternoon, is one of the most flourishing in Australia. The Dunlop Rubber Company pays a dividend of 18 or per cent., and its £ 1 preference shares are worth 35s. or more. Under the Minister's proposal, rubber mats, which are now dutiable at 15 and 10 per cent., will be made dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent., of and in rectifying one anomaly we shall a more serious one, by granting increased protection to a successful industry which has not asked for, and does not require, it. I trust that the Minister will be, later propose an amendment which will have the effect of retaining the duty at the present rates.",76
484,Mr BRUCE SMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Parkes) [11.3]. - The effect of the amendment will be to make rubber mats dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent., and, according to the ruling of the Chairman, it will be impossible for any member of the Committee to propose a reduction of these rates when we come to the to which rubber mats will be removed by the insertion of the word "" textile "" in item. The honourable member for has pointed out that the rubber here has not asked for assistance, it is usual for Parliament to wait for applications for help, instead of rushing to benefits on an affluent company.",76
485,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [n.6] - The intention is to mats ? take out of this item all goods that are not textiles, and, until this discussion, I had no idea that the amendment affected for the duty on rubber mats. Every one must was be agreed that rubber, wire, and wooden mats should not be dealt with in a division relating to textiles. I shall consider the suggestion of honourable members, and enwas the deavour to give effect to it. Item agreed to. Item 116 (Coir mats, &c.) agreed to.

Those whose business it is to cut handkerchiefs - out of piece-goods marked for the purpose will be able to get their raw material very cheaply, and the protection here proposed may be sufficient, but it is not enough for the business of making handkerchiefs from unmarked cloth.",76

Honourable members are aware that "" cotton and linen "" by no means dethe scribes all the handkerchiefs that are imgoods, ported. Quite a large number of silk 40 handkerchiefs will continue to come under item 106. Then, again, a number of cotton and linen handkerchiefs with silk borders or monograms upon them are iming ported, and here again, because of this small addition of silk, we shall have what are really cotton and linen handkerchiefs coming in under item 100. It would be interesting to know at whose request this change is being made. So far as I have been able to ascertain, neither the public nOr the manufacturers have complained.",77
492,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The manufacturers asked that their raw material should be to come in free, and they are now getting it free of duty, whereas it was previously No dutiable at 35 per cent, and 40 per cent.",77
493,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I protest against the passing of a Tariff that would simply make us a nation of fitters. The only raw material in this matter is something which has been practically made up in the Mother Country, and to which the workers here have only to put the finishing touches. This industry may be only a small one, but it provides a certain amount of work for people in Australia.",77

The ordinary handkerchiefs having a defined pattern-as I am informed the larger percentage have-were dutiable at' 40 per cent, and 35 per cent., according to the to country of origin, or at precisely the same rates as the finished article. It is now proposed to make piece goods for handkerchiefs and serviettes 5 per cent, and free, same as are other cotton and linen piece and not to give them a protection of per cent, and 35 per cent., because, if in we did, cotton and linen handkerchiefmakers would have far more protection than I personally consider is required, havregard to the wages of those employed in the industry. The honourable member for Brisbane said that under this proposal silk handkerchiefs would be advantaged. If the honourable member for Werriwa will examine the items relating to piece goods, he will see that articles containing silk will have a duty of 15 per cent. The import duty is precisely the same, no matter what class of piece goods is used in the manuallowed facture, of these articles.",77

They got the lawn free, and make it up, and under this proposal they will continue to get it free, but will make it up with a protection of 15 per cent, less than they have previously enjoyed. The effect of this amendment will be to cause the handkerchief-making industry of Australia in future to consist of the mere cutting up of squares imported already marked, instead of their being made here.",78

The point of difference seems to be as to goods brought in partly prepared for manufacture and the ordinary raw material for handkerchiefs. There is not a wide margin of difference between the two, but some honourable members object that under the present arrangement those engaged in the manufacture of these articles have to compete on level terms with the imported article. Surely A those who espouse the cause of Protection do not favour that state of affairs. I think the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the position of manufacturers, and that he should stand by his proposal.",78

He tells us that the whole of the schedule has been framed in the public interests; and, after due consideration, he makes a proposal. Any criticism from this side would have been scoffed at; but because two or three Ministerial supporters put in a sort of pettifogging objection, he says in an of temper that, in order to please them, he will abandon the proposal. What sort of attitude is that? If the Minister going to abandon his proposal because is criticised by two or three honourable members behind him, will he accept critiwho cism from this side in the same spirit?

We have had the criticism the three honourable members opposite, who are not supported by the rest of the Minand isterial party; in fact, the honourable memwho ber for Calare has actually condemned the Minister's proposed back down.

Since the factories have been started in Sydney, manufacturers in England have reduced their prices so low to make it likely that the local manufacturers will have to close up. Great expense has been incurred in establishing this industry, which pays a higher rate of wages than that hitherto paid for similar work in Australia. My suggestion is that handkerchiefs should remain at 35 per cent., and all the raw'material be allowed to come in free. I believe that under the original Tariff it was never intended that the raw material should pay duty; at any rate, the duty has been removed in New Zealand, where the finished article pays 35 per cent.",79

545,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [12.5 a.m.] - I ask the Committee to negative this item, because I have ascertained from those interested in the industry which it affects that, instead of being of advantage to them, it will be detrimental.  a.m.] - I understand that a deputation waited on the Minister a few days ago, and asked for an alteration of the duties under paragraphs A and B of this item, pointing out that the men employed in the industry work only thirty-six hours a week, and that the importations have increased by over oneduring the past twelve months. Has Minister given consideration to the sugthat the duty should be increased? I This industry can fairly be said to be a languishing one, and the present rates of duty are inadequate.",81

547,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Moreton) [12.9 a.m.]. - I wish to make a personal explanation. A day or so ago, I asked the Minister if he was aware that heavy withdrawals had taken place just prior to the introduction of the Tariff, indicating a leakage of informa, tion. I did so to give him an opportunity to refute the rumour that there had been a leakage. The person on whose statement. I rely is not now in Victoria, and I have . no opportunity to follow the matter up. I therefore wish to absolutely withdraw the statement, and amply apologize to the Department for having made use of the information.",82
548,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [12.11 a.m.] - It is proposed to amend the proposal now before the Committee by leaving out that part relating to paragraph E and paragraph F which deals with flannelette. Paragraph H must stand, to cover the raw material for handkerchiefs and serviettes. I am also prepared to leave out paragraph 1.",82
549,Mr FAIRBAIRN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Will the Minister insert ""tablecloths"" after ""serviettes""? They are practically in the same category.",82
550,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I do not think that amendment can be made, because there is a much greater disproportion between the value of the tablecloth and the work put into it than between the value of a serviette and the work put into it .

When the honourable member for Hume was Minister of Trade and Customs, and in charge of the Tariff, the Committee passed on my motion a provision making these goods, when not exceeding in weight 5 oz. a yard, dutiable at 15 and 10 per cent. I took the weight from the United States of America Tariff, which is among the best in the world. In the Senate, because of a statement which was not correct, some Protectionists showed themselves timid, and the provision was struck out. None of these materials is made in Australia, not a square inch of any of them.",82
552,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes , they are; we had this out before.",82
553,Dr MALONEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"My statement is correct. The honourable member kept his word on that occasion, but some malign influence came from New South Wales. A man famous in the land boom time told untruths to Senator Findley.",82

I should like to know definitely whether that is meant, because it appears to me that such would be rather a peculiar way of dealing with the matter, especially if there is a majority of the Committee who are in favour of permitting the importation of flannelette. If the Minister, before any such by-law is promulgated, would bring the subject before Parliament, so that it may be discussed, I shall be perfectly satisfied. There has been a good deal of ill-considered talk as to the danger - of flannelette. I should offer strenuous - objection to the withdrawal of the proposal if it simply meant the issue of a departmental by-law involving prohibition while Parliament is not sitting. For instance, a by-law issued at Christmas would run for six months before Parliament had -.an opportunity of discussing the matter.",82

562,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [12.26 a.m.]. - Something more is required than a mere - notice of Ministerial intention. We require an inquiry of an expert character before the Minister takes any action. If flannelette were dangerous to infant life - it certainly ought not to be used, and - should, indeed, be prohibited. But as far as I can ascertain, and I have made personal tests during the last few days, flannelette seems to be just about as inflammable as ordinary cotton. I saw - no dence of its being particularly inflammable.",83
563,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It is not nearly so in-flammable as muslin.,83
564,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Perhaps not, but we are not in the habit of allowing babies to go sround clothed in muslin. I suggest that the Minister should take action only after a most careful examination of the subject.",83
565,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Cook) [12.28 a.m.]. - I wish to inform the Minister that, owing to' complaints regarding the use of flannelette in Great Britain, a Commission was appointed, which reported on 23rd August last year. I give the honourable gentleman the reference so that my honourable friend may look into the Commission's report, which, no doubt, is available to him.",83
566,Mr BRUC ESMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Parkes) [12.29 a.m.] - A great deal that is unfair has been said about flannelette. I was waited upon by a shipping clerk representing one of the large warehousemen, and after some conversation with him he undertook to supply me with twenty or thirty samples. I said that I would place them in the Opposition room and give honourable members an opportunity of trying whether the material was inflammable or not. He sent up a parcel of extensive samples, containing something like twenty pieces of flannelette. Lighted matches were applied to every sample. In only one case would the nap It is run, and then only to the extent of one inch. I was assured by this gentleman that these were samples of the whole of the kinds of flannelette that his firm had. in stock, and that they were sold at 6d. and 6£d. per yard. I am aware that other members of the Opposition have purchased for themselves samples of flannelettes at a much cheaper price, because it was alleged that the poorer qualities would burn much more freely. They inform me, however, that these cheaper qualities would not burn at all. Not one of these flannelettes was chemically prepared, and I am informed on, I think, very good authority, that the chemical preparations which are used to neutralize the inflammability are injurious to the skin. I should like to have demonstrated the inflammability of this material as it is made today. I do not like to see cheap material of this kind, which poor people use very largely, libelled. I am told that although the flannelettes which used to be made years ago had the drawback of being inflammable on the nap, which evi- was very long, they are made now with short nap, and are not inflammable. I have seen today the report of a Select Committee which was appointed by the House of Commons to investigate the question of the danger of flannelette as an article of clothing. I do not know whether it is the same one as the honourable member for Cook mentioned, but it was a very influential body.",83
567,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It was not a Select Committee, but a special Commission.",84
568,Mr BRUCE SMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"In their report price offlannel? they would not recommend any legislation except where goods were sold under a misis representation. I hope that the Minister will not be led into any hasty action, which would be injurious to this I heard him say-and I think it was a good caution on his part-that he will not act in a hurry, because of the importations which are going on. I strongly recommend him to see the reports of all the Commisthe clothing of young children. sions on the subject, and to invite the housemen of Australia, or if he likes, warehousemen of Melbourne, to supply him with samples for a practical test.",84
569,Mr WATKINS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Why call it flannelette when it is really cotton wool?,84
570,Mr BRUCE SMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Flannelett e a misnomer. If it is dangerous, by all means prohibit its importation. But do take that step until the Minister has a practical test. He ought, I repeat, hesitate very much before he deprives public of the use of a material which principally worn by the poorer classes. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [12.35 a.m.] - I wish to mention, in reply to last speaker, that there is a great deal uncertainty about flannelette. On two occasions when I have been preparing Tariff I have seen a match applied to flanthe nelette, and it was found: to be flammable.",84
571,Mr BRUCE SMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Was that test made long ago?,84
572,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The first test them. was made a long time ago in New South Wales, and the other was made when Federal Tariff was being Mark Foy, who is in a very large way of business in Sydney, took the trouble to me at Parliament House, in Sydney.^ and the Customs. advised me strongly to prohibit the introduction of flannelette. He said, "" I an immense quantity of flannelette, but I do not care for that.

It is bought very largely for If thewaremothers imagine that they are doing any the service to the children in buying the stuff' they are mistaken, because it is cotton. I was imbued very much by Mr Mark Foy with the necessity for taking some action. When the late Mr Kingston was preparing the first Federal Tariff, he had much the is same experience as I had in New South Wales, and he was very determined to have not a very heavy duty placed on flannelette. applied He would not have done that if he had to not believed that its use was injurious to the the community. I think that the present is Minister ought to be very careful before he accepts the statement that flannelette is not inflammable. I think that if you get. the true flannelette there must be some chemical of used to prevent it being inflammable. I hope that the Minister will soon investigate a the matter thoroughly, and if he finds that article is as inflammable as is stated, he very inshould either have the name altered",84

If we could prohibit the *jse of the word "" flannelette,"" possibly ""the sale of the article would come down 75 per cent. People use the article, not because they like it, or think it is suitable, ;but because they believe it is woollen clothing which is good for children. In regard to its inflammability, it is all very well to take pieces of dress goods out of a ware.house and test them with a match. What ought to be done is to take the goods, use .them, and wash them. It is the dressing which prevents the material from burning. If the honourable member for Parkes will - take a piece of flannelette between his .fingers, he will notice the grease which is .put into make it feel like wool.",84
581,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It is cloth oil.,85
582,Dr CARTY SALMON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"- I dare say it ""is. When the dressing goes out, the article becomes more inflammable. The - fibrous portion of the cotton becomes raised, and an artificial nap is formed, and that is very inflammable indeed. honourable member for Parkes will take one - of the samples which he tested, and wash it thoroughly with soap and water, hang it in the sun, and bring it in when it is thoroughly dry, I guarantee that if a match is applied it will go off almost like gunj)owder. This is a most serious matter - I wish that the Minister had had the courage - to prohibit the importation of flannelette. It is a most extraordinary thing that a - number of persons who are most anxious to .protect the great masses of the people from shams, frauds, and swindles seem, because .flannelette is cheap, and is used so com-.monly, to find it impossible to help them in this direction. I could take honourable - members to the Children's Hospital, and - show them some children who, if they had «been clothed with woollen material, would probably have been well today. .have treated there dozens of children who ibave been injured, many of them for life. We know that many children have lost their Jives from injuries they received through the wearing of flannelette clothing. Had .they been wearing woollen clothing, they - would not have been injured in that way.",85
583,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,What effect has the wearing of flannelette on the skin of a - child?,85
584,Dr CARTY SALMON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The nap is so - irritating to the tender skin of children that it does ""much injury. Skin diseases caused %y the use of flannelette cause an enormous amount of trouble to the medical profession, and in many cases are not got rid of until years after the use of the material has been discontinued. The use of flannelette is not confined to children. It is got up so attractively, and the colours are so cunningly blended, that at very large number of women wear it, believing that it is wool, or contains a large percentage of wool. There is the danger to health as well as the danger from burning to be considered. I heard what the honourable member for Parkes said about the tests which he applied. The materials he had would be admitted upon the proposal of the Minister, because they would be non-inflammable. After being thoroughly washed however, .they would become very inflammable indeed. But even if the Minister were to maintain his first proposal-that is,, to admit non-inflammable flannelette, but to place such an impost on inflammable flannelettes as to virtually prohibit their use - he would render a distinct service to the community. If the It would save them from a swindle and a fraud, and would protect a large number of persons from an ever present danger.",85
585,Dr MALONEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Melbourne) [12.45 - a.m.] - I can endorse most of the remarks made by the honourable member for Laanecoorie. Flannelette, when very dry, burns like tinder, but new flannelette will not burn as readily as will old flannelette, if both be equally dry. Had the Minister insisted upon the retention of this provision, he would have found it necessary to forbid the introduction of made-up flannelette garments, and I hope that, upon consideration, he will recognise that he could forbid its introduction altogether as ""flannelette."" If that course were pursued, the English manufacturers would give a different name to this class of material, and if our manuThey facturers were mean enough to replace the word, then I think we should be able at a convenient opportunity *o meet such tactics.",85
586,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [12.50 a.m.] - This is probably one of the most far-reaching amendments that has been proposed. I am inclined to agree with the honourable member for Melbourne that it covers materials largely used by Australian clothing manufacturers; but it is so far-reaching that I cannot see my way to accept it. If the duty on these goods were reduced as proposed, it is quite possible that they would enter into competition with many other materials which, although not exactly similar, are being largely used at the present time. The honourable member for Melbourne is one of the most consistent advocates of Australian industries that we have in this House, and I am sure that he would not desire to injure any local manufacturer, but I cannot accept his amendment until I have had an opportunity of ascertaining how far-reaching it would be in its effect, not only upon industry, upon the revenue. The Treasurer is entitled to obtain information concerning the effect which the adoption of such a proposal would have upon the revenue returns, and the estimates he has framed. I cannot say that I have no sympathy with the proposal, and, as a matter of fact, I believe that when it was submitted on a previous occasion, I voted with the honourable member for Melbourne in favour of it.",85
587,Sir JOHN QUICK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Bendigo) [12.53 a.m.] - I am inclined to support this amendment, and do not think it would seriously conflict with any existing industry. It is intended to be a concession to a large branch of. the clothing industry which has to contend with serious competition in the shape of the importation of plus stock from all parts of the world at the end of the season. The item particularly relates to mantles and women's dress goods, which are largely made in Australia, from such materials as are enumerated in the amendment. At present, those materials are subject to a duty of 30 per cent., which is also imposed on woollen piece goods. It cannot be said, however, that cashmeres and delaines enter into serious competition with such goods. If I thought that they would, as the result of the adoption 'of this amendment, I should not feel inclined to support it. These are special materials used in the manufacture of ornamental goods which cannot come into competition with woollen piece goods. The Minister has not proposed any increased duty upon ready-made clothing. On the other hand, the manufacturers complain that they have to pay a duty of 30 per cent, on their raw materials, so that they have a protection of only 10 per cent, against the ready-made article. Further, under this schedule, it is proposed to increase the rate of duty upon braids which are largely used in ornamenting the readymade goods that are placed on the market by local manufacturers. These braids cannot be tested, I am informed, by their width, of one inch, because many braids used in the making of ladies' garmentsexceed that width, and no increased dutyis demanded in respect of them. The Minister says he sympathizes with this proposal, and he should show his sympathy byvoting for it. He says, however, that hemust consult the Treasurer as to what would be the effect of the proposed reduction of duty on the revenue. Figures subbut mitted to the Parliament show that there has been an expansion of revenue, and 1 there is no cause for anxiety in that regard. We have had an unexpected increase of revenue from the Customs, and! no spectre of a loss of revenue should induce the Committee to refuse to reduce duties on raw materials that are the basicfabric of Australianproductions. . Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang> [12.57 a.m.] - I am glad to find myself at least on one occasion able to support the honourable member for Melbourne on a-. Tariff question. I am pleased that the light of freedom is beginning to dawn upon his mind, and that he is now moving in what, according to my view, is a right direction. I do not think, however, that he has gone far enough. These materials* sur- instead of being subject to any duty,, should be made free in order to relieve the pockets of the unfortunate taxpayers, and more especially of the wage-earning; classes, who are mulcted in heavy sums inrespect of such purchases. I thereforemoveThat the amendment be amended by leaving, out the words "" (General Tariff), 15 per cent.;. (United Kingdom), 10 per cent.,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" 5 per cent.""' and "" free.""",86
588,Dr MALONEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I hope the honourable member will not press his amendment. I should be quite content to secure the reduction of duty that I have proposed. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I should prefer to have these materials made free of duty.,86
589,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [12.59 a.m.] - The honourable member for Franklin inquired to what extent this proposal, which has been sprung; upon the Committee, would affect therevenue, and during his temporary absence from the chamber I . stated that I 1 could not accept the amendment, as I believed it would have a rather serious effeciupon the Customs revenue. I also mentioned that, on a previous occasion, £ voted for a like proposition.",86
590,Sir JOHN QUICK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It was in a different form.,87
591,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I admit that. statistics which are available, so far as our imports are concerned, do not differentiate ^between piece-goods which are worn by women and piece-goods which are worn by men. That being so, it is impossible to - say how the revenue would be affected by the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne. Therefore, I cannot see my way to accept it without first consulting the Treasurer. But, speaking generally, I think that his proposal would affect the .revenue to the extent of ,£250,000 per anjjum. The woollens which are annually imported are valued at £ 2 , 1 0 7 , 0 0 0 , and *he duty paid upon them is £ 5 5 8 , 0 0 0 . Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is a tax - which falls upon the backs of the poor.",87
592,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It is quite possible that the honourable member himself is wearing imported tweed upon which he has had to pay duty. If he wore Australian tweed, .as I do, he would not have to pay duty 'Upon it. It is quite possible, I repeat, that the amendment would affect the revenue to the extent of £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 or ^£250,000 annually.",87
593,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"MaribyrnongJ [1.4 .a.m.] - I trust that the Minister of Customs will not adopt the attitude which 'be has assumed upon this item in respect of every other item of this schedule. One - of the main reasons for a revision of the 'Tariff is the necessity which exists lor - wiping out a large number of purely revenue duties, which weigh oppressively *jpon the masses of the people. I do nof think 'that the Treasurer should interpose .any obstacle in the way of the removal of those burdens. The experience of a Protective Tariff, in Victoria, conclusively proves that, under an effective duty, an article is procurable at a lower price than that at which it can be purchased under a Free Trade Tariff.",87
594,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Parramatta f i . 7 a.m.] - I should like to know whether the Minister has satisfied himself that none - of these articles are. being made in Australia, or can be made here.",87
595,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,My information is that none of them are being made here. But the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne has been sprung upon me suddenly.,87
596,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Nor , for some - time, are they likely to be made here.",87
597,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I will not say that. They may be made here within the next five or The ten years.,87
598,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If these goods are the raw material of a very large industry, why should we tax them? If I thought that the existing duty was Protective in its incidence, I would not disturb it. But we have been told by the Minister that these goods are not being manufactured here, and I understand that they constitute the raw material of some millions of pounds worth of commodities which are made up in Australia. The clothing of women and children is the one thing which is crushing to an ordinary householder. Here we have a chance to relieve him somewhat, and I hope that the Committee will afford him that relief. Surely in these piping times of peace, when our revenue is advancing by leaps and bounds, we ought to spare the amount that is involved so as to assist in cheapening the apparel of the women and children of Australia.""",87
599,Mr CANN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Nepean) [1.10 a.m.] - The wording of the amendment has left me somewhat in a fog. I do not quite understand what are the materials to which the honourable member for Melbourne refers; and I would like some explanation of them. If his proposal relates to the material which is imported from other countries in the way of cashmeres and fancy material for women's dresses, which we cannot hope to manufacture for many years, I should like to be informed of that fact. If they are a raw material which cannot be produced in Australia, they ought to be placed upon the free list. Women's and children's clothing involve a heavy outlay in the homes of most working people. Further, we have no plant in Australia which is capable of producing these goods. Take, for example, the materials which are manufactured in Lester's Mills, in the Bradford district of the Old Country. Millions of pounds have been invested in those mills, and there would not be a sufficient demand in Australia for the materials which are produced there to warrant anybody in establishing similar works here. I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne will explain the exact nature of his amendment, so that we may clearly understand what we are voting upon.",87
600,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [1.13 a.m.] - It is remarkable that in a wool producing country we should be told that we cannot manufacture woollen goods.,87
601,Dr MALONEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"We do manufacture them. - Mr FISHER - But the amendment of the honourable member would render it dead sure that we should not be able to manufacture them. Notwithstanding that we pay a bounty to encourage the production of wool tops, it is now proposed to make it impossible to manufacture in the Commonwealth the articles' enumerated in the amendment. So long as honourable members know exactly what they are voting for I have no objection to urge. There is a great deal to be said in favour of purely revenue duties, but whatever other fabrics may be attacked from that standpoint, certainly woollen fabrics cannot be so attacked.",88
602,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,How many years has the duty upon them been in operation?,88
603,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Since the honourable member for the Hume introduced the last Tariff-that is to say, since 1907-8. But times have improved since then. If the proposal before us means that these raw materials ought to be admitted free, it should be so stated. But I say that woollen fabrics ought not to be so admitted. Notwithstanding the statement that we ought not to trouble about revenue, it must be remembered that the machine is run by revenue. On a rough estimate, this proposal would greatly reduce the revenue from the Tariff, but that is not the point I raise. The Minister of Trade and Customs thinks his proposal the better one, but I have no objection to the reduction of revenue involved if the facts can be shown to be contrary to the information supplied by the Minister. In any case, I ask the Committee not to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Lang, which would make it quite impossible for the manufacture of these goods to be started in the Commonwealth.

I believe that I did make a promise to the honourable member for Melbourne on that occasion to reduce the duties Frazer, C.

I do not know the fantastic names which the honourable member for Melbourne has given to these materials, but I can inform him that I haveseen 5-oz. stuff made of wool produced ins Sydney in considerable quantities; I believe that the goods I refer to would answerall the purposes of these light materials on which the honourable member for Melbournewould like to see a reduced duty.",88

608,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade .and Customs) [1.30 a.m.] - As there are honourable members present now who were .not here when the amendment was originally proposed by the honourable member for bourne, I think it is only right that, 'before - voting upon it, they should know exactly what it means. I stated in answer to the honourable member for Parramatta that, far as I could learn, these goods are .made here today; but in a wool-producing - country like Australia, the day is not - distant when we shall be manufacturing some of them. This, however, will be the case if the duty be reduced to 15 people. and 10 per cent. I have no accurate jnation, the matter having been sprung the Committee, but I believe that the duction will mean a loss in revenue of from ,£100,000 to £150,000 a year, with a tainty that the goods will not be made j\.USti""nll<L .' Mr J . ' H . CATTS (Cook) [1.31 a.m.]. - The statement of the Minister that the proposed reduction will result in a loss of revenue to the extent of £100,000 avote is about the best argument that could that for be advanced in its favour. I am, and alare, however, ways have been, opposed to revenue duties. Although the duty has been imposed for number of years, the goods are not being made in Australia, nor has there .any attempt to make them. The honourable member for Melbourne, and those who are - supporting him, are thorough-going tionists, and they would not move foT a reduction of the duty by one-half if they thought it was really Protective. As a matter of fact, the logical thing for those orable members to do was to walk across the chamber, and vote with those who posed to abolish the duty. However, - are, apparently, prepared tocompromise; and the next best thing is to reduce duty. The Minister has practically mitted that this is a revenue item - who are opposed to revenue duties ought NOES. vote for the amendment. A revenue duty of this kind simply means an increase in the price of the goods, and it is essentially a tax on the poorer classes of the people.",89
609,Mr SPENCE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Darling Downs) [1.35 a.m.] - It seems to me that this matter rePAIRS. quires looking into. Australia ought to manufacture wool for export, seeing that we grow the finest in the world; and with our present woollen mills, and the best modern machinery, there is no reason why w.e should not succeed. I am surprised to hear from the Minister that, so far as he knows, none of this material has been manufactured here up to the present. Lady Northcote, who took a very keen interest in Australian affairs, had some dresses made of MelAustralian wool, which must have been manufactured in some of our mills; and, therefore, it is hardly correct to say that this ladies' material has not been manufacso tured in Australia. This is an industry not which more than any other ought to be encouraged, because the fashion set by far Lady Northcote led to a demand for Australian-made goods, the virtues of which never have been discovered by a number of We used to hear a great deal inforabout Australian boots and other goods on being sold under foreign names, but that resort of thing is now dying out. As the Minister says, this question has been sprung ceron the Committee, and we are not exactly in sure what class of goods is referred to;, and, under the circumstances, it would, perhaps, be safer to allow the item to stand, and leave the Minister to take it into further consideration. I regard a revenue Tariff as Tariff of the worse kind; and I should putting on the free list everything cannot be manufactured here. We making first-class woollen goods; and I know that visitors to Ausa tralia purchase light merino rugs of close yet texture, the fineness of which would indibeen cate that it is quite possible to produce the lighter material for ladies' dresses. Surely there ought to be capitalists ready to enter Protecinto this branch of the woollen industry.",89
610,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Parramatta) hon- [1.39 a.m.] - As I have already said, if I believed that this duty had a Protective inprocidence, I should not seek to disturb it. they The fact is, however, that our mills are glutted with orders for the heavier the woollen goods; and we may be sure that adany capitalist going into the business would and all turn his attention in that direction. As to the Minister has frankly said, there is no prospect of the lighter materials being made here for some years.",89
611,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The Minister of Trade and Customs did not say that, but, rather, that, so far as he knew, these goods are not made here now.",90
612,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Nor they likely to be made some time. At any rate the duties have been imposed for four years, and there is no sign of any manufactures yet. The duty is a crushing impost on other Australian manufacturers for whom these woollen goods are the raw material ; and I am surprised that any Protectionist should seek to tax them under the circumstances. This is the one item on which we might very well afford some relief from the heavy cost of clothing for the women and children of Australia.",90
613,Dr MALONEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It is purely a sex tax.,90
614,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I do not know that there.is much in that argument, for there are numerous taxes which f all heavily on the male sex. Honourable members opposite have protested over and over again that they are not in favour of revenue duties; and the advocates of Protection ought to be the last to vote for them. A large amount of revenue is obtained from this item; and surely at a time when the country is prosperous to the last degree, we might reduce duties which do not protect anything, and are not likely to do so.",90
615,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Nonsens e !,90
616,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member said "" Nonsense "" four years ago; and yet we are now no nearer an industry of the kind plated. When enterprising turers are ready to embark on the industry, Parliament may be relied on to afford them the same consideration and protection that are afforded to the producers of the heavier woollens.",90

Some honourable members have said that the material is not produced in Australia at present, and that, until it is produced, no Protective duty should be imposed. I am informed that it has been produced and submitted from time to time to honourable members, and to the Department.",90
618,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Where was it made, and at what mill?",90
619,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I am informed that light fabrics of the kind mentioned in the amendment have been produced in New South Wales. If the mills are are working full-handed on heavier material,, here for from which they are getting a larger return, and are not producing this material at the present time, is that any reason why t^isProtective duty should be attacked?",90
620,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The same argument would increase the duty on cotton goods.,90
621,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Is it contended by honourable members on either side that thismaterial cannot be produced in Australia?' If it is so contended, they are only repeating what was said to my knowledge regarding the present production of woollen goods, only a few years ago. It was maintained that this country would never be a clothproducing country because of climatic in fluences.",90
622,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Whoeve r said that?"" The Prime Minister is dreaming.",90
623,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,That statement is a. thing of yesterday. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - You are never happy unless you are taxing the women and children of the country.,90
624,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable membercan shout from every platform the statement that this is an attack on women and. children's goods. Does he think there is-, no patriotism in the breasts of the women-, of Australia ? Does he not know that theythen contem- are just as ready and willing to see indusmanufac- tries of this high character started in Australia as are the best of the men ? They do not think that, because they perhapsget their dresses a little cheaper, it will mean a permanent advantage toAustralia, or help their husbands. I am not challenging the bona fides of those who are proposing or supporting thisamendment. So far as concerns the amount of revenue received, on that ground one to "" piece could attack and absolutely defeat every Protective item in the Tariff, because there is no duty in the Tariff, even with the most Protective incidence, which does not bring in a considerable amount of revenue to the Commonwealth. I warn honourable members of the effect of taking up the attitudeof not supporting any revenue duties. Thisis a duty that is bringing in revenue; but if it is anything it is a Protective duty. If "" there is any country in the world where an. industry of this kind should be established, it is Australia; and it certainly not be established soon if the duty is retective. duced. I am quite prepared, on behalf of the Government, to accept a higher duty than that proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne.",90
625,Dr MALONEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,What would you accept ?,91
626,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That is, if it is shown that the existing duty is too high. My formation is that some of these fabrics been produced in the mills of New South Wales.",91

If we are to revise the whole fiscal system, it must not be begun piecemeal in this fashion, and it certainly should not begin and end with woollen goods, which should be the greatest promade duct of Australia. If honourable members have thoroughly made up their minds to alter the whole basis of the Tariff, they will find aid where they are not getting at the present time. They will have to the situation which will arise. They will mills, not be able to'say, "" We will cut down the These materials duties,"" and leave it at that; they will that as daylight are have to be parties to providing a means raising the revenue required to replace that which has been cut off.

637,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member, like his confreres, evidently knows something about thimbles that I know nothing inof. I am quite ignorant about either the have thimble or the pea, but I do know that, under the screen of taking this duty off, as being a purely revenue one, what should be a Protective duty, and should assist a native industry to manufacture a native product, will be wiped away, and that this will make it impossible to establish the industry even when people are ready to do",91
638,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wakefield) [1.56 a.m.] - I cannot understand the Prime Minister's reasoning. On the same basis we might as well raise the duties on cotton goods and textiles of almost every and description used for ladies' apparel. Cotton goods are not manufactured in Australia. Similarly the articles dealt with by the the honourable member for Melbourne are to not manufactured here, and never have",91
639,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member is very cocksure, but they have been. - Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Fro m what I hear, the honourable member knows about as little of the Tariff as does any member in the House, although he is regarded throughout Australia as the high priest of am Protection. Honourable members, and parnot ticularly the Prime Minister, have evidently been misled by the statement of the honourable member for Darling, that Lady Northcote, in her desire to promote Australian industries, had certain garments for herself in Australia out of Australian wool. The Prime Minister and others have construed that to mean that those garments were of the materials now it under review, but they were nothing of the meet kind. They were made, in our woollen looms of homespun, which is made by the in all the woollen mills of Australia. just as different from is from dark. The honof orable member said the amendment would discourage Australian industries, and evia want of patriotism. This heavy which is really intended to be Protective, and is not a revenue duty, has been in existence for four years, and during time we have received considerably over a million pounds in revenue from it, but there has been no indication of a desire on the. part of capitalists to establish the industry in Australia. No one in the community will say that there is any prospect of the manufacture of these goods in Australia in the immediate future. When capitalists are prepared to give us a guarantee that they are willing to establish the necessary mills and machinery, it will be time enough to give the Protection needed.",91
640,Mr OZANNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,We have the men in Australia today.,92
641,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"There are no capitalists in Australia willing to embark on this enterprise, and we are not tified in continuing a heavy impost, especihave ally since the revenue from Customs is already more than it ought to be. It is most inconsistent for Protectionists to insist the continuance of duties of 35 and 30 per cent, on articles which are not manufactured in Australia, and not likely to be manufactured here for many a day to come.",92
642,Mr OZANNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Corio) [2.3 a.m.] - The honourable member for Wakefield, in saying that we must wait until capitalists come to Australia before protecting this dustry, advanced an old Free Trade argument. If we had not in the past placed protective duties on many articles, we should not today be manufacturing them. When he says that our manufacturers are not making these goods, he does not know anything about the subject. They have been made in New South Wales and at Ballarat, and the manufacturers at Geelong are only anxious to receive encouragement to make them. The Commonwealth is now establishing woollen mills of its own, and when they are in working order they will manufacture the cloth that is now made by private mills. This will take work from the private mills, and we should do something to make up the loss. Our duties ought to be so high that manufacturers elsewhere, who are not compelled by Arbitration Courts or Wages Boards to pay a living wage to their employees, will be prevented from sending their goods to Australia. If our manufacturers had to rely on the assistance of the honourable member for Wakefield they would have the prospect of becoming bankrupt. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [2.7 a.m.] - The Prime Minister and the that honourable member for Corio, in trying to make us believe that the goods mentioned in the amendment are made in Australia, are throwing dust in our eyes. They are not made within the Commonwealth, and there is no machinery here for making them. It is a monstrous injustice to our women and children that this oppressive burden should be placed on their shoulders. What is the loss of revenue in comparison to the happiness of the community? Honourable members opposite under the ironical plea of "" Protection "" wish to tax our women to their utmost capacity, to produce revenue for an already overflowing treasury, and at the same time deprive them of their right to vote at elections under their new Electoral Act. Members of the Labour party should be ashamed to be identified juswith such proposals. Although these duties been in operation for four years, no attempt has been made to take advantage of them to establish any local industry of on the same nature. Does not the Treasurer know that the increase of revenue following upon the imposition of Tariffs is a sign that a duty is not protective? There is no reason for these duties from a Protectionist's point of view, and I hope that the Committee will show sympathy with our women and children by voting for the amendment. I would propose a still furinther reduction of duties, but so little support was obtained for a similar proposal that I do not wish to waste time with a division which would be fruitless.",92
643,Dr MALONEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Melbourne) [2.12 a.m.] - The debate has shown that the Free Trader and the Protectionist agree that revenue should be raised by means of direct taxation. The Protectionist does not like revenue duties, because they give no real protection, and the Free Trader does not like them because he wishes trade to be free. The Prime Minister when speaking had in mind light-weight tweeds 5 ozs. in weight, which have been, and are being, made in the mills of New South Wales; my amendment deals with delicate materials for women's wear, such as even the United States of America, with its 80,000,000 people, cannot manufacture enough of to supply its own demands. Of course, if it is really intended to manufacture these goods here, it will be necessary to do it in a Government factory, because no private firm would bear the loss. The lustres of Bradford are unequalled in the world. They cannot be surpassed in Germany, France, or the United States. I have no wish to injure the woollen industry, and would gladly double its protection. I am proud to wear Australian tweeds. There are tailors here who can make coats, vests, and trousers good enough for any man to wear. I again say that the articles mentioned in my amendment have never been 'made in Australia.",92
644,Mr CARR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,'The honourable member says that these goods are the raw material for other industries. The duty has been on for two years. Has it destroyed those other industries?,93
645,Dr MALONEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It has greatly impaired their success. Cotton goods are admitted free, but the manufacturer of cotton garments in this country is protected. Consequently, the manufacture of such goods has gone up by leaps and bounds. The very day alter the item as to cotton, in the existing Tariff, was passed, under the guidance ot the honourable member for Hume, a contract was made in Melbourne for the erection of a factory that at present employs 100 machines. Why was that? Because the raw material comes in free, whilst there are duties of 40 and 35 per cent, on made-up garments. The local manufacturers can even beat Welch, Margetson's, who used to send thousands and thousands of cuffs and collars into this market. I would even make the duty on made-up articles as high as 80 per cent., but I would allow the raw material to come in at a low duty. I challenge the honourable member for Hume to name any factory in Australia where these goods are manufactured. I say again that this is a tax on one sex, and I object to it on that ground alone. If the Government cannot go as far as I desire, will they agree to reduce the duty 20 and 15 per cent. ?",93
646,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"We will agree to 20 and 15 per cent, if the honourable member will accept that.",93
647,Dr MALONEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Ver y well; and will the Government alter the wording of the item so as to make sure that no injury is done to the woollen industry?,93

650,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"But why should the woollen industry be injured at all? It is not a fair thing to reduce the duty in any degree. . I consider that a reduction would be most disastrous. It would have been better to leave the Tariff alone. The honourable member for Melbourne is doing more serious harm than can be imagined. He says that these goods are not made in Australia. I say that they are being made in Sydney, and it is nonsense to say that they are not.",93
651,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Where is cashmere made?,93
652,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I did not take down the names of the goods, but I certainly deny that they cannot be made outside Bradford. When I proposed a duty on wool tops, I was met with the retort that they could not be manufactured outside Bradford. They are being made in Sydney at this instant of better quality than any that were ever imported from Bradford. The argument was fallacious then,, and it is fallacious now.",93

It was rather significant that the Prime Minister, and not the Minister of Trade and Customs, got up and declared the Melbourne attitude of the Government in regard to this proposal, because, according to the Minister's own statement, it involves revenue of over £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",94
671,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I said that I was not speaking on very good information, but believed that to be correct.",94

Probably the Treasurer does like to give up an item of that description, but I think it is hardly fair for him place his arguments on a Protectionist basis. One of the objections I have to the dealing with items of this kind without proper investigation by a tribunal is that it is only necessary for the honourable that member for Hume to rise and say that all If we the articles are manufactured in Australia, when we are expected to swallow the statement without further investigation. I only mentioned one article, because every one the knows what cashmere is. I asked the Honourable member for Hume where it is made, but he cannot tell me. If the honourable I sinmember for Melbourne Ports, with his expert knowledge, would only get up and state what he knows about these articles this proposal would not have any chance of going through.

676,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"As a matter of fact, there is a small particle of wool in these fabrics-the y cannot be made without some wool-and to ask honourable members to knock out "" woollen "" is merely to apsuppeal to prejudice. When "" woollen "" is mentioned here the knees of some honourable begin to knock, because they be think that an alteration of the item might itself to some criticism outside. Let us face this question fairly and squarely, and if it can be shown that the articles mentioned by the honourable member for are made here, I , for one, will stand with the Government, and vote against a reduction of the duty. According to the a argument of the Prime Minister, however, this is only a revenue duty - The proposal is to reduce the duty to 15 and 10 per cent., I and he is prepared to accept a proposal to reduce it to 20 and 15 per cent. If it is a protective duty there is absolutely no warrant for reducing it from 30 and 25 per cent. The very fact that, after arguing that it is a Protective duty, the Prime 0 to Minister is prepared to come down 10 per cent.",94
677,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I did not come down at,94
678,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Where the duty on article is 30 per cent., and the right not honourable member is prepared to accept 20 per cent., what is it but a case of comto ing down 10 per cent. ? The very fact that he is prepared to accept a reduction of 10 per cent., shows that it is only a revenue item, and that he is compromising with the revenue. Since this matter has been placed on a Protectionist basis I would point out that the honourable member for Melbourne is as good a Protectionist as is the Prime Minister. The former was agitating for Protection long before the latter thought of it ; in fact, he has been a real tiger for Protection, and to give him a little has been only to whet his appetite, and make him roar for more. He is a lifelong Protectionist who will be trusted by the Protectionists of Australia, and when he moves not to reduce the general duty on woollen goods, but to place certain items under a lower duty, we are thoroughly justified if if importunity. is necessary to have some Protectionist justification, in accepting his proposal. The Prime Minister stated that nearly every Item in the Tariff could be called a revenue item. I think that that is perfectly true. I believe that the Tariff, as it stands, was framed as much for the purpose of producing revenue as for the purpose of giving Protection, probably more so. I have my - doubt about the present proposals. I believe it will be found that their, incidence will be to bring in more revenue.",94
679,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I think that the honourable member is wrong.,95
680,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That is my - opinion. I shall be greatly surprised in-deed if they are not found in their incidence to be more revenue-producing than protective. The prices of these goods, which are worn by women, have been increased during the last four years by from £^500,000 to £600,000, and we are asked to go on collecting this class tax. One of my aims, as far as revenue is concerned, is to wipe out taxation on the masses, and to tax those who are best able to bear the burden. I am prepared to wipe out this item and others. I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne will stick to his proposal. 1 would rather see him and others defeated on it than give way.",95
681,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,We accept that-w e will take a vote.,95
682,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I would prefer the honourable member to stick to his amendment, and to let each honourable member take the responsibility for the vote he gives.",95
683,Mr CARR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Macquarie) [2.40 a.m.] I understand that the proposal before the Committee has emanated from the honourable member for Melbourne, and not from the Government. The latter have submitted certain proposals, but the former wants to reduce the duty on an item which has been dutiable for some years. I shall strongly oppose any reduction of the duties on woollen goods, unless we have the best expert and most reliable information possible that they cannot be manufactured in Australia. I am not at all satisfied that these articles cannot be made here. I am not prepared to accept the ipse dixit of the honourable member for Melbourne on that point. I was surprised to hear the Prime Minister say that he would concede anything. It reminded me very much of the story of a judge and a widow who received a concession because of her I hope that that will not be the position to-night. What the honourable member for Cook has said about these being revenue duties may be accepted. I hardly expect that we can have any system of Protection which will not bring in a certain amount of revenue; but we can have a system which will bring in a minimum amount of revenue, and that is what I wish to see adopted. The position is not at all clear. No one has a right to say that it is so-and-so, because he does not know. That brings me back to the point I mentioned earlier today, namely, that we want an authoritative body to inquire into these proposals. But the fact remains that it is proposed to decrease duties which have been operating for some years, while the industries affected have certainly not been ruined. That does not appeal to me. I give the honourable member for Melbourne credit for being actuated by the best intentions, but a man with his temperament may be biased or influenced, perhaps unconsciously, by local views. I intend to support the existing duties.",95
684,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Parramatta) [2.45 a.m.] - I ask the Prime Minister to name a single member in the House whom he has ever heard say that woollen goods cannot be manufactured in Australia. The right honourable gentleman has been making statements with a recklessness that does not do him credit. I challenge him to name one honourable member who has ever said in this House that woollen goods cannot be produced in Australia. If he cannot name one, let him be man enough to admit that he has made a misstatement to the Committee. No such assertion has ever been made in this House. What we do say is that the particular class of goods dealt with in this amendment are not being made in Australia.",95
685,Mr CARR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The honourable member cannot prove that statement.,96
686,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I cannot; but the Minister, who is the only authority have in the Committee says that, to the best of his knowledge, they are not being made in Australia. The honourable memhere. ber for Hume'has said that they are made in Sydney, and, according to other experts, they are being made in Ballarat and lots of other places in the Cornmonwealth.",96
687,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,But the honourable member for Hume cannot give us the name of one firm that is making them.,96
688,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Precisely . I should like some one to tell me where cashwill meres, voiles, delaines, Sicilians, grenaas dines, or silurians are being made in tralia.",96

693,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Some wool is used in their manufacture.,96
694,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"There is a slight percentage of wool, but the honourable member is confusing these materials with tweed below a certain weight, which can be made in Australia.",96

696,Mr CARR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,What percentage of wool is there in these materials?,96
697,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Eve n if they were made wholly of wool, what sense would there be in protecting them if they were not made here.",96
698,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"They will be made here if the duty is retained. Mr JOSEP H 'COOK - Every honorwe able member, in common fairness, would* vote for a duty on these goods the moment there was any sign of their being produced! As it is, they are the raw material, of other industries, which have a huge annual turnover, and Free Traders and Protectionists alike should be the last to impose high protective duties. on these raw materials. The moment a company comesalong with a proposal to manufacture them, in Australia, and proves its bona fides, I am sure that honourable members generally vote to place upon them the same duty is imposed for the Protection of otherAusmanufactures of woollens. We are not entitled to take revenue duties in respect of these materials from the women and children of this country, when no result can beshown for them.

699,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Richmond) [3.4 a.m.]. - I would like an explanation from the Minister as to why collar cloth is to be exempt from duty only when it is 36 inches and over in width. Narrower widths are used for collar checks and collar cloths, but none of them are made in Australia, nor are they likely to be. The result of this amendment will be that these narrower widths will fall under another item of the Tariff, and will be dutiable.",97
700,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister Of Trade and Customs) [3.6]--When this item was made free under the last Tariff, the object in view was to assist the saddlery and other industries. But it has been found that narrower widths of collar check and collar - cloths are being imported for other purposes.",97
701,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,--For what purposes?,97
702,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,For scouring cloths.,97
703,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,They make very expensive scouring cloths.,97
704,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Ver y likely. At any rate, they are Used for purposes other than those for which they were intended to be used Most of these collar cloths are more than a yard in width, and consequently the amendment will not inflict any injury. Item agreed to.

By inserting in sub-item (B) a comma after the word "" Fringes "" By omitting from sub-item (B) the words "" Braids n.e.i.; "" and inserting in their stead the following words :""Cotton Featherstitch Braids; Plain Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [3.7.a.m.]. - The object of this amendment is to make braids subject, to a duty. I have information in my possession to the effect that these braids are used, to a large extent, in manufacture, and that they are not made in Australia. Under these circumstances, I think that they may very fairly be exempt from duty.",97
705,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.9 a.m.] - The reason underlying this proposal is that, some three or four years ago, trimmings and ornaments, n.e.,i., for bonnets, hats, shoes, and other attire were made dutiable at 25 per cent, under the general Tariff, and 15 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. It is impossible to distinguish between some of these braids and the articles which are used for trimmings under 134A of the Tariff. Consequently, it is proposed that they shall be of a specific width. All braids over that width will be dutiable and the balance will be admitted free. Some of these braids cost more than ios. a yard, and are used only as ornaments for the very finest dresses. I do not think that all braids should be admitted free, seeing that some of them are of many colours and fancy patterns. As a matter of fact, they become a trimming in themselves 0 and should, therefore, be subject to a duty. However, I am willing to. exempt all braids under 2 inches in width.",97
706,Sir JOHN QUICK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Bendigo) [3. n a.m.] - I have already pointed out that this duty will be oppressive on the manufacturers of goods in Australia. These braids are necessary accessories to a madeup garment. They are not, strictly speaking, 'ornamental, in the sense that trimmings are ornamental, and I fail to see why a revenue duty should be placed upon braids which are necessary to the completion of a garment. I think that there is a well-known trade definition of braids which is sufficiently comprehensive to admit of a distinction being drawn between them and trimmings. Trimmings are distinctly ornamental and decorative in their character, whereas braids are necessary to the completion of garments. It is absurd to impose a duty upon an article which is a necessary component .part of a finished garment. Braids (other than Cotton Feather- Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond) [3.12 a.m.]. stitch) of one colour and not ex- - I would point out to the Committee that ceeding one inch in width,, but many of these braids are plain, and are not including braids containing manufactured up to 3 or 4 inches in width. gold silver or tinsel threads;"" They are used as bindings upon ladies' dresses.",97
707,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Not of that width.,97
708,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Yes .,97
709,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,A width of 2 inches would more than cover braids which are used for bindings.,98
710,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Onl y today I was looking at braids which are actually in use upon dresses, some of which were 3$ inches wide. I hold in my hand a black braid which is manufactured in all widths from a quarter of an inch to 4 inches. Whether a braid is separate or attached to a garment makes a great difference. This sample is over an inch wide, and dutiable, but when stretched in stitching it will not be an inch wide, and therefore not dutiable.",98
711,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The Minister agreed to exempt from duty all braids up to 2 inches in width.,98
712,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes . But the braid which - I have exhibited to honourable members varies in width from' a quarter of an inch to 3J inches. I think that all braids which cannot be made in Australia should be admitted free, especially when they are used in making up garments.",98
713,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Cook) [3.17 a.m.] - I understand that the Minister proposes to make an exemption in regpect of braid under 2 inches in width.,98
714,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"-Because they would be of the cheaper class of braids, and more largely used in the manufacture of the cheaper class of garments.",98
715,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I am satisfied that the Minister would not agree to exempt braids under 2 inches in width if this were really a Protective item. As these braids are not manufactured in Australia, *they should be removed from the list of dutiable articles, irrespective of their width.",98
716,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If the honourable member will look at item 134A, he will find that trimmings and ornaments are dutiable at 25 per cent, and 15 per cent., and it is difficult to distinguish between braids and trimmings.",98
717,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I do not think that there is any difficulty in determining what a braid is, and it appears obvious that this item is included in the Tariff for revenue purposes only.",98
718,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I can assure the honourable member that it is not. The proposal is made for the convenience of the Department, and to assist in interpretation. The object is that one oflicer shall not pass an article as a braid, and another class the same article as a trimming.",98
719,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The Minister, in submitting the amendment, has had no difficulty in determining what a braid is, or he would not have limited the width to 2inches.",98
720,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I am proposing to deal with braids not exceeding 1 inch in width, but I have agreed, at the request of the honourable member for Hume, to increase the width to 2 inches.",98
721,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I think the Minister should accept a further amendment to make the width 6 inches. As I have somerequests to make to the honourable gentlemanlater on, I shall not occupy more time on' this item.",98
722,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Darling Downs) [3.2* has a.m.] - I wish fo know from the Minister what would be the effect' of the proposed amendment to substitute commas for semicolons after the words ""buckles; clasps> slides; buttons "" in sub-item b. Is it intended that these articles with, fringes be governed by the letters n.e.i. following that word ? I wish to know if the amendment will make any difference in the incidence of the Tariff?",98
723,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.24 a.m.] - The object of the amendment is to bring buckles, clasps,, slides, and buttons under the n.e.i. provision, with the exception of gold and silver buckles, which are specially dutiable under another item of the Tariff. Amendment (by Mr TUDOR) agreed toThat the words "" one inch "" be left out, witha view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" two. inches."" Item, as amended, agreed to.

724,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Fremantle) [3.26 a.m.].. - I should like to know from the Minister whether the insertion of the word "" service , r as proposed will not affect gunstocks and barrels that are not fitted, and which may be required for other than service work, and may so bring these articles under someother part of the Tariff in which they wouldi be dutiable.",98
725,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The word ""service,"" if inserted as proposed, will govern only the word ""fittings,"" and the articles referred? to by the honourable member will not beaffected by the amendment. Item agreed to. Item 141By omitting the whole of sub-item (c). Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [3.30 a.m.] - This item refers to lamp and gas stoves for heating and cooking, which are subject to a duty of 20 per cent. Will this include motor lamps? I do not see why these lamps should not be dutiable.",98
726,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I think that motor lamps are dutiable; if they do not come under 141A, which provides for lamps and so forth, they will come under manufactures of metal.",99
727,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If so, I am satisfied; but that is not how the position has been represented' to me. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [3.31 a.m.] - If this item be omitted as proposed, will not lamps and gas stoves for cooking and heating, which now bear a duty of 20 per cent., be automatically transferred to item 170A, and be subject to a duty of 30 and 25 per cent. ?",99
728,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Yes ; I said so in the statement. I made when I introduced the Tariff. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - What is the object of this? These lamp stoves are used by the wage-earners and the poorer sections of the community. What anomaly is being rectified by means of this increase ?,99
729,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.33 a.m.] - Whil e all other stoves are rated at 30 and 25 per cent., there is no reason why gas stoves should escape with a lighter duty.",99
730,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I am convinced that not a single kerosene stove of the stamp contemplated by the item is made in Australia.,99
731,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Many 'of the gas companies absolutely refuse to deal in Australian stoves. It is impossible to hire an Australian stove from the Melbourne Metropolitan Gas Company; a consumer must take an imported stove or none. In 1.908, the importation of these stoves represented £41,000, and in 1910 it represented £57,000. Lamp and gas stoves are not separated in the statistics, but the bulk of those imported are gas stoves. I do not know whether lamp stoves are made here or not, but gas stoves are.",99
732,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Why do the gas companies not use Australian stoves?,99
733,Mr HALL,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Because Australian stoves do not use as much gas as other stoves do!,99
734,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I do not know the reason. The importations are .valued at £33,500 from the United Kingdom, £6,700 ""from Germany, £8,800 from Sweden, £7,400 from the United States. In the gas stove industry in New South Wales, most of those employed are under the W,ages Board, and the wages paid range from £ 2 ios. to £-5 6s."" per week.",99
735,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Hindmarsh) [3.36. a.m.] - I think the Minister ought to allow the item to remain. I have never seen an oil stove of the kind in Australia, except an imported one. I am now talking about the kind of kerosene stoves imported from America.",99
736,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,What about gas stoves?,99
737,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I was speaking of what are called gas stoves, but what are really kerosene stoves. I know that ordinary coal gas stoves are made in Australia, and I do not care a rap if a duty be placed on these; but it is sought to impose an increased duty on the kerosene stove which is used in every country household where families do not exceed about four, and where economy is desired. In such households no fuel is used except for warmth in the winter. I refer more particularly to the "" Preference"" stove, which is used not only in the country districts, but also in the cities.",99
738,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If I move an amendment to the effect that Primus and other similar lamp stoves or lamps shall be subject to a duty of 20.per cent., will that satisfy the honourable member ?",99
739,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes . Amendment (by Mr TUDOR) proposed - That this item be left out and the following words be inserted :"" 141. By omitting the present sub-item (c) and inserting in its stead the following sub-item :(C) Primus and other similar heating lamps, ad valorem, 20 per cent.""",99
740,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Cook) [3.40 a.m.]. - This item, in so far as it purports to include kerosene stoves, only confirms my suspicion that one of the main purposes of thisTariff revision is to obtain more revenue. The Minister's action in proposing to exempt these kerosene stoves from the higher duty is an admission that they ought to be placed on the free list-a n admission that, so far as these lamp stoves are concerned, this is not a Protective duty.",99
741,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I never admitted that; the honourable member for Hindmarsh said that they are not made here.,99
742,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Does the Minister accept that statement?,99
743,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I did, to facilitate matters, and because I thought the item of gas stoves of the more importance.",99
744,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Ga s stoves are made here, and I do not desire to be a party to the reduction of the duty in their case.",100
745,Mr THOMAS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Will not kerosene stoves - compete with the gas stoves?,100
746,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"No , because kerosene stoves are used only where gas is not available. The Government would not submit an item without ascertaining the probable effect; and surely they know that to raise the duty to 30 per cent, would mean extra revenue. Kerosene stoves - should be made free. I move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" a d valorem 20 per cent.,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word -"" free.""",100
747,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Hindmarsh) [3.45 a.m.] - I objected to the Minister's proposal, because I saw no reason for increasing the duty, as the articles are not made here.",100
748,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Twent y per cent, is a revenue duty.",100
749,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It is now; but I could never understand why Australian ingenuity has not been sufficient to invent a similar stove. A 20 per cent, duty would give Australians a show to do so. For that reason 1 urge the honourable member for Cook to withdraw his amendment. I have no particular love for the Standard Oil Company, to whom the stove belongs, but, while seeing that justice is done to our own people, we ought to give the Australian mechanic a chance to do something in this direction.",100
750,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [3.47 a.m.]. - The two speeches to which we have just listened prove the desirability of continuing the discussion of the Tariff on some occasion when we are a little more awake. The honourable member for Hindmarsh proposed a reduction of the duty because the articles are not made here, and then he said the duty must not be abolished altogether because that would prevent them from ever being made here. The bigger the duty, the sooner things will be made here, if they can be. This way of dealing with the Tariff is ""over the odds."" Is this a deliberative assembly, or is it a farce? Members are asleep all round the chamber. I cannot see why the user of an artificial stove in the city should be asked to pay a heavy price, while the user in the country is allowed to obtain it free of duty. The honourable member for Hume ought to be able to inform the Committee whether these articles are being constructed anywhere in Australia; but, under present conditions, we do not know enough about the item to pass it. Why should we not go home instead of passing items with half the Committee asleep, and the Government not caring, and prepared to compromise whenever any suggestion is made by a Government supporter? The Vacuum Oil Company has writtenICerosene cooking stoves and heaters are not manufactured in the Commonwealth, so that no local industry is affected by the importation of same. The manufacture of kerosene cooking stoves and heaters can only be carried on under enormous expense in providing suitable plant with which to manufacture the goods, and which goods are manufactured by the thousand in the United States of America, and, we believe, elsewhere. No attempt has ever been made to manufacture kerosene cooking stoves and heaters in the Commonwealth, because the demand for same would not warrant the necessary expenditure in providing suitable plant for the manufacture of these goods, and as there is no local industry to protect, it seems somewhat of an anomaly to further increase the rate of duty on these goods, which are principally used by people of moderate means throughout the Commonwealth, and in districts in which it is practically impossible to obtain wood, except at a prohibitive cost. We should know what the price of these stoves is. It may be fair to tax them if they are a luxury, but they should not be taxed if used chiefly by the poor.",100
751,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"A standard heater costs about £ 2 ios., and a half size about £ 1 ios., with the present duty of 20 per cent.",100
752,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"A duty of 20 per cent, probably increases the price by 30 per cent, to the purchaser. Probably if admitted free the stoves would not cost more than 36s.",100
753,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Brisbane) [4.5 a.m.]. - I regret that the Minister is willing to allow kerosene stoves to remain at a duty of 20 per cent. There are two kinds of these stoves on the market in Queensland. Australians, as a rule, are inclined to purchase the imported, rather than the locally manufactured article, and a higher duty would give a stimulus to the local manufacturers. I should like to see the duty increased by at least 5 per cent. The makers of the ordinary fuel stoves also deserve consideration.",100
754,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,They have a protection of 30 and 25 per cent.,100
755,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I know that because of the competition of America and England they are not in a happy position. The increased cost of material, and the increased rates of wages, have practically taken away the margin of profit.",100
756,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,In what part of Queenshave land are'kerosene stoves made?,101
757,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"In Brisbane. The Americans are clever inventors, because of the protection of their Tariff, and it appears to be the fact that, under Free Trade less inventive ability is.shown than under Protection. Then, too, in America the people are willing to support local inventions. If we were more patriotic in that respect, our manufactures would develop more rapidly.",101
758,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Cook) [ 4 . "" a.m.]. - I am sorry that the honourable member for Brisbane did not speak earlier. Had he done so I should not have moved my amendment, and, under the circumstances, I ask leave to withdraw it.",101
759,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [4.13 a.m.]. - Before the amendment is withdrawn, we should be informed definitely as to the price at which these stoves are sold in Brisbane. Are they stoves, which can compete with the Primus, selling at about the same price? We should have full information before the amendment is withdrawn.",101
760,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Parramatta) [4.15 a.m.] - Has the Minister any information regarding the manufacture of stoves in Brisbane?,101
761,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,No .,101
762,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I marvel at what the Department does not know. The Minister should send the honourable member for Brisbane into his Brisbane office, and discharge his highly-salaried men there, who, while supposed to be looking after the local manufactures, are unable to give him the information needed by the Committee. This is not the first time that we have had to grope our way through Tariff discussions in the dark. I ask the Minister what is the intention in re-arranging these duties? Is it to give protection to the manufacturers of oil stoves?",101
763,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.17 a.m.] - I have already explained that all stoves, except lamp and gas stoves, are dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent., and it is not thought right to treat these stoves, particularly gas stoves, differently. I have no information regarding the stoves to which the honourable member for peatedly. Brisbane referred, but I am informed that gas stoves are made here. On the suggesthem in Brisbane? tion of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, it is proposed to make other lamp stoves dutiable at 20 per cent., and to apply the higher rates to gas stoves.",101
764,Mr ANSTEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Bourke) [4.19 a.m.] - I endeavoured to expedite business by remaining silent, but as we have had two hours' discussion of the proposal of the honourable member for Cook, which I assume was put forward only after serious consideration, I do not think that it should be withdrawn without further explanation. The honourable member for Brisbane, with his lovely Doric voice, asked for stimulusfor the stove-making industry, and immediately the honourable member for Cook asked leave to withdraw his amendment. Under die circumstances, it is not surprising if honourable members occupy time in discussing the matter. As I have no further remarks to make, I shall resume my seat.",101
765,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Parramatta> [4.24 a.m.] - It is time to protest against the frivolity and inanity of these proceedings.,101
766,Mr THOMAS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,This is a burlesque.,101
767,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That happily describes what is taking place. It is a pity that the Minister has not more information, so that we may check the statementsmade by other honourable members. If "" stoves are being made in Brisbane, the industry there is as much entitled to Protection as that of any other place. But we should know who is making these stoves,, and at what prices they are being sold. Mere general statements are worthless. Indie interests of his constituents, the honourable member for Brisbane should give usfurther details. We have heard from timeto time of the wonderful forests of whitepine that exist in Queensland. It is abouttime that the truth of some of these statements was demonstrated to honourable members. If they can be proved to be true, so much the better for Queensland and for her industries, but these general statementsmean nothing in the absence of verification. All the evidence we have now is that givenby the honourable member for Brisbane, and' he confesses that he knows nothing about the working of these stoves. It is up to the honourable member or to the Minister to assure the Committee that such stoves are actually being made.",101
768,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I have seen them re,101
769,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Who is making,101
770,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I could not tell tfiePrimus and names of the makers.,101
771,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Has the honourable member any idea of what they cost? If we impose this duty,- are they likely to be as cheap as are imported kerosene stoves ? .In the absence of any particulars of this kind, is it fair to ask us to impose this - duty ?",102
772,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,We are not asked to Queensland. impose any duty.,102
773,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,What does the honourable member mean by that?,102
774,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It is not proposed to raise the duty at all, as far as ordinary kerosene stoves are concerned. We are simply putand ting them at the same rate as all other be 20 per cent. - stoves.",102
775,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"There is not for. much objection to that. We are supposed to be arranging these duties for the purpose of stimulating the industries of Australia, and also for stimulating the inventive faculnow,ties of the people. The honourable member for Brisbane spoke of the way in which Americans bring out patents. Is my honfresh orable friend aware that, according to officials of the Patent Office 'here in Meleven bourne, Australians are more inventive people than Americans? I hope that the Minister will give us a little more informatured tion about these items as we proceed. Insupplying stead of doing so, he leaves us to blunder along.",102
776,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I have given tion twice.,102
777,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I am satisfied now that I have got it, but does not the Minister think that his Department ought know what is taking place in regard to these industries ? Is he going to investigate the statements made by the honourable memdrawing ber for Brisbane? I am going to let this item go on the strength of that honourable member's statements, because i stoves are being made in Brisbane they have just as much right to a duty as any . other stoves. So far, however, we have only the unsupported statement of the honourable member, who cannot even tell us the names of the stoves or of their makers. It the strength of information of that that we are shaping this Tariff. Can it be wondered at that we have constantly re-adjusting duties? One would not allow a builder to erect a house on such informahonorable tion as that on which we profess to building a Tariff that controls and domiI nates the industries of this country.",102
778,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wimmera) [4.36 tion. a.m.] - I am quite prepared to vote for any duty that will encourage the manufacfirms ' ture of local articles, but we surely require a little more information in regard to Primus stoves. I have looked up the Tariff Commission's report, and find that they investigated this subject. They took evidence from the manufacturers of cooking stoves in New South Wales and The Protectionist section of the Tariff Commission decided, however, that they would not recommend an increase of duties. They appear to have made a fairly full investigation as to the different classes of stoves manufactured in Australia, they recommended that the duty should",102
779,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,That is all I am asking,102
780,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Apparently , kerosene stoves were not being made in Australia three years ago. If they are being made there has been a development in our manufactures. Certainly no request was made for a duty for these articles. No information has been supplied except the by the honourable member for Brisbane, and he could not give particulars as to the name of the manufacturers. If evidence can be given that they are being manufacin a way that gives a promise of their Australian requirements, there is a justification for the duty, but in the absence of that information, I shall have to the informavote against the item.",102
781,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Moreton) [4.39 a.m.]. - The honourable member for Cook has moved an amendment to this item, which he to now proposes to withdraw. In fact, he is so much interested in the question that at this moment he is asleep. He is withhis amendment on the statement of the honourable member for Brisbane, who, said that Primus stoves are being made in f these the city which he represents.",102
782,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"No , I did not.",102
783,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If I misunderstood the honourable member I beg his pardon, but I fancy that the Committee understood is on him to say that Primus and Perfection kind stoves were made in Brisbane.",102
784,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,He said that he had to be seen them in Brisbane.,102
785,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I should like the member to name a firm in Brisbe bane which makes kerosene stoves. While am not against the duty I think that the Committee is entitled to reliable informa,102
786,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I know half-a-dozen in Brisbane which sell kerosene stoves.. Mr .SINCLAIR - I endorse the honourable member's statement with regard to the languishing condition of the stove industry. Quite a number of gas and ordinary household stoves are made, but the industry needs a little more help, which I am prepared to grant. I shall not support the reduction of the duty even on Primus stoves, but I think that we have a right at this hour of the morning to protest against needless waste of time.",102
787,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [4.41 a.m.]. - I did rather resent the remarks of the honourable member for Moreton, because the honourable member for Cook was in a very difficult position. He moved in good faith for the reduction of the duty. He was given to understand by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and also by the admission of the Minister, that no such stoves are made in Australia. He did not move against an industry in existence here but against a revenue duty- a duty which would never have any Protective value. Other honourable members perceived the force of his proposal and debated it, and then suddenly the honourable member for Brisbane rose and said that he had seen such stoves made in Brisbane.",103
788,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,So have I ; in South Melbourne.,103
789,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The honourable member knows they are made in Australia?,103
790,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Yes .,103
791,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Our only difficulty has been that we cannot get this information from the Department. I do not blame the Minister, who is infinitely preferable to his predecessor in conducting a Tariff through the Chamber. If there has been any waste of time it has been due to the fact that the Department has failed to supply the information to which the Committee is entitled.",103
792,Mr GORDON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Boothby) [4.45 a.m ] Like the honourable member for Bourke, I have been practising a good deal of selfrestraint. With the exception of one or two amendments I should have been prepared to allow the remaining items in the schedule to pass. I am very glad that on the item before the Committee the Minister has seen his way clear to follow the lead of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. The question of fuel supply becoming one of the most serious items in domestic economy, and the Primus stove is becoming a necessary article in every particularly in the summer months. I am pleased that the Minister has seen his way to make the duty as low as possible. If it can be shown at any time that there is any firm or inventor who can provide a stove equal to that which is imported from America I shall be prepared to vote for a duty to help a deserving industry. But I think that that time has not yet arrived-, and that we should be doing a serious injustice to the people if we levied a higher duty than that which is proposed by the^ Minister.",103
793,The CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Is it the pleasure of the Committee that the honourable member for Cook have leave to withdraw his amendment ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang> [4.47 a.m.] - I object. If the honourable member for Cook is serious I am prepared to support his proposal to remove the difficulties which are proposed to be placed in the way of persons getting these stoves at a reasonable price. The only effect of the duty will be to enhance the price of the article to the working classes.' The Primus stove has been found to be very handy, and very economical in places where cheap gas and other cheap fuel are not available. These stoves cannot be and are not manufactured in Australia. This is purely a revenue duty. Again, there is no anomaly to be rectified. I marvel' that the honourable member for Cook should seek to withdraw the proposal which he made in face of his declaration that he would not support any revenue duty. He has declared that this is a pure revenue duty.",103
794,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Since then, I have had further information from the honourable member for Brisbane. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHN""SON - The honourable member has not had any reliable information, and there has not been any evidence to substantiate the statement that these stoves are made in any part of Australia, or any stove which comes into competition with them. I hope that the amendment will be pressed to a division. Amendment of the amendment negatived. Amendment agreed to. Item 147By inserting in sub-item (A) after the wore? is ""grain "" the letters ""n.e.i.""",103

797,Mr CHARLTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member stops away one week, and then comes here and keeps us up all night. Mr J"". H . CATTS - The honourable member is talking through his neck like a blatant fool.",104
798,The CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Order . Orable member will withdraw that remark.,104
799,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I do so, sir, and ask you to protect me against these insults.",104
800,The CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I will protect the honourable member.,104
801,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I admit that probably during the last hour a little time might have been saved, but I submit that up to that point reasonable progress has been made. It is impossible for us to deal with the whole of the Tariff at one sitting.",104
802,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I understand that the Prime Minister desires that the Tariff should go right through at the present sitting. I am quite prepared to go on.,104
803,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Then we shall have a few divisions.,104
804,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I am quite prepared for that.,104
805,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Some honourable members are in bed all night, while others are here to do the business.",104
806,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I have not closed my eyes.,104
807,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Parramatta) JJ4.52 a.m.] - I also ask that we should be allowed to get a little sleep before proceeding further with this item.,104
808,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I have not the slightest objection to the honourable member having some sleep.,104
809,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,But I want to be here to do my duty while the items are going through. I was very much surprised at the loud demand by the honourable member for Hunter that we should go on.,104
810,The CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member should not refer to that matter, as it has been settled. Item agreed to. It e m 148By inserting in the item after the word "" Refrigerators "" the words "" other than for household use."" Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [4.53 a.m.] - Unde r item 148 of the Tariff a duty of 25 per cent, is imposed on churns of all kinds, cheese-presses, dairy coolers, refrigerators, supply cans, incuof bators n.e.i., and foster-mothers. Minister might explain the reason for making the proposed alteration. So far as I have been able to discover, it will be another blow at the householders, particularly the wage-earners, who seem to be aimed at all the time. The effect of the alteration will be to bring household refrigerators under item 299A, "" furniture,"" dutiable at 35 and 30 The hon- - per cent., being an. increase of 10 per cent, against the householder, or 5 per cent, if British articles are used. Where is the anomaly that is being rectified to justify this further increase?",104
811,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I tried to show where the anomaly comes in when I was introducing the Tariff. I shall do so again. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The Minister's interjection shows the necessity of dealing with general principles, - and not with details, when he is introducing the Tariff. At nearly 5 o'clock in the morning we are expected to remember all that was said several days ago. Perhaps he will now explain the reason for this alteration.",104
812,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.55 a.m.]. - When refrigerators were included in this item they were understood to be refrigerators used in connection with dairying, and not the ordinary ice-chests which are used in households. As every one knows, the latter are articles of furniture.",104
813,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Does the honourable, member think that they are imported?",104
814,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I believe that nearly all of the ice-chests which are used are imported. There is no reason why they should not be made here. In Victoria, and, I believe, in New South Wales too, the men who are engaged in the furniture trade or in ordinary factories are working under Wages Boards, and the rate of wages runs from £ 2 16s. to £ 3 4s. a week.",104
815,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Cook) [4.56 a.m.]. - I think the proposal of the Minister in this case is quite justified. It does seem to be an anomaly that ice-chests tor household purposes should not be dutiable, whereas similar appliances which are not for household purposes should be dutiable.",104
816,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"They have been dutiable, but they will now come in at a higher rate.",104
817,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,They are being put into their proper classification now?,104
818,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,That is so.,104
819,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"In spite of a duty 25 per cent., these articles are not being The made here.",104
820,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"They are. The making of an ice-chest is one of the simplest mechanical operations, and I was surprised to hear that any were being imported. I do not regard this as the introduction of a new item, but as the rectification of an apparent anomaly.",105
821,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Wentworth) [4-57 a.m.]. - It has been represented to me that it is rather extraordinary that cheese caps should be dutiable.,105
822,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"They do not come under this item. Mr KELLY.'-No , but they come under a kindred item. I suggest to the Minister that he might ascertain why they are not admitted free, like cheese wrappings.",105
823,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Piec e goods are 5 per cent, or free. If persons like to get in the material free, surely there is no difficulty in cutting out the caps here.",105
824,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It is a rather vexatious proceeding; in fact, it is not worth the trouble. At any rate, I make the suggestion to the Minister.",105
825,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I shall be very pleased to look into the matter. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [4.58 a.m.] - It is perfectly clear now that the object in taking out refrigerators and safes for household use is so that the cost of the articles shall be increased to the householder by being brought under a higher duty. This is, I think, a gross injustice to the householder, who needs these articles to keep food fresh and who'esome, and to keep flies and other pests from destroying it. In order to encourage the use of these safes as much as possible in the interests of public healfh, I move That the following words be added- "" ReTariff), frigerators and meat safes for household use cent."" free."" Mr TUDOR.^Meat safes come in under the head of furniture now.",105
826,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Parramatta) [5.0 a.m.] - The duty, so far as refrigerators for household use are concerned, is being increased from 25 per cent, to 35 per cent, as against the foreigner, and a preference of 5 per cent, is now proposed in the case of imports from the United Kingdom. Originally, no preference was granted, but it will be small comfort to the manufacturers of refrigerators in Great Britain to know that this preference to them takes the shape of a 5 per cent, added duty. This is about the trickiest Tariff schedule I have ever seen. By a mere alteration of phraseology, the Minister makesit impossible for us to test these items. I should like to move a reduction of the duty on imports from Great Britain, with a view "" of increasing the preference, but I cannot owing to the way in which the item is submitted to the Committee. We have not been able to obtain a 5 per cent, preference for goods from the dear old Mother Country all night.",105
827,Mr THOMAS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It is too bad.,105
828,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"We well remember how the Minister of External Affairs, with tears in his voice, used toplead for preference for the dear old Mother Country.",105
829,Mr THOMAS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That is not correct, but it is near enough for the honourable member. I used to oppose any preference.",105
830,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I repeat that it is correct.,105
831,Mr THOMAS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,But no one will believe the honourable member if he does say so.,105
832,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I ask that that remark be withdrawn.,105
833,Mr THOMAS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I withdraw it.,105
834,Mr JOSEPH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COOK - Will the Minister point out how I may move in the direction I have indicated?,105
835,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It is open to the honoiable member to move the insertion of a new sub-item.,105

We now propose to define "" cutlery "" in the terms of the new . item, so that the ordinary silver ferruled article will not be treated as a silver article. Thsre will be a uniform rate of duty for all these knives, forks, and spoons, and it will be slightly lower, so far as spoons are con. cemed, than that at present levied.",106

Under the old Tariff they were dutiable at 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, respectively.

But before the Tariff is finally dealt with elsewhere, the Government will, if that course be deemed desirable, take steps to secure the insertion of a qualification which will make the position perfectly clear.

I understood the Minister to say that the tanks were imported full of goods, and consequently I could not understand how they were landed. But ' the Minister's explanation has dispelled my - doubts.

The proposal is that tanks not exceeding 400 gallons in capacity, whether . they be imported empty or as containers of .goods, should be admitted free. Previously - .all tanks, irrespective of whether they contained goods or were imported empty, were thus admitted.

The 400-gallon tank is that in which articles such as mustard are imported into Australia. These tanks I suggest compete with tanks of local manufacture which are admirably adapted to the purposes for which they are intended to be used.

As a result they ask for the imposition of a higher duty. I do not press the matternow, but I would like the Minister to promise that he will consider their request.

The increase of 50 per cent, between the two is out of all proportion as you could get barytes ground for about ios. per ton. It is a soft ore and easily ground. What really is wanted is a higher duty on the ore, say 2s. 6d. per cwt., and on the ground product 3s. per cwt. production of barytes is essentially a poor man's industry, and, moreover, one that a person suffering from miner's complaint can carry on, because, in the greater number of instances, it is purely a surface mining industry. To make a difference of 20s.. per ton in favour of the product will simply be giving the greater part of the increased protection to the miller and not to the producer. I ask the Minister, in view of the fact that this is a poor man's industry, which may be engaged in even by men who have suffered from miners' phthisis, to accept the suggestion of my correspondent and make the duty on crude barytes 2s. 6d. per cwt., and on the ground product 3s. per cwt.",110

892,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"As a rule small packages are dutiable at a higher rate of duty than goods in bulk, because they are usually packed ready for use. The honourable member has referred to the size of a package of magnesium carbonate 14 lbs. in weight, but he will admit that a package of Portland cement or of plaster of paris of the same weight would not be a very large package.

Dr CARTY SALMO N (Laanecoorie) [6.1 a.m..] - How will this item affect these chemicals when they are intended to be used for medicine and drugs, for which they are specially prepared, and are packed in smaller packages? It would be unfortunate to admit the larger quantities used for manufacturing at a lower rate than that charged in the case of medicines. Further, one of these substances is used very largely by hairdressers for application after shaving. It is imported in small blocks of a very refined character; and it would be a pity if it were subject to a high duty.",111

Cements, mucilage, and so forth have to pay duty, and dextrine, when admitted free, comes into competition with them. Further, so long as dextrine is free it will not be manufactured here. The Commonwealth Analyst points out that it is an anomaly that starch and starch flours should be dutiable while other products like dextrine should be free, seeing that dextrine is based on a comparatively simple process which might easily be performed here.

904,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"So far as I know the manufacture of easeine started before there was any thought of a duty. The whole of the easeine the manufacturers propose to make is, I understand, already sold for the export to Europe, where it is used in the manufacture of knife handles, buttons, and a variety of other articles. Of course, if the duty is asked for and needed I am willing that it should be imposed, because a large factory is being started in my electorate, and I do not desire to see it exposed to competition, from abroad.",112

Bill duty was proposed at 2d. per lb., which passed the Houses the first instance, but was afterwards rescinded,, and dextrine was placed on the free The duty now proposed is 25 per cent, on I ask the English invoice price. This material is largely used as an adhesive in making up cardboard boxes, envelopemaking, and paper manufactures. It is also used extensively in leather manufactures and in the hat. industry,, as. well as many others. No firm of boxmakers in South Australia has. any knowledge of this material being, made in the Commonwealth, nor have they eveT received samples: of quotations frorri local manufacturers. These increased duties on the raw material used in manufactures, combined with. the. added rates of wages, will so. addto the cost of producing, many articles that they will be imported at less cost than they can be made up in the Commonwealth, which will mean less work for our employees, and reduction in. the staff of workers.",112
907,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Richmond) [6.23 a.m.]. - I understand that a number-of industries use this substance a good deal. I do not want to see any article made dutiable if it cannot be manufactured here. Dextrine is made from potato starch, and it is as much as Australia can do to supply enough potadutiable toes for its own use.",112
908,Mr HALL,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Werriwa) [6.25 a.m.] - I see no reason why we should tax the raw material of industries, unless there is a reasonable prospect of making it here. If the Minister can show that there is a reasonable prospect of manufacturing dextrine in Australia, I am prepared to vote for the duty. Otherwise, it should be free.",113
909,Mr RYRIE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"North Sydney) [6.27 a.m.]. - The imposition of a duty on dextrine will be a hardship on many manufacturers, who use it largely. It is not manufactured in Australia, and it is to no one's interest to impose a duty on it. I move^That the word ""dextrine"" be left out.",113
910,Mr CANN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Nepean) [6.28 a.m.] - I cannot see the force of the Minister's argument, for I know no one in the Commonwealth who is manufacturing dextrine, which is used largely as a raw material by boxmakers, printers, and bookbinders. To raise it from free to 30 per cent, is a big jump. Only last Saturday 1 was shown a box in Sydney by one of the directors of Firth's, and was told that they used a large quantity of it.",113
911,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Firth' s do not use it. The secretary told me so.,113
912,Mr CANN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member's information may be more accurate than mine, but since I came here this week another Sydney box manufacturer said he could get no other substance that answers the purpose so well.

I hope both this and the strawboard duty will be left out.",113
913,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Brisbane) [6.32 a.m.] - There is considerable strength in the Minister's argument that dextrine is one of four substances that seem to have a common use, but, in view of the objections to raising the duty suddenly to 30 per cent., the Minister might make the duty on the whole item 20 per cent. These four substances enter largely into the manufacture of other articles, and dextrine is not manufactured here. [i55]- 2",113

916,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [6.35 a.m.]. - I cannot understand why these irritating pin-pricks should be inflicted upon the greatest of the many noble industries of which Australia is so justly proud. We are making envelopes and, even more important, boxes, and dextrine is a raw material in both industries, which are dependent on the Tariff for their existence. The duty on strawboard is most serious to the box-making industry, which employs 5,000 persons, and is being suddenly hit in its raw material.",113
917,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [6.39 a.m.] - It is said that this article is largely used in a struggling industry. Twenty-one thousand pounds worth of dry gums, sandarc, dextrine, and mastic was imported into the Commonwealth last year, of which over £14,000 worth came to Victoria alone. There has not been a single complaint from Victoria, so far as I know, about the imposition of duty on this article as a raw material. I do not care to do what the honourable member for Brisbane suggests.. Recently an importer delivered four samples for analysis, representing two lines, which he said were used by box manufacturers to replace dextrine, and which he thought should also be on the free list. On examination they were found to be practically the same substance.",113

920,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Maribyrnong) [6.49 a.m.] - The master masons and working masons of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia ask for the insertion of the following sub-itemsMarble, unwrought (white Carrara), including rough and scabbled from the pick, free. Slabs or scantlings (white Carrara), sawn on one or two faces, free. Slabs or scantlings (while Carrara), sawn on one or two faces and one or more edges, ad valorem, 10 per cent. Australian coloured or spotted marble is well protected.",114
921,Dr CARTY SALMON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"We have white marble, too.",114
922,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If we have white marble equal to the white Carrara, I am prepared to extend protection to it. The masons also ask for this itemWrought, n.e.i., ad valorem, 40 per cent. That is in place of the Government proposal, which is 35 per cent. The SecreAYES. tary to the Marble and Stone Workers' Union of Melbourne and Sydney writesNotwithstanding any assertions to the contrary, there is at present no suitable white marble in Australia, and there is no prospect of any being Salmon, Dr Carty placed on the marked; therefore, it is in the interests of the workers to have the same placed Spence, W. G. on the free list. As to the admission free of slabs or scantlings sawn on one or two faces, he saysThis proposal practically means unwrought Tellers: material, as all the work with the exception of the sawing is done by the workmen in Australia. Watkins, D . The reason advanced for placing the 15 per cent, NOES. on was on account of the sawing plants here. But notwithstanding this duty, not one single slab of Carrara has been sawn here. Therefore, it is very questionable protection for the workers ID impose a duty which has the elTec'. of lowering the duty on the wrought, and the difference of 15 per cent, on the practically unwrought and the finished article is totally inadequate. It is thought that 10 per cent, is enough to put on slabs or scantlings sawn on one PAIRS. or more edges, as invariably the sawn edges have to be masoned, and there should be at least 30 per cent, between these and the .finished article. As to the duty on wrought marble, n.e.i., it is said that the Government proposal is not high enough Under the old duty of 30 per cent, headstones and table tops, & c , of the plainest description, have been imported, and the disparity of the wages paid in Italy and Australia accounts for the importation. Unfortunately, the majority of the employers in this industry are indifferent as to whether the profit is made by the imported article or the locally-worked. Whilst 40 per cent, may be a high duty in some cases, in this it is a very moderate one, and is not as much as desired. At the present time the large furniture manufacturers, including the Chinese, import table tops largely. . . The whole of this work should be done here. The coloured marbles of which we have large deposits here, are provided for in the old sub-items (A), (U), and (c). We are of the opinion that if the foregoing subitems and the increase on the wrought to 40 per cent, are carried, the workers will benefit to a considerable extent, and the polishing branch will be quite a flourishing industry in itself. These requests come from practically all the States, and from both employees and employers. Whatever our fiscal faith may be, we ought to give reasonable consideration to such representations as these. I appeal to honourable members to assist me in this matter, and hope that the Minister will take into consideration the suggestion made in the document I have quoted.",114
923,Mr GORDON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Boothby) [6.58 a.m.] I do not expect that the Minister will be able at this juncture to do what I should like. I draw attention to the fact that we have in South Australia very important flagstone quarries. Considerable difficulty is found in competing in the Melbourne and Sydney markets against the imported article. Italian and other slates are being brought to Australia on a freightage which is not higher than the freightage from Port Adelaide to Melbourne and Sydney. It seems rather ridiculous that that should be the condition of the freight market, but nevertheless it is a fact that Italian stone entering into competition, with the Mintaro flagstone quarries. These South Australian slates have a world-wide reputation. Their quality is such that they are being used today in the new Federal buildings in Melbourne, as Well as in other official structures. There is no question of their quality. If honourable members can see their way to give this important South Australian industry a measure of protection, I hope that they will do so, if not on the present occasion, at least when the next amending Tariff Bill is brought down.",114
924,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Hume) [7.0 a.m.] - The question of granting protection to the Australian marble quarries is not new to us. We had a strong fight about it when the last Tariff was being debated. man to whomwe were chiefly indebted for information respecting white marble was Mr Summers, of Melbourne. At that time certain white marhle quarries at Bathurst were being developed. This stone is not at its best when obtained near the surface, because it is discoloured by percolations from ironstone and other earths. At the time to which I refer it was not known whether the quality of the marble would improve as the quarries were worked further down. Since then they have been developed to a considerable extent, and I am informed that the marble obtained is as pure as any that can be found at Carrara or elsewhere. This marble is being used very largely in Sydney. The only man whom I have found to be against a good Protective duty is an importer in George-street, who does a great deal of marble work, and who finds the Carrara marble softer, and therefore easier to carve. The Australian white marble, however, is much more durable. A good deal of it is being used for tombstone and monumental work, for which purposes it is far better adapted than Carrara marble. Mr Summers furnished a report, which the Minister can get, on the marble obtained on the Murray. He showed that there were magnificent quarries of marble of all colours, in addition to white marble. find, turning up Hansard, that when the existing Tariff was under consideration we had a strong fight on this question. The division was 32 to 9. Amongst the majority were the honourable members for Cook, Macquarie, Parramatta, Swan, Darling Downs, Bendigo, Melbourne Ports, Wimmera, and Laanecoorie, as well as Mr. Watson and the late Mr Batchelor. The is vote was a decisive one. I hope that none of the protection will be removed, because the marble quarries have been developed to such an extent that the industry may now be considered to be established.",115
925,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Fremantle) [7.6 a.m.]. - I support the statement of the honourable member for Boothby in regard to the Mintaro slate. I believe it to be one of the finest slates in the world, and if, as he says, the industry is languishing through-the competition of imported slate, I shall be very pleased if the Minister will include a Protective duty in his next Tariff, even if he is not able to provide for it on the present occasion. I have personal knowledge that the slate is of first-class quality. The Mr TUDOR (Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [7.8 a.m.] - Wit h regard to the point raised by the honourable member for Boothby and the honourable member for Fremantle, if they will turn to item 264 of the existing Tariff, they will find that slates are there made dutiable. Practically the slate duties are on a par with the marble and granite duties. I think, however, that the marble and granite duties should be higher in proportion than those on slate. As to the point raised by the honourable member for Maribyrnong in conJiexion with the raw material for monumental masons, I may state that I made inquiries when the last Tariff was under discussion, and I was strongly supported by the honourable member for Hume. I voted against him in connection with the marble duty. In fact, I voted to make white marble free, because I did not then believe that we had good white monumental marble in Australia. I admitted that we had a good substitute. I am informed that there is not a monument of white marble, which is' Australian marble, in any Australian cemetery.",115
926,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Yes ; there are any number in the Waverley cemetery.,115
927,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I regret that I cannot see my way to accept the amendment sugI gested by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, though I candidly admit that I believe he is on the right lines. I am, however, prepared to accept the suggestion that there shall be an increase of the duty on wrought marble. I propose to make that duty 40 per cent. I therefore move That the following words be added : "" and on and after 14th December, 1911, ad valorem 40 per cent."" Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to.

928,Mr FULLER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Ulawarra) [7.15 a.m.]- I hope that the Minister will not insist the proposed alteration in this instance. doing so we shall be putting a premium on the manufacture of vinegar which will operate in a very unfair manner. Under this proposal there will be duty of 100 per cent., raising the rate from 6d. to is. per gallon. The whole of the importations come from the United Kingquality. dom, and the vinegar sent to us is absolutely the best that can be made. It is manulengthy factured wholly from malt. I object very strongly to the raising of duties cent, against goods coming from the United Kingdom, particularly when they are of the - I Mr.amGREENE quality of such articles as Crosse and may be necessary Blackwell's vinegar, and other imported article which can be vinegars. The Minister has given no evitralia, but the local manufacturers dence to show that the Australian manugar say that they do not require this facturers of vinegar demand this duty. On the contrary, we have a statement made by According Mr Thurlow, a British manufacturer, that Courierthe existing duty is quite adequate. His largest firm is the largest manufacturer of vinegar in Australia. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) increased [7.18 a.m.] - I desire to read a statement which I have received from a firm particusold larly interested in this item. I refer Scott, Henderson and Company, of ney, who sayWe beg to draw your attention to the extraordinary statement made by Mr Tudor, Minister of Customs, as reported in the Daily Telegrafh of the 1st instant, page 9. said, inter alia"" At present vinegar was dutiable at two rates, and his analyst contended that it was impossible to tell malt and fruit .from other vinegar. The new duty would be is. all round instead of 6<fon the malt and fruit and 2s. on the-, other class."" We beg to say that the duty has been 6d. per gallon on vinegar of any description up to6 per cent, acetic acid, the apparent object being, to equalize the duties on the former and on concentrated vinegar, which used to be importedhere for the purpose of sale after reduction by water. That is a statement from a firm who know what they are talking about, and who areparticularly interested in this commodity. In the light of what he states in that communication, I submit that we ought to befurnished with fuller information as to thereason for the increase.",116
929,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of 6 per Trade and Customs) [7.22 a.m.] - The Tariff Commission recommended two ratesof duty, namely, 6d. per gallon if the vinegar was made from malt or grain or fruit juice, and 2s. per gallon if it was not the upon product of malt-that is, ordinary wood' By vinegar. The Analyst advises that it is impossible to tell one kind from the other. I have not the slightest doubt that most of the vinegar which is imported is made from an increase of inferior materials.",116
930,Mr FULLER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,That which comes from the United Kingdom is mostly of the best,116
931,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If there is to be a fight, I would sooner abandon theitem, and let the article fall under the old* 100 per rate of 6d. per gallon. (Richmond) [7.24 a.m.]. prepared to vote any duty which> for the protection of any manufactured in Ausof vineduty. to a paragraph in the BrisbaneMessrs. R. W. Thurlow and Company, themanufacturers of vinegar in Australia,, state with reference to the proposed Tariff in crease on vinegar that they made no request for protection, and they consider the old duty quite adequate. The best brands of Australian vinegar are in the open market at 6s. per dozento quarts cased, while Champion's pure malt SydEnglish vinegar, which commands thelargest sale in Australia, sells at 9s., so that the former is underselling the latter by 3s. per dozen. Mr Tudor Air. TUDOR - The value of that which was imported last year was 2s. 3d. pergallon.",116
932,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I think that in these* circumstances an increase in the duty is not ^warranted. The Minister has stated that ""the reason for proposing an increase is that --the Department cannot distinguish between - the good article and that which we all ad-mit to be. bad. Surely it is most extra-ordinary that he should propose to lower - the duty on the bad article, and increase - the duty on the good article.",116
933,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member will see that, according to the reports made, - the one cannot be distinguished from the - other.",117
934,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I admit that, but where - is the logic in raising the duty on the good - article because the Department cannot distinguish the bad article from the good one? . Mr FINLAYSON (Brisbane) [7.26 - a.m.] - I have two objections to an altera-tion of the duty. My first objection is that - the duty of 2s. per gallon on the inferior vinegar has been so successful as to reduce ithe importation of the article to the value of ^ 5 a year. That proves its efficacy. To Teduce the duty by 50 per cent, will facilitate the introduction of the very thing we want To keep out. My second objection is --that the present rate of duty seems to have no prohibitive effect so far as local manu' fact'ure is concerned. Messrs. R. W. ""Thurlow and Company, of Brisbane, are - not, by any means, the only manufacturers - of vinegar in Australia. Australian manu' facturers are able to supply an article of ,-good quality at a reasonable price, and they ; say that they are doing sufficiently well not - to need an increase of the duty. The in-evitable result of increasing the duty will ""be to enable them to increase the price of vinegar by rd., 2d., or 3d. per bottle. As it enters into the everyday life of the - people, an increase in the duty would add an unnecessary burden to the taxpayers. ""These two objections, I think, should be sufficient to defeat the proposal.",117
935,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Darling Downs) [7.28 -.a.m.] - I sympathize with the desire of the Minister. I draw his attention to a suggestion made by a correspondent to the press in BrisbaneThere should be no difficulty in excluding 'importation of false vinegar if the authorities take the same action as they have in regard to synthetical-o r artificially made or imitation 'brandy, rum, and whisky. Let shipments of vinegar purporting to be pure be accompanied by a brewer's certificate countersigned by a Governmembers ment authority. I suggest that even if the Minister decides - to stand by the existing duty he should ito get this duty as well.",117
936,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [7.29 a.m.] - I am prepared to drop the proposed alteration and to allow the old item to stand. If we can tighten up the item, well and good. But the analysts say that it is absolutely impossible to distinguish one kind of vinegar from, the other.",117
937,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Melbourne Ports) [7.30 a.m.] - I regret that the Minister has decided to drop the item because of silly arguments advanced by several honourable members. I would suspect any manufacturer who told me that he did not want more duty. He must have some reason for saying that. Either he does not want other competitors, or he imports more largely than he manufactures. I under stood the Minister to say that, he would withdraw the proposal.",117
938,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes , and let the rate stand at what it was before, and try to get a Government certificate as to the purity of the vinegar.",117
939,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If the honourable member can do that I think that he will collect an enormous amount of revenue, because most of that which is imported is not made from malt but from some concoction, and is passed off as malt vinegar. Many honourable members will, I suppose, hold up their hands aghast at that reference by me to a so-called reputable firm. In Victoria we had to pass Food Acts to stop the use of a lot of imported stuffs. It is quite likely, as the honourable member for Richmond said, that while the Australian vinegar is offered at 6s. per dozen quarts, imported vinegar is sold at 9s., and that more of the imported article is sold. In Australia we have people who would buy bread from a baker in London every morning if they could get it telegraphed out. I hope that if the Minister has agreed to allow the item to drop with a view to making better provision in the future to protect fruit vinegar from any other, he will be able to do so, but I think that it is rather discrediting the officials. My view is that as the the honourable member had the opportunity he should have taken advantage of it. I hope that very shortly we shall have another Tariff, and that when it is before us next session the Government will make honourable sit every night until it is perfected.",117
940,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Maribyrnong) [7.34 try a.m.] - I.understan d that the Minister has assured the Committee that his analyst will get to work and find out the component parts of imported vinegar.,117
941,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It is absolutely impossible to tell them.,118
942,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Is it beyond the skill of the analyst to do so?,118
943,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes , according to the report of Mr Wilkinson, the Government Analyst, than whom, I suppose, there is not a better man in Australia.",118
944,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The locally made article will be in the same category as the imported article. I am sorry to hear that about an article which is used on the table every day. I hope that the Minister will exercise, with his officers, the strictest vigilance over the importation of vinegar.",118
945,Mr DEAKI N,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Ballarat) [7.36 a.m.] Surely the common-sense suggestion is that the test required to be applied is not to the constituents of the vinegar, although that may be desirable, but is simply as to its wholesomeness. Let the inferior article pay the higher duty. Item negatived. Items 275 (Ammonia) and 282 (Cyanide of Potassium, &c.) agreed to. It e m 284By omitting the whole of sub-item (A) and inserting in its stead the following sub-item :"" (A) Sheep washes and cattle and horse washes; insecticides and disinfectants in liquid form in drums containing not less than 5 gallons and, when in other than liquid form, in packages containing not less than 28 lbs., free. By inserting in sub-item (B) before the word ""insecticides"" the word "" for m a l in ; """,118
946,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Calare) [7.38 a.m.] - I wish to know the reason for proposing this change. In a previous Tariff the item was, contested very strongly, and it would seem that while the Minister agrees with a previous decision as to the quantity of 28 lbs., he proposes to eliminate a further concession in regard to the stuff which is contained in tins. Under the old item there was an exemption up to 5 gallons, as well as 28 lbs., and I wish to know the reason for the proposed change. Mr TUDOR $Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [7.39 a.m.] - Unde r this item sheep washes and cattle and horse washes, insecticides, and disinfectants are still free.",118
947,Mr DEAKIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Why free when ^60,000 worth is exported every year?",118
948,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That duty has not been altered. The only alteration is in connection with formalin, which has been added as a disinfectant. Formalin is being made here at a factory in which methylic alcohol is being produced, and it will now be dutiable at 10 and 15 per cent., according to the country of origin. Sub-item A, which relates to sheep-washes, is really designed to correct defective wording in the old schedule.",118
949,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Fremantle) [7.40 a.m.]., - Formali n is largely used in pickling wheat. On the recommendation of Professor Lowrie it has been used for that purpose with much success all over Western Australia, and I should be glad if the Minister could see his way clear to place i i on the free list.",118
950,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [7.42 a.m.] - Formali n is being manufactured on a commercial scale in Victoria, and the local production has had the effect of reducing the price from 12s. or 14s. per gallon to 8s. per gallon. Formalin is obtained from a waste product of the saw-mill trade, and this duty will thus assist a country industry. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [7.46 a.m.] - Formali n is used not only in connection with agricultural pursuits, but largely in hospitals and sick rooms, and it ought to be made as cheap as possible. Already in the absence of a duty the price has been reduced from 12s. to 8s. per gallon.",118
951,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It was probably reduced with the object of destroying the local industry. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The people got the benefit of the reduction, and the more general the use of formalin for disinfectant purposes the better for the health of the people. The Ministerial proposal, however, will increase the price of formalin, and make it more difficult for the poorer classes who live in the least sanitary houses to obtain it. In other words the Government are offering a premium to insanitary conditions. The death rate will be increased, and the health of the people will suffer as the result of this duty.",118
952,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Melbourne Ports) [7.50 a.m.] - The evident joy with which the honourable member for Lang urged that as the result of this proposal, formalin would be dearer and more difficult for the poor invalid to obtain, induces me to remind him that since its manufacture was commenced locally, the price has been reduced by 50 per cent. That alone constitutes a reply to the honourable member, who must know that i£ the importer could do so he would destroy the local industry, with the result that the price would at once be increased to the poor invalid.",118
953,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [7.52 a.m.] The medical profession all over the world is fomenting a crusade against flies as germ carriers. In America there are whole societies dealing with that very plague, and the Australian' Government is proposing to lend its assistance to that world wide project by imposing a special tax upon things which are mainly used in other countries for fighting the fly pest. In the very next item we find that fly papers are taken from the free list and made dutiable at 10 per cent. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Everythin g upon the classes I have mentioned. to encourage disease.",119
954,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"-Exactly . While the Godition vernment do everything to encourage by means of a. tax of this sort, they have already done something to discourage death, because they have put up the price of tombstones. Formalin is being used all over the world for the destruction of flies which are the pest of every table, and if the sary article as formalin. Minister of Trade and Customs, who adthat ministers the Pure Food Act, has any real desire to preserve the purity of the food of than it has ever been previously. the people, he will see that its purity they get it originally has not a chance being adulterated by flies. The fact that there is a formalin industry here is not post of 15 per cent. going to weigh with us. Surely we are not to put the profits of a small local in Australia. dustry against the health of the people. The Minister has stated that the local faclocally, tory is so successful that it has been able to figured upon the free list. to bring about a reduction in the price formalin fro m 14s. to 8s. per gallon.",119
955,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Migh t not that reduction be due to an attempt to wipe out the local industry ?,119
956,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If it is a struggling inand dustry, would it not be better to let i rather than the people die. There is difficulty in the manufacture of formalin.",119
957,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Then it will be readily manufactured here.,119
958,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,But the duty will mean an increased price to the people. I honourable members will vote to abolish these duties against fly destruction.,119
959,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Calare) [7.59 a.m.] - Formali n was originally free; the Minister is now proposing to place i a paragraph where it will be per cent, and 10 per cent, according to the country of origin. As the honourable member for Fremantle has very properly pointed out, formalin, during recent years,"" has come largely into use amongst farmers for the purpose of removing germ diseases, particularly smut, from wheat. It is also being used to a considerable extent in connection with stock. In New South Wales during the past two or three years sheep have been attacked by a veritable plague of flies, and great losses have occurred. The farmers and graziers are now using a preparation of formalin for the purpose of combating the plague. Any proposal to levy a duty upon this article-whic h has hitherto been admitted into the Commonwealth free-wil l inflict a grave injustice I trust that the Minister will allow the conof things, which has heretofore obdisease tained, to remain unaltered.",119

I have employed it in the seeding of hundreds of acres of wheat, and I say that formalin is much simpler to use than is bluestone. It is quite as effective,; is more easily handled. I fail to see t why the Government should subject it to'a. no duty. If it were a poison, or if it were an inflammable article, I could understand the Government prohibiting its importation. I am sorry, indeed, that it is to be subjected to a duty, because that will impose hope a handicap upon our producers throughout Australia. Somebody has evidently got the ear of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has been supplied with wrong but information. I ask him to reconsider the t in matter with a view to placing this article dutiable at 15 upon the free list. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [8.8 a.m.] - Jus t now the honourable member for Melbourne Ports made a statement which would lead us to believe that he intends to vote for the proposed duty at all costs, although not the slightest evidence has been forthcoming to show that a single worker iii the Commonwealth will be benefited by it Yet so recently as 7 th September, of the present year-as will be seen by reference to Hansard, page 199-the honourable member said I represent what I believe to be the largest manufacturing electorate in Australia. I have almost a Prohibitionist, and would keep out the country every article that could be manuarticle. factured in it ; but until we are able to protect the men who sent me here I shall not vote for any further protection to the manufacturers. The honourable member is now supporting this Bill despite that declaration. I claim his %'ote against the proposed tax. Again on page 201 of Hansard of the present year he is thus reported:'I desire to say to all manufacturers that I am as good a Protectionist as ever I was, but I do not intend to vote for any more protection until I am assured by the men employed, through their organizations, that the wages paid are sufficient to keep them in a civilized state. 'Has he made an inquiry in connection with this industry ? I do not think he has had time to do so. If the honourable member is a man of his word-and I believe that he is-h e must have overlooked the declaration, which is thus reported on page 199 of Hansard for the current yearI shall not vote for any further protection the manufacturers. During the referenda campaign, the Age said that the workers already enjoy New Protection. I deny it. It declared that New Protection was given by means of the Victorian Wages Boards and similiar tribunals in other States. I denv that the WagesBoards, as they exist, give protection to the workers in anything like the same sense that the manufacturers are protected by the Customs duties. In the face of these declarations I would like to know whether the honourable member is still of the same mind. Upon that occasion he took up a very heroic stand, but has he the courage to abide by it, and to refuse to sanction the imposition of an increased duty either upon this or any other item of the Bill until he has been assured that the employees in any industry thus protected shall share in the benefits which flow from that increased protection ?",119
961,Mr JOSEPH COOK,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Parramatta) [8.12 a.m.] - I should like to know from the Minister whether any great quantity of formalin is being manufactured in the Commonwealth at the present time. To myf mind this is one of the most important; items in the Tariff, seeing that it pro* foundly affects many branches of our pri« mary industries.",120
962,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [8.20 a.m] - I wish to remind honourable members that: formalin is used largely - to prevent thespread of disease.

Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [10.34 a.m.] - I am informed by those interested in the timber trade that the effect - of this proposal will be very injurious to their interests. I propose to quote some advantage passages from a circular issued by the ney Timber Merchants' Association, which, I suppose, has been sent to every member Building Trade. of tEe Committee, and which states the case used from the point of view of the timber . chants of the Commonwealth, who are before thoroughly conversant with of the tirade. They sayWe employ approximately 3,600 bands. We pay in wages yearly between ^455,300 and - ^470,000. We estimate the cost of labour in converting rough timber into dressed at is. 6d. per 100 feet , - super. Fifty per cent, of the work done in Sydney Mills is in New Zealand white pine and Rimu ' timbers' in the shape of dressing and re-sawing. - This timber is imported in the rough, and is - dressed in Sydney. Should the proposed duty of 2S. 6d. on New Zealand timbers remain, this 50 per cent, of our Sydney work would be lost to our workers. Notwithstanding the duty of 3s. per 100 feet on dressed timber for the past 10 years the importation has increased in some States, so 3s. is not enough to stop timber coming' in dressed. There is an average loss of 25 per cent, in s - converting rough timber into dressed flooring and lining, add _ 25 per cent, to the proposed duty of 2S. 6d.,""this will bring the duty on rough . timber higher than the duty on timber dressed. Although we lost this 25 per cent, of rough timber we have to pay duty on it . It takes 112.5 feet of rough timber to produce what is known in the trade as 100 feet of 4 x J dressed flooring, the duty on this 112.5 feet at 2s. 6d. would be 2s. g f d. The super of inch measurement of this 100 feet of dressed flooring making boxes, per 100 super, feet, is 87.5 feet, and would pay if imported dressed, under the 3s. duty 2s. 7£d., so the duty is less by 4S."" 2^d. per 100 feet on the finished article than would be paid on sufficient rough timber to manufacture the same quantity. If 2s. 6d. duty is imposed on rough timber, then we ask for a duty on rough box timber, cut to size, 8s. per 100 feet super, of inch, and 16s. on the same timber dressed. We wish to draw your attention tp the following facts referring to Imported Dressed Timber, and showing how Sydney trade will be bandsi ad. val., 10 per cent."" at a disadvantage should the extra 2s. be placed on white pine and Rimu timbers :s. d.

The above figures refer to 4 x £ lining, which is very extensively used in the Sydney Sydney Timber Merchant) convert 80 per cent, of their flooring and lining from rough timber. This timber is stacked merand seasoned in Sydney for at least six weeks being dressed, and, therefore, gives adthe requirements ditional labour. With regard to timber for butter boxes, there is this further statementBox-makers in the Commonwealth are in the habit of manufacturing butter boxes out of is and 14 x § timber. Should there be a duty put on all timber other than these sizes, it will necessarily follow that the New Zealand millers will have to charge a higher price for this timber than the other timbers of smaller sizesAny man with commercial experience knows that that is no exaggerated statement. The timber suppliers are not going to suffer any loss, but must necessarily charge a higher price to their customerson which it is proposed to place a duty of 2s. 6d. per 100 feet, because taking into consideration that the log will only produce at the most 50 per cent, of this butter box size, they wil l have to find a market for the narrower sizes, so that they will be forced to ask 2s. per 100 feet more for the butter box size to enable them to self the small sizes on the market at the same price as at present. I am credibly informed that after all the best of the timber is used for making butter boxes, whereas the refuse or dead pieces, unsuitable for such a purpose, are used for making fruit cases, rabbit crates, and similar articles. This really gives the butter industry an advantage at the expense of the fruit and other industries which have to pay the extra duty on the timber used in - making the casesThe Sydney box trade use quite 70 per cent, of the imported white pine and rimu into ordinary boxes, and so find a market for all the white pine produced that is not fit for butter box making, and we are firmly of opinion that if the duty remains as proposed, it will have the effect of increasing, not only the price of the ordinary boxes, but more especially butter boxes. Here is a table showing a comparison of prices, and how timbers are affected in connection with the duties. As to American timbers we are toldAmerican Timber. To import rough timber in sizes 12 x 6 and upwards, the duty is ... Re-sawing into sizes 6 x 1 , cost Loss in sawdust, is£ per cent, at gs. per 100 ... ... .. --Duty at 6d. on 12^ per cent, loss Duty on ordinary rough timber is This will show that there is nothing gained by taking advantage of the sixpenny duty on sizes 12 x 6 and upwards. Sellers of American timber, if asked for all large sizes of 12 x 6 and upwards, leaving out the smaller sizes, ask is. 6d. per 100 feet super. advance. As a matter of fact, this advance is recognised in the trade. New Zealand Timber. To import rough timber in sizes 12 x 6 and upwards, the duty is ... Re-sawing into sizes, 6 x 1 , cost Loss in sawdust, I2£ per cent., white pine and rimu, at 12s. ... ... This shows that it is cheaper to import rough timber in smaller sizes, and only pay the duty of 2s. 6d. The above examples should demonstrate the fact that 3s. on dressed timber is not enough. The average log brought to any mill in the world would not yield more than 56 per cent, of sizes of 12 x 6 and upwards, and the miller must naturally dispose of his smaller sizes. White pine makes the most attractive box of any timber known. It is free from any woody odour, takes print like paper, brands show out well, and our exports packed in boxes made of this timber have a good start in any market.",120
966,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Will the honourable member explain how only 12J per cent, is allowed for waste in saving in one case, while 25 per cent, is allowed in the other? Mr W. Elliot Johnson. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am now referring to American timber, and there may be a difference between the two.",122
967,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"We may take 12\ per cent, as correct. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am not making these statements on my own authority, but on the authority of information supplied to me by the merchants. The circular I read a few moments ago is from the Sydney Timber Merchants' Association j and I quote it because I think that association is in the best position to give correct information. A great deal more might be urged; but I content myself with asking the Minister to carefully reconsider the whole question of New Zealand timber in the light of facts which may hitherto have escaped his notice. I do not suppose that it is the honourable gentleman's desire to place any industry at a special disadvantage, or that it is the will of s. d. Parliament to show any unjust discrimination between the interests of the ...06 fruit-growers, for instance, and the in--- 1 0 terests of the butter producers. There is 1 no reason why we should give any special -- o of advantage to the dairying industry, while 2 8£ penalizing another industry equally entitled --- 2 6 to our consideration. The readjustment proposed will dislocate trade and place timber merchants, fruit-growers, and others at a grave disadvantage, with the probable result, in some cases, of ruin. Failing recourse to the old duty, they ask for a compensating advantage in order to rectify the anomaly which the Government, under s. d. these proposals, must immediately create. I do not advocate an increase of duty to ...06 . equalize the disadvantage, but urge strongly ... 1 o the removal of duties on timber altogether. ... 1 6 I hope the Minister will give the matter his very serious consideration. 3 ° Mr 'FENTON (Maribyrnong) [10.50 a.m.] - The Minister has thought fit to put New Zealand white pine on the free list, so far as butter boxes are concerned; and I think he might have gone further. It seems to me that the concessions that have been made to the dairying industry might well be extended to the fruit-growing and other in. dustries ",122
968,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Is there no timber in Australia fit for fruit cases? °,122
969,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I am speaking of the timber with which I have had much to do in the butter trade. I have no desire to detract from the merits of any other timber; but it is said that New Zealand white pine boxes are the finest in the world for butter.,122
970,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I was speaking of magnificent asset. f r u it cases.,123
971,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Sometime s I think our Queensland brethren think we are encroaching on their preserves. It is a fact that, in the hoop and other pines of that State, we have the finest commercial timbers Australasia; and it is too good to be made into butter boxes. I understand that many of these New Zealand white pine butter boxes 'which are exported find their from the Old Country to Sweden, where they are usect in the manufacture of matches. The Queensland ""'dairymen, I understand, paraffin their boxes, so that they may be ""Safely used for packing for butter export. I have several communicaGeneral's tions from Melbourne and Sydney merendeavouring chants on this question, including one Messrs. G. Gunnersen and Company, who monwealth. published a letter in the Age, from which the following is an extract: Approximately, 35 per cent, to 45 only is used for butter boxes, therefore, the average duty on New Zealand white pine will really be increased from 6d. per 100 super, feet to about is. 3d., and this is principally at the expense of the fruit-growing industry. According to an article in your paper this morning, we notice that you state"" Members admit that the removal of duty against New Zealand woods for butter boxes, while benefiting butter producers, would have a doubtful effect on the Queensland timber industry."" We beg to state that it could in no way affect the Queensland timber industry. produces some very fine timbers indeed, but the only kind which has been found at all suitable for butter boxes is the hoop pine. This timber is of such a fine nature and quality that it is far loo good for such common purposes as box-making, and it is a shame to use it for such. Furthermore, the demand for hoop pine has been so great for a long time past that suppliers are not able to fulfil orders. I think that that is a well-known fact. Queensland timber is recognised as one of the very best for certain purposes, and I understand that the merchants can obtain from 5s. to 7s. per 100 superficial feet more than is paid for New Zealand pine. The millers of Melbourne were, I believe, prepared to give orders for millions, of feet, but they found that these orders could not be fulfilled. The Queensland mills are kept more than full y occupied, not being able to overtake the Australian demands.",123
972,Mr FULLER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Order s have to be given months ahead.,123
973,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I know there is great difficulty in that respect; and I congratulate Queensland on the possession of such a,123
974,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Queenslan d will be able to supply all the requirements of Australia.,123
975,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I have no doubt as to that, and, as I have already said, I regard this timber as too valuable for the purpose in of butter boxes. New Zealand dairymen have been urging on successive Governments in the Dominion the advisability of imposing an export duty on white pine, so that way they may be sure of an adequate supply in years to come. I should like to suggest, however, that we might even now show a friendly spirit towards New Zealand, apart altogether from Tariff considerations. We were given to understand in the Governorspeech that the Government were to arrange for reciprocity befrom tween New Zealand, Canada, and the ComMr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is an Australian firm that is working the New per cent, Zealand timber in the Dominion.",123
976,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Is it not that New Zealanders have come over here? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - No ; Australians have gone to New Zealand.,123
977,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"We have our own boxmaking factories; and I think, with the Minister, that it is only fair to impose a duty of 4s. per 100 superficial feet on timber cut into box sizes. Queensland Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Such a duty will result in much of the work now done in Australia being taken over to New Zealand.",123
978,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"There is no fear of that. When the New Zealand pine is cut into butter-box sizes, there is very little left but the off-cuts. My desire is that the free list shall embrace New Zealand white pine. In Sydney, Melbourne, and I suppose all the capital cities, this timber is the raw material of many other industries. It is preferred for washing boards, broom handles, salt boxes, knife boxes, and many other domestic utensils. The following is a letter I have received from Messrs. Spencer and Krigsman, timber importers and general woodware manufacturers, Melbourne :We have submitted the following particulars to the Honourable the Minister of Customs :Every item in the enclosed list is made out of New Zealand white pine. Every article enumerated is used by the housew if e ; therefore, higher duty on the raw material means a correspondingly lower protection on manufactured imported woodware, which would soon flood Australian markets. Because Melbourne is in the unique position of being the manufacturers' distributing centre, we ourselves exporting to every State. Because cheaper freights can be arranged from New York to Melbourne, than is charged between Melbourne and Fremantle. Because the lowest workman's wages in our employ is -£a 8s., others £ 2 ios., £ 2 18s., £ 2 18s. 6d., up to £ 3 ios. per week of 48 hours. Because the margin of profit on these small lines is very small. Because the duty on New Zealand white pine will not benefit Australian timbers Because there is no timber to substitute for white pine at the price. The nearest, Queensland hoop, which costs ios. 'per 100 super, f t . more. I find I underestimated the difference in priceBecause Queensland Mills cannot supply the normal demand at the present time, therefore restricting the woodware manufacturer if he - could use timber at above price.",123
979,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Are you going on the principle that if a local industry cannot - supply an article it ought to come in free?,124
980,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I am in connection with this matter, but there is in one sense an inter-relation between these various industries. When a New Zealand white pine log is cut, the main cuts are used for butter-boxes, because for that purpose we want the very best timber. The New Zealand saw-miller will say, "" I have to send to Australia the very best cuts out of the log for butter-box purposes. am I going to do with the off-cuts?"" ' If he cannot find a ready market for the offcuts, the chances are that instead of. our receiving a benefit by the removal of the duty on the timber for butter-boxes, the New Zealand miller will have to charge more for his best cuts because he will not be able to find so ready a market for the off-cuts. It is further statedRe Tariff Item 303 (v) :-"" Square timber rough sawn into sizes suitable for manufacture of broom handles, which means any length timber ii by ii inches square."" We consider that this item should be recast and placed on the free list instead of 20 per cent, ad valorem. Because we ourselves cannot get sufficient supplies from seven Queensland mills to keep us going. We Bought from Queensland this year, January to October, 356,000 pieces, we wanted at least.600,000. Because this size is really an off-cut, i.e., small widths that cannot be used any other way. Because no mill in Australia will cut planks or logs up into broom squares, we, as manufacturers having the necessary machinery, are unable to do it on account of the advancing cost of all lines of Australian timbers. Because not one timber in a 100 varieties is suitable for so small diameter. Because we are not able to import New Zealand white pine in manufacturers size, viz., 3 f t . 6 in. in length for household brooms at the present on account of the duty which is equal to 3s. per gross on broom handle squares. Unless the New Zealand miller can sell practically the whole log, he will not sell us the best at the present rates, and allow the rest to rot in his mill yard. Grave consideration should certainly be given to these representations.",124
981,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Richmond) [ n . 5 a.m.].. - The New Zealand Government impose an export duty on white pine logs, with the result that all the white pine we import from that country is already cut up. Naturally the New Zealand millers want to sell all the sizes they cut out of the log, and unless the Australian importer is prepared to take them, the millers will raise the price for the parts which he does take. It is quite possible therefore that, instead of the removal of duties on white pine used for butter-boxes benefiting the butter-producing industry of Australia, it may work out the other way.",124
982,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Does the honourable member want all New Zealand pine admitted, or only New Zealand white pine?",124
983,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I mean the white pine, which is used principally for making butter-boxes, crates, and fruit cases. The only Australian timber so far as we know suitable for this class of work, and What growing in any quantity, is the hoop pine. It is a splendid timber, but owing to the great demand for it for house-building purposes and joinery work, the supplies are not sufficient. If we admit New Zealand white pine free, it will not embarrass any Australian industry. If I thought it would, I should refuse, as a Protectionist, to have anything to do with it.",124
984,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It would be better to leave the duty at 6d. on the lot as it is now.,124
985,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I believe it would be. The Minister has already stated that he intends to alter the sizes specified in the schedule. I have here a statutory declaration by the manager of the Co-operative Box Company of New South Wales, which supplies eighty co-operative factories with butter-boxes, and uses from 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 superficial feet of timber every year. He says The sizes required primarily for butter boxes are 12 x j , and 14 x j New Zealand white pine. 12 x 14 and 14 x 14 New Zealand white pine are planed first and re-sawed afterwards, and 12 x if and 14 x if New Zealand white pine are re-sawed first and planed afterwards. When unable to procure sufficient boards of the six sizes above mentioned, narrow boards of the same thicknesses are used by tongue and grooving. 3 x 3. 34 3. 4 x x 6(x f , 7 x j , 8 x } , g x J, i o x J, and n x § are all used to joint together 3 x ' i> 34 x i£, 4 x 14, 44 x 14, 5 x 14, 6 x 14, 64 x 14, 7 .x 14, 8 x i£, 9 x i£, 10 x 14, 11 x 14, are used for dressing, splitting, and jointing together. 3 it 3* x if j 4 ' f . 44 if . 5 ' I . 6 x if , x x x 64 x if , 7 x if , 8 x if , 9 x if , 10 x if are used for splitting first, dressing and joining together. All these sizes are used in the butter-box making industry, but some of them' are shut out by the Minister's proposal. hope that before we commit ourselves to the .item the Minister will go thoroughly into it. I am not at all certain that the proposed re-arrangement of duties will benefit the butter industry, and it will certainly penalize the fruit, rabbit, and other industries.",124
986,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Capricornia) [11.15 a.m.]. - I oppose the proposal to allow any New .Zealand timber for butter boxes to come in free. It is somewhat disconcerting to find that there are still some members in the Committee who are only one-sided Protectionists.,125
987,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,One-eyed .,125
988,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"They have two eyes, both of which are merely used in the interests of certain industries in their own electorates.",125
989,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,*-Hav e you any Queensland timbers in yours?,125
990,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"There are in Queensland certain industries, among them that of timber, but I doubt if the honourable member can find a single industry throughout Australia to which I have not voted to give the most ample protection possible. If it were proposed to remove the present duty of 3d. per lb., or 25 per cent., on butter, or the duty on raw and preserved fruits, the honourable member for Maribyrnong would be up in arms. He wants, however, to allow New Zealand timber to come in free for fruit boxes. Some time ago, when Mr Justice Isaacs was a member of this House, he was censured by the Fruit growers' Association in his electorate for voting for a duty on timber. If there is anything in the Protectionist idea, all industries ought to receive adequate protection. I do not claim that Protection is a panacea for all the ills that flesh Is heir to, but it is a method of enabling the Labour party to carry out its ideals in Australia. If we take the duty off timber for fruit and butter boxes, other consumers should have the same consideration extended to them. The removal of the duty which it is proposed to levy on butterS, 44 x t. 5 x i . 6 x f, box timber will not increase by a single copper the amount which the dairy farmer will receive for his butter, nor will the removal of the duty from timber for fruit boxes help the fruit-grower an atom. The trouble with the fruit-grower and other producers x today is that the commission agents and , 11 x if , companies rob them of a great deal of - the produce of their labour.",125
991,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It is not so with the butter industry now. I Mr HIGGS - It was a few years ago It is only because of the wealthy and prosperous co-operative .companies mentioned: by the honourable member for Richmond, that the farmer is now getting something like a fair return for his labourThe wealthy co-operative dairy companiesare well able to pay an import duty on timber. The one-sided Protectionists of whom I have spoken have short memories and queer methods. When it was proposed some tune ago to put an import duty on New Zealand pine, so that Queensland timber might be used for butter boxes, we were told that that timber was not suitable, and when we proved that it was, the objection was raised that it was too good. In our big cities the public is charged 5d., 6d., and even 8d. a lb. for apples, and when in London recently I saw white grapes marked up at 8d. and black grapes at 7d. a lb., while as much as 9d. each was being charged for pears, and rod., for peaches.  ber wish himself back in Australia?",125
992,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I was glad to .find onmy return to Adelaide how reasonable, incomparison, are the prices charged here. The removal of the timber duty would not help the fruit-growers. What is necessary to improve their position is an attack on the system of distribution. I intend to move That the words "" (B) New Zealand white pine, undressed, for butter boxes, in sizes not less than 9 in. x $ in. nor exceeding 12 in. x 2 in., but not cut to shape, subject to Departmental By-laws, free,"" be left out.",125
993,Mr FULLER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Ulawarra) [11.26 a.m.]., - It is open to grave doubt whether the laudable desire of the Minister to protect the butter industry will be achieved by the proposal submitted to the Committee. The honourable member for Maribyrnong pointed out the position very clearly. He showed that the New Zealand suppliers of pine would have to charge higher prices if they could not dispose of the smaller portions of the log, and the honourable member for Richmond has expressed a doubt as to whether the proposal will do what is aimed at.",125
994,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,We are placing the New Zealand timber on the same footing as other timber.,126
995,Mr FULLER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The timber business is a very intricate one, and I do not feel competent to express an opinion, except generally, on the Minister's proposal. been freely stated that fruit-growers and others engaged in rural industries, whom we wish to encourage, will be injured by what is proposed. I suggest that, before anything is done, the Minister should obtain the opinion of those engaged in the timber business in Melbourne and Sydney. As the representative of a large dairying district, I am very pleased that the Minister intends to make butter boxes as cheap as possible, but, although I amglad that my constituents are to be assisted, I do not desire that the fruit-grower shall suffer. We should try to deal justly with all. The manager of the company to which the honourable member for Richmond has referred saysI f the intention is to remove the 6d. duty now charged on butter box timber, and this concession is granted as well as on the smaller sizes referred to, it should make a difference of something like f d . per box. Butter boxes are made in a number of sizes, and the timbers in use are 12 inches by }, 12 inches by 12 inches by if , 14 14 x and 14 x if . This is timber for boxes with the sides, ends, tops, and bottoms in one piece. It is found that the use of improved tonguing and grooving and gluing machines, and the making of the sides and bottoms in two pieces, is an advantage, and enables smaller sized timbers, which must be purchased at the same time as the others, to be used up. manager saysWe do not think the Tariff mentions anything below g inches by J inch. To use the size in direction he desires. the side or bottom of a butter box, we would need also to attach thereto another piece -5-inch by f in order to make a full side bottom. According to Mr W. M. Pearson, of Pearthan son's Proprietary Limited, who are very big people in the city of MelbourneThe operation of the revised tariff on New Zealand white pine for butter box purthe poses is likely to prove the opposite to that tended by the Government. Hitherto New Zealand pine, undressed, of all sizes, has been dutiable at 6d. per 100 super, feet. It is now proposed to make sizes suitable for manufacture into butter: boxes free (that is not less than gin. x f in . , and not exceeding 12m. x 2in.), but to make other sizes dutiable at 2s. to 2s. 6d. per 100 super, feet. These other sizes, or offcuts, which constitute about 60 per cent, of the original timber, have to rely upon Australia as a market, being sold as a by-product. But while off-cuts will become dutiable at 2s. to 2s. 6d., instead of 6d., it is feared that the extra duty cannot be recovered, as they have to be sold in Australia, in competition with spruce and hardwood. In this case, therefore, the net return to the New Zealand saw-miller will be reduced, and in order to obtain the same total It has amount from the whole log as before it would be necessary to obtain a higher price for the butter-box timber. Some of the leading sellers from New Zealand are asking an advance of is. per 100 feet, and it is thought possible that a greater advance may have to be asked, the resuit being that the concession represented by the Government proposals will be more than neutralised. I have also before me a report of the annual meeting of the Kauri Timber Company Limited which was held recently. The chairman of the company in his report to the shareholders saidThe Federal Government, in bringing in a Bill to do away with the anomalies of the Tariff, had made a considerable change in the duties on New Zealand pine, this being practically the only alteration in timber. While the Bill was supposed to do away with anomalies, it only served to create bipper anomalies than existed before. The Minister of Customs, in introducing the Bill , said that he recognised something had to be done to assist the butter industry, and this he proposed to do by remitting the present duty, equal to is. 3d. per ton on butter value £112To make up for this, however, he proposed to tax the fruit growing industry to the extent of 4s. 6d. per ton x f, value £14, so that the fruit-growers would have to carry the impost for the benefit of the butter factories. As a matter of fact, however, the price of butter boxes would not be reduced by the alteration, but the effect would be to raise the prices, as in producing the better grades for the butter business, they were compelled to make a large quantity of sizes suitable only for fruit cases, and if the market for this line was to be restricted or taxed so heavily the better qualities would have to be raised in price to compensate for the loss on the lower grades. The These large firms have pointed out that the Minister's proposal will not work in the Turning from the dairying industry, it seems quite clear that of the fruit-growing industry will, under this or proposition, have to bear a heavier burden it has ever borne before. The fruit growers of New South Wales have had a very bad time for some years past. Any one who will take the trouble to look up statistics of the State will find that at in the present time there are about 3,000 acres less under orchard in New South Wales tovarieties day than there were some years back. That rates, irrespective of size. shows that the fruit-growing industry, stead of being prosperous, is going I am quite aware that what the honourable member for Capricornia said is perfectly true, that the unfortunate men on the land here. do not get the price to which they are entitled. We know from sad experience - connection with the butter industry that dairy farmers in the Ulawarra. district, up duty? to fifteen years ago, allowed the middlemen in Sussex-street, Sydney, to get rich at their .expense. But the South-West and West Camden Co-operative Company was formed, which has since developed New South Wales Co-operative Company, and which does about 80 per cent, of the defend me. butter trade of the State. It would be well if the fruit-growers of New South W,ales also formed a co-operative associain tion.",126

1002,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It is quite unnecessary to,127
1003,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I know that very well. As nearly as I can remember, the duties regard to timber which I submitted to the Government are those which I submitted to Parliament. Of course, I have in since suggested an alteration. I could not say the same as to all the items. The position is this: By granting concessions to at New Zealand timber, irrespective of size, we are allowing the small pieces-the offof cuts as they are known in the trade-to come in at lower rates; whereas our object was in every instance to make the duties corposirespond with the amount of work which had be done in the Commonwealth. In the last Tariff .it was proposed, for instance, that avoid there should be a duty of 6d. per 100 resuperficial feet on timber undressed, 12 in. We also provided agree that New Zealand pine, undressed, all best exsizes, was to pay 6d. per 100 superWhat was the result? Instead out wheof New Zealand allowing us to reway ceive large timber, the Dominion Parliament imposed export duties with the object of preventing logs and large timbers from that being exported to the Commonwealth to be I have not before me and at the moment the figures showing the most amount of exports from New Zealand to timber. Australia, but I am confident that 90 per cent, of the whole quantity of timber exported from the Dominion last year was sent to this country. The result of sending timber of small sizes was that the offconcuts of our own mills could not be disThe off-cuts from New Zealand undersold our own millers in at that time did the. market.",127
1004,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That applies not only to New Queensland saw-millers, but also to those and other of Victoria and other States.",127
1005,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Quite so. I am given to understand that in consequence of Australian saw-millers not being able to dispose of their off-cuts they have had to charge a higher price for the larger timber which they had to sell. It stands to reason that if a saw-miller can only sell the principal article which he is producing, and can do nothing with the by-pvoducts - becaus e the off-cuts or small cuts are the by-products of the timber trade-the consequence must be that he must charge more than he otherwise would do for the more bulky timbers. If our saw-millers were able to sell these off-cuts at a profit, as New Zealand does, purchasers would reap a great advantage all round. If Parliament wants white pine to be free, let it say that white pine and white pine alone shall be so treated. But do not let us permit white pine to carry on the top of it all other varieties of New Zealand timber.",128
1006,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If this timber is wanted for casing only, why not say, "" White pine for casing ' ? 1",128

New Zealand has imposed an export duty of 5s. per 100 on logs cut into halves. I presume that that means sawn straight down the centre. But she has also imposed an export duty of 3s. per 100 on flitches 12 inches in width and 4 inches in thickness, or its equivalent, or less than the equivalent of 10 x 10. Those timbers would be dutiable at our 6d. rate. The object of New Zealand, in fact, has been to prevent work being done in Australia. They want the whole work to be done there I find no fault with them for that.",128
1011,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,What about reciprocity?,128
1012,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"When the late Mr. Batchelor, while member for Boothby, raised the question of reciprocity with New Zealand with regard to wine, the Dominion, did not respond, but charged 2s. a gallonon South Australian wine. We have noreciprocity with New Zealand. If we treat her timber as we have been doing, we shall have nothing to give away when we begin to talk about reciprocity. We shall not beable to negotiate on reasonable terms. New Zealand will say to us, "" Thank you for nothing'; you have given us what we want under your Tariff; your Parliament has decided that our timber* shallenter the Commonwealth at low rates."" The New Zealand Tariff also gives rebates for kauri exported at the same rates as applied to other timbers. If the Committee chooses to decide that New Zealand pine, whether for butter boxes or otherwise, shall come in at a lower rate than any other timber, it can do so. But let us thoroughly understand what we are doing. We can do that, not necessarily by fixing the size, but by saying that New Zealand white pine, which is used for this particular purpose, shall come in at a certain rate, and all other New Zealand pine at the ordinary rates which are fixed for other timbers; or alternately we can say that New Zealand pine for the manufacture of butter-boxes shall come in at a low rate, but that all other New Zealand pine in sizes less than 12 in. by 6 in. shall come in? at the rate of 2s. or 2s. 6d. per 100 super., feet. If it is desired to give an advantage to New Zealand let the Committee adopt some other rate, say, is. or is. 3d. Or is. 6d., or any sum it likes. I have heard,, and no doubt other honourable members have heard, that this item, if passed, will interfere with our timber mills, which are used"" for the cutting and dressing of timber. If deal we are anxious that they shall receive what we consider justice, or to put them on their old footing, we can increase the rate on dressed timber, so that they shall not suffer any hardship as compared with their previous position. I admit that it is a difficult question to deal"" with. I believe that the best diing which the Committee could do would be to say that New Zealand white pine of any size, and that alone, shall come in at the former rate, namely, 6d. per .100 feet super., or any other rate which it might care to fix, and' that all other New Zealand pine shall fall under the ordinary rates for other timber.: The anomaly which the Ministry tried tocorrect was the treatment of New Zealand pine differently from other timber. But in our anxiety to do that, we have apparently bumped up against one vested interests which have been worked in connection with the importation of Zealand pine. We should, I think, conwould sider, first of all, our own industries. admit that it is very difficult, perhaps, get the truth concerning a number of these articles, whether they are imported manufactured.",128

I believe that in the making of butter-boxes not more than 30 per cent, of New Zealand pine is used, and not 80 per cent., as we believed on a previous occasion. I do not think that this or any other timber should be lowed to come in practically on the back of another industry. I suggest that the very limited sphere.

The prices of timber for building purposes are going up, and probably an increase in the prices of those timbers will mean a further impost upon occupiers of houses. The honourable member for Capricornia is not able to supply us with any definite information as to how the timber industry of Queensland is prejudiced. He simply says, "" There are duties on other items; let us have a duty on this."" We have no facts to show that he believes that to place New Zealand timbers on the free list would be to disadvantage any other timbers. My impression is that there is a general shortage of timber in Australia. I have lived in some parts of New South Wales where pine is available, but the pine forests there have been disappearing with marvellous rapidity, and a demand is being made for afforestation. The Minister of Trade and Customs is as much in the dark in this matter as are other honourable members, and it seems to me that we shall make a mistake if we interfere with this matter at all. If the Minister does not know what the effect of this alteration is going to be, and if other honourable members who are Protectionists are ill at ease with respect to it , surely we have a case made out for postponing action until we have some reliable information for our guidance.

1059,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wimmera) [12.20] I am very pleased to find that the Minister has been doing all that he possibly can to meet the views of those who represent - the dairying and fruit industries of Australia. The honourable member for Capricornia has adversely criticised the attitude Which certain Protectionist members' of this Chamber have adopted towards this proposal. But I contend that the question of the admission of New Zealand white pine free of duty is one which stands entirely by itself. The' Minister, strong Protectionist though he is, will recognise that a special case can be made out for the free admission of that timber in connection with our fruit and butter industries. We must recollect that the great bulk of the cases which are used in those industries are used for the purpose of packing our products for despatch to the Old Country It is not as if the timber imported from New Zealand competed with our own timber. Most of the former finds its way to London in the form of cases, where it has to compete with timber from all parts of the world. It has been said that we - should not attempt to introduce New Zealand white pine free until our own resources had been exhausted, and we 1 were thoroughly convinced that we could not supply a single butter-box from our own timber. But if honourable members will read the. evidence which was given before the Tariff Commission in 1906 they will see that it is not possible for us to produce butter-boxes 'from our own timber as cheaply as it is to produce them from New Zealand white pine. The estimates which were presented to that body showed that the use of the hoop pine of Queensland would cost at least i d . per box more than would be involved by the use of the white pine of New Zealand^ Seeing that the great majority of these boxes are forwarded to the London market, it is plain that we are now called upon to deal with quite a special case. Under these circumstances, I hope that the Minister, who has already intimated that he is partly favourable to the idea which has been put forward by several honourable members, will reconsider this matter during the luncheon adjournment, with a view' to submitting a 1 proposal which will enable New Zealand white pine, for use as boxes in our butter and fruit industries, to be admitted free. I am not sure that it is necessary at this stage to make any distinction between New Zealand importations and importations from the Baltic, the United States, and other places. I believe that much can be said in favour of timber being regarded as a raw material. After all, there is a great similarity between a national asset, such as a large timber supply, and a national asset such as a coal supply. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - In New Zealand measures are taken to preserve the young timber.",132
1060,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I am aware of that. A splendid system of afforestation has been adopted there upon which I would like to dwell. But time forbids that. I think we should provide that New Zealand white pine for use as boxes in our butter and fruit industries may be imported into Australia free of duty.,132
1061,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Hindmarsh) [12.27]. - There seems to be a strong element of doubt in the minds of the Committee in' regard to this item. In these circumstances, especially as we have not time to enter into the question thoroughly, and also because of the great demand which exists for timber, I think the wisest plan for us to adopt would be to retain the old duty. Consequently, I suggest that the Minister should withdraw the item. The more the last Tariff is discussed the more I am satisfied that it reflects great credit upon the Commonwealth Parliament. Hence the necessity for great care being exercised in tinkering with it. I urge upon the Minister the advisableness of withdrawing the item.",132
1062,Mr GORDON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Boothby) [12.28] I join with the honourable member for Hindmarsh in asking that more time should be given to the consideration of these important duties. I was very much relieved to hear the Minister say just now that he and others who have had an opportunity of going through the previous Tariff have always experienced great difficulty in understanding the timber duties. I have been struggling with them during the last two or three days, and the more I wander into the labyrinth of this forest the more I am bewildered. I certainly do not understand anything about the question which is before the Chair at the present moment, nor do I quite appreciate the alterations which the Minister has outlined. I rose chiefly to voice, in a few brief sentences, a protest which has been sent to me from South Australia. In doing so I wish it to be distinctly understood that I hold no brief for the timber merchants who have forwarded thek protest I merely wish to say that I think the timber industry of Australia is deserving of consideration and of protection. What that measure of protection ought to be, I am not prepared to suggest at the present moment. timber merchants of South Australia wish to enter their protest against the proposed alteration of this duty. They contend that on apple cases the proposed extra duty will amount to 7s. 6d. per 100 cases, and as many thousands of these cases are used yearly they urgg-thaf the impost will be a very serious one. They also point out thatCabinetmakers and other large users of this timber will also suffer, because there is no other timber so suitable for cheap articles of furniture that can be obtained at equal prices, and the merchnnls submit that there is no justification in making the alteration, because the duty is not wanted for revenue purposes, nor is protection needed for Queensland p'ines, seeing that the sawmillers in that State cannot supply much, if any, beyond their own State requirements; and South Australia has no timber of its own. They further claim that the matter should be reconsidered with a view to retaining the old duty; the Tariff in their opinion being already sufficiently high to afford adequate protection to, without interfering with, these rural industries.",133
1063,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"East Sydney) [12.32] - I think that the Government would be acting wisely if they withdrew this itern, because there is not a city in Australia today in which there does not exist an urgent demand for timber. I am a Protectionist, and I do not wish honourable members to think that I am in any way a renegade to my fiscal principles. The representatives of Queensland have no need to worry about the admission of New Zealand white pine into Australia free of duty, because all the timber which Queensland can send to New South Wales, that State can take from her. At the present time the demand for timber is so active that it is being taken out of. the ships' holds, placed upon the wharfs, and carted direct to the buildings in which it is being used. No attention whatever is being paid to the seasoning of timber., As honourable members apparently cannot make up their minds upon this question, the Minister should withdraw the item and allow us to deal with it when our thoughts have clarified somewhat.",133
1064,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Fremantle) [12.35] - I consider that the discussion upon this item has proved that, so far as the timber duties are concerned, we made a good job of the Tariff when we last considered it. The Tariff on that occasion was given more con* sideration than we are able to give to this proposal. . I believe that it would do no harm to leave white pine dutiable at 6d. per But the 100 superficial feet, as it is at present; but I hope that whatever is done will benefit the producers of butter and fruit alike. I think there should be 110 distinction made between them. I have a communication from the Western Australian Fruit-growers'' Association in which they strongly protest against any extra duty on timber for fruit cases. They contend that it is . almost impossible to secure satisfactory cases from the use of the local hardwood. I know that the attempt has been made, and that it has not been considered successful. At one time. I thought it might be better, in dealing, with this item, to make provision for rebates, but I am afraid that that would cost too much for supervision. I direct attention to the reference in this item to hickory felloes. I have seen hickory rims, but I never knew hickory to be cvi into felloes. If honourable members are prepared to come to a vote I shall not speak at greater length, but I hope the Minister will state that it is his intentionto retain the present duty on white pine.",133
1065,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Brisbane) [12.40] I oppose the proposal to admit New Zealand' white pine free of duty, for reasons other than those which have so far been advanced.! I take it that the main object of this pro* posed alteration of the Tariff is to protect and assist industries that need protection and assistance. The party on this side of the House are anxious that the workers in industries receiving protection under the Tariff shall share in the profits derived from the prosecution of those industries. I think that we are agreed that an industry which does not give the workers engaged in it a fair return for their labour is not entitled, at least, to further protection under the Tariff. To show how little the dairying industry is entitled to any consideration in the shape of a remission of duties or increased protection, I submit for the consideration of honourable members the following figures for 1909 taken from the Commonwealth Year-Book No. 4. It will be seen that I have compared the dairying industry with groups of other industries whose output is approximately of the same value, and I ask honourable members to study the contrast which the figures disclose :Factories. Value of Butter, Cheese and Condensed Milk Factories . . 550 6,727,324 295,826 3,283 Saw-mills 1,284 - Woollen and Tweed Mills 24 1,308 6,694,704 2,162,973 24,381 Australia Agricultural Implements 148 Engineer and Ironworks 764 Hat and Cap Factories.. 73 Boot and Shoe 1/ Factories . . 215 Soap and Candle Factories 73 - Coach and Wagion Works 720 Furniture, &o. - Factories . . 345 1,353 6,959,512 2,052,222 Mr Finlayson. It will be seen from these figures that the dairying industry sweats its employees and pays them miserable wages. It does not, therefore, deserve consideration from this House. There is no industry in Australia that is more in need of reform in regard to its wages, hours, and conditions of labour than is the dairying industry. I am not prepared to vote today, or on any other day, for further assistance by means of the Tariff to this industry until those engaged in it pay fair wages and give reasonable conditions to their employees. It is somewhat disgraceful that this is about the only industry in connection with which .there is no Wages Board to fix rates of pay and conditions of labour. Those engaged in this industry strongly object to their employees forming themselves into a union. I suppose it was more difficult to organize the Rural Workers' Union than any other body of workers in the Commonwealth, and yet the employers in this industry come to this House and ask for the remission of a miserable duty of 6d. per 100 feet on butter-box timber. 2 Number ot",133

1069,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Unti l the dairying industry gives a better return for their labour to those employed in it, it is not deserving of protection from the people of - Before this industry can make a legitimate claim for Tariff assistance, it should put its house in order and be prepared to give the employees in it reasonable wages and fair conditions of labour. It might very easily do so, because it is one of the most profitable industries in Aus985 6,623,252 2,257,007 23,324 tralia. I say that it is to the credit of those who are carrying on the industry that they have developed it in the way they have done, and seeing they have done so well during past years, it is to their disgrace that they should have treated their employees so atrociously as they have done. With regard to the duties proposed on other timbers, I may say that I am utterly opposed to the suggestion to increase the duty in one case from 2s. 6d. to 4s., and .in 28,351 another from 2s. 6d. to 5s. I am heartily in accord with the honourable member for Parramatta on this subject. I consider that the frui t industry is deserving of great consideration. My main objection to the proposed increased duties is that there is a timber ring operating in Australia today that has forced the price of timber up until what cost from 12s. to 14s. some little time ago, costs now anything from 25s. up to 30s. The'timber ring has taken advantage of the great demand for timber, and the comparative difficulty of getting supplies, to force up prices, and if we are going to increase these duties by is. 6d. and 2s. we shall be only saying to the timber ring, "" You can now put up your prices by another js. 6d. or 2s."" I am against handicapping the public, who have to buy timber at the present extortionate prices, by imposing a duty amounting to an additional is. 6d. We all know that every additional penny of duty is an excuse to raise the price to the consumer, who always has to pay in the long run. I hope the Minister will adhere to the duties as they at present stand, with the exception of the alteration in regard to New Zealand white pine. Progress reported. SEAMEN'S COMPENSATI ON BILL .

That meets the objectionsof the butter-box people completely, but it only affects about half the trade. There is great pressure in Sydney in the building trade, which is now hampered for the want of material, and an absolute block will occur if further supplies are stopped. I appeal to the Committee to vote out the proposed alterations of the old Tariff, so that we may get this business through.

That is a monstrous proposition. The Australian timber industry gives employment to thousands of men. It is not a mushroom industry, but is paying good wages throughout Australia, and doing justice between man and man. It is alleged by one or two that they desire consideration in regard to certain timber, but the Minister's proposal is a fair compromise, which I hope the Committee will accept. I am amazed at the honourable member for Brisbane, who was elected as a Protectionist, denying protection to the saw-milling and timber-getting industry of Australia, and attacking those engaged in the dairying industry in such an unjust manner.

1081,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Franklin) [3.36]. - As the timber duties largely affect Tasmania, and my electorate in particular, I feel under an obligation to say a few words. It is absurd to contend that we cannot supply timber for the fruit cases needed on the mainland. During the last twenty years we have exported probably over 15,000,000 bushels of apples, in cases made of Tasmanian hardwood. New South Wales fruit-growers find that they cannot get timber from Tasmania because one man needs only enough to make 200 cases, and another to make 50 cases, perhaps ; but were they to co-operate as the dairymen have done, and give reasonable orders, they could be supplied from Tasmania for i d . per case less than they pay for cases made from other imported timber. It is said that it would injure the rabbit port trade to put a duty on imported pine, but Tasmania sends to New Zealand timber to make crates for the carriage of rabbits, while New South Wales and Victoria import pine for the same purpose. The timber industry of Tasmania today is stagnant. The largest and one of the best mills in Australia has been sold recently for 7s; in the £ r , and has not paid a dividend for the past five or six years, because Australia is flooded with Oregon, and Tasmanian timber has to be exported to find a market. The honourable member for Hume in 1907 proposed a duty of is. 6d. per 100 feet on Oregon, but as the result of a combination between the honourable member for Barrier and the then honourable member for Kooyong, representing the miners and proprietors of Broken Hill, it was reduced to 6d. The duty on oregon does not exceed 6 or 7J per cent. The timber used in the Broken Hill mines, if supplied from Tasmania, would keep our mills going for the greater part of the year.",136
1082,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Tasmania n timber cannot be used at Broken Hill.,137
1083,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That was a gag which was employed successfully on the last occasion. Every bit of timber in the Mount Lyell mine is local timber, and the directorate of that mine is practically the same as that of the Broken Hili Proprietary.",137
1084,Mr SPENCE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The nature of the "" country "" is different.",137
1085,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"In the wettest mine in Australia, and perhaps the most dangerous so far as the "" country "" is concerned, all the timber used during the last ten or twelve years has been Tasmanian timber, and Tasmanian timber was largelyused before that.",137
1086,Mr ANSTEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,What duties does the honourable member want?,137
1087,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I do not ask for any concessions for the timber industry, but I say that it should receive the same assistance arid protection as every other. Most of the mills in southern Tasmania have been sold within recent years, or are being offered for sale. After a long struggle we have obtained a Wages Board for the mill men. This will be a great boon, but those of us who have had the facts brought under our notice know that the timber industry of Tasmania is not today in a position to pay the wages which honourable members would like to see paid. Were it a Melbourne or Sydney industry it would be exprotected by duties of 25 or 35 per cent. But because it is a bush industry, and its representatives do not fill the Queen's Hall, lobbying for assistance, it does not receive the attention which is its due. When the proposal of the honourable member for Hume was under discussion, the Prime Minister said If we are to have Protection, let us have Protection all roundj and especially give some attention to the pioneer who is doing so much to open up the country. I ask him if the pioneer has ceased to do this ? I ask the Minister of Home Affairs, who then pleaded so eloquently for the industry in his district, what has changed his attitude? The honourable member for Herbert then urged that the men working in the bush should receive as much consideration as those working in the factories. The timber used in Broken Hill alone, if produced in Australia instead of being imported, would be sufficient to give constant employment to 1,000 men. We have been dealing with various anomalies, and have been granting Protective duties to assist such magnificent industries as those of vinegar making, and cardboard and matchmaking. We spent some hours early this morning in determining what encouragement should be given to the great industry of hemming pocket handkerchiefs, yet we find many honourable members are unprepared to give any consideration to a great rural industry which, if properly developed, must provide employment to many thousands of men.",137
1088,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Does the honourable member say that the men in this industry are not fully occupied ?,137
1089,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The mills have not been working full handed, and the men have not been able to obtain the wages they ought to be receiving.",137
1090,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Then there is no shortage of labour in that industry.,137
1091,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"No. Owing, largely to the fact that Australia is flooded with timber from Japan, which is got by men - receiving very small wages, and from Europe and America, our own timber gettersare in a very grievous condition. I have never pleaded for high duties, but if Protection is to be the national policy of Australia, why should we grant it to some industries and deny it to others? We have reached a critical stage in the history of the timber industry from the point of view of not only the employers, but the employees. The wages of the men are to be fixed by a Wages Board, and the award of that Board will be based very largely upon the earnings and profits of the mills. These men, as the result of the imposition of Protective duties, have to pay increased prices for everything they use, yet are denied a full measure of Protection for the industry in which they are engaged. Last year we imported timber valued at over £2,500,000. Such an importation in respect of any other industry would have led at once to an outcry that Protection had failed, and that increased duties were necessary. With the exception of tobacco, spirits, and one or two other items, in no case did our importations last year reach this level. Our own timber getting industry is being practically knocked out by the imported article, and yet the Committee, apparently, is not prepared to grant assistance to it. No one works under harder conditions than does the man in the bush. In Tasmania, for seven or eight months in the year, he is wet all day long, and the state of the industry is such that he does not receive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.",137
1092,Mr LAIRD SMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The Minister's proposal will meet our requirements.,138
1093,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"He is not proposing to assist the saw-mill industry of Tasmania - in the only possible way-by giving those engaged in it the same measure of Protection as is accorded to other industries. I should have failed in my duty had I allowed to pass unchallenged statements that have been made to the effect that these duties must be removed, because Australia is not in a position to supply its own wants.",138
1094,Mr LAIRD SMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The Minister is willing to allow the duty of 6d. to go on.,138
1095,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That is not equal to 6 per cent. If we are to have Protecthe tion, why not give the timber-getting dustry the same rates of duty as we have passed today to encourage the local facture of formalin and other industries ?",138
1096,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Calare) held [3.52] - This is another of those hoarythe headed old Protectionist items that have discussed from time to time since the original Federal Tariff was submitted. Again and again these requests for special favours for the timber industry have made to us, honourable members incharges terested in the timber-getting and sawthe milling industry, and who have no for other industries dependent upon them, being invariably anxious to have competing timber shut out of Australia. As was pointed out on a previous occasion, to comply with the request of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat would be to penalize the mining industry, which is of far greater importance to Australia than is that of timber-getting. The honourable member, for Darling, who is familiar with the timber-getting industry of Tasmania, and also with the mining industry, tells me that even if we granted all that the honourable member for Franklin has asked, we should not benefit Tasmania to the extent of a pound, whereas we should seriously penalize the mining industry-of the Commonwealth. The use of Oregon in the Broken Hill mines is a matter of life and death to the miners concerned, yet the honourable member for Franklin would have a heavy duty imposed upon it. A special class of timber is necessary for making butter boxes. It must be free from resin and sap, which would be quickly absorbed by the butter, and it is found that New Zealand white pine is the most suitable. Then, again, the fruit-growing industry requires special consideration. Whilst fruit growers are too individualistic to reap the full advantage that is obtainable from a little co-operation, that is no reason why we should punish them by placing a heavy impost on the timber they require for fruit cases. Large quantities of timber are also used in making the crates in which rabbits are exported, so that we should penalize yet another industry by complying with the request made by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat.",138
1097,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The additional expense, would be only about i d . per box.",138
1098,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That additional impost would make a very serious difference in the returns to those engaged in butter, fruit, and rabbit industries. I inread in the Sydney daily newspapers a statement to the. effect that as soon as the manupresent schedule was introduced, the men engaged in the timber trade in that city a meeting and determined to pass on - increased duty to the consumer-in been other words, to pass it on to dairymen, fruit-growers, exporters of rabbits, and others, who find imported timber absolutely necessary for their requirements. At this been meeting it was agreed that the timber should be re-adjusted by making following additions :-Half-inc h timregard ber, is. per 100 feet extra; f-in. and §-in., is. 6d. per 100 feet extra; and i-in. and over, 2s. per 100 feet. These extra charges relate to lines that have hitherto been admitted at the 6d. rate. Another point to be remembered in this connection is that the suburbs of Sydney are being rapidly extended; that small blocks are being sold on the deferred-payment system to the workers, and that various firms are erecting on such blocks cheap dwellings made from timber of the class now under consideration. The firm of Messrs. Hudson Brothers were the pioneers of those enterprises, and other firms have developed a large trade. Now it is proposed, by means of the Tariff, to penalue, not only these firms and their employees, but the poorer sections of the community who are endeavouring to get homes of their own. At the same time, it does not appear to me that the Tariff will confer £ 1 of benefit on the mill-owners of Tasmania or elsewhere. I hope the Minister will see the wisdom of making some further concessions. The original Tariff permitted the development of new interests; and, if a great injustice is not to be done, we shall have to allow the duties to remain as they were. If the Minister cannot be brought to take that view, I hope the Committee will give me their support.",138
1099,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Fremantle) [ 4 . 2 ] sire to say a few words in case the Minister or the' Committee are influenced by the Statements of the honourable member for Franklin. There are many reasons why Tasmanian hardwood cannot be used at Broken Hill , Kalgoorlie, and other inland places. The first is that the weight makes it impossible to pay the freight with profit, and, further, the cost of handling in the stopes is too high. The mine-owners are today paying a bigger price for oregon than for Tasmanian hardwood; and that fact, in itself, is sufficient proof that the market is open to the latter at any time. Tasmanian hardwood shrinks f-inch in 10 inches, and twists into all shapes when exposed to the heat of the sun in the interior. I am speaking with authority, since, for a period of two years, I had the contract for timbering the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's mine. During that time, owing to a scarcity of Oregon, Tasmanian hardwood was tried; but the expense proved so great that the mine-owners never desire to see it again. The honourable member for Franklin has told us that the men who procure this wood are wet through from morning until night; and we may well ask ourselves what sort of haulage this means to the horses and bullocks. We cannot expect work to be done at reasonable rates in a country like that, and, therefore, the mine-owners, in view of the nature of the wood, cannot afford to pay the price. The honourable member also told us that some £ 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 00 worth of soft wood is imported each year; but we must remember that this wood is used for ceilings, linings, 1 floorings, and a variety of purposes for which Tasmanian hardwood is entirely unsuitable. The difference in the railway freight alone would make it impossible to use Tasmanian hardwood for the mines at Broken Hill ; and if honourable members had the handling of a 7-ft. length of 10 inch x 10 inch in a mine, they would realise the truth of what I am now saying. I hope the Minister will not be influenced by "" h if a l u t in "" or pathetic appeals. This Tasmanian hardwood has been produced for thirty or forty years; and yet we are told that last week one of the biggest mills was sold at 7s. in the £ 1 .",139
1100,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,A Western Australian firm has bought the mill in order that this hardwood may take the place of jarrah.,139
1101,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It is more likely that they have purchased the mill for the sake - I deof the machinery. I hope the Minister will revert to the old Tariff, which was carefully thought out, and not press his proposal on the Committee.",139
1102,Mr BAMFORD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Herbert) [4.8] - As the representative of, perhaps, the largest timber district in Australia, I should like to say a few words, more especially as I have been referred to by more than one member as advocating a higher duty. When the timber duties were being considered in the first Tariff. I contended that some Protection was necessary to put the industry on its feet, and keep it there. At the present time, although I represent a. timber constituency, in which, beyond Cairns and along the coast, there are many millions of feet of pine, hickory, and so forth, I do not advocate a higher duty. This timber is the raw material of several other trades; and it cannot be made dutiable without penalizing those trades. The building industry, at the present time, is suffering heavily; and all the timber and saw-mills in Queensland are unable to supply local requirements, much less develop an export trade. During my last election campaign I visited Atherton, and some people interested in the numerous saw-mills there were - in favour of the imposition of a higher duty. One of their reasons was disclosed in a Sydney newspaper clipping, which stated that a vessel had arrived there with something like 3,000,000 feet of timber. I suppose that there are ships arriving with large cargoes of timber every week, and that fact alone proves that Queensland cannot meet the demand. Another argument used in favour of a higher duty was that the freights are so high-up to £ 4 per 1,000 feet, I think - that the timber producers cannot reach the market in the south. I asked them if they thought for a moment that any body of intelligent men would impose such a duty as would equalize that freight.",139
1103,Mr FAIRBAIRN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Does the honourable member regard us as intelligent men when he talks like that?,140
1104,Mr BAMFORD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Of course, I bow to the honourable member for Fawkner; but, still, I may be pardoned for having an opinion of my own, and for estimating my intelligence as highly as, perhaps, he estimates his. Under the circumstances I agree with the honourable member for Calare and others that the duty ought to remain; but I ask what on earth is the good: of 6d'. per 100 superficial feet as a protective duty in the case of New Zealand pine I",140

1108,Mr BAMFORD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I do not know that I shall vote for it. This is a question that should be thoroughly discussed; and the attempt of the Government to rush the business through does not meet with my approbation. I desire to impress on the Committee that, although I represent a timber district, I am not here to advocate a higher duty than that now existing.",140

The object of this amendment is to place the Tariff, in regard to this item, precisely before ? as it was previously, and, therefore, if the amendment be accepted, I shall ask the Minister to make all the necessary consequential amendments.",140
1110,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Capricornia) [4.15] should not have risen but for the some Protectionists may be under a misapprehension, owing to some of the remarks that have been made. I should like honourable members to realise, before they cast a vote in favour of this proposal, that there are probably 30,000,000 or 40,000,00 feet of timber, apart from the white pine, which will come in at the lower rate of duty.",140
1111,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [4.16] - The Minister, I understand, will make the consequential amendments, and I think he may be trusted to see that Protectionists are not deceived.

1113,The CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The question is: - I That the amendment of the Minister of fact that Trade and Customs be agreed to.,140
1114,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Richmond) [4.24] - The Minister's amendment will now read; "" New Zealand white pine undressed, in.e.i., per 100 super, feet, 6d."" The words "" in all sizes"" should be added to make paragraph B read exactly the same as it was in the old Tariff, but with the word "" white "" inserted.",141
1115,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I assure the honourable member that the amendment, as it stands, will effect what the Committee desire. If there is any doubt about it I shall have the matter attended to.",141
1116,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Wentworth) [4.25] - I reigret that during the last division a number of honourable members made statements at variance with the facts regarding the position with which the Committee was then confronted. A certain statement was made to the honourable member for Denison by an honourable member for Queensland. A good deal of trickery was used in order to deceive the Committee.,141
1117,The CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member is not in. order. Mr KELLY.:- I withdraw the statement. I understand that the interests affected are going to be protected by the Minister, but the point I wish to urge is that honourable members representing butter - districts and timber districts where the mills are not able to supply existing requirements combined to ignore the requirements of the building trade of the great cities of Australia. The positions of tens of thousands of workmen in those cities will be jeopardized as the result of the callous selfishness displayed by those gentlemen during the last few minutes. Under the arrangement I made with the Minister the idea was to test the question as between the old Tariff and his present proposal; but it was denied all over the Chamber that the division was being taken on that point. I protest against that way of transacting business. Some honourable members appear to be anxious to take a vote immediately on the Minister's amendment, and one urgent reason why it should be assented to at once is that, if it is not accepted without delay, We. shall have some more whispers going round the Committee to mislead members, and, perhaps, jeopardize still further the interests of the workmen of Australia.",141
1118,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Calare) [4.28]. - I must express my great disappointment at the action of certain honourable members who have been fighting the Minister all the morning. Under paragraph B of. the old Tariff all New Zealand pine was allowed to come in at the 6d. rate. By the vote just taken, that is limited to New Zealand white pine, and all the other pines which have been coming in heretofore, and being used by fruit box-makers, and in the housebuilding trade,, and in a hundred and one other industries, have been shut out. The butter men, as soon as they secured the admission of the particular white pine in which they were interested, went over to the other side and knocked out all the other interests which I have enumerated. I am' disappointed that men should be so selfish as to consider only their particular interests, and to refuse consideration to much bigger ones. If the last vote was taken under a misapprehension, honourable members have now an opportunity to correct it.",141
1119,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Shoul d the sub-item be struck out, New Zealand white pine will be dutiable at the rates applying to other timber.",141
1120,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"In that case, I shall vote to strike it out. so that the users of butter boxes shall be on. the same terms as every one else.",141
1121,Mr FULLER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Ulawarra) [4.32] - The honourable member for Wentworth has suggested that some trickery has been taking place; that there has been, a combination of the representatives of dairying districts on behalf of the butter makers. Speaking for myself, I know nothing of it. I came into the chamber only just before the vote was taken, and asked you, Mr Chairman, what the question was. You said that it was the acceptance of the proposition made by the Minister some time this morning in connection with white pine. I therefore gave my vote without consulting any one.",141
1122,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Darling Downs) [4.34] The honourable member for Wentworth has suggested that I misled the honourable member for Denison, but I did not misrepresent the position to him in any way. The honourable member for Brisbane put a question to me, to which I replied, but the honourable member for Denison voted with a knowledge of what he was doing.",141
1123,Mr LAIRD SMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Denison) [4.35]. - I went to the Minister, and got a full explanation from him. The honourable member for Darling Downs merely confirmed what he said.",141
1124,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wimmera) [4.36] - I believe that the Minister's compromise between the old and the new duty is a very good one. I do not endorse what has been said about some who voted with the Government on the last division, although I voted on this side.",141
1125,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Cook) [4.37] -- I shall support the honourable member for Calare in the endeavour to make New Zealand pine dutiable at 2s. 6d., and I hope that those who, like the honourable member for Capricornia, are so desirous of protecting Australian timber will give a true Protectionist vote. The combination which carried the last vote was",142
1126,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unhol y !,142
1127,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes , and, in some respects most selfish - Free Traders have voted with Protectionists to secure an advantage for the butter makers and the fruit-growers, but refuse to give a like advantage to the workers in the cities, who cannot get houses of their own because of the high price of building material. am assured by the Minister that if this timber is made dutiable at 2s. 6d., he will propose a duty of 5s. on dressed timber, which will give the protection necessary to secure in their employment those now engaged in dressing it here. I hope that the honourable member for Maribyrnong will vote with us on this occasion. a good Protectionist until it comes to butter boxes, and then he is a Free Trader.",142
1128,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I use my own judgment. Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNS ON (Lang) [4.41] - I hope that honourable members will not, in the heat caused by disappointment, vote to make white pine dutiable at 2s. 6d. There are four points which they should consider. The first is that we have not in Australia timber suitable for the purposes for which New Zealand white pine is used. Secondly, because of the difference between the duty on undressed white pine and that on dressed white pine, employment is now given to thousands of Australian workmen, and machinery of great value is used. This pine is ployed largely in the construction of working men's homes, and it would be a severe blow to them to have the duty increased. Thirdly, Baltic pine is dressed by foreigners, in their own country, and undressed New Zealand white pine should, therefore, have a preference if we cannot get - both in free. Fourthly, i duty on New Zealand white pine were increased to 2s. 6d. per 100 feet supercaught. ficial, thousands of Australian workmen would lose the employment given in the dressing of it here, and the working of it up into a condition enabling it to be used for building and other purposes.",142
1129,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Richmond) [4-43]-Ttere is no substitute in Australia for New Zealand white pine.,142
1130,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,For the making of butter boxes 1,142
1131,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,What about Queensland hoop pine?,142
1132,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"About 40 per cent, of the New Zealand white pine which comes here is used for butter boxes, and 60 per cent, in the construction of artisans' cottages. That pine comes in. at the lowest rate. Kauri and red deal are valuable timbers, which are used for joinery work, and are rightly charged at a higher rate. The Minister said at the opening of the discussion that he believed that the proposal I before us would give effect to the intention of Parliament when originally imposing timber duties. We cannot get locally timber suitable for the purposes for which New Zealand white pine is used. That is the true Protectionist stand-point, and I gave a Protectionist vote. He is Mr THOMAS BROWN (Calare) [4.46] - It is all very well for the apologists for the butter industry to put before the Committee the phase of the question just stated by the honourable member for Richmond; but it is not a correct.view of the matter. It is stated that of the importations of white pine about 43 per cent, is used in making butter boxes; but there are large importations of other pines, which have been excluded by the vote just given; and, to the extent to which they have been excluded, the building industry, as well as those who cater for the frui t and rabbit industries, have been penalized. I am surprised that those interested in dairying should be prepared, under the guise of fighting this Tariff-in order to assist other em- industries-to make terms with the Minister",142
1133,The CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The honourable - member must not deal with that matter.,142
1134,Mr THOMASBROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I regret that I shall not be in order in doing so; but when it comes to a question of gaining an f the advantage for one industry, to the detriment of others, I do not intend to be I shall, therefore, vote on this occasion to put all on an equal footing.",142
1135,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Capricornia) [4.48] - Fre e Trade members constantly make the same speech in regard to Protectionist proposals, and speak of our robbing one industry for the benefit of another. Where was the building industry, to which the honourable member for Wentworth has referred, prior to the adoption of a Protectionist policy for Australia ? In those days we had practically no building industry in any of the States, whereas we now have all-round prosperity. It is true that people are building largely in the suburbs of Sydney, as well as in practically every large city in Australia, but the demand for more house accommodation, is due to the fact that, as the result of our Protectionist policy, ample employment is offering. A great deal of our increased prosperity is also attributable, as I am reminded, to Labour legislation, and that legislation would not have been possible without a Protectionist Tariff. I hope that honourable members will adhere to the item.",143
1136,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [4.50] - The honourable member for Capricornia is quite right in attributing the great increase in the building trade in the capital cities of Australia to Protection and Labour legislation. The Almighty has been encouraged by Tariffs and Labour legislation to grant beneficent seasons to Australia, and, in that way, production and enterprise have been increased throughout the Commonwealth. But if we are to have Protection, why not have it all round ? Why should an industry employing 40,000 or 50,000 Australians meet with, not only scant consideration in this Chamber, but with something approaching chicanery? Why should there be ""logrolling"" between interests so divergent?",143
1137,The CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member must withdraw the word "" logrolling.""",143
1138,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I do so.; but we have just seen consummated a rather remarkable alliance between honourable members who wanted, first of all, to keep out all New Zealand pine, and others who only wanted to get in the particular variety of New Zealand pine which the farmers whom they represent require for butter-box making.",143
1139,The CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The honourable member must deal with the question before the Chair.,143
1140,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Then I am sorry that so much has got into Hansard to which I am unable to reply. I suggest to my honourable friends who [156] share my indignation as to the method in which this business has been transacted--thos e who feel that we owe some duty to artisans working in our great cities, as well as to prosperous farmers in rural districts - that we shall not necessarily improve our position materially, if , merely to score off the butter-making side of this unholy combination, we play the game of the timbergrowing side of it. We can test the question by moving to insert after the word "" p in e "" in the.item as it now stands, "" New Zealand white pine undressed, n.e.i.,"" the words "" including rimu and kauri."" We shall then revert to the position under the old Tariff. I wish particularly to have it on record that this Committee has ignored the claims of artisans engaged in building operations in the great Australian cities, and especially in the city from which I have the honour to come. I move That the amendment be amended by inserting after the word "" Pine"" the words "" including Rimu and Kauri.""",143
1141,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"[4.56] - The Ministry intend to vote against this amendment, which is much on the lines of the proposition last negatived. I trust that, since we have discussed this item for some hours, honourable members will proceed to a vote as soon as possible, as I , for one, certainly do not desire that we shall have another all-night sitting. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [4.57] - The honourable member for Richmond questioned the accuracy of a statement made by me to the Committee regarding the use of certain New Zealand timbers, but persons engaged in the business, whom I have since had an opportunity to consult, inform me that my statement was absolutely correct. They inform me that timbers which I said were used largely in the erection of artisans' dwellings are so used, and that the timber which the honourable member for Richmond said was used for joinery purposes, is instead used principally for Scoring and lining in the cheaper classes of artisans' homes.",143
1142,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Cook) [4.58] - I suggested that we should take such action as would place the whole of these. New Zealand pines on the dutiable list, but I am prepared to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth, which would place other New Zealand pines under the duty of 6d. per 100 super, feet. I hope that those who were so ready to offer a concession to the dairy farmers will be prepared to enable other sections of the community to take advantage of the same arrangement.",143
1143,Mr GORDON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Boothby) [4.59] - I intend to accept the compromise offered by the Minister. When he made that offer earlier in the afternoon I thought it a. very fair one, but I voted as I did on the last division because the Committee seemed to be so confused that I felt it would be better to go back and stand by the old Tariff until we were in a better position to-discuss these timber duties as a whole and to arrive at a definite decision with respect to them.",144
1144,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wimmera) [5.0] Having .already voted on this question, it is really, in my opinion, a waste of time to pursue it further.",144
1145,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I desire to know whether the honourable member is in order in saying that I am wasting the time of the Committee in moving an amendment which is to test the opinion of honourable members on a question which it is claimed has not been properly decided.,144
1146,The CHAIRMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It is not parliamentary to say that an honourable member is wasting the time of the Committee.,144

1149,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Yes .,144
1150,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"We ought to have some further information. We met late in the afternoon, and, perhaps, there has not been an opportunity to discuss some of the items as fully as we should have liked. But we are now faced with the proposal to impose a 10 per cent, duty on the raw material used by every vehicle builder in Australia. There is no evidence to show that we produce the hickory required for the thousands of vehicles used throughout Australia. I have received letters from reliable coachbuilders in my constituency-and I suppose honourable members have received similar communications-to the effect that it is impossible to obtain any Australian hickory spokes or felloes. Under the circumstances, the proposed duty will be a 34 purely revenue impost.",144

1152,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"No evidence has been given to us on this point during the debate; and we ought to be very careful before we impose a duty of this kind. There are quite enough revenue duties at the present time. The Protectionist section of the Tariff Commission investigated this matter very exhaustively, and, only three years ago, they came to a unanimous conclusion that they could not recommend a duty on spokes and felloes. What has transpired since to warrant a 10 per cent, duty on such an important item of raw material?",145
1153,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.1.5]--The rate has not been imposed by the Government as a revenue duty'. There is a carriage woodware factory at a place called Nundah. near Brisbane. 1 iunderstand that sixty or seventy men are working there under good conditions, and turning out a first-class article. I'admit that the company are not satisfied with the duty which has been imposed, but the Cabinet considered that as they had made a start without any protection, a duty of 10 per cent, would give them a chance of becoming established. The Government think it would not be fair to impose the duty of 25 or 30 per cent., which the company desired, as they would not be able to turn out all the material required in the near future.",145
1154,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Moreton) [5.17] - I . am surprised that, when we ask for a small duty to develop our industries, Victorian members should object to it as a rsvenue duty.",145
1155,Mr SAMPSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I only asked for information.,145
1156,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The Minister has given it. If the honourable member is in want of any of the articles of which he spoke, the manager of the establishment, who will be passing through Victoria shortly, will take orders for any number of spokes, felloes, or other carriage ware. They are manufactured at the factory, under the very best conditions of labour. Principally Australian timber is used, or, at any rate, they are anxious to use it. While the duty is not as large as I wanted, it is something. The company would be quite satisfied with a duty of 15 per cent. Will the Minister make the rate 15 per cent. (General Tariff), and 10 per cent. (United Kingdom)? [TS6]-2",145

1159,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"A duty of 15 per cent, cannot be considered high. The industry is growing very slowly. Will the Minister put on record his interpretation of the words "" in the rough,"" in paragraph DD? Amendment (by Mr TUDOR) proposed - That the following new paragraph be inserted after the seventh paragraph of the item :- "" By omitting from sub-i'cm (DD) (I ) the words ' in the rough,' and inserting in their stead the words ' rough turned but not shouldered or tenoned.' "" Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [5,20] Some honourable members think we have no hickory in Australia, but the most successful maker of vehicles and machinery in my electorate does not use imported timber, but what he calls Australian hickory, which he gets from the Bago mountain, near Tumbarumba. He never uses a stick of it until it has been reasoned for three years, and that is why his undertaking has been so successful. The forest covers 70,000 acres, and comprises asfinetimber as exists, perhaps, 111 the world. Although it is a long way from, the market, there is a sawmill there, working, I believe, full time, making felloes, oars, and other articles for which timber which can stand a great strain is required. The undertaking has to compete against a great deal of opposition, and carts its supplies immense distances, but still it survives, and is the commencement of a great industry in Australia. I understand that a similar industry has been developed to a great extent in Queensland. The honourable member for Wimmera need not be at all alarmed about our not having timber to take the place of the imported. We only need railway communication and quick transit to make our timber as cheap as it can be obtained from any part of the world, and then, with a good duty placed on imported timbers, the industry would be a good thing for the country. Neither in America nor Canada did I see timbers to be compared with those of Australia. We have not commenced to realise the valua of our timbers. We do not prize them, and do not stop their destruction as we should-. It was a crying shame that an immense quantity of beautiful timber on th?. Murray should have been destroyed, but we have plenty of timber in the mountain ranges. Mir. HEDGES (Fremantle) [5.253 Will the Minister explain what "".felloes of hickory "" mean? We get hickory rims, bnt, so far as I can learn, no felloes of hickory are importer!. Will the Minister explain the effect of leaving out ths footnote defining superface? Will it open up the old question of double measurement?",145
1160,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.26] - In the 1907-8 Tariff the words "" spokes, rims, and felloes of hickory in the rough "" occur. If were right, - then they are right now. although. I do not. know whether ""felloes of hickory "" is a correct technical term., or known to the. trade. In the last Tariff, Parliament altered the term "" superface "" to ""super, feet"" everywhere, except in paragraph T of item 303. We propose to put the whole of *he timber duties on a uniform basis, and, instead of having one kind of timber measured superface and all the others measured super, feet, we have made paragraph T subject to super, feet measurement, and increased the rate from, 2s. 6d. to 5s., which brings out exactly the same effect, because we are going to measure now only one side, whereas previously in that case we measured on two sides. Amendment agreed to. ' Mr JH CATTS (Cook) [5.27] - This is the time to remind the Minister of his undertaking to insert a duty on dressed timber, as paragraph r of item 303.",146
1161,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.28] - I have not forgotten the promise I made to the honourable member to increase the rate on dressed timber in certain circumstances, but the Chairman tells me that I had better move it as a new item..",146
1162,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Fremantle) [5.29] Will the striking out of the footnote regarding ""superface"" affect the price of timber for making boxes or doors?",146

1164,Mr HEDGES,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Is it proposed to measure both faces of the board ?,146

(B) Gramaphones, Phonographs, and other Talking Machines, including cases imported with Machines, when the value, without horn, exceeds £ 5 ; Horns for Talking Machines, whether accompanying the Machines or otherwise, ad valorem (General Tariff), 35 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 30 per cent. (c) Unassembled Metal parts of Talking Machines but not including Horns, Free."" Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) £5.41] - Previously , talking machines, graphophones, gramaphones, phonographs, commercial or business, including all accessories except horns, were admitted free, but now it is proposed to impose duties of 35 and 30 per cent, on all exceeding in value £ 5 without horns. This is a very unwise proposal. These musical instruments have done much to educate our public, and give a great deal of pleasure in domestic and social circles. When honourable members are worked up - to a white heat, as they were for a short time this afternoon, the playing of a Melba or Dani record would have such a soothing influence that an atmosphere surcharged with electricity would soon be peaceful and calm again. Music, by touching the sensitive chords of our nature, awakens its better feelings, and elevates our sentiments as nothing else can. Nothing but good can result from the use of the best records obtainable, and the best machines obtainable. The refining influence of music is of incalculable value. The duty, however, would place the best of these musical instruments out of the reach of the ordinary public.",146
1171,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"--If the Committee negatives the item, these instruments will continue to come in free. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It would probably be safer to first propose a reduction in the rates. I therefore move:Taat the following words be added to subftem D :- "" and on. and after 14th December, 1911, 5 per cent, and free.""",147
1172,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [5.45],- I wish only to suggest to the Minister one or two considerations that may have escaped him. First of all, the proposal to differentiate between gramaphones, so as to bring the better class under a duty equal to that applying to furniture generally, and, on the other hand, the cheaper articles, which are not brought out in cabinets, may lead himi into an error. The importation of the higher priced talking machines is not very large, and it is questionable whether it would be worthwhile collecting what is undoubtedly a purely revenue duty. The better the gramaphone the better the investment, and wealthy people are not the only class who invest in the better class of instruments. About 25 per cent, of the total purchasers are buying high-priced machines on the deferred payment system. As Postmaster-General the present Minister of External Affairs was frequently met with', requests for a telephone to be placed on the back door of every settler. The mere fact that a man was a pioneer, or an out-back' settler, in .the opinion of many persons, entitled him to a telephone. But as a solace to a man in the bush, which is likely to be the better acquisition- a reasonably cheap gramaphone or an expensive telephone? This is an item that affects the working community, and I suggest that the Minister might well allow it to remain as in the existing Tariff. This will be a purely revenue duty, and, according to the honourable member for Hume, a revenue duty is an anomaly.  does not protect is an anomaly.",147
1173,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,If those who take that view will only support my request we shall have no further difficulty. I think that the Minister admits that tiiis is a purely revenue duty.,147
1174,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I have said nothing of the kind. In some instances these machines are brought out in cabinets 5 feet high.,147
1175,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Then , the proper course for the Minister to pursue would be to place a duty, not on the machines, but on the cabinets, in order to protect the cabinetmaking industry. As the item, stands, however, both the machines and the cabinets will be liable to the duty.",147
1176,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.52] - In the item, in the existing Tariff, we had the words "" including all accessoriesexcept horns."" It was found, however, that that term was too wide, and that, under it. people were able to import free of duty machines in cabinets, in some cases about 5 feet high and 2 f t . 6 in. wide. One importer told me that had no less than twenty-five such cabinets, which are really articles of furniture. As argument. to the minimum value of £ 5 being too low, I think that is really too high, and that might very well be reduced to £ 2 ios. or £ 3 , without doing any injury to purchasers of talking machines. of gramaphones. We found that we were unable to tax these cabinets, as they ought to have been taxed, as articles of furniture, since they were held to be part and parcel of the gramaphones themselves.",147

The incident may well be illustrated by the story of two people who were arguing from two different buildings and who were told by a passing lawyer that they would never agree becabinet. cause they were arguing from different premises. In conversation with Mr. Sparks I found that the lighter class material of which the honourable member for Hume was thinking was different from that which I had in mind, and Sparks told me that the grenadines had never been manufactured in his factory, nor so far as he was aware were they being produced by any factory in Australia. hope I have made the amende honourable, - for I should not like the friendship he tween the honourable member for Hume and myself to be disturbed even by a political",148

I should of be prepared to support effective Protection in the case of the cabinet; but a large trade is done in gramaphones and other Mr instruments. The item in the schedule, while it may have the effect of affording protection to articles of furniture, will, at the same time, greatly harass those enI gaged in. the gramaphone and phonograph business. 1_ am afraid that the Minister bewill fine, if ce persists in his proposal, that he has created a greater anomaly, which will require to be dealt with later on. I suggest that he deal with the articles separately.",148

1190,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The honourable member means the gramaphone cabinet?,149
1191,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes ; that could be done without harassing the trade in the instruments themselves. In my own electorate, there is a large business done in these machines, which many of the workpeople buy on time payment. The Minister's proposal means the maximum of disturbance with the minimum of benefit; and more than he desires could be obtained by a fixed duty.",149
1192,Mr WH IRVINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Flinders) [6.5]. - The Minister, in intimating that 'he proposes to withdraw the duty on motor chassis, practically admits that the principle on which this class of duty is imposed is fallacious. Where there is a composite article, part of which is intended to be dutiable and part free, the difficulty arises that importers endeavour to value as low as possible the part that is dutiable, and as high as possible that which is not dutiable. It seems illogical, however, to attempt to get over the difficulty by placing a duty on the whole article.",149
1193,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I admit that there is difficulty.,149
1194,Mr WH IRVINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I advise the Minister to take what power he thinks necessary for ascertaining the actual value of the cases, quite independently of the estimates of the importers; let him preserve to himself by regulation, or otherwise, the fullest authority in this regard. This is a principle which applies to a good many other articles besides gramaphones and motor chassis.",149

I am further informed that there is nobody in Australia making ""bottoms "" at the present time. The local timber, I understand, costs as much as a ready-made article does purchased in Germany or Holland. The fact that the raw material bears as high a duty as the finished article is one which, I think, will commend itself to .the Minister as an anomaly. Item agreed to.

1198,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"This duty is not imposed in the interests of the tyre industry ; and on that point I desire to disabuse honourable word members' minds. This item is to enable the Department to arrive at the average price of the rubber, so that importers-if I may say so without seeming offensivemay not be able to practically juggle with values, in order to reduce the duty payable. This has been repeatedly the case, so far as motor tyres are concerned. The honourable member for Wentworth, and the honourable member for Melbourne, intimated earlier in the day that they desired to make some reference to bicycle tyres and tubes, and I am quite prepared to listen to what they, and others, may have to say.",149
1199,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Wentworth) [6.13] - This proposal of the Minister will not really help the users of what he calls the "" push "" bicycle. The average bicycle tyre weighs between 1 lb. 10 or 12 ozs., and 2 lbs., and the tube, I understand, about 10 ozs. These tyres are sold in different grades in Europe, just as in Australia. If we take the medium grade of cycle tyre, the wholesale price, free on board, in Europe is about 5s. The cheapest tyre that can be bought in Europe, corresponding, more or less, to the no-guarantee tyre produced by the Dunlop Company in Melbourne, is valued at 3s. The average weight is somewhere under a lbs., and, at rod., each tyre will pay a duty of is. 8d., if from Great Britain, and 2s. if from a foreign country. On the other hand, the ad valorem duty of 25 and 20 per cent., which obtained before the introduction of this schedule, would mean is. on the 5s. tyre, and 7d. on die 3s. tyre in the case of British goods, and is. 3d. and od. in the case of foreign goods. The poundage rate thus increases the duty by well over 100 per cent. A rate war has been going on for the an exception? last year in die motor tyre trade between the Miclielin and Continental Companies, but the bicycle tyre trade case. is practically carried on at fixed prices and grades, due to the fact that over firms in Europe are competing with one other in that line. The Dunlop Rubber Company of Australia, which, I am happy to say, is flourishing, its cumulative prefera ence £ 1 shares being sold in the Melbourne market, before these duties were introduced, diately at 35s. or 36s., and which, therefore, not want additional Protection, competes with the 5s. f .o.b. in Europe tyre with tyre called the Oceanic, sold here at iod. The price of the best bicycle tyre about 9s. 9d. or ,10s. The no-guarantee tyre, at 4s.,, competes with the cheapest European tyre, which is sold at 3s., on which the duty suddenly rises from to 2s., or an increase of over 300 per cent. The Minister, in endeavouring to regulate the uneven invoices of motor tyres, ought to be careful that he does not hit the bike rider.",150
1200,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I do not desire to' hit any one; but we wish to have something like a fair alternative, so that there will not be any "" juggling,"" if that term is not offensive.",150
1201,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The fixed rates on motor tyres might, I think, be allowed to remain with safety, in view of the condition of prices. The Minister would be perfectly safe to make the duties on ordinary bicycle tyres what they were previously, at the ad valorem rates. I come now to motor bicj'cle tyres, which are also at fixed rates. A tyre' like the Triumph, 26 inches by 2% inches, weighing from 6 to 7 lbs., has a wholesale value in London of 15s. The duty on that cover, at is. 6d. per lb., would come to at least 9s. under the general Tariff. Those t5'res are now sold to the trade in Australia at 23s., or less than cost and duty amount to. The ad valorem rates previously worked out at 3s. 3d. (United Kingdom), and 4s. (General Tariff), on a 15s. tyre. It would be desirable to have sufficient competition with motor bicycle tyres from abroad to regulate the price more or Jess. It would be advisable either to reduce the poundage rate on them, so as to arrive at a reasonable fixed duty, for it will be agreed that 9s. is not a fair duty on a 15s. article, or impose ad valorem rates.",150
1202,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Is that an average case, or",150
1203,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I am told it is an average An important consideration is that fixed 100 rates may tend to discourage new inanventions in the way of substitutes for rubber. A great deal of experimenting is now going on in Europe in the search for substitute for rubber for tyres. If it can be found, the motor industry will immebecome industrially possible does throughout Australia, although the rubber industry will suffer in a minor degree. If a a fixed rate is imposed the Department will 6s. have to be constantly watching to see what is composition the cheaper tyres are being made of. About a year ago a man I know in England produced a cheap motor tyre which and he was selling at about half the price of 7d. the ordinary motor tyre. He broke the ring in London, and there was a great uproar about it. These tyres were probably made of some composition, but were wearing just as well as rubber. The fixed duty will shut this. SQit of tyre out. The public interest requires that we should endeavour to make some industrial use of the motor trade, which, in Australia, is at present almost entirely a luxury. In every old established country in the world the motor trade is of great industrial value. A census recently taken in London showed that 97 per cent, of the traffic in the biggest thoroughfare was motor traffic. With a due regard to Australian industries, such as the Dunlop Rubber Company, we ought to keep our eyes constantly Open for means of making extensive use of motor traction, but I am afraid the tendency of the poundage rate will be to keep out the pioneers of the cheap resilient tyres.",150
1204,Dr MALONEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Melbourne) [6.27] I am pleased to be able to endorse almost every remark of the honourable member for Wentworth regarding pneumatic rubber tyres for the push bicycle. It would be far better for the Government to revert to the old rates of 25 per cent. (General Tariff) and 20 per cent. (United Kingdom). The average weight of covers is from about i j lbs, to 2 lbs. The item, as it affects - motor tyres, can be left as it is. My information regarding the weight of motor bicycle tyres is somewhat at variance with the case quoted by the honourable member. He spoke of a certain standard tyre that weighs a little heavier than the others, but some motor bicycle tyres run about 4 lbs. in weight, which would lessen the amount of the fixed duty. The honourable member and I were evidently making similar in-quiries in London regarding compositions for tyres. I was able to render a slight service to the representative of a big American firm, Who are exploiting a deposit of what is known as mineral rubber, and he told me that a compound of three-quarters mineral rubbei and one-quarter pure Para rubber'gave better results than Para rubber alone, although, in certain cases, it could not be used. He estimated that ultimately the compound would be sold to the world at 2^d. per lb. At present, its price is 6d. per lb.",151

In this matter we are far behind the Old World, where motor traction has largely replaced horse traction, and, being a country of magnificent distances, anything that will enable us to get from point to point more quickly and cheaply will be of great advantage to the community. I am afraid that the Minister, in providing against administrative difficulties, may be penalizing the users of push bieycles and motor bicycles, these vehicles having been largely substituted for horses by shearers and many other workers. According to the honourable member for Wentworth, the riders of push bicycles will be penalized to the extent of is. 8d. or 2s. a tyre, and of motor cycles to the extent of about gs. on the cheaper tyres. The position might be met by imposing a duty of so much a pound on motor car tyres, and an ad valorem duty, as at present, on bicycle and motor cycle tyres.",151
1207,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [7.49] - The suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth is, I understand, that bicycle tyres shall be charged ad valorem, and other tyres over 2J lbs. in weight, and tubes over i lb. in weight, at a fixed rate of so much a pound, or ad valorem.",151

1213,Sir ROBERT BEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I am informed that reclaimed rubber is a raw material of our manufacturers, and used in considerable quantities by them, and that to successfully compete against the importations from Europe and America it should be free. The Protection now afforded by the Tariff on rubber goods is not great, having regard to the wages paid, and the duties on chemicals and other ingredients used in the process of manufacture. A duty on reclaimed rubber would seriously affect our manufacturers, and, as reclaimed rubber is practically on the same footing as masticated rubber, it should, like it, be admitted free.",152

1216,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Calare) [8.0]. - This seems to be a revenue duty rather than a proposal to give any encouragement to the production of rubber in Australia. I shall not, however, discuss that phase of the question. I understand that in Papua efforts are being made, with considerable promise of success, to develop the rubber industry, but that imports from that territory are treated as if they came from a foreign country, no preference being allowed in respect of them. There should be a closer commercial relationship between the Commonwealth and Papua, and, since it is proposed under this item to allow a preference of 5 per cent, in the case of imports from the United Kingdom, I suggest that a similar preference should be allowed in respect of imports from Papua.",152
1217,Mr THOMAS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Why not make such imports from Papua free?,152
1218,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"-B y all Kingmeans. I thought that the Government were in need of revenue from this so: , e,and therefore did not ask for more :han a preference of 5 per cent.",152
1219,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Capricornia) [8.3] - I JIB amazed at the remarks of the honourable member for Calare. It would seem to me that we need a political schoolmaster, whose task it would be to inform honourable members of their duty to the Commonwealth, the Labour party, and the wage earners' interests. I do not understand how those who believe in keeping Australia for the white races could possibly favour the free admission of the black-labour products of Papua. Those who go to Papua to exploit the native labour should be called upon to pay the highest duty on their products when they are brought into the Commonwealth. The minimum rate of wages paid to the natives is ios. per month, and rations. They are paid, however, only once in two years, and the natives sometimes are so badly treated that they leave their employment at the end of twelve months, with the result that no wages are received by them. The adoption of the suggestion just made would mean the thin edge of the wedge for preferential rates in respect of the produce of those who were recently described as our fellow British-Indian subjects. Hoards of Indians are employed at 3d. per day in producing certain commodities, and some gentlemen who have extraordinary ideas concerning Imperialism would ask us to allow those commodities to come in under the preferential rate.",152
1220,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,There is no analogy between Papua and India.,152
1221,Mr HIGGS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I think there is. I am' not prepared to grant any preference to the product of an. industry in which the rates of pay and conditions of labour are not the same as those which' Australian employers are called upon to observe. Whilst our Tariff has been responsible for a good deal of our prosperity, it will have to be increased to the verge of 100 per cent, before we shall be able to keep out black-labour commodities produced by capitalists who go to India, China, Java, and Japan to secure cheap labour.",152

I understand that this duty, if retained, will materially interfere with rubber works at present in Australia. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [8.9] My information is that reclaimed rubber should be placed in the same position as is masticated 'rubber, since there is practically no difference between the two. I do not profess to know much about the matter, but I ask the Minister to take the suggestion into consideration.",152

1228,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If there are saddles which fall below the value indicated, where is the justification for treating the item in this particular way?",153

1230,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It is hard to prove the value of any article; but the honourable member would not, on that account, confine the Tariff exclusively to fixed duties ?",153

1232,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [8.16] - There has been no request from manufacturers in regard to this item, but I was approached by the 5s. ; representatives of the workmen who form the Saddlers Federation of Australia, and shown the rates of wages paid under the Wages Board award in Victoria. The workman receives 8s. in wages for making the cheapest saddle of the third quality, 9s. for saddles of the second quality, and 18s. for saddles of the first quality; these amounts represent wages alone. The men asked for a higher fixed duty than the one that is proposed, and I asked whether any of the manufacturers would join with them in their request. The reply was in the negative, the reason given being that most of the manufacturers are also importers, and always balanced one against the other. The men said that they were always unable to get higher wages, and they desired a duty that would be effective in preventing the cheapest saddles from coming in. They assured me that this would not have the effect of increasing the price of the cheap saddles.",153
1233,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"What does the Minister mean by saying that the employers ""always balanced one against the other ""?",153
1234,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I was told that the employers always informed their workmen that wages could not be raised-that,'soone r than raise the wages, they would import the saddles. That was the reason that induced me to submit this proposal to tha Committee. With ad valorem duties there is always a tendency to import the cheapest articles; and the fixed duty represents more than the ad valorem rate on such goods.",153
1235,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Brisbane) [8.19] The explanation of the Minister is satisfactory to a certain extent; but I should like to know whether he took steps to verify the information given him by the saddlers of Victoria?,154

Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [8.20]. - I trust that the Minister will further reduce the duty, because even a duty of 3s. will have the effect of wiping out the industry - already carried on in Victoria.",154
1238,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Does that apply to the whole of Australia?,154
1239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes ; so far as this industry is concerned. I have here samples showing the state of the hide when it is imported, and the hide in its finished state, so that honourable members may see the work that is bestowed upon it. I urge the Minister to reduce the duty to, at any rate, is. or 2s., in consideration for those who are endeavouring to establish an industry and make a living. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [8.23] - The fact that the Minister has, of his own volition, proposed to reduce this duty, is an indication that the schedule was hurriedly prepared without due consideration. In his greed and anxiety to extract more and more money out of the pockets of a long-suffering but not sufficiently complaining people, the Minister has swallowed any proposal suggested, without taking care to ascertain how it might affect the country at large.",154
1240,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Does the honourable member not welcome the suggestion of the honourable member for Hume? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am very glad to see that even so voracious a Protectionist as the honourable member for Hume is suffering from satiety, and is beginning to rebel against this excessive taxation. I only hope his attitude today is a forerunner of his attitude in regard to Protectionist Tariffsgenerally, and that he will propose reductions in item after item, until he reaches the Free Trade point of view. Under such duties, the consumer is robbed without knowing that he is robbed; and there is no doubt that this impost, made, apparently, without any warrant, will seriously interfere with anestablished industry, and certainly not justified by even a pretence that there is an anomaly to be rectified. I propose to rsad a letter in this connection from Messrs. J. P. Howe and Company Proprietary Limited, of the Excelsior Patent Leather as folWorks, who conduct a well-established industry at Preston, and who will be very adversely affected by this duty. The letter this contains ""the following:TARIFF AMENDMENT - DIVISIO NXII . , LEATHERAND RUBBER. Under the above heading amongst the amendments you will note item 353, and to this it isproposed should be added a new sub-item (D) "" Hides limed, fleshed or split, per hide, 5s."" We think it important that w« should explain what tins new sub-item would mean. iFor some considerable time hides limed, fleshed, split and haired have been regularly imported from New Zealand, but the imposition of a duty such as is proposed will prevent the further importation of any hides in the condition above referred to, regardless of the consequences. The amount of work expended on hides to bring them into the condition specified under (he proposition of the Government is very small and usually considered unimportant, but to our industry and the public the imposition of such a duty is very serious. To our industry, because we have put in an expensive plant, erected extensive buildings, and laid in full stocks of materials for the treatment of such hides, which embraces the tanning, currying, and enamelling :Why the Minister should aim a destructive blow at an established industry in his own State is more than I can comprehend :To the public, because they will be forcedto pay higher prices for an inferior grade of leather to that which we have been able to put on the market, whilst such hides have been imported free of duty. The benefit to be conferred upon the worker by the imposition of such a duty is hardly worth consideration, for we can assure you that the cost of un-hairing,. fleshing, and splitting hides does not exceed the sum of is. gel. per hide, and this work could be carried out by our present staff. Our reason for not doing this class of work is that the selection of hides in Australia (where no regard is paid to the branding or the flaying of the hides) is such that it practically makes it impossible for an industry like ours to be carried on successfully. This forced us to investigate the matter and ascertain what could be done in New Zealand, where more care is exercised: in the branding and flaying, and the hides are also more uniform and freer from other defects, such as scars, cuts, & c , and after incurring; great expense and arranging with large suppliers (who export to the English and Continental markets many thousands of hides pel year in exactly the same condition as those referred to above) to select specially from the best of the hides that come through their hands our requirements, we have in the past been able to secure for the Australian users a very high grade of material, which has enabled us to produce enamelled leathers that have been commented upon by English and Continental manufacturers as being equal to anything that is produced in any otheT part of the world. The fact of these hides being duty free has also enabled us to supply very large quantities of the finished article in competition with the outside world to the various States and also New Zealand. The imposition of a duty as proposed by the Ministry means the annihilation of our industry, for it will be impossible for us to carry on as the average Australian hides offering at the present time will not suit our purpose, having far too many blemishes owing to being badly and excessively branded, carelessly flayed, and full of cuts, scratches, and scars, and until legislation is brought into existence compelling greater care in connection with this-on e of our natural products-a n alteration cannot be hoped for. Therefore, to impose this duty can hardly be considered iii the interests of the public, as it will confer an advantage on no one, but will force out of existence a growing industry and compel the users of high class leather to import their requirements. The labour expended 00 these hides after we receive them from New Zealand costs considerably over 15s. per hide in wages paid, which are based upon rates much higher than those determined uppn by the Wages Boards in connection with the Tanners and Curriers! industry, and the proposed duty means sacrificing the whole of this, besides preventing the public from obtaining the high-grade leather we are enabled to manufacture by virtue of being able to secure a special selection of skins, for practically no gain to the worker, seeing that, as previously stated, the amount of wages paid for the preparing of the hides in the mannei referred to in the proposed Tariff does not exceed is. gd. per hide. These facts we can substantiate, and should you wish to verify them, we will be pleased to give you an opportunity. Coming from a well-established and reputable firm, these statements deserve serious consideration, and unless the Minister can controvert them, he has no justification for introducing the sub-item.",154
1241,Mr OZANME,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Did you not get another letter diametrically opposed to that? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I did notj but if I did it would only prove how foolish we are to legislate to give people special privileges to rob the public, when even the privileged persons themselves cannot agree as to what they want from the Parliament. All this shows how utterly foolish and wrong it is to table a revision of the Tariff in the expiring days of the session. These matters require careful investigation and inquiry. It would take months to read and digest all the communications that reach us, and sift the right from the wrong in the'conflicting, and often grossly inaccurate, mass of information supplied to us on both sides. I read the letter because it appeared to come from a reputable firm, and its statements were"" couched in moderate language, and did not seem to be exaggerated. I have not seen the writer, nor do I know any member of the firm personally. Without taking any personal responsibility for the accuracy of its statements, the letter bears the impress of a fair and correct presentation of the case, and if we are to believe it, that industry will suffer very materially. I therefore move That the sub-item be left out.",155
1242,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Why not be reasonable; the honourable member cannot carry that. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Perhaps I cannot; but are we never to move a thing unless we can carry it? A man should fight for his principles all the time, no matter how often he is defeated. I do not suppose when I look at the solid phalanx of Protectionists, by whom I am surrounded, that I shall get much consideration in the matter of reductions or abolitions of duty, but when I believe it right to move for them. I shall do so.  [8.40] - I much regret that the Minister has reduced the duty from 5s.; but what surprises me is the attitude of the honourable member for Hume. I have seen the honourable member for Lang in some peculiar political company lately, but I did not expect to see him in the company of the honourable member for Hume in this matter. The honourable member for Lang displayed so much heat in advocating his Free Trade .principles that he dispelled any inclination we might have had to believe the assurance of the honourable member for Parramatta that the Free Traders accepted Protection as the settled policy of the country, and that honourable members on the other side were a happy family. The honourable member for Lang quoted from a lengthy letter which he received from, a firm that has been in existence only four months, and from others who are engaged in the tanning, not of hides, but of sides. The honourable member totally ignored another memorandum that he must have received - from a firm which has been engaged for twenty-five years in the tanning of hides. The honourable member said a good deal about the poor consumer. Of late, we have heard him pleading for the poor tenant, the poor tenant farmer, and the poor widow, but we are getting used to it. The people the honourable member really has in his mind are the poor importers. These hides are at present being brought largely from New Zealand, fleshed, haired, and limed. I should like the honourable member for Hume to hear the other side of this question, because I am surprised at such a staunch Protectionist saying that this duty would mean the crushing out of our industries. We have more people engaged in hairing, fleshing, arid splitting hides in Australia, and therefore likely to benefit by item, than there are people who will be injured by it. We should have greater care and regard for those engaged in the work of this country. The importations of hides from New Zealand, limed, unhaired, split, and ready for tanning, does away with the lime-jobbers and beamsmen, and throws out of employment pit and tan-yard hands. tanneries in Victoria which have spent thousands of pounds on machinery for the splitting of hides. According to the memorandum read by the honourable member for Lang, the.hides needed for special work cannot be obtained in Victoria and New South Wales; but I know several tanneries which for many years have used such hides exclusively.",155
1243,Mr MASSYGREENE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Hear , hear 1  about every 150 local hides, some fifty are described as culls. The importation of pickled hides from New Zealand will throw out of work the men who are employed to prepare these culls. According to the honourable member for Lang, the work done 011 the imported hides costs only about is.. 6d. a hide.",156
1244,Sir ROBERT BEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"On e shilling and ninepence.  ficial view shows that it costs more like The tanneries I have in mind pay their beamsmen 57 s. a week, and a beamsman diture can do about sixty whole hides a week, which is a cost of about is. a hide. Making the allowance for culls to which have referred, the cost is increased to IS. 4d., to which must be added is. 6d. for splitting the green whole hides, bringat ing it up to 2s. l o d . To allow only for the labour on limes and other treatment would be absurd, but this would bring the total to over 3s. In my opinion, the lowest rate of duty should be 4s. I know that the proprietor of a tannery offered to let a contract to another tannery to do certain hides for 3s., so that obviously they cannot be done for less. It is the hide-tanners principally whom the proposal affects, and whom we, as Protectionists, should consider, seeing that they employ twice as much labour as the side-tanners. More harm will be done by injuring those engaged in the' tanning of hides than by injuring the handful engaged in the tanning of sides. My opinion is that any duty that does not protect is an anomaly, and I hope that the Minister will the reconsider his proposal.",156
1245,Sir ROBERT BEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Kooyong) [8.53]. - In my introductory remarks, I selected this industry to show how difficult it is for the Committee to deal with conflicting statements. The remarks of the honourable member for Lang were based on good authority, and similar information was supThere are plied to me, but they were flatly contradicted by the honourable member for Indi. According to the representations made to me, the duty would strike a blow at a well established industry, employing a large number of men. It would seem strange that our tanners should have to import hides from New Zealand, but the fact is that the legislation of the Dominion regarding the branding and flaying of hides prevents scars and blemishes.  Government is now taking the matter in hand.",156
1246,Sir ROBERTBEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If the State Governments can be induced to deal with this matter, I shall side with the honourable member; but, until the local hides are so treated that they are free from blemish, the importation of New Zealand hides ought not to be prevented, so that an important industry may not seriously suffer. I understand that in one place ,£750 is in paying duties on hides alone. My 4s. appeal is in the interest of an established industry. I am informed that the expenon the imported hides is, at the most, is. od. or 2S., but that the work done here to produce a sample such as was exhibited I by the honourable member for Hume costs something like 16s. I think the imposition of a duty of 5s. would strike a serious blow an established industry, and I ask the 2d. Minister to reduce it to 2s. or 3s.",156
1247,Mr CHANTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Riverina) [8.59] - No one will accuse me of inconsistency in regard to Protection. I believe in Protection which protects, and in dealing fairly with all concerned in an industry. I would not play into the hands of a combination which was taking all the benefits of an dustry and crushing out others. I have known the head of the firm to which reference has been made for twenty-five years, and can thoroughly rely on the information that he gives me. There is no better Protectionist in the country than he is. There are in existence two other firms which I am credibly informed are in combination. Mr J. P. Howe, the gentleman to whom I refer, was originally employed by one of them, and was subsequently induced to accept employment with the other firm, and helped to build up its business. Later on, he entered into business on his own account, and in competition with the two firms with which he was formerly associated, and which carry on business at Beechworth and Preston. Having command of capital, they have introduced into their tanneries what are known as splitting machines; but the struggling firm has not sufficient capital to be able 1fo do so. will, consequently, have to 5s. per hide, whereas its competitors, having their own splitting machines, can bring in the hides whole, and split them here. A duty of 5s. per hide would absolutely destroy the struggling firm. I am credibly informed that it would mean, with respect to that firm, an impost of about £,7$o per annum. I am also credibly informed that the Beechworth tannery was established because the proprietors knew that by going into the country, they would not have to observe the award of a Wages Board. They thought also that since rents would be cheaper in a country town, it would not be necessary to pay dieir employee's such high wages as must be paid in the metropolis.",157
1248,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,They went to Beechworth before the Wages Board was appointed.,157
1249,Mr CHANTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"But they were opposed to a Wages Board being appointed. The process of splitting is a very simple one. A hide having been limed, fleshed, and haired is put through the splitting machine, and the cost of the labour involved is very trifling. Under this item, a hide introduced into the Commonwealth in two portions is dutiable, but if it is brought in whole, it is free. The struggling firm to which I have alluded deals with only one particular class of manufacture, and any portion of a hide not required for that special line 5s absolutely wasted. The combined firms, however, can utilize whatever proportion of a hide they require for in- that special purpose, and can use the balance in the production of other qualities of high class leather. They are therefore in a better position than is the other firm. The honourable member for Indi and the honourable member for Kooyong said that the cost of the labour involved in splitting these hides varied. Mr Howe states that it costs is. 9d. to lime, flesh, hair, and split a hide, but the honourable member for Indi has produced figures showing that the cost amounts to 3s. or 4s. per hide.",157
1250,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The two men interviewed me, and practically agreed, as a compromise, to a duty of 2s. or 3s.",157
1251,Mr CHANTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If the honourable member will agree to a reduction of the duty to 2s., I shall have nothing more to say.",157
1252,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"On e advocated a duty of 2s. per hide, and the other a duty of 3s. I brought them within a shilling, so to It speak, of each other, and they talked for pay this duty of an hour over it.",157
1253,Mr CHANTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I was not present at the interview, but Mr Thomas Broadhurst, a tanner in a large way of business at Murray-road, Preston, writesI have seen the pickled hides under discussion, and I reckon the cost of labour on the same to be amply covered by is. 9d. or is. iod. per hide. Mr W. Braithwaite, another tanner, carrying on business at Preston, writesRe cost of lining, splitting and pickling hides - I have had experience only with sides, and the cost incurred for labour is about one shilling per hide-certainl y no more. Whole hides I should estimateat from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent, extra. If I had a splitting machine of suitable size I would certainly like to undertake the work at that price. Those letters are an answer to the honourable member for Indi. So far as I know, the two firms to which I previously referred are the only tanners in this State who have splitting machines, and they will not sell split hides to the third firm, save at such a price as renders it impossible to buy from them. The net result of the passing of this duty will be that Messrs. Howe and Company, who are employing twenty-three hands, will have to close down, and the public will not be advantaged, since the other two firms will have a monopoly of the business. I do not agree with the honourable member for Lang that we should make the item free, but if the Minister would agree to reduce the duty from 5s. to 2s. per hide, I should be satisfied. It would be an act of justice to this firm, abling A. to expand its business, and to increase the number of its employees.  is involved in the work of preparing these hides.",157
1254,Mr CHANTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I have just explained during the temporary absence of the honourable member that,158
1255,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member, having explained the matter to the Committee, surely does not intend to go over it again.",158
1256,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I have been in this chair for nearly thirty-six hours.,158
1257,Mr CHANTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I have not spoken before during this debate, and I do not think the Prime Minister ought to chide me. I have given the Government every assistance, and this, perhaps, is the only item in which I take a special interest, because of my own personal knowledge of the facts. Will the honourable member for Indi guarantee that these two firms will not only split these hides at is., but will supply J. P. Howe and Company? Is it not part of the game of these two firms to prevent Messrs. Howe and Company continuing in competition? This duty is not protective, though it may bring in a certain amount of revenue, and with that I do not quarrel; but, in fairness to myself and Protectionists in general, the Minister ought to reduce this duty to 2s.",158
1258,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Moreton) [9.19] There is a good deal more in this question than the splitting of hides. The remarks of the honourable member for Indi only go to show that we should be very careful in accepting statements made by parties interested. I am as anxious as any one to assist industries by means of protective duties; but I can remember a deputation of the tanners and curriers of Queensland waiting on the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Ballarat, with a request for an export duty on Australian hides, and a subsequent deputation to the rjresent Minister of Trade and Customs with a similar request.",158
1259,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That was nearly three years ago, during my previous term of office.",158
1260,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Tanner s have been complaining of the price of hides; and certainly not long ago I saw paid for one. Of course, I rejoice at this state of affairs so far as rural industries are concerned; but we are told that the tanning industry is languishing, and that the Japanese come enhere and buy our best hides. The Minister of Trade and Customs now proposes an import duty on the tanners' raw material.",158
1261,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"If the hides come in green - with no work done on them they are admitted free, but they pay a duty if any work has been done.",158
1262,Mr SINCLAIR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,That settles the question !,158
1263,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Calare) [9.23]. - - I believe that both the honourable member for Indi and other honourable members who have spoken are perfectly honest in their representations; and they are only getting a little of the experience we had over the first Tariff. This is a most unsatisfactory method of dealing with Tariff questions; and I contend that there ought to be some sort of tribunal for sifting statements of the kind.,158
1264,Mr ANSTEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Bourke) [9.24] - The particular trouble to myself is that the conflicting elements to the dispute are in my constituency. A little matter of that kind, however, does not affect my judgment, because, with all other honourable members, the only considerations that weigh with me are national and patriotic. The honourable member for Calare thinks there ought to be a Tariff board to consider the facts and give a judgment, by which this Chamber would loyally abide. But would it? Not in the least. We should dispute the judgment of the board just as we are disputing the judgment of the Minister. I have been surprised at the attftude of the honourable member for Kooyong right through the debate, for he appears to be a very different person from the Robert Best who at one time dealt with Tariff questions in Fitzroy. The disputing parties are both manufacturers, and solid Protectionists, but one desires a duty, while the other does not. Their statements having been duly weighed by the Minister, he originally proposed a duty of 5s.; but, having heard other arguments, he comes to the conclusion that he had better split the difference, and make it 3s. Men who are most intimate with all the details of the situation, and whose interests are bound up with the industry, cannot agree: and how can we be expected to agree? Under the circumstances, the Minister, like a Solomon, splits the difference as best he can, only I think he might have split it at half-a-crown. A niunber of Solomons in the chamber are prepared to argue the point; but, for my part, I accept the decision of the Minister. Amendment regatived.",158
1265,Mr CHANTER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Riverina) [9.29] - I must make one final appeal to the Minister to reduce this duty a little more. We are imposing, a charge of ,£750 per annum on one firm,, while competing companies will pay no duty at aill.",159
1266,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9-30] - I met the two manufacturers, and also consulted some of the men engaged in the industry, and decided that 3s. was a fair thing,.

1286,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"There is none in the trade. Prior to this there has only been one factory in Australia. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, who lived in the same town for a number of years, can say better than I can the conditions existing there, but I can say that the employees at that factory in the North-Eastern District are receiving better conditions than when the last Tariff was passed.",160
1287,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Whaf : is the duty on the finished article, such as I.Oxes, for which strawboard is used ? Will not the duty, be higher on the raw material ih;::r on the manufactured article?",160
1288,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I believe it will.,160
1289,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Is not that an anomaly?,160
1290,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Whil e strawboard can come out in the bulk, and be cut up here, boxes, except a few folding boxes, cannot be imported, as a general rule, and the bulk of the boxes used in Australia are made in Australia. They have a natural Protection, which the strawboard industry does not possess.",160
1291,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Cook) [9.43] Strawboard is in a somewhat similar position to several other items that have caused a good deal of trouble. We were faced with a similar state of things in regard to hides, which were the raw material for a local industry, and which are also produced in Australia. There was a desire to impose a duty on the imports from New Zealand for protective purposes, and a consequent conflict between the two interests. A similar position arose in the case of New Zealand timber, which was the raw material used in the fruit case and butter making industries. Although the timber resources of Australia are almost unlimited, New Zealand white pine was specially dealt with in the interest of those two industries. Strawboard is the raw material of the cardboard box-making industry, which employs about 5,000 persons in Australia, whereas the making of strawboard employs only about fifty. The duty of 2s. is equal to 40 per cent, on lined strawboard, and to 50 per cent, on unlined strawboard, while the duty on cardboard boxes is only 30 per cent., so that the finished article has from 10 to 20 per cent, less protection than the raw material. Mr. existing MCDougall, the managing proprietor of the Broadford Strawboard Mills, when examined before the Tariff Commission on the 16th March, 1906, admitted that the cost off importing a ton of strawboard was 32s. It has been said by the Minister that the duty on cardboard boxes is almost nominal, because it is practically impossible to import-them by reason of their bulkiness, and"" their liability to be damaged by handling. If the price of cardboard boxes was increased to any extent, the confectionery shops, pastry cooks, and other businesses, would cease to use them, and would take to paper bags instead. I had samples, which I have mislaid, of imported and local strawboard, and there is no comparison between them.",160
1292,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The sample of the local strawboard was shown to the honourable member by an interested person.,160
1293,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member will, no doubt, have something to say on behalf of other interested persons, and he may be able to show a better sample. The makers of cardboard boxes are put to so much expense and inconvenience in importing strawboard, that they would use the local article if it would in any measure serve their purpose. They have suffered great annoyance and incurred considerable expense by reason of the fact that, at times, importations which they thought would be dutiable at certain rates have been declared by the Customs authorities to be dutiable at other rates. A little while ago I saw the Minister, in regard to a, decision about the classification of a certain importation, and found that the Australian representative of the foreign firm, who had sold it, had afterwards secretly given the Customs Department another classification. In reality the cardboard box-maker concerned was being taken box- down by the importer from whom he bought, and a good deal of fraud takes place in connection with the importation of paper generally.",160
1294,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,They have all to be watched.,160
1295,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"--Yes, very carefully. Before the introduction of the Tariff, shares in the Broadford Mills were selling at 27s. and they immediately went up 3d. The business is paying a 10 per cent, dividend, which shows that it is thriving, and, I am told by the honourable member for Darling, has a reserve of about ^11,000. Unfortunately their output is suitable for only a cheap line of goods.",161
1296,Mr GORDON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,And they are three months behind in their orders.,161
1297,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I understand that they do not keep up with their orders. The ex-Leader of the Labour Party, the Honourable J. C. Watson, is a high Protectionist, but, speaking on this subject on the 19th September, 1906, he said I think that the Minister might consider whether there is not room for an amendment of this item in regard to strawboard. Only a few minutes ago he stated that a very large proportion of the strawboard which is listed as coming from Great Britain is of Continental manufacture. I am informed upon very good authority that absolutely the whole of it comes from the Continent, chiefly from Holland. mother country, I understand, there is not a single factory which produces strawboard. These are reasons why we should defer the consideration of this question until the recommendations of the Tariff Commission are before us. If strawboard were manufactured in Great Britain, I should be quite willing to support the imposition of a preferential duty.",161
1298,Mr CROUCH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Why not accept the Government proposal as an instalment of justice to the combine?,161
1299,Mr WATSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I think that they are receiving justice now. I think the Minister ought to reconsider the matter; and if he is not inclined to do so I shall most decidedly vote against the item. In August, 1907, again dealing with the matter he saidThe Government proposal is to increase the duty on strawboard from is. per cwt. to 2s. against the United Kingdom, and 2s. 6d. against the world. There is no strawboard manufactured in the United Kingdom, and we can therefore consider the item merely as a proposal that there should be a duty of 2s. 6d. per cwt. against the world. I should not object to the increased duty on strawboard if the local manufacturer, and there is only one in the Commonwealth, was content to supply his goods at the same price as he previously supplied them. He opposed the increase of the duty on strawboard. When Mr MCDougall, the representative of the Broadford factory, was before the Tariff Commission, he gave a solemn assurance that if he received the duty for which he asked,, he would be able to supply strawboard at the then prices.",161
1300,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Did he get the duty for which he asked ?,161
1301,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Yes .,161
1302,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,What was it?,161
1303,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Tw o shillings and sixpence. The moment the Tariff was introduced, he put up the price of his strawboard to the extent of the higher duty. When the item was knocked out, he had to bring down his price once more.",161
1304,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I shall prove that the man who gave the honourable member that information told a lie.,161
1305,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"My information is such that I am prepared to accept it. .1I have no desire to detain the Committee. Thirty-sixhours have elapsed since I entered this chamber, and I have been going pretty, constantly ever since. Indeed, I may say that I was afraid to go to sleep, because 1 thought that this item might be reached at any moment. I represent an electorate in which there are many factories ; but the proprietor of a cardboardbox factory was the only one to approach me in regard to this Tariff, and he begged me to ask Parliament to leave.them alone. I have been challenged regarding the stateI n the ment that Mr MCDougall increased the price of his strawboard to the level of the increased duty.",161
1306,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Will that really affect the merits of the duty?,161
1307,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes . If we give an increase of duty to a manufacturer who already has sufficient Protection, and the moment he receives that increase he makes a corresponding rise in the price of his goods, the result is that we simply increase the price of those goods to the users. In this case the action of the strawboard manufacturer in increasing his prices in many cases sent his goods out of use altogether. In reply to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, let me say that my authority for the statement. I made regarding Mr. MCDougall's action is Mr Watson, who, when Leader of the Labour party, made a statement in this House, as reported in Hansard, that the moment the Tariff was introduced, up went the price of this strawboard by 30s. a ton.",161
1308,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,He only got that information from some one else.,161
1309,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I presume that he is as well able to verify his information as is the honourable member.,161
1310,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I can prove that Messrs. Sands and MCDougall did»not raise the price.,161
1311,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"No doubt the honourable member could prove to his own satisfaction that black was white. I have given him my authority for the statement, and a  the owner of a cardboard-box factory in my electorate. That authority is quite good enough for me. Mr Firth is opposed to the party to which I belong. No doubt, because of his own political convictions, he would use his influence against me if he could do so, and I should take no exception to his doing so. But if Mr Firth tells me that he has to pay a certain price for his strawboard, I know that I can accept his statement as correct. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - He straightforward.",161
1312,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Absolutely . When this matter was under consideration in the Senate in 1910, Senator Barker, of Victoria, who is a sound Protectionist, opposed an increase of duty on strawboard, upon the ground that the employees in the Broadford factory were not being treated fairly, and he stated that the owners of that factory had opposed the constitution of a Wages Board to regulate the conditions of the employees in the industry. According to Senator Barker, the employees in that factory are not being paid a fair and living wage at the present time.",162
1313,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,When was that statement made?,162
1314,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"On 23rd November, 1910.",162
1315,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,As k Senator Barker what the position is now.,162
1316,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Senato r Barker will be able to make a statement on the subject when this schedule is before the Senate.,162
1317,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,If the firm improved the wages of the employees the honourable member would give it a measure of Pro tection. Is not the honourable member a believer in new Protection?,162
1318,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I am, and when we have power to provide for new Protection I shall be prepared to vote for Protection to the point of prohibition, in respect of anything that can be made in Australia. But the idea of new Protection is not to give the manufacturers statutory Protection, and to allow their employees to submit their claims to Wages Boards, where the factory owners will fight them to the last ditch, in their effort to obtain a bare living wage. Speaking in the Senate on 23rd November, 1910, Senator Barker said I cannot support the Government proposal. I believe in the new Protection pure and The less that is said about the condition of those who work in these mills the better. They are not getting fair wages, nor do they labourunder reasonable conditions. I shall vote against extending increased protection to our paper millsuntil they give their employees better treatment. To my own knowledge, they have refused to pay them a fair remuneration. They also opposed the establishment of a Wages Board in connection with the industry, and when the Wages Board Bill was before the Legislative Council of Victoria they petitioned it not to grant their employees a fair measure of justice.",162
1319,Senator STEWART,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Perhaps they cannot afford to pay fair wages.,162
1320,Senator BARKER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"But they can afford to pay good dividendsis So that the firm refused to pay good wages, although it was in a position to do soAs a party the Labour party desire to give effect to the new Protection, which seeks to extend protection alike to the employ^ and the consumer as well as to the manufacturer. But here we are asked to grant an increased measure of protection to manufacturers without any regard to their treatment of their employees. I will not vote for increased protection to any industry in which sweating occurs. I have pointed out that this industry enjoys a considerable amount of natural protection, and that we are imposing duties up to 40 and 50 per cent, on the raw material of cardboard-box manufacturers, whereas the finished article is dutiable only at 30 per cent. I have pointed out, further, that, for the sake of fifty employ6s in one manufactory, the interests of 5,000 in the cardboard-box making industry are to be prejudiced; and my own knowledge of diat industry leads me to believe that, if we agree to this duty, we shall probably be putting 500 persons out of employment merely to grant increased Protection to a factory in which only fifty are employed. As there is a general desire to proceed toa division on this question, I shall resume my seat, knowing that, if necessary, I shall be able, at a later stage, to speak, again; but I appeal to honourable members to leave the Tariff as it is with regard to the item under consideration.",162
1321,Mr ARCHIBALD,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Hindmarsh) [10.15] - I believe that this item relates to the raw material of so many industries that it would be just as well not to interfere with the duty for which the existing Tariff provides. I should like, further, to say that I do not thank the Government for sopersistently forcing upon the Committee its own intentions and desires. The proposal was kicked out last year, and is going to be kicked out again to-night, and again next year; and there ought to be some limit to the forcing of this question by the Gosimple. vernment. I rose to let the House know the position of this company, and I shall do so from a well-known book which supplies information of the kind. The Australian Paper Mills has an authorized capital of .£150,000; subscribed £107,000; the number of shares issued is 107,000, paid up to the limit of 20s.; the reserve fund is ,£15,769; the last dividend paid was ro per cent, per annum; and the share value, when this book was published some months ago, was 31s. A company like that must be regarded as being in an eminently nourishing position; and I think it highly desirable that these appear in Hansard.",162
1322,Mr GLYNN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Angas) [10.17] 1901-2, we had a close division on a motion by myself to make this duty 9d., as against dized. a proposal for 2s. The votes were thirty-three on each side; and if this Chamber was so equally poised, with all the facts before it, I hope honourable members will hesitate before they add 33 per cent, the present rate. There are fift y factories, employing 1,500 persons at excellent wages, dependent on this vote; and I hope honormill able members wil l not, at the end years' importunity, increase the duty, practically at the instance of one factory, and give what must prove a staggering blow many industries.",163
1323,Mr OZANNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Corio) [10.19] - The honourable member for Hindmarsh said that a similar proposal had already been jected by another Parliament, but for that rejection was the conditions in the trade, which were not satisfactory from a Labour stand-point. To-day, conditions are totally different, as is shown by the fact that the wages paid for a week of 48 hours are as follows : Machine men, 60s.; beater men, 60s.; breaker men, 48s.; boiler men, 42s.; bleach men, 42s.; overhaulers, who are women, 20s. to 30s.; rag sorters, who are women, 17s. to rag cutters, who are men, 48s.; and cutters' assistants, 42s. The wages paid Great Britain are full y 33 per cent, those paid here.",163
1324,Mr GORDON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,How many men are emthat ployed ?,163
1325,Mr OZANNE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The total number is 220. The honourable member for Hindindustries marsh told us that there is only one facdustry tory in Melbourne; but there are two Geelong and one in Sydney, the latter ploying i r 6 hands.",163
1326,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"East Sydney) [10.21] - On reason for my opposing this duty is that it is impossible to produce locally the quantity of strawboard required by manufacturers in Australia. If one buys a suit of clothes, it is sent home in a strawboard capital, box, and this commodity is used by pastry cooks, bookbinders, picture-frame makers, and a host of others, including dairy farmers, who require it for the safe transit of their eggs. I am assured that it is even difficult to get from Holland all the strawboard required, so great is tire demand in all parts of the world. I should be pleased to give some support to this facts.should industry if I thought it possible within the next five years to procure the necessary hands and machinery to overtake the de-In mand. If this duty is imposed, the employment of 4,000 men will be jeopar",163
1327,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Maribyrnong) [10.23] We are often told that Protection raises prices; but, as a matter of fact, prior to to the establishment of the Australian Paper Mills, the price of strawboard was , £ 1 5 a ton; but as soon as the first strawboard was established in the Commonwealth of ten the price came down to .£12 ios.",163
1328,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The manager's evito dence given before the Tariff Commission is quite to the contrary.,163
1329,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Almos t immediately after the establishment of the mill the reprice was reduced by .£2 ios., and today the reason the price is . £ 8 to .£10.",163
1330,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"What is the price of the however, the imported strawboard ?",163
1331,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It is .£6 ios.,163
1332,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I have no doubt that the imported strawboard is very cheap. It paper comes from England, Belgium, Germany, and some of it from Japan; but the bulk 24s.; of it comes from the Netherlands. I am rag sorry to see honourable members supportin ing the industries of Japan, where the pay under is about is. 2d. a day. From the United Kingdom we receive only 929 . tons per annum. We have it from the Minister another factory is to be established in Melbourne; and surely it should be the duty of this Parliament to assist of the kind. If there is any in that ought to be protected it is one in that may be described as a native indusemtry, such as this, the raw material of which is straw. If we had sufficient strawboard e mills to meet Australian demands hundreds of men would be employed, and the millswould be large customers of our farmers, who sometimes find straw a drug on the market. The honourable member for Corio says that there are 220 men employed; but we know that there are many indirectly connected with this industry. Like many others, I was not satisfied with the conditions at one time; but I would not be taking the stand I am to-night were I not satisfied that the employees now work under better conditions than previously in the paper mills of Victoria. Amongst the industries of this class, those employed in strawboard making occupy a very good position. While we are advocating the interests of one particlar industry, we should be careful not to cast aspersions on other industries which it is our duty to also foster. I hope that in the next two or three years there will be sufficient mills to supply .other manufacturers with all the strawboard they require. The duty may induce other persons to invest in this industry.",163
1333,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Melbourne Ports) [10.28] - The honourable member for Cook seems to think that the best way to defeat this duty is to abuse the industry it is intended to assist. I might just as well retort that the cardboard industry he is trying to bolster up is one of the worse paid.,164
1334,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,It would true if the honourable member did say so.,164
1335,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member objects to assertions of that k in d ; but he is not so particular about making them. The honourable member told us that there are thousands engaged in the cardboardbox industry, while very few are employed making strawboard. Is there any reason why the few should not be assisted if they are not interfering with the thousands? The honourable member contended that the strawboard made at the Australian Paper Mills is not as good as that imported. I doubt whether he is a judge. If he stays here during this week end, we shall give hun an opportunity of seeing the stuff produced here. Why should the box manufacturers and others object to encourage the local manufacture of strawboard, when they admit that it takes themall their time to import it? We have already one factory, and the Minister has assured us that machinery has arrived to start another. The honourable member for . Cook tried to make out that, after the duty was increased, the prices were raised. It is quite possible that at the start the imposition of a duty may raise the price, but it afterwards brings it down. I have here the price lists issued by the Australian Paper Mills Proprietary Limited, which have evidently not been prepared for the occasion. The first was issued on the 12th August, 1907, prior to the imposition of the duty in the last Tariff, and the figures prove conclusively that, from then until 1911, the prices, as a matter of fact, have come down. The honourable member for Cook has accepted the statements of individuals who, out of sheer pique, are trying to bolster up their own industries at the expense of another. The most inveterate Free Trader would not refuse to assist an industry when it did not raise the prices. If we are only to protect industries in our own constituency, or our own State, we shall get into a very peculiar position. The honourable member attacked this industry, because it did not happen to be in New South Wales. It is nothing but a case of Sydney prejudice. The Victorian box-makers are not doing the growling, but we have had a gentleman from Sydney in the lobby all the week. The Sydney box manufacturers do not want to encourage the local product, and the honourable member for Cook believes anything they tell him. I hope the Committee will always give assistanceto an industry when it can be proved, as I can not be prove in this case, that prices Save not been raised.",164
1336,Mr GORDON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Boothby) [10.37] - I should not have spoken, but for the extraordinary statement of the last speaker that an attempt is being made to ruin the strawboard industry. This is not a question of imposing a new duty in order to establish an industry. There is already a duty of 30s. per ton, and the shares of the company, which are of a nominal value of 20s., were selling yesterday at 27s. 3d., while the last dividend was 10 per cent. The Minister told us that, before a new company had any idea that an extra duty might be imposed, it was prepared to establish another mill. I am credibly informed that there are only fifty men employed in the existing mill in making strawboard. The others are engaged in paper making. We are, therefore, asked to give an increased duty to an industry for employing fifty men on a raw material that is used by cardboard makers who employ thousands. The proposition is most absurd, and I confidently leave it to the Committee to reject the increase. Question-That paragraph K. Strawboard,"" stand part of the item-put . Tne Committee divided.

There are, for instance, the fourseated bodies and the two-seated bodies. I hope that the Minister will look into the matter ",165

1339,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The motor car bodies can be made in Australia easily.,165

Under this proposal, a man buying a ,£150 motor car imported with the body will have to pay a duty of ,£24 ios. on the body alone, if it comes from any foreign country, and £ 2 1 if it comes from the United Kingdom, while the same rates would apply to the body of a car worth ,£500.

1347,Mr CANN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Nepean) [10.56] - I am sorry that the Minister has reduced the duty on the chassis. In my electorate, there is a motor car company which is making chassis, importing only two parts, which are covered by patent rights, and cost about ,£34. It seems ridiculous to protect the motor car industry at every point with duties of 35 and 30 per cent., and allow chassis to be imported from foreign countries on the payment of 5 per cent., and free of duty from the United Kingdom.",166
1348,Mr MAHON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Coolgardie) [10.58] The honourable member for East Sydney entertains a fallacious notion in assuming that motor cars are used only for pleasure. In nearly every large city in Australia they are in extensive use by medical men, and for the delivery of parcels and goods, while in the back country they are employed for the carriage of mails. Some places which used to get a mail only once in three weeks have now, thanks to the motor car, a weekly delivery.

1351,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Cook) [11.1] This is another familiar feature of Tariff discussions, and a great contest has ranged round the proposals to increase duties on these instruments. My attitude on this question is a studied one. I desire to see ample Protection given to the manufacture of Australian pianos, but I do not think we ought to be asked to go on increasing duties without rhyme or reason. I hope that the Minister will be able to justify this item. It is not sufficient that we should keep on piling up duties unless they are serving some useful purpose, and I should like to know what is the necessity for the increase proposed in this case. I stated during the general debate that I objected to a general re-opening of the Tariff for protective purposes at this particular juncture, but that I was prepared to join with the Government in rectifying anomalies. I stated, further, that if it could be shown that an industry was suffering, and that it would be injured if it did not receive more Protection until such time as we could enter upon the discussion of the whole Tariff question again, in circumstances that I have enumerated, I should be prepared to support the Government in such a rearrangement' of the Tariff schedule as would give that necessary Protection.",166
1352,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,We have all made up our minds. If the honourable member were to talk for a week he would not alter a vote.,166

He must not be restless, and cast upon me the responsibility for the fact that he has been kept here a long time. We have been required by the Government to deal with a week's work in one sitting; but I have a duty to do to those who sent me here.  has done it well.",166
1354,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I might quote the honourable member on pianos. On a previous occasion he gave us some illuminating remarks upon the subject; and if his speech on that occasion were measured, it would be found that he occupied more time than I have taken up in dealing with this question. We should place on pianos and pianolas a sufficient Protection to enable the local industry to be thoroughly established and to carry on; but an absolutely prohibitive Tariff ought not to be imposed. musicians get more pleasure from certain makes of pianos than they do from others, and we should be taking a rather extreme course if we said to them, "" You shall be compelled either to buy a.make of piano that does not please you or to pay a heavy penalty for miking your own choice."" There are in Australia today two piano factories. That which is conducted in New South Wales by Messrs. Beale and Company was established under Free Trade, and without any Tariff protection at all it has built up a very considerable business. There is good evidence that this industry, at the time when it first received Tariff assistance from this Parliament, could have carried on without any Tariff. The Government of the day, however, proffered assistance with a duty, and handicapped its competitors very considerably. Messrs. Beale and Company conducted their business for a few years under the operation of the first Federal Tariff, and expanded it to an almost unprecedented extent. Their balance-sheets, which have been quoted, show them to be in an exceedingly flourishing financial position, the result of the trade done by them in Australia. On the occasion of the last Tariff revision, the industry received the benefit of a 5 per cent, increase of duty; but it was granted on a very narrow voting margin. There seems to be some power behind the throne, and if it keeps on barracking and barracking for this factory, it will be absolutely impossible presently for some people to buy any other make of instrument. I have here a report of a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the question of shortage of lahour in New South Wales, before which Mr Beale, the New South Wales manufacturer, gave evidence that there was a shortage of labour. My impressions from a hurried glance at his evidence are that he could not cope with any more business in his factory with the labour that he then employed, and that he could not get any more labour in Australia.",167
1355,Mr HALL,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,He does not say that now.,167
1356,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I do not know what he says now. We must remember a Tariff schedule is before Parliament.,167
1357,Mr HALL,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I know, as a fact, that his factory is capable of coping with a lot more work.",167
1358,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The statement to which I have referred was made by him as Some recently as 27th June last. Why are we asked to increase the duty on pianos ? Is it because the industry is languishing? If this firm is working at top speed-if it cannot cope with more business, and cannot secure more labour- a strong case should be made out to induce us to vote for these increases. If it could be shown that increased duties were required to keep the industry going, I should be prepared to support it.",167
1359,Mr LAIRP SMITH,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Beal e and Company are not the only manufacturers of pianos in Australia. There is another firm, and they do not say what, according to the honourable member, Mr Beale has said.",167
1360,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I have no evidence as to what they say; but at page 20 of the report to which I have referred, and which was presented to the New South Wales Parliament in October last, will be found a report of the evidence given by Mr. BealeThe Commissioner - As I have said to other witnesses, this Commission has just to deal with things as they find them, and, as regards the Tariff, must assume that it remains as it is. Witness - On that basis, that the industrial system of the Commonwealth is likely to remain on its present basis, it is likely that there will be a continued shortage of labour. Mr Sparks - Q . Do you recognise that there has been a great increase in the development of our manufacturing life since the introduction of the Tariff?-A . Certainly. It has been in a much higher ratio than the increase of population. Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, whether industries-you r own and others-hav e by the state of the labour market today been, forced into the importation of goods which they manufacture or could manufacture?-A . I only know it as having been reported to our Association. Later on Mr Beale was examined by Mr. Buchanan as follows :Mr Buchanan - Q . You said that the manuthe increase. facturers were up to their limit, as far as manufacturing purposes are concerned?-A . I think, in general terms, they are working to their limit. Q. You - are speaking with regard to the labour available?-A . Yes. It means that I think the labour available is pretty well employed at present. Q. But, at the same time, your business capable of expansion?-A . Well, it depends in tion. what direction the business may go. We can occupy ourselves with other manufacturing business, but at present we would not undertake for the reason that we cannot see where employees would come from. Further on the witness was examined by Mr Kavanagh, a representative of the Sydney Labour CouncilQ. As a matter of fact, there is no shortage your industry at the present time-tha your factory?-A . There might be one or two of the departments short. Practically there is not; but the questions may have two very answers. If you asked me whether we could fill our new factory, we could not; we could not get the labour for it. The Commissioner - Q . Have you a new factory?-A . We have made very great alterations there. We have other things in contemplation, in addition. He was extending the factory without any Protection, although he was afraid he could not get the necessary labourMr Kavanagh - Q . You have not made a demand for labour for that yet?-A . We certainly will not get it. Q. But you certainly have not asked for it?A. No. But if we prepare the materials, which we shall have to do, and put down machinery, we want to be very sure that we shall have the last and essential part-the labour-and I am sure we cannot get it. Q. Have you made any inquiries about getting it?-A . Yes' Q. From the Union?-A . We know that if we sent to Cutler for two or three first-class cabinetmakers, for instance, we could not get them. Q. How many different trades would there"" be in your factory?-A . You might say eight or ten-quite that. Q. So that a good deal of the contention with regard to the shortage of labour depends really on the Tariff?-A . Yes. Q. You say that at present we are manufacturing up to our limit. Do you mean the limit of our present requirements, or the limits of the labour?-A . The limits of the labour. I have much other evidence that I should like to lay before the Committee, but, after the long sitting, I am sure that honourable members .are not anxious to hear it. Before a further duty is imposed on these musical instruments we ought to have some Mr J. H. Catts. evidence of the necessity for it ; and if justification can'be shown, I shall vote for",167

1366,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I do not know of any article is more completely made in Australia than the piano.,168
1367,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"What I am trying to arrive at is a just method of dealing with Australian producers. It is obvious that if there is a duty on the finished piano, and one of the two manufacturers makes the instrument wholly in Australia, while the other imports the parts, and assembles them here, the former is doing more for Australian industry than the latter; and the reward is not equitably divided. If I am assured that the pianos are made in Australia as completely as the other commodities of which we have heard, and that all the manufacturers are on the same basis, I shall be satisfied.",168
1368,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [11.24] - I have visited both the factories, and' I have never seen similar places where there was a greater proportion of adult labour, and practically the whole of it male. This is a highlyskilled trade, and, as a duty of 35 to 30 per cent, is placed on furniture, there is no reason why pianos should be admitted at a lower rate.",168
1369,Mr KELLY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Is there a fixed duty on furniture ?,168
1370,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"No , because of the variety of the articles, which range in value from £ 1 up to ^ 5 0 ; whereas, in the case of pianos, there are practically standard prices for grands and the ordinary uprights.",168
1371,Mr MAHON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Coolgardie) [11.25] Earlier in this sitting the Minister was understood to favour a different duty on the case in which gramaphones are imported ; and I do not see why the same rule should not apply to pianos. A piano has a certain value as a piece of furniture; and I agree with the Minister that the duty on what might be called the cabinet part of the piano should not be less than that of ordinary furniture.. The position, however, will be that, whereas the talking machine itself will come in at a lower rate of duty than the case in which it is contained, the whole of the piano will be charged at the higher rate. I .do not think that that is quite equitable; and there should h% 'some power in the Minister to get over the anomaly.",169

1376,Mr MAHON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Obviousl y it does. piano has separate parts, each of which has a distinct value that can be accurately assessed. I agree with the honourable member for Cook that there must be some curious secret influence at work enabling these two manufacturers of pianos to obtain special concessions, and win considerable advantages at the expense of the community. Why is it that Mr Wertheim and Mr Beale have their tools of trade admitted free, while the tool of trade of the music teacher is taxed 35 per cent. ? Right through the schedule the tools of trade of individuals are admitted free, or at a very nominal rate. There are thousands of music teachers who earn less and woVk longer hours than the poorest paid labourer in the community. Why should those teachers be taxed extortionately in order to add to the enormous profits of those two monopolists? They come to this Chamber with absolute lies, as can be proved. One of them says in his circular that he is paying in wages on a piano more than the total cost of the article elsewhere. As a matter of fact, there is no very startling difference between the wages here and in Great Britain. I have it on information that cannot be attacked that piano stringers here are paid 2s. 9d. an instrument, and that not more than three instruments can be dealt with by an operative in one day. In Great Britain a similar workman is paid 40s. to 50s. a week; polishers, 35s. to 40s.; markers off, 40s. to 50s. j finishers, 50s. to 60s.; regulators, 50s. to 60s. ; and fitters, 50s. to 60s. One of those piano manufacturers started under a Free The Trade Tariff, and was able to make enormous profits; and we ought to have some information as to why both he and the other can come to this Parliament and secure, without inquiry, increases on the. substantial Protection they have already received. Why should we tax the tools of trade of thousands of music teachers in order that those men may become millionaires ? We require more information, and the Government, if they have not got it, should; postpone the item until it is\obtained. I regret to notice the impatience of members. This is about the second time. I If he have spoken during the Tariff debate, so I cannot b f charged with delaying business. The Minister said just now that male labour is chiefly employed in these factories. Possibly it is in the one with which he is best acquainted, but I am informed that in the A other a considerable proportion of very poorly-paid female labour is engaged.",169

1380,Mr MAHON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I am very glad to hear it. But if my information is inexact, that is a reason why official data should be laid before us. We ought not to be asked to advance the duties to this penal extent merely on the ipse dixi t of any manufacturer. It is not fair to honourable members nor to the people of this country to raise them to the enormous extent now proposed. I know the punishment that has been inflicted upon honourable members, and the officersof the House, by these protracted sittings, and I have no wish to intensify it, but it is not my fault that it has been done. In conclusion, I ask the Committee to remember that these rich men who are making enormous profits out of their business get every tool of trade free of duty, while we are taxing the tools of trade of thousands of music teachers, who must have the imported pianos. Hpnorable members may say what they like about the local instruments, but people engaged in music want the best, and will have it, because otherwise they will drift into a position of inferiority as compared with musicians in other parts of the world.",169

It should be pointed out that, although a man who was not born here may have lived here from his childhood, and gone to England or Europe to study art, calling himself and thinking himself an Australian, he would not be an Australian artist resident abroad.

I am not an Australian, and I , therefore, speak without prejudice on this subject. I hold that an artist living in Australia has the same right to receive protection as has any lawyer or other professional man, or man following any handicraft or calling.

H . Soutar, and others-in which they desire to record their opinions that it is to the interests of Australia that recognised examples of fine art should be admitted free. Under the item before us they will not be free. If it be carried, a very heavy duty will be collected in respect of an expensive picture brought into the Commonwealth. The writers of this communication go on to sayWhile we are in general agreement with the desire of the Government to impose a Tariff so as to check the influx of indifferent work, suggest that the work of Australian artists abroad should be added to the free list. Under the item as it stands, I do not think that the work of Australian artists abroad would be free, but the Minister of Trade and Customs has expressed his willingness to accept an amendment making it clear that they will be. I have prepared such an amendment, and shall submit it to the Committee after we have decided the general question as to whether or not any duty shall be imposed. If we are to interfere at all in this direction, it should be with the object of preventing the introduction of cheap pictures; but the item, as it stands, whilst blocking the importation of expensive pictures, will prove no barrier to the admission of inferior ones.",172
1399,Mr FULLER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Ulawarra) [12.4 a.m.]. The Prime Minister has spoken very strongly on the necessity of protecting Australian artists. I fail to see why he should not go further, and propose a duty to protect native-born politicians. If such a duty were in force, the Prime Minister and some of his colleagues, as well as a good manyother honourable members who are recent importations, would not be in this Chamber at the present time, without having paid duty before landing here. Such a proposition would be just as sensible as is that now before us.",172

1401,Mr WH IRVINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"It is no illustration whatever, because there is not, and cannot be, any protection given to lawyers.

The Government cannot accuse me of having taken up much of the time of the Committee during this debate, and I should not have said a word more on the subject if the Prime Minister had not thought fit to use what I may describe as a catch-penny illustration about lawyers. Every profession and calling imposes its own obligations, its own duties, and in almost all cases the community charges certain fees for the admission of persons to the practice of their professions.",172
1406,Mr FRAZER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Not the community in the case of the lawyers. ',172
1407,Mr WH IRVINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes , the community ; or, in other words, the charge is made under the law of the land. The honourable member knows nothing whatever of what he is talking. Since the Prime Minister has chosen to refer to this matter, I repeat that it has been the pride of this, as well as of every other British community, that we throw open our doors to people from other places to whom no exception can be taken. If we are to exclude productions of art because they happen to have been produced by persons other than Australians, we might as well exclude books that are not written by Australians. I shall not hesitate to give my reasons to the Committee for objecting to the item, since the Prime Minister has chosen to adopt this attitude, and a little illustration of the absurdity of this proposal comes to my mind. During a Tariff debate in the Victorian Parliament, a gentleman who was connected with a comic newspaper in this State seriously submitted a proposition that all comic serials containing material similar to that published .in his newspaper should be subjected to a duty. He pointed out that we had ample raw material for the making of good jokes; that the making of jokes was a struggling industry, and that persons who were engaged here at very poor pay in working out jokes for the entertainment of the community should be protected just as well as any other class. This proposal stands on no higher plane. It stands, indeed, on a lower plane, because the Government are trying to exclude works of art that are for the benefit of all, and especially for the benefit of Australian art students themselves. I sincerely hope that the good sense of the Comrnitte will lead to the rejection of this proposal. Question-That paragraph (B), proposed to be left out, stand part of the item-put .

1408,Mr MAHON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Coolgardie) [12.13 a.m.]. - The Committee having decided that the item shall be retained, there are one or two questions that the Minister might well consider. In the first place, what is to be the definition of "" a n Australian student "" ? Is he to be a native of Australia, or a man who had the misfortune to be bom somewhere else, but lived in Australia for a time, and then went to another country? Furthermore, since these works of art are to be subjected to an ad valorem duty, will the Minister state whether there is in the Department an expert competent to judge the value of an oil or water-colour painting ?",173
1409,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,An expert will be required in each State.,173
1410,Mr MAHON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"There are not many of these experts in the Commonwealth, and those who are here are more remuneratively occupied in following some private occupation than they would be in the service of the Department. The Minister will have to consider whether he has an officer in each of the States capable of appreciating the value of a painting. Further, some provision should be made for uniformity in valuation, so that a painting worth ^100 may not be admitted in one State as dutiable only on £ 2 5 , and in another State Page. J. on its full value. What practical provision is the Minister going to make to carry the item into effect? And what is his definition of an ""Australian student"" ?",173
1411,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [12.17 a.m.] - I have no doubt that the Government will try to do its best. It is quite possible that we may not have a sufficient number of art experts; but, as a rule, people who import the class of pictures referred to are not likely"" to try to swindle the Customs by representing ;£ioo paintings as worth only ,£25. The honourable member for Werriwa, earlier in the evening, suggested to me the addition of some words, providing that in addition to Australian students, Australian artists abroad should have an opportunity to send in their pictures free. I do not think that the Department will say that because a person does not happen to have been born in Australia",173
1412,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,There must be a definition.,173
1413,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I have no doubt that a suitable definition will be made. It is not to be expected that we should lay down all definitions and rules in connection with an item of this kind until it has been passed, considering the controversial nature proposal. I move That the following words be added to the item:-""o n and after 15th December, 1911, each £ i , or ad valorem 25 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher duty.""",173
1414,Mr HALL,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Supposing I bought "" The Light of the World "" for J£IO,OOO, and desired to introduce it into Australia, should I be charged 25 per cent. ?",174
1415,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yes , if this item be carried as it is.",174
1416,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Will paintings for a church or cathedral be subject to a duty?,174
1417,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I think that is provided for in another item, but I shall look into the matter.",174
1418,Mr HALL,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,I should like to submit the amendment of which I spoke to the Minister of Customs earlier in the evening.,174
1419,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I ask leave to withdraw my amendment temporarily. Amendment withdrawn accordingly. Amendment (by Mr HALL) agreed toThat after the word "" students"" the words "" or Australian artists abroad "" be inserted. Amendment (by Mr TUDOR) agreed toThat the following words be added to subitem (B) :- "" and on and after 15th December, 1911, each, £ i , or ad valorem, 25 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher duty.""",174
1420,Mr MAHON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Coolgardie) [12.23 a.m.]. - The item, as it stands at present, will subject to a heavy duty pictures for churches, cathedrals, and other religious institutions. Presumably, this is not intended by the Government.",174
1421,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I shall look into the item, and if necessary, see that some provision f is made in another place.",174
1422,Mr MAHON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,That probably means if it is convenient.,174
1423,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"As to churches, I shall certainly agree as to the suggestion. consider a cathedral a church.",174
1424,Mr MAHON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"There are pictures in other religious institutions, and these ought to be placed on the same footing as churches.",174
1425,Mr FISHER,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I pledge myself to churches, at any rate. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 425 (Thermit), items 440 and 448 (Scientific Instruments) agreed to. Postponed item 342By omitting the whole item and inserting in> of the its stead the following item :"" 342. (A) Gramaphones, PhonogTaphs, and other Talking Machines, including cases (but not horns), imported with Machines, not exceeding £ $ in total value; also Records, free. (B) Gramaphones, Phonographs, and other Talking Machines, including cases imported - with Machines, when the value, without horn, exceeds £ s ; Horns for Talking Machines, whether accompanying the Machines OT otherwise, ad valorem (General Tariff), 35 per cent. ; (United Kingdom), 30 per cent. (C) Unassembled Metal parts of Talking Machines but not including Horns, free.""",174
1426,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [12.25 a.m.] - I move That all the words after the word "" item,"" line 2, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""342 . Gramaphones, phonographs, and other talking machines, including cases (but not horns) imported with machines, ad valorem (General Tariff), 10per cent.; (United Kingdom), 5 per cent."" The cases are from one-third to one-fifth the value of the whole machine; and the idea has been, while assessing the value of the whole gramaphone, to assess the case at about the same rate as furniture. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to.",174
1427,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [r2.27 a.m.] - I said last night that it had been decided to increase the duty from is. per central to is. 6d., involving, on an average, about £d. per dozen. I now move That the following item be inserted :- "" 59.. By adding at the end of the item the following words, 'and on and after 15th December, to n , bananas, per central, is. 6 d . ' "" Deputations have waited upon me in regard to an increase of this duty, not only here, but on my visits to Queensland, on more than one occasion. It has been represented that, if fair play js to I be given to the Queensland industry against the"" black labour of Fiji, a higher duty is necessary. It was urged - that bananas should be classed as green fruit, at 2s. per central, but this was decided 'against in favour of the proposal now made.",174
1428,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Cook) [12.30 a.m.]. - I think that this proposed increase in the duty is absolutely unjustifiable. Since the present duty was proposed, it has been almost impossible to buy a decent banana, except at an exorbitant price. If we were encouraging the growth of a fruit anything like equal to that of Fiji, it would be a different matter.",174
1429,Mr THOMAS BROWN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Fij i bananas are imported now.,175
1430,Mr J,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"H. CATTS - My impression is that the present duty has almost crowded Fiji bananas out of the market.' Certainly the Queensland bananas which are served us in the refreshment room of this House, are not worth putting one's teeth into. This duty will increase the price of bananas, and it is ridiculous to say that Jd. per dozen is any protection for the industry. I hope honourable members will not vote to increase the present duty by 50 per cent., and prevent the people of Australia from getting a really good wholesome fruit at a price within their means.",175
1431,Mr FINLAYSON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Brisbane) [12.31 a.m.] - Many honourable members object to giving additional Protection to Queensland banana-growers on the ground that the trade is largely in the hands of Chinese. That is altogether wrong. Some years ago, there might have been some foundation for the idea, but every successive year shows a marked diminution in the number of Chinese growers. There are now about 130 of them to over 300 European growers. Since 1906, when a cyclone devastated the northern banana plantations, the Chinese have been gradually going out of the business. Last week, a Bill passed the Queensland Parliament limiting to 5 acres the amount of land that may be leased to an alien. This will practically eliminate the Chinese banana-grower. An increasing acreage is being planted in bananas in the southern part of the State, and the centre of the industry is now in southern Queensland. It is going to be a white man's industry, and honourable members must choose whether or not they will protect the white man against the black.",175
1432,Mr GORDON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Boothby) [12.35 a.m.]. - Surely the Queensland banana industry does not depend upon a duty of Jd. per dozen.,175
1433,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,This is an additional farthing.,175
1434,Mr GORDON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"That alters the matter. I shall be very pleased to do anything I can to encourage the banana-growing, or any other rural industry, but my objection to this duty is that it is imposed on a food supply, as bananas are becoming an article of almost daily diet.

1435,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs [12.40 a.m.] - When dealing with the timber duties yesterday morning, I promised the honourable member for Cook and others that if the re-adjustment of the duties on New Zealand pine made the duty on undressed timber approximate too closely, to the duty on dressed timber, thereby depriving the timber merchants in Sydney of their margin of Protection, I would consider the advisability of increasing the duty on dressed timber. I have since gone into the matter, and ascertained that instead of New South Walesgetting anything like its proportionate share, it gets only about one-eighth or one-tenth of the amount, but it is possible that if the margin of Protection is increased the amount will go up. I have not had time to go fully into the matter, but will do so later, and, if necessary, have a suggestion made in another place. If that does not satisfy the honourable member for Cook, I shall move the alteration now.",175
1436,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,We should do it now.,175
1437,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Then I move That the following words be inserted in item 303 :- "" By adding after the present sub-item F the following words :- ' And on and after 15th December, i q n , per 100 super, feet, 3s. 6d.' "" That would be in place of the present duty of 3s.",175
1438,Mr JH CATTS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,You told me you would make the duty 5s.,176
1439,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"I told the honourable member nothing of the sort. The merchants are getting the New Zealand white pine, which comprises two-thirds of the timber, at the old rate. Only a certain portion of the undressed New Zealand timber has been made dutiable at the higher rate. Amendment agreed to. Item 408. (Corks.)",176
1440,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [12.43 a.m.] - It is proposed to insert an alternative ad valorem rate of 30 per cent, in this item.

' (B) n.e.i. per lb. 6d., or ad valorem 30 per cent., whichever rate returns higher duty.' "" Amendment agreed to.",176
1441,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [12.47 a-.m.] - In reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Richmond, I desire to say that magnesia, magnesium carbonate, and nesium chloride, in packages over 14 lbs. in weight, will be dutiable at movingis. and od. per cwt., but packages under that weight, .will be treated as drugs, and admitted duty free. I was also asked about the duty on cheese caps. The ordinary binding for cheeses is dutiable at per cent, under the general Tariff, but free if from the United Kingdom, and the same rate applies to cloth tops cut here.",176
1442,Mr RILEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"South Sydney) [12.49 a.m.]-The Minister promised to make statement regarding felt for damp courses and roofing. I pointed out when the paper duties were under discussion facture of felt paper would be heavily hit, and asked the Minister to propose duty on felt to equalize matters. Perhaps he will do so in another place?",176
1443,Mr TUDOR,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,"The honourable member for South Sydney and the honourable member for Calare brought the matter under my notice. I shall inquire if relief can be given, and, if so, shall do my best to see that it is given. Amendment (by Mr W.
