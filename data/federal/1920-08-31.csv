Hoblcr of tour of inspection of. Ordered to be printed. SUPPLY OF COAL'. Mr MAKIN' - I ask the Treasurer whether the attention of the Government has been drawn to n statement made by Mr J. Entwistle at a recent meeting of the South AustralianGas Company. He is reported to have said thatThey had heard a lot about supporting Australian industries, but he had been informed the other dav that a certain well-known South Australian business institution, which controlled one of the big collieries in New South Wales, had practically sold the whole of their output to Japan, ana that the shipment was so immense that the smoke of one steamer was not lost sight of by the second, and so nn. Is the Government aware of the circumstances referred to, and, if so, what action, if any, does it intend to take to conserve coal for the industries of Australia, which during recent months have been lacking supplies?",19
2,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I was not aware of the facts stated; one usually has to go outside for statements of this kind. I do not pay much credence to the report. We are doing the best we can in the circumstances, and 30,000 tons of coal is on its way to Victoria. I hope that what is now happening will not be interrupted, because if the present supply continues the coal situation will soon be eased very materially.",20
3,Mr FETJTOK,Unknown,Does your agent see that preference'is given to Inter-State loading?,20
4,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The purpose of his appointment is to see that overseas trade does liot unduly interfere with trade between the States. WHEAT POOLS.,20
5,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Will the Government take the earliest opportunity to give us definite information as to when we may hopo for the settlement of the earlier Wheat Pools, and as to the arrangements that are being made in regard to this sea sou's wheat?",20
6,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , certainly. WIRELESS TELEPHONY.",20
7,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Ar c the officers of the Postmaster-General making exhaustive inquiries about the possibilities of wireless telephony in Australia; if not. will the honourable member have inquiries made on the subject, so that Australia may receive .the earliest possible benefit from the discovery? Mi"". ""WISE - The control of wireless has not been completely taken over by my Department yet, but when it has been, an investigation of wireless telephony will be one of the first things undertaken. WOOL POOL.",20
8,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,Is the Governmentyet in a position to make a statement about the. dividends frcm the Wool Pool ?,20
9,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"T believe that the Prime Minister will make a statement on the subject in the course of the day; I hope that he will, because I want) tihe wool-growers to know what they are going to receive, so that they miny put some of the money into the Peace Loan. PACIFIC ISLANDS MANDATE. i i r . RYAN - I ask the Treasurer whether the mandate for the government of the Pacific Islands has yet been received ?",20
10,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No . HOURS OF MEETING.,20
11,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," I move That unless otherwise ordered the House shall meet on each Tuesday at 3 o'clock p.m., on each Wednesday at 2.30 p.m., on each Thursday at H o'clock a.m., and on each Friday at II o'clock a.m. The "".ist of measures to be considered is lengthening, and we must increase the time available for their consideration.",20
12,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [3.8] - I object to the proposal to meet on Thursday mornings ut 11 a.m., because it is too reuch to ask a member to sit in this chamber for practically twelve hours continuously. The Treasurer and I have seen the bodies of members carried from this building, and I believe that the long sittings of the past are thereason why so many men in parliamentary life have broken down. A member who takes his work seriously, as every member should, and attends conscientiously to his parliamentary duties, has to remain here for many hours at a stretch, and if we are required to come early on Thursdays, breakdowns will be more frequent in the. future than they have been in the past. I say frankly.that I do not intend to takeas much upon myself as I have done.",20
13,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,You deserve a rest.,21
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am going to take things more easily: because I do not wish to break down before my time. But I do not think that the long hours proposed for Thursday sittings are fair to members generally. Recently the Standing Orders were amended in such a way as to empower the Government to fix the time for the bringing of a measure to completion. When the alteration was proposed, it noticewas said that there would be no all night sittings after it had been made. there was an all night sitting on the first occasion on which the new rule was brought into operation. Similarly to meet at 11 on Thursdays will not prevent'all night sittings.",21
15,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Fawkner) [3.10] I agree with the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). public A large number of important measures await our attention, and if they are to be discussed intelligently, their examination will involve a considerable amount of time cannot apart from the sittings of the House. We should have more time than we have for that purpose. I , therefore, intend to oppose the motion, in so far as it provides for the House meeting on Thursday noticemornings. Question resolved in the affirmative. COMMONWEALT H FACTORIES. CONTROL AND INCREASE OF SALARIES.",21
16,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"for Dr MALONEY ) asked the Minister representing the M i nter,"" ister for Defence, upon notice I.

Will the Minister give a list of all whose salaries he has the right 3. Are such increases made by the Minister subject to veto by an authority; and, if so, by 'whom ?",21
17,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's quesment tions are as follow:1. The salaries of the Managers of the tories mentioned were previously based on salaries paid to officers of the Professional Division; but objection having been taken the Treasury to these officers being graded the Professional Division, their salaries have to be fixed by the Minister from time to time. 2.

18,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon ' 1. Has an allocation been made to Tasmania But of Defence cloth which is now being sold in suit lengths in Melbourne at 15s. per yard? 2. If so, what quantity, and when will it be available?",21
19,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is intended to make available to the in all States a quantity of the cloth referred to. 2. Every State will receive its due proportion of the quantity available, taking into consideration population and climatic conditions. The date when sales will start in Tasmania be definitely, stated, but the necessary arrangements will be made as soon as possible.",21
20,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon 1. Whether the statement published that it is the intention of the Defence Department to increase the price of ""Defence Tweeds"" is correct? , 2. If so. has the Minister seen a paragraph in "" the Melbourne Herald, of 24th August, 1020, in which it is alleged that a protest was made by a branch of the Returned Soldiers League, who.^in "" demanding an inquiry into the matresolved to handle no more material until the result of such inquiry was announced? 3. Will the Minister make a statement setting out the reasons for increasing the cost; and if Goany inquiry as desired was made, what are Factory, the results of such inquiry!",21
21,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,Unknown,"The officers answers to the honourable member's quesof increasing? tions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. The paragraph referred to has been brought under the notice of the Minister. 3. When the contract between the Departand the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia was entered into, wool was obtainable from the Wool Pool for Faclocal consumption at appraised rates; but the provision was made in the contract that, if the price of wool altered, the price of the by tweed would be increased to cover any increase in in the cost of manufacture due to such alteration in the price of wool. In view of the fact that the Central Wool Committee requires all wool ear-marked by manufacturers prior to 30th June, 1920, .and put into manufacture after 1st. July, 1920, to be paid for at enhanced prices based on London parity, it has been found necessary to increase the price of the tweed. The reason for increasing the'price has been explained to the Defence Tweed Committee of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, and no inquiry is necessary. NA RESERVISTS.",21
22,Mr LISTER,REPATRIATION OF ITALIAN,"the Minister re-Â» presenting the Minister for Defence, notice I.

23,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,REPATRIATION OF ITALIAN,"The or a private firm? answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:I-. The papers in this action are already available to the public by usual application, and payment of fee at the Courts, and no statement from the* Minister would appear to be necessary. 2. It is not considered desirable that reports which may be in the possession of the Department of Defence showing efforts made by Italian reservists and their friends to prevent their being repatriated, should be made public. 3. War Precautions Regulation 17E (a) provides that any person who, by - advocated or encouraged reservists"" not to comply with notices calling them up nation or service, - committed an offence. It is not considered that justification - exists for - disclosure of any - information the Department statedof Defence may have affecting persons who infringed against the regulations; but Where it was considered sufficient justification existed, action was taken at the time in the ordinary <>urts. 4.

STATEMENT'S BY COMPANY PROMOTERS.",22
25,Mr FRANCIS,REPATRIATION OF ITALIAN,"the Attorney-any means, General, upon notice I. Has the Commonwealth Government any for examicontrol over company promoters? 2.

Will the Government take the necessary steps to protect the investing public by upon promoters of companies to substantiate their figures?",22
26,Mr GROOM,REPATRIATION OF ITALIAN,"Tb e answers to the honourable member's question is as f o llows :The scope of the War Precautions (Companies, Firms, and Businesses) Regulations under which the Commonwealth controlled the registration of companies formed for the purpose of carrying out operations in Australia was considerably reduced at the end of last year. The control of the Commonwealth is now limited to firms and private and proprietary companies the membership of which does not consist wholly of natural-born British subjects; to foreign companies and firms; and to companies and firms partly or wholly formed with foreign capital or whose operations are to be carried on outside Australia. CADET C. G. HUCKELL .",23
27,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,REPATRIATION OF ITALIAN,"On the 19th August the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) asked me1. Whether the lad, Clement George Huckell, who was sentenced to fourteen days' imprisonment on one charge, and seven days on another charge, for breaches of the compulsory military service sections of the Defence Act, on 20th March, 1!)20, and who was released from military custody upon serving fourteen days, was released upon instructions from the Minister or some subordinate official? 2. Is it a fact that this lad was re-arrested on the 13th instant, and conveyed to Fort Largs, South Australia? 3. Had the lad been called upon to return to his'former custody in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Act? I am now in a position to furnish the honourable member with the following in formation :Cadet Clement George Huckell was sentenced to two terms of detention, viz., fourteen days and seven days respectively, for breaches of discipline, the sentences to be cumulative. first term was served forthwith, and expired on 8th April, 1920. Instead of serving the ditional term immediately, Huckell was not called upon until 13th August - throug h misinterpretation by the Area Officer of departmental instructions governing such cases-to undergo the further detention of seven days. This detention expired on 18th August, 1920. NA ARBITRATION BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 27th August, vide page 3957): Clause 10, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 11 to 13 agreed to.",23
28,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Darlin g Downs-Minis calling ter for Works and Railways) [3.20] - I move That the following new clause be added:3A. Section S of the principal Act is amended(o) by inserting after the word ""orders"" the words "" encourages, advises or incites""; and (6) by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section:"" (2.) For the purposes of this section an organization shall be deemed to have ordered, encouraged, advised or incited its members to refuse to offer or accept employment, if (a) the Committee of Management of the organization has ordered, encouraged, advised or incited members of the organization to refuse to offer or accept employment; or (6) an officer or officers of the Committee of Management has or have ordered, encouraged, advised or incited members of the organization to refuse to offer or accept employment, unless the Court before which the proceedings are brought is satisfied that the Committee of Management was not cognisant of the matter"" Section 8 of the Act is as follows: Any organization of employers or employees which, for the purpose of enforcing compliance with the demands of any employers or employees, orders its members to refuse, to offer or accept employment, shall be deemed to lie guilty of a lockout or strike, as the case may be. . It will be seen that to the word "" orders "" in the section I now move the addition of the words "" encourages, advises, or incites.""",23
29,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Hunter) [3.21] This seems to be rather a far-reaching amendment as to the effect of which I am not quite sure. The section in the Act makes ample provision for dealing with organizations which are deemed to have committed an offence of the k in d ; and, altogether, the amendment appears to me rather an objectionable one. The MinisTlie ter has given us no reason why this new ad- clause is proposed, and I am afraid it might lead to a good deal of trouble. It is quite possible, in connection with an in dustrial upheaval, or some anticipated trouble,' that an officer may make certain remarks which do not represent the views of the organization with which he is connected, and, under the clause, the organization will be held responsible. It often happens in industrial troubles that a representative of the men takes a certain view, and places it before the members, but it does not follow that the members agree with it or accept his advice. The members of the association may hold quite a different view, and, under the circumstances, they ought not to be regarded as having committed a contravention of the Act . The section in the Act at present is sufficiently effective, and has hitherto worked satisfactorily; but now, for some reasons of which we have not been told, we are asked to make it more drastic. The Minister ought at least to show the grounds on which he proposes^ to make the change. This is a clause which may not prove acceptable to the bodies outside concerned in industrial arbitration , and no' one can say what it may lead to. We are not told whether the suggestion for such a clause emanates from the Department or from some indust r i a l bodies, and evidently it was an afterthought, for it was drawn up after the Bill had been drafted.",23
30,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,It only prothings. poses to make the law unmistakable.,24
31,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,It is unmistakable now.,24
32,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,The clause extends the law.,24
33,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Of course it does, and in extending it makes it more drason the organization. t i c ; indeed, it is a. sort of drag-net, may be applied in a way never intended. We cannot be expected to accept such amendment without knowing what is the object or the reason for its proposal. may have the effect of preventing any appeal to the Court at all, for if the vernment go too far the industrial unions will have nothing to do with the ciliation and Arbitration Act.",24
34,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [3.29] This clause has been proposed because the practical working of the section i original Act, which deals with an organiorganization is held responsible. zation that "" orders "" its members to fuse to offer or accept employment. any prosecution that takes place it has be definitely proved that an organization gave such an order. I remind the Comclaim mittee that at the instigation of honorthings able members opposite an amendment has been proposed providing that it is an fence for an employer to merely threaten to do a certain thing, and the clause before us is an extension of somewhat the same principle. An organization which "" encourages, advises, or incites "" an offence just as much as an organization which "" orders "" its members to refuse to offer or accept work.",24
35,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Does this clause apply to persons?,24
36,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"No , it deals only with organizations.",24
37,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Why does it not apply to ^persons ?,24
38,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"We have dealt with persons in previous clauses. The section we are amending deals only with organizations qua organizations. It provides that if an organization orders its members to refuse to accept or offer employment it commits an offence. In practice it has been found difficult to prove that an organization ordered a certain course of action, but organizations which incite and encourage the doing of certain things are just as much responsible for creating in dustrial turmoil as is an organization which actually orders the doing of those The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) has said that the officers will become liable. This does not make them liable. When an organization is registered its rules provide for a Committee of Management, and anything done by the committee should be binding Provision is also which made for the appointment of officers. An organization will be liable if an officer or an officers of the Committee of Management has or have ordered, encouraged, advised, It or incited members of the organization to refuse to offer or accept employment, unGoless the Court is satisfied that the Committee of Management was not cognisant Conof such actions by the officers. In short, if an officer is engaged in agitating, order- ing, encouraging, or advising members to go on strike, and the Committee of Manof agement knows what be is doing, and is n the taking no steps to restrain him , the That reis reasonable. Otherwise, a Committee of In Management might have paid officers all to over the country engaged ill inciting the men to a certain course of action, but disresponsibility by saying "" These were' done by our officers."" If the committee were cognisant of the doing of ofthose things, the organization should be held liable. An officer is the agent of, now and is responsible to, the organization, which, therefore, is made liable for acts done with the cognisance of its managing commits body. The onus is thrown on the Committee of Management to show that they were not aware of the action of their officers. An organization might be charged with having incited certain members to refuse employment. If it were proved that the person who did the act was an officer of the organization, and that he did the acts alleged, the onus would then be on the Committee of Management to satisfy the Court that they were not cognisant of what the man had been doing.",24
39,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Prim a facie, the Committee of Management is liable for the acts of its officers, but it is open to them to show that they were not aware of those acts. - Mr GROOM - Yes . The Committee of Management ought to be cognisant of what their officers are doing, and if an officer is deliberately carrying out a policy contrary to that of the committee, they should deal with him.",25
40,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"But if he is doing these things privately, without the cognisance of the committee?",25
41,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,The committee can establish that fact in Court.,25
42,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,This makes the whole committee responsible for the actions of one man.,25
43,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Certainly . The organization, through the committee, must be answerable for the actions of its officers of which they are cognisant.",25
44,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Hunter) [ 3 . 3 7 ] - I am not inclined to accept the amendment. It goes a long way further than was in tended when we adopted the principle of arbitration. The Act at present only refers to the offence which an organization commits if it orders its members to do a certain thing. The Minister laid very little stress on the additional words he is proposing to insert, viz., ""encourages, advises, or incites."" There is a vast difference between ordering a man to refrain from work and encouraging, advising, or inciting him to do so. officer of an organization may give utterance to certain views which are not in dorsed by the committee of the organization, but the organization is to be held liable.",25
45,Mr G,CONCILIATION AND,EOOM - Unles s the Committee Management was not cognisant of what the officer was doing.,25
46,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I will state a case that occurs to me. Honourable members will remember that during the trouble i 1917, when the mines were held up heof cause there were no engines running to convey the coal to port, it was claimed that the miners had taken sides in connection with the dispute. I take the case of what occurred at the Richmond Main colliery, in which 200 or 300 men from the State of Victoria were employed. If when the difficulty was overcome, and the men who were out were asked to.go back to their places in the mine, although the Richmond Main mine was only one colliery connected w""th the industry, an officer of an association of miners had said to the men that he did not think it would be advisable for them to go back to the mine to work with the men who had been introduced from Victoria, the organization would be held responsible under the proposed amendment. I say as a practical man that it would not the advisable for the men to go back to the mine to work with other men who had not been accustomed to work in gaseous mines, and thus take the risk of losing their lives because of the employment in the mine of inexperienced labour. When there is a strike on we are often carried away by our feelings, and these things are not reasoned out as they should be. If any prominent officer of a miners' organization took up the attitude which I have suggested as justifiable, and said that in the circumstances he thought members of the organization, if they desired to protect tiheir lives, should not go back to the mine to work with inexperienced men, the organization, under the new clause proposed by the Minister, might be charged with encouraging or inciting the men to do certain things.",25
47,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"The , Committee of Management would not be liable on those facts, because the officer to whom thei honourable member refers would be acting on his own.",25
48,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Suppos e the Committee of Management of the organization An took up the same attitude. I do not hesitate to say that if I were a member of the Committee of Management that is the attitude I would take up, because any inexperienced man working in a gaseous mine might strike a match, and the result of might be another Mount Kembla disaster. I am reminded by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) that in some cases it may be 2 miles from the mouth of the mine to the face at which men are n working, and in the event of an explosion gas there is little hope that the men would be able to get out. If in the cumstances I have mentioned the Comthe mittee of Management of an organization use of language or of told the members of the organization that they did not think it would be wise for them to go back to their work, it might claimed, under the proposed new clause, that the organization was guilty of doing difficult problem. something in the nature of a strike. the case to which I have referred owner of the mine and the State Governtoo ment of Victoria were acting together, because it has since been proved that owner asked the Victorian Government to indefinite. put men from this State into the mine. The men employed in connection with nine out of ten sections in an industry may be working, and because for some good reason those employed in one section refuse to work, and the officers of their organization advise them not to do so, it might be claimed that that is inciting the men to do a certain thing, and the organization might be held liable for the penalty under the new clause. I cannot accept that. I think that there is quite sufficient power in section 8 of the existing Act to enable us to deal with lockouts",25
49,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Batman) [3.45] The honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton) stands upon solid ground in opposing the proposed new clause. Under the new clause an offence, which is a very serious offence, if one may judge from penalties attached to it , is extended, committed by some other person. and the class of persons proposed to be reached is also extended. When we refer to the original Act, to which reference already been made, we find that it is vided thatAn organization' of employers or employees which for the purpose of enforcing compliance with the demands of any employers or ployees orders its members to refuse to or accept employment shall be deemed to be ment of an organization. guilty of a lockout or strike, as the case In the proposed new clause, taking my first objection to it , I find that the "" orders"" in the section I have quoted has been extended to include "" encourages, advises, or incites."" Advising oue to a thing may, I suppose, be rightly classed mind, most unjust. to be a direction to do it , and a person who directs another to do a thing well be held responsible. But when consider the meaning of the words "" courages "" and "" incites,"" immediately into the realm of uncerof tainty, and we might easily find that persons or organizations would be held cirto be guilty of the offence with which proposed new clause deals, by the conduct which might certainly not be intended to give rise to an offence, and might be nothing be more than a legitimate expression of candid opinion, upon, perhaps, a very 1 do not propose to In support the extension of the offence in the that way at all. These words are far vague and general - Where such heavy penalties are attached to a so-called the offence, the language used is much too When we come next to the class of persons to be reached, and this, perhaps, is a more important part of the proposed new clause, we find it stated thatFor the purposes of this section, an organization shall be deemed to have ordered, encouraged, advised, or incited its members to refuse to offer or 'accept employment if(a) the Committee of Management of the organization has ordered, encouraged, incited, or advised members of the organization to refuse to offer or accept employment; or (6) an officer or officers of the Committee of Management has or have ordered, encouraged, advised, or incited members of the organization to refuse to offer or accept employmentand then follows the saving clause. That is a very important departure from the principal Act , because here it is prothe posed to make men liable for offences The whole organization is to became liable to these extremely heavy penalties by reason has of the fact that the Committee of proManagement has incited members of it to do certain things. The Minister, himself has pointed out that the whole spirit of this legislation is to deal with organemized bodies. The original Act provides offer for the very severe and drastic punishWhat is may be. proposed here is a penalty for what might be called a quasi-criminal offence, word and to make the whole of an organisation, and therefore every member of it , liable for something which the Comdo mittee of Management does is, to my It is unjust in the light of the fact that language may which is considered to be merely an we incitement or encouragement renders enthe person who uses it subject to very we get severe penalties. There seems an element clear vindictiveness in this extension of the clause to the persons to whom it is intended to apply. If we are dealing with organizations, let us convict the organizations, and if we are dealing with Brennan, F. persons, let us convict the persons. I do not Charlton, M. applaud the legislation at all, because we Cunningham, should not make men subject to penalties Lavelle, T. J. who are thought to have committed ofMakin, N.

50,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"It would make an Wise, G. H. organization careful in selecting a ComGibson', W. G. mirtee of Management.",27
51,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"I agree that, as. far MCWilliams, W. J. as terrorizing organizations are conPage, Dr Earle cerned, it may be effective, and as the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) suggests, it may make them more careful.

The object of the amendment is to permit the parties to a dispute to appoint representatives to act with the Judge, and to advise him on matters pertaining to the industry.

If it were carried, section 11 of the principal Act would readThis is There shall be a Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, which shall be a Court of Record, and Bhall consist of a President and two assessors to be appointed by the respective parties to the dispute. It will thus be seen that under this amendment the assessors would be incorporated as part of the Court itself. In stead of providing that assessors shall be called into deal with any particular dispute, the amendment would make them a component part of the Court.",30
76,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,Sectio n 35 gives all that power.,30
77,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"I was about to mention that section 35 provides thatThe Court shall on the application of any original party to an industrial dispute, and may without such application at any stage of the dispute, appoint two assessors for the purpose of advising it in relation to the dispute, and the assessors shall discharge such duties, as are directed by the Court, or as are prescribed. Thus both the President of the Court and the parties to a dispute have power under the A ct to secure the appointment of assessors to advise the Court. - Mr Bruce - Does this amendment propose to give the assessors equal powers with the presiding Judge in arriving at honourable the decision of the Court?",30
78,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"It would make them part of the Court itself, so that every reference in . the Act to ' ' the Court ' f would mean a Court constituted of a Judge and two assessors. That is a fatal objection. I think it would assist the Court to have two assessors, but that is a matter for the Judge himself to determine, in connection with any dispute before him. The Government have announced on several occasions that the Act in its entirety is to be reviewed at a later stage.",30
79,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,That was promised two years ago.,30
80,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Quite so, but we have not had all the industrial powers we desire. AB ill to amend the principal A ct is not only a hardy annual, but a promising one. Proposed new clause negatived.",30
81,Mr BLTJNDELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Adelaide) [4.35] I move That the following new clause be added: "" 14. Section 27 of the principal Act is repealed and the following inserted in its stead :' (1.) On the hearing or determination of an industrial dispute an organization may be represented by a member or officer of an}' organization, and any party not being an organization .may be represented by an employee of that party. (2.) No legal practitioner, whether on the rolls or not, or solicitor's clerk, shall be allowed to appear before the Court, be heard, or attend the Court, in any hearing or determination of an industrial dispute.'"" I hope that my amendment will meet with a better reception than that accorded the amendment with which we have just dealt. In order that my position may not be misunderstood by my legal friends, let me say that, .as a 'member of the State Parliament of South Australia, I availed myself of every opportunity to move to exclude members of the legal profession from the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I recognise that in my proposed new clause I am making a most serious attack upon the strongest and most powerful trade union in the world. If it were carried, and resulted in a number of legal gentlemen being thrown out of work, I should be glad to assist the Government in establishing a bureau to find work for unemployed solicitors. I do not anticipate, however, that the exclusion of the legal profession from the Court would have that effect. We may trust the lawyers to look after themselves, and always to be able to earn a crust. I submit this amendment, in the first place, because I believe it essential to divest the Arbitration Court of any suggestion of the legal element. If I had my own way, even the President of the Court would not be a legal gentleman. My experience convinces me that the heavy expenses involved in approaching the Court constitute one of the gravest causes of dissatisfaction with the Court on the part of a great many of our trade unionists. Trade unions have made repeated efforts to reap the benefit of our industrial legislation. I remember one case in South Australia where the employees of the Tramway Trust attempted to register under the Act. A number of legal gentlemen appeared in the case: the application for registration was refused, and the association had to pay over Â£400 in respect of legal and other expenses. That is the sort of thing that creates among trade organizations a distrust of industrial legislation. Trade unionists are advised that the cheapest and most common-sense way of settling a dispute is to appeal to the Court. If they take that advice, with the result, which so often happens, that not only the accumulated funds of their organization are eaten up, but a special levy is made to provide for legal and other expenses, a sense of injustice is created, and an absolute distrust of industrial arbitration follows. In this way, their minds are prepared for the suggestion, which might 'be put to them very logically, that a lightning strike would at least cost no more than would an appeal to the Court, and that it might give them a better chance of securing a speedy verdict. Trade unions in South Australia are making levies every week to meet the legal expenses associated with an application to the Court, which involved the settlement of a question of interest to quite a number of unions. With all due respect to my legal friends, I find that lawyers appearing in the Court cannot refrain from putting before it the purely legal aspect of a dispute.",31
82,Mr BELL,CONCILIATION AND,Is that not necessary?,31
83,Mr BLUNDELL,CONCILIATION AND,"No . If arbitration means anything, it means the coming together of the parties directly concerned, - and the stating of their case by themselves, so that a settlement may be secured without reference to the dry and musty records of decisions given perhaps before we were born. In my experience I have known an Arbitration Court case argued for four or five daysj and for this, I contend, there is no need; the simpler, easier and cheaper we make the admin.istration of our arbitration laws the better for all concerned. I know that the Minister will say that section 27 of the Act really meets the position, because it leaves the appearance of legal gentlemen to the 'decision of the parties concerned. That section provides that on the hearing and determination of any industrial dispute an organization may be represented by a member or officer, and any party not being an organization may be represented by an employer, but no party shall except by the consent of all parties be represented by counsel, solicitor or paid agent. There was a slight amendment made in that section in 1910, but it does not materially affect the principle laid down. Doubtless the Minister will contend that my proposal is unnecessary, because the matter is in the hands of the parties, but, despite that section, legal gentlemen do appear. Western Australia is the only place I know of where, under the conciliation and arbitration laws, legal representatives are absolutely excluded.",31
84,Mr BRENN,CONCILIATION AND,AN - They cannot appear in the Commonwealth Court except with the consent of all concerned.,32
85,Mr BLUNDELL,CONCILIATION AND,"That is true, but, still, the legal men get there; members of the legal profession have a happy knack of getting to any place where there are fees to be earned. I am not so much concerned about the employers, who are very well able to look - after themselves, but the employment of legal practitioners involves the workers in considerable expense. Men whose wages are not too high are called upon to find the means of protecting their interests, and to pay special levies for the purpose of meeting legal expenses. It is true that no legal men can appear if any of the parties object, but the circumstances are such that the men are given the idea that they get a better "" d e a l "" if they are employed. Even under the section of the Act the employers cannot be prevented from having the advice and assistance of legal gentlemen. In cases in which it is decided there shall be no legal men, it is true that no lawyer stands up and pleads openly, but a lawyer may sit immediately behind the representative of the employers, and every action and question in a particular case I remember was but an echo of the legal mind. That was in a case in which I was directly interested, and in which, in my simplicity, I thought the parties alone would fight the matter out. That sort of thing creates amongst the unionists a feeling of unrest, and they determine, in many cases, to have a lawyer, involving, as I say, considerable expense. In my opinion the wisest thing to do would be to insert a clause which would not allow the Judge to sit in any place that even looked like a Court. The moment the parties get into a place with - a legal atmosphere a feeling of antagonism is raised between the parties, whereas a gathering, consisting entirely of - laymen directly interested, would prove a cheaper and better method of settlement. I have made it very clear in the clause I propose that no legal representative shall be allowed to sit behind the chair of the representative of either employer or employee. I tell honourable members quite frankly that the clause aims at the exclusion from the Court of all legal practitioners while, a case is on, for, otherwise, the lawyers cannot be prevented from giving their advice and assistance, with the effects I have indicated. That particular portion of my amendment is copied from Western Australian legislation, and represents a step towards the ideal of a gathering of laymen directly the interested. I look to the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to vote with me on this occasion, because, on looking up the records, I find that when, that gentleman was a member of the"" New South ""Wales Parliament, and an Arbitration Bill was before the House, he moved to the effect that no person connected with the legal profession should be allowed to be even the Judge in an Arbitration Court. That, of course, goes a good deal further than I propose; but I think I can look for the honourable gentleman's support. There is another phase which I might incidentally mention, and of which I ask the Minister to take note. A few days ago representatives of a particular calling were summoned by the Court from all over Australia to appear at the hearing of a case. In South Australia the union concerned was put to an expense of over Â£20 in order to send the secretary and representatives, and the employers also had to find a good deal of money to cover their expenses. The Committee will agree that it is a scandal that all these representatives and witnesses should be called together from all parts of the country, and, in ten minutes, told that they could go home again. I do not blame the legal profession for what took place on that occasion, and merely mention it incidentally, with a hope that the Minister will see that such a thing does not occur again. The clause I propose will result in great saving to the employees, and eventually be the means of making both parties recognise that it is better for them to settle their own disputes without the intervention of the legal profession.",32
86,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways [4.50] - I ask the honourable member not to pres3 his amendment, and I do so in the in terests of the litigants in the Arbitration Court. The first part of the proposed new clause is now the law, and no party, except with the consent of all parties, may be represented by counsel, solicitor, or paid agent. If all parties desire to be represented by the legal profession, why should they not have the right to be so represented ? The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) proposes that the parties shall be deprived of legal assistance, even if they wish to have it .",33
87,Mr BKENIVAJV,CONCILIATION AND,"He takes the that industrialists are not compos mentis - that they "" do not know their job.""",33
88,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"I think they ""know their j o b "" pretty well. The peculiar point is that, while it is proposed to exclude lawyers, a number of men are permitted to appear who are just as keen as any lawyer in raising objections and prolonging cases by calling witnesses. not say that these men cause delays wilfully, but they have not the same knowledge or appreciation of the relevancy of evidence that legal practitioners have. Giving my own individual opinion, I think it was a mistake to prevent the Court from having the advantage of the assistance of counsel if desired. Lawyers, by their training and experience, have a knowledge of what is relevant and what is not relevant, and their employment would shorten the proceedings, more clearly define the questions to be decided, and, on the whole, make the administration much better. However, Parliament has taken a contrary view, and it is not now proposed to reverse it . In the interests of the parties concerned, however, I ask the Committee to retain the provision that by the consent of all parties counsel may appear. In cases where employers or employees are not trained advocates, and are devoid of experience, why should they not have assistance? Such men, we know, have not always the requisite ability to put cases clearly and concisely, and it would be monstrous to prevent an employer or any organization which felt itself deficient in this regard from obtaining the best assistance possible. To prevent them from employing legal representatives places such organizations at a disadvantage, and, even now, they cannot have them unless all parties consent. The honourable member for Adelaide speaks of the great expense entailed by the employment of lawyers, but if he analyzes the balance-sheets he will find that all the money is not spent in that direction, but is mostly required for the payment of witnesses, and of persons moving about to obtain evidence. The honourable member for Hindmarsh mentioned a few days ago a heavy legal bill, the bulk of which, I understand, was represented by witnesses' fees. Even the costs of an ordinary common law action often consist mostly of Court fees, and witview nesses' fees; the remuneration for the profession often is relatively small. It would be very unjust to pass the amendment, and to prevent either party from getting, with mutual consent, the legal assistance it desires.",33
89,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Maribyrnong) [4.57] I support the amendment, and am prepared to go very much farther in advocatI do ing simplicity oflanguage in Acts of Parliament, particularly in industrial legislation. The language of industrial legislation should be such as to be readily understood by any layman, and, if possible, I would have a lay Court from which the legal fraternit y were excluded entirely. That would be a wholesale, but wholesome reform.",33
90,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member's party gets good legal men, does it not?",33
91,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"This country would be better without any legal gentlemen at all. One may take an Act of Parliament to half-a-dozen lawyers, and get half-adozen different opinions as to its meaning. As a rule, an ordinary individual can understand a newspaper paragraph. Why should we not have the same simplicity and clarity of language in our Acts of Parliament? Legal argument as to the meaning of Statutes has wasted more time and money than has anything else. Any opportunity I can get to l i m it the opportunities of the legal profession I shall take. There are comparatively few lawyers in the ranks of the Labour party, but, in any case, I would sooner have a  pearing for me in an industrial case than any legal man in the community. Mr . Smith, the present secretary of the Victorian Railways Union) and Mr E . Holloway, are able to present an industrial case to the Court in a way that wins the appreciation of the presiding Judge. Over and over again, Mr Justice Higgins, who was an equity lawyer before his elevation to the bench, has complimented officers of unions upon the manner in which they have presented their case to the Court. Unionists will lose nothing by being represented by men of their own organization j who understand all the technicalities of their industry.",33
92,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Nobod y says a word against those gentlemen, but is there any reason for depriving other persons, who cannot put their case, of the assistance they desire?",34
93,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Neithe r employers nor employees are in such a bad case. We have arrived at a stage when we can say good-bye to a lawyer at his office, and enter the Court without him. The Committee should grasp the opportunity of introducing the reform which the amendment suggests. The majority of honourable members do not belong to the legal profession, and for that reason they bring to bear on the business - of the House a greater amount of common sense.",34
94,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"Dampier) [5.1] - At first sight, I was inclined to support the amendment, so that lawyers should be excluded from the Courts entirely, but I find that' the section provides that neither party shall be represented by counsel, except with the consent of the other party. To such a provision, what exception can be taken ? Surely the parties know their own business better than we do. We provide a Court, and say that the lawyer shall not enter it unless both parties are agreeable. Surely that is all we need do. If the employees desire the assistance of a lawyer, and the employers are agreeable to the appearance of counsel, the matter is one entirely for them to decide. It would be unjust for us to interfere. Therefore I must vote against the amendment.",34
95,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Melbourne) [5.3] - I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment, for it is in conformity with my policy for the last twenty years. In my action against Sir Malcolm MCEaeharn, I had one experience of receiving legal advice that should not have been followed. Owing to legal technicalities, the Court officials would not accept my money, and I arranged with my solicitor that I would tender the money personally, if need be, planking it down on the counter and telling the official to go to Hades. Just as Gronluiid, in his Co-operative Commonwealth, referred to Switzerland as an example ' of the efficacy of the referendum, initiative and recall, so he referred to Denmark for an illustration of simplicity in law. Many years ago, when Mr Justice Higgins, as a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, secured the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the simplification of the law, I . introduced toi him a Danish gentleman, who gave valuable evidence as to the procedure in Denmark. Briefly, it is this: If citizen A wishes to sue citizen B, he cannot do it directly, as is allowed under the laws of most other countries. He must first appear before a magistrate, a pacificator, who is sworn to make peace between citizen and citizen. The parties may meet before him at a table, and smoke and chat. Citizen A may claim Â£20 from citizen B ; the latter says he owes only Â£15. The pacificator says he thinks B is in the right, and advises A to accept the offer of Â£15. If A refuses, he pays about Is. 3d. for a process of law, and he and B appear before the pacificator in his magisterial capacity. The parties may call witnesses, but no lawyers ""may appear in the court. The magistrate writes down his decision, and the reason upon which it is based; obviously, it generally follows the suggestion he made at the informal conference. If the unsuccessful litigant is still dissatisfied, he carries the case to a higher court, in which both parties can be represented by counsel. But no fresh evidence can be adduced, and the lawyer can only argue on the written decision of the magistrate. In my opinion, and that of Gronlund, Che legal system of Denmark is the simplest in the world. I have in my possession a documentwhich to me is worth more than its weight in diamonds. A Mr Christisen, who had been a police official in Australia for some years, and whose father had been the greatest medal maker in the world, succeeded to his father's estate, and went to Denmark to wind it up. Against his own inclination, he was persuaded by his solicitor to go to law. The letter I hold in my possession was sent to Mr Christisen by his solicitor, and stated that the High Court of Denmark had penalized him with costs, but after consultation with his colleague, he had decided to pay all the costs, so that Mr Christisen would be involved in no expense whatever. Mr Christisen explained to me that as the High Court had held the advice of the solicitors to be wrong, they, as honourable men, had decided to pay the costs. When I tell honourable members that the writer of that letter three years later became Attorney-General of Denmark, they will recognise that he was a light in his profession. Whilst I loathe and detest the legal profession, there are many men amongst it whom I love and esteem, and I often find that my friendly feelings towards them are in conflict with my conscience. I was speaking recently with one of the few religious men whom I call friends, and, using a concordance to the Bible, he convinced me that all I might say of lawyers would be mild in comparison with what the good Old Book says of them. If any honourable member who desires material with which to slate the legal profession, I refer him to the Bible'. The legal profession has too much power. If I were only one of two of the same mind, I should vote for the amendment. Two Judges of the Supreme Court and another Judge have said that the lawshould be altered to enable that unfortunate man, the Reverend Mr Ronald, to secure justice; and we cannot get it done, in spite of the fact that, in Mr. Ronald's case, every witness .for the plaintiff, with the exception of Sir George Fuller, who is now a member of the New South Wales Parliament, was sentenced for perjury and conspiracy. How can any one respect the law when such things as that can occur? One cannot blame the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) for standing up for his crowd; but I may mention that the great Sumner, one of the greatest jurists that America ever produced, said that for the betrayal of a cause or a country you have not far to go; you can find one ready-made in any lawyer you meet. If the Committee will not agree to the amendment, I hope still to live to have an opportunity of voting for a similar amendment on a later occasion.",34
96,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Batman) [5.13] - If the proposal of the honourable member for Adelaide were directed to reducing in some way the emoluments or earnings of the members of the legal profession who are interested in industrial work, and if it were likely to have that effect, I should have contented myself by taking no part in the discussion, and enjoying a pleasant half-hour in the club-room while it was in progress. But there is an aspect of the amendment which moves me to say something, and to make quite clear why I am opposed to it. It has already been pointed out that, as the result of some amendments of the Arbitration Act, it is no longer possible for a party to arbitration proceedings to be represented by a legal practitioner unless all parties to those proceedings consent. It is not enough that an organization may desire to be represented in the Court by a legal representative, because the opposing parties may veto that desire by declaring that they do not consent. An organization of employers or an organization of employees might desire to exercise what, in other Courts, would be the right to be represented by counsel, but they may be prevented by this very drastic provision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act from being so represented in the Arbitration Court, which' requires the consent of all parties to proceedings before counsel may appear in the Court. The honourable member for Adelaide finds that, spite of this very strict legal enactment, there is an extraordinary and incorrigible tendency on the part of some industrialists in this country to seek legal advice and assistance.",35
97,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,Why ?,35
98,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member asks me why. Surely it must be for the pleasure of paying the lawyers, or the joy they derive from association with them. It cannot be, one may suppose, that as sane men exercising their free will, they desire to avail themselves of the expert knowledge of experienced men in presenting their evidence or their case.",35
99,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,"Migh t it not be because the unionists know that sitting behind the employer is a trained lawyer, advising him, even though he does not appear in Court, and, as a consequence, both side3 are represented by lawyers?",35
100,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"That might be the reason, to some extent. It might be that the industrialists know perfectly well that the employers, whoever they may be, though they are in Court apparently without legal assistance, have, in fact, the benefit of legal advice. Rut how does the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Blundell) propose to overcome that difficulty? He proposes thatNo legal practitioner, whether on the rolls or not, or solicitor's clerk Honourable members will mark thatshall he allowed to appear before the Court or to attend the Court in any hearing or determination' of an industrial dispute. 1 venture to say, with great respect, that a more ridiculous proposition was never submitted to a sane Parliament, if the proposed amendment be clearly understood in all its bearings. If it is to be logical, and certainly if it is to have any effect in the direction the honourable member expects, his amendment should go much further, and I would suggest to some extent how much further it should go. It should readNo legal practitioner, whether on the rolls or not, or solicitor's clerk shall be allowed to appear before the Court, to be heard, to attend the Court, or to be seen anywhere within the hearing of the Court, or in the right-of-way leading to ov in proximity to the Court, or in the neighbouring hostelry within the hours that the same is open for the sale of liquor; and no industrialist shall be found in suspicious conversation with a legally qualified legal titioner or his clerk or his typist, male male, either in his office or elsewhere wheresoever.",35
101,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND, Is the honourable member proposing a new clause?,36
102,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"No , sir; I am merely suggesting that in' order that the amendment should be effective for the purpose desired by the honourable member who has moved it, it should be drafted upon lines similar to those I have indicated. If the honourable member reflects for a moment ou the effect of his amendment, I cannot understand him seriously pressing it in its present form. If the industrialists, the workers, are so intent upon seeking legal advice in connection with the presentation and"" argument of their cases that the honourable member thinks, it necessary to exercise coercion upon them to the exent of preventing any one suspected' of legal knowledge going into a Court where an ordinary member of the public may go, I do not agree with him. I am specially addressing myself to the coercion of industrialists involved in the amendment. It would appear that the honourable member regards the workers of this country as so many fools, who cannot resist the temptation to take the advice of a legal practitioner if they have any case to present to a Court. If that be so, the honourable member must go further and prevent, under penalties, those men going to the offices or places at which they would be likely to get advice from legal practitioners. If the prohibition is to operate, it must be carried out in its entirety; otherwise it will be utterly ineffectual. ' Considering the amendment professionally or personally, I have not the very faintest interest in it or anxiety that it will affect lawyers in the slightest degree. I am not worrying about that. If I seriously thought that it could have an effect of that kind, I would not have addressed myself to it at all, lest it might be suggested that I am in some way personally interested in the matter, which I am not in the veryleast. ""What makes me speak about it-and I think I ought to speak-is that it is an absolute affront to the intelligence of the men who come to the Arbitration Court to suggest that they are dependent on the honourable member for Adelaide or any other honourable pracmember for his wise legislation preventor fe- ing them from exercising their own discretion as to whom they will consult and when they will consult him in matters of this kind.",36
103,Dr MAXOKEY,CONCILIATION AND,That is too thin.,36
104,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member need not interject. He said a moment ago that although he loathed and detested the legal profession, there are many members of it for whom he has a great admiration and esteem.",36
105,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Wors e luck, the honourable member is one of them!",36
106,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"I could not, in the face of that compliment, say what I intended to say. It is because of the absurd attempt to coerce the deliberate judgment of the industrialists-sinc e it is for them. I usually speak, and in them. I have a particular interest-involve d in the amendment, that I am absolutely opposed to it. Eor that reason I feel it my duty to protest against it. Speaking as one who has had some little experience, I may say that although the members of the legal profession are excluded, except with common consent of all. the parties, from appearing before a Judge of the Arbitration"" Court- a matter about which they make no complaint so far as I know; at all events, I do not make any at present - the truth is that organizations, in preparing their cases and collating the ' evidence in regard to them, exercise the judgment and common sense that wise men, or ordinary, normal men in other walks of life, exercise, availing themselves of the best information they can get for the purpose of expeditiously and wisely putting their cases before the Court. It is for that very obvious and natural reason that the law excluding the legal profession from the Arbitration Court has been largely ineffectual. For that reason, as the honourable member himself indicates, it happens that it will very often be found that a solicitor or solicitor's clerk is, at the earnest request and solicitation of the secretary of a union or the man acting for a union, seated behind him in Court helping him with his case. Nothing that the honourable member can do short of the absolute penalties such as those I have mentioned will prevent men from availing themselves of the advice and assistance of legal practitioners. I ' do not desire to go into the value of industrial work to the ordinary practitioner, or to the extent to which it is onerous, exacting, and sometimes unpleasant, because I do not want to be placed in the position'of appearing to defend my own profession in this matter. I am opposed to the amendment because of its inherent absurdity and injustice, not to the legal profession, .but to the unionists, and because it seeks to correct the judgment of men who are just as well able to think for themselves as is the'honourable member for Adelaide. I know the prejudices that exist against the profession, and which arise very often from the fact that long, intricate and expensive arguments sometimes take place in Court as to the meaning of terms incautiously drawn by laymen who say what they mean and afterwards employ lawyers to find out what they mean, and as to the interpretation of Acts of Parliament, which we in our wisdom, and sometimes in our comparative lack of wisdom, may pass. That position is not affected by the particular proposal of the honourable member for Adelaide. I am opposed to it because it prevents men from exercising discretion and free and independent judgment without coercion. It seeks to* deprive them in a purely futile way of their right to decide for themselves as to what advice or assistance they shall have, expert or inexpert, or whether they will have any at all. The law went far enough- I am not prepared to express an opinion as to whether it is wise or not' - whe n it provided that industrialists shall not be at a disadvantage when appearing before a Judge by reason of the fact that the employers with their greater reserves have the assistance of counsel. But the honourable member for Adelaide goes further when he says that a legal practitioner, whether on the rolls or not, or a solicitor's clerk, shall not be allowed to appear before the Court, or be seen in the Court. The honourable member for Adelaide is reducing the proposal to an absurdity, and suggesting that intelligent men who take their case to the Court are so many dupes and fools because they sometimes seek the advice and assistance of expert men in connection with the presentation of their case and the effect and method of collation of evidence. I oppose the proposed new clause, even at the risk of appearing selfinterested, which I am not.",36
107,Mr BLUNDELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Adelaide) [5.30] - I quite realise that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) is not opposing the proposed new clause merely because he is a member of the legal profession. The honourable member is in error in. saying that the amendment has been brought forward without an expression of opinion from trade unionists, because I have moved the amendment at the request of the trade unionists. If the amendment is absurd and foolish, as the honourable member suggests, then those who have requested me to have it inserted must be foolish and absurd. This "" absurd"" clause is a copy of the legislation which was passed in ""Western Australia by the Labour party when in office, and my amendment has not been moved merely because a request has been made 'by trade unionists, because if the honourable member peruses the policy of the South Australian Labour party he will find that that party favours the absolute exclusion of legal practitioners from the Arbitration Court. The honourable member knows that when both parties appearing in a ease before the industrial Court are opposed.to the appearance of legal practitioners, legal representatives are in the Court and sit directly behind the employers' representative, and actually speak to the Court through their representative. Legal gentlemen thus appearing do not do it for amusement, but because they are paid, and when they occupy a seat behind the employers' representative they conduct the case in just the same way as if they were sitting at the table. Some years ago, when a petition was lodged to upset a Senate election, an incident occurred which will illustrate my point. Under the electoral code it is clearly and' distinctly provided that no legal practitioner shall appear in an appeal case without the consent of both parties. In the case to which I have referred, I was an interested party and objected to the appearance of legal practitioners, particularly in the preliminary hearing. In the appeal, which was heard before Mr Justice Barton, four persons were involved, and when we met in the Judge's chambers I was surprised to find that the three gentlemen I was petitioning against walked in with solicitors to assist them. I raised the as to whether counsel could appear, at least at the preliminary proceedings, and I was informed that they could not. Although counsel did not actually conduct the case of these men, it was noticed throughout the proceedings that not one of them attempted to speak without consulting counsel. That is what is being done in the industrial Court, and, there is only one way to keep them out, and that is by inserting such a provision as I have suggested.",37
108,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,Then it will be necessary to fix a radius of 5 miles.,38
109,Mr BLUNDELL,CONCILIATION AND,I am not dealing with the absurdities of the position. - Mr BRENNAN - There would be nothing left.,38
110,Mr BLUNDELL,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member had better inform the trade unionists who desire this particular amendment that it is absurd and silly, as they know where the boot pinches, and* who has to pay for the work done. I know why organizations ' engage legal assistance, and if honourable members had sat in the Court as I have in connection with industrial cases, they would understand the position. The employers' representative sits at the table with a leading solicitor behind him, and it is felt that the employees' representative might just as well also have the assistance of counsel. 'The average trade union secretary, or member of the trade union, could appear in these cases and do just as well as a legal practitioner, but foolishly they have the assistance of counsel, with the result that they spend their accumulated funds, and very often have to make a levy.",38
111,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,In two years' time a union secretary will become as bad as a lawyer.,38
112,Mr BLUNDELL,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not think that any trade union secretary is likely to become as bad as a lawyer. I ask the House to realise that if we desire to make industrial legislation effective and prevent trade unionists from preaching the doctrine of direct action, we shall have to show them that arbitration is cheap, and that it will not cost them as much to go to the Court as it will to strike. Honourable members opposite know as well as I do that in many cases it has cost industrial unions as much to appear before the Arbitration Court as a strike would point have involved. In the Bootmakers' and Builders' Labourers cases five or six strikes could have been successfully carried out for the money that was spent in going to the Court, and the industrial unionists of today that adopt constitutional methods have to pay as much as if they went on strike. In disputes between employees and employers, unionists do not desire to go to the Court, knowing that legal technicalities in every shape or form will be raised, and one of the best means of making arbitration effective is by inserting a provision to debar legal men from appearing. It is also very desirable that provision should be made to prevent industrial cases being heard in a building that resembles a Court, or before a person who is associated with the legal profession. The amendment I have moved has the support of trade unionists, and as it will be the means of facilitating the hearing of cases I ask honourable members to accept it.",38
113,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,"Angas) [5.39] - I rise to support the proposed new clause moved by the honourable member for Adelaide. It is not often that we agree, but on this occasion I must confess that he is right, in spite of the ridicule of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). A majority of trade unionists are of the opinion that lawyers should be kept out - of the Arbitration Court, and I am convinced that the trade unionists in South Australia think it would be in their ests if lawyers were prevented from appearing in industrial cases.",38
114,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"If a unionist ""wants to consult a lawyer, would the honourable member be in favour of preventing him from doing sol",39
115,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,I would be in favour of permitting him to obtain advice in regard to the preparation of his case.,39
116,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Then , your whole argument falls to the ground.",39
117,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) is not necessarily of the opinion that the advice of a member of the legal profession cannot be lielpful to a trade unionist, or to a union organization, but that the presence of a lawyer in the Arbitration Court involves 3, waste of time and money; expenses are ? iled up, and the hearing is protracted, t is a simple matter for the lawyers to prolong a Court hearing. I can quite understand a wealthy employer being - quite willing that his legal representative should protract a hearing. There are many employers who can afford to pay Â£1,000 - where a struggling trade organization may find it hard to raise Â£10. The object of adding expenses, in such circumtitances, is obvious. The point has been advanced that a lawyer is not permitted to be present in the Arbitration Court unless by consent of both parties. The honourable member .for Batman (Mr. Brennan) says, "" Surely the unions know their own business best."" It is not so much a matter of the unions knowing their own business as of their feeling the necessity for engaging a lawyer in order that he, with his expert knowledge and training, may be able to counter the quibbles and technicalities raised by the lawyer for the other side. I once had to engage a lawyer. I did so, not so much that I felt that I could not conduct my own case, as that I was afraid of the legal technicalities which might be raised by the lawyer opposed to me. I have been sorry ever since, for my lawyer charged me two guineas for his advice that I should plead guilty.",39
118,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member got off lightly.,39
119,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,"The point is that I was not guilty. The engaging of lawyers byunions is not due to the fact that the secretaries have been unable to adequately conduct their case, but it has been done because the unions are afraid inter- of the disadvantage at which they might find themselves without the service of a lawyer when it came to the matter of arguing legal technicalities. I can quite understand the fears of the organizations in this respect. Before I went to college, I was always afraid to enter into an argument with a collegebred man, because I had the feeling that his special education gave him advantages which I would not be able to withstand. I had that same feeling of diffidence before I entered Parliament. I used to feel, when I was attending Labour conferences, and the like, that I was not equipped to enter into argument with members of Parliament, because they appeared to be especially wise and . sane persons. Since I have entered this political arena, however, those ideas have departed. I sympathize with the attitude of trade unions generally towards members of the legal profession. They rightly fear that advantage may be taken by the other side if they themselves have not engaged legal advice. The bulk of public opinion is that the Arbitration Court would be infinitely more acceptable and successful if lawyers were barred.",39
120,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong) [5.47] - The proposal under discussion is really amazing. I do not know why the unions consult lawyers at all; but I suspect that it is because of the benefits which the unions expect to accrue therefrom. They consult lawyers- I take it - in order to get the best possible advice in relation to the presentation of their , case before the Court. The suggestion that the introduction of lawyers necessarily involves the protraction of a hearing must emanate from a miserable and unfortunate experience. The unions know what is best in their own interests. There is already provision j that lawyers cannot be employed within the Court, except by the consent of both parties; and, if both parties agree that lawyers shall be employed, it is because each side is of opinion that it will be advantageous, both in its own interests, and for the assistance of the Court it self, thus actually securing-in the matter of length of hearing-greate r expedition. If it is a crime for lawyers to appear in the Court, in order to give parties the benefit of their expert ing and knowledge, it must be, similarly, a crime for either party, or for anybody at all, to consult a lawyer. Honourable members who may differ from me will be consistent if they next move to make it a penal offence for parties to consult a lawyer. But would such a course of action be fair to the unions themselves? Would it not be passing a reflection upon the sanity and discretion of the unionists who desired the assistance of lawyers? I do not think unionists will thank the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) or the honourable member for Angas (Mr. Gabb), seeing that there is already ample protection in this matter afforded under the Act., If I were to consult a doctor, it would be for the reason that I considered that his advice would assist me towards the recovery of my health. A medical man would be able to help me, because of his expert knowledge. From a professional standpoint,""^ it is absurd to suggest that I , or any other legal member of this Legislature, should be moved, in arguing upon this matter, in any personal sense. I emphasize that the sole reason why parties consult members of the legal profession is, in their own interests, to secure expert advice and assistance.",39
121,Mr LAVELLE,CONCILIATION AND,"Calare) [5.53] - If there were required additional reasons to convince me to support the proposed new clause, they have been furnished by those honourable members who have spoken in opposition to it . I refer cularly to the' remarks of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), and of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best). It must be within the knowledge of practically all honourable members that unionists generally desire the legal fraternity to be excluded from Arbitration proceedings. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), with all his eloquence, failed to convince me that it was due to the consideration of any expert training or knowledge that unionists engaged lawyers to attend the Arbitration Court. In matters coming before that Court, the expert knowledge and training are exclusively the attributes of the particular parties thereto;. the lawyers engaged generally know nothing whatever of the matters under consideration.",40
122,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONCILIATION AND,Then why do the train- parties consult lawyers?,40
123,Mr LAVELLE,CONCILIATION AND,"As legal quibbles and legal interpretations are raised, the unionist is compelled to have his lawyer in Court to argue the legal side of any question. The industrialists do not want to have the legal so much as the practical side of their cases presented; they want to put before the Court the prevailing conditions of employment, and the amendment of those conditions for which they are asking. The Minister said that the employment of lawyers expedited the hearing of cases, but my experience is that lawyers have brought dilatoriness to a fine art. We hear of the workers going slow, but the delays in the Arbitration Court due to the lawyers were a revelation to me.",40
124,Mr JACKSON,CONCILIATION AND,Would the honourable member put a layman in place of the Judge of that Court?,40
125,Mr LAVELLE,CONCILIATION AND,"I think 'that that would be an excellent thing to do. To determine working conditions, you require, not a Judge, but a practical man. I fail to see why either Judges or lawyers should be employed in the industrial Court. Arbitration does not appeal to unionists, and a large number of them have no faith in it, because of the delays which occur before cases can get to the Court, the delays that arise after they get there, due to the appearance of lawyers, and the fact that the greater part of their funds go in paying lawyers' partifees. The amendment should appeal to all who desire the success of arbitration and object to direct action. If you want direct action, the way to bring it about is to reject the amendment.",40
126,Mr MARRS,CONCILIATION AND,"Wentworth) [5.5S] - As a lawyer, I have for years suffered under the appellation of member of the "" Devil's Brigade,"" but recently a new appellation was fastened on me, when in a communication received the other day I was told that the letters "" M.H.R.,"" in the opinion of the writer, stand, not for Member of the House of Representatives, but for ""Money Hunting Robber."" At first I was disposed to support the amendment, because I know' that a. tremendous amount of money is spent on legal argument; but I am of opinion that, inasmuch as the Act provides that, where both sides agree, legal assistance may be employed, a prohibition should not be placed on the employment of lawyers under those circum- stances. I hope that in the round-table conferences under the Industrial Peace Act, the parties will thresh matters out among themselves, but lawyers may well be permitted to appear in the Arbitration Court if both ]Darties to a dispute wish to employ them.",40
127,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Maribyrnong) [6.1] When speaking on the Industrial Peace Bill , the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) was in favour of keeping away from the Court. He said, "" Let matters be settled in some quiet private place, not in a Court."" Therefore, I expected him to be a whole-souled supporter of the amendment, because its - aim is to do away with the employment of lawyers, and to take from this tribunal the air of a Court. I should like to have everything done by laymen, though I do not know that that will be possible u all Acts of Parliament are drafted in language which the ordinary layman can understand. The honourable member for Calare (Mr Lavelle) has shown that, although the Act says that lawyers are not to be employed unless there be an agreement between the parties for their employment, a legal gentleman almost invariably sits behind, the representative of the employer, f r a m in g arguments and questions for him, and that, therefore, the lawyer is not really excluded. I believe that the unionists of Australia would like to exclude lawyers from the Arbitration Court altogether. At the present time, a very intricate case is being heard - before Mr Justice Higgins, which raises the question of hours of labour; but on the employees' side the assistant secretary to the Trades H a i l Council is appearing, not for one union only, but practically for all the unions. At aconference of the Australian Labour .party held in 1915, the late Laurie Cohen said thatParliament should make the laws so definite Foster, Richard that there would not he room for the High Francis, F. H. Court to step in and upset legislation, which Gibson, W. G. should be so set out in words that people could Greene, W. M. understand it. The honourable member for Illawarra Hughes, W. M. (Mr Hector Lamond), who was a memJackson, D. S. ber of the conference, said on that occasionThere had been placed on the shoulders of the workers heavy burdens of taxation in order to ascertain what the law of"" the land really was.",41
128,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND,"The engine-drivers, for instance.",41
129,Mr LAMOND,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , and it had cost the Australian Workers Union tens of thousands of pounds in recent years to ascertain what the legal position of organizations really was. That is the penalty that the working 23eople of Australia have had to pay, because the framers of the Constitution were not wise enough to frame it as it should have been framed, because the High Court has not interpreted it in a broad-minded fashion, as Mr Justice Marshall interpreted the Constitution of the United States of America, and because a host of lawyers has been engaged by the employers, and consequently the employees have had to follow suit. Could we but exclude the legal gentlemen from the Courts, we .would save the workers many thousands of pounds. I support the common-sense proposal now n t i l before us, and I hope that members generally will, by voting for it , take the common-sense course of "" b if f in g "" out the legal fraternity.

130,Mr BLUNDELL,CONCILIATION AND,"Adelaide) [6.10] - I move That the following new clause be added:"" 16. Every employer shall(a) make and keep a true record in such form and giving such particulars as may be .prescribed of the names, work, time worked, and wages of the persons employed, and the age of every such person under twenty-one years of age; (b) produce such record for inspection whenever demanded by an authorized person pursuant to section 41 of the principal Act; (cj affix and keep affixed in legible acters in some conspicuous place so as to be easily read by his employees a notice containing a copy of the industrial award."" The Minister has amended section 41 of the principal Act to provide that the person authorized by the Registrar shall have the right to inspect documents and so forth . The proposed new clause will make it necessary for employers to keep records of the names of their employees, the time worked, and the wages received by them. Most of them do so at the present time, but, in some of the States, in stances have occurred where employers have been found to keep no records, and not to ask their employees to sign for their wages. If an inspector were sent to the factory of such an employer to inspect documents, he would be unable to find any receipts for wages paid. In many of these cases, there is very grave suspicion in the minds of union secretaries that the men are not receiving the full wages to which they are entitled. This amendment is designed to carry out what the Minister has already agreed shall be done.. No one would be allowed to inspect the books or the documents of an employer under the proposed new clause except an authorized person approved by the Registrar. It would not be possible for a union secretary to go into an office whenever he. pleased and to inspect the wages books. If there is reason, however, to suspect 'that men are not receiving the wages provided for by an award, the prescribed authority will have power to in spect the documents. Paragraph c ofmy proposed new clause requires that every employer shall post in a conspicuous position in his factory or works a copy of the award relating to his industry. This is a very necessary requirement, particularly in the case of industries where changes are frequently made in the personnel of the employees. A man entering such an establishment in search of employment might not know exactly, what parfc of an award relating to the industry applied to him , and what wages he ought to receive. If we require that copies of an award shall be placed in a conspicuous position in the factory or workshop, there will be no trouble in that regard. A similar provision appears in all State legislation, and I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment.",42
131,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling Downs-Minis char- ter for Works and Railways) [6.16] - I hope that the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) will not press his amendment, since it proposes to insert in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act regulative machinery such as is usually associated with . factory legislation. The amendment is scarcely relevant to the original Act. The Commonwealth function, under the ""Constitution in this regard is to provide for conciliation and arbitration for the prevention or settlement of industrial disputes, whereas the honourable member seeks to devise machinery for regulating the way in which individual employers shall carry on their business.",42
132,Mr MCGRATH,CONCILIATION AND,Unde r the State Wages Board system employers are required to post in a conspicuous position copies of Wages Board determinations relating to their industries.,42
133,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"That bears out the point I have just been making that this amendment is rather in the nature of factory or Wages Board legislation, and that we do not possess the same power that the State Legislatures have to regulate in dustry.",42
134,Mr BLDNDELL,CONCILIATION AND,Does not the Minister think that an employer should be required to post in his factory a copy of the award relating to his industry?,42
135,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,I am not quite sure as to the feasibility of this proposal. Some of our awards are exceedingly lengthy documents.,43
136,Mr BLUNDELL,CONCILIATION AND,But the substance of an award could be posted - up.,43
137,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"I hope the honourable member will not press his amendment. I promise him that I will look into the matter and see to what extent it would be possible to provide for what the honourable member seeks to accomplish in that part of his amendment. The other part is more in the nature of the provisions of a Factories Act. I will look into the matter of the regulative machinery, - and if I find that what the honourable member suggests can be done, I will endeavour to have the Bill amended.",43
138,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,"East Sydney) [6.19] Under the New South Wales law every employer is required to post in a conspicuous place in his' factory a copy of the award relating to his industry. Employers are also called upon to keep a time book showing the number of hours worked by their employees and the wages received by them, and the employees are required to sign that book. Surely there can be no objection, to a similar' requirement in respect of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act. It is necessary to see to the interests of the honest employer, who desires to obey an award, as well as keep control over the dishonest employer who seeks to evade it ; and to this end copies of awards should be conspicuously displayed. We have not yet reached the "" pitch "" when it is necessary to have a witness to the signature of a workman in payment of wages; but, in New South Wales, in the building trade, printed forms are provided,' showing the number of hours worked each day and the amount due. When a case goes to Court, these signed forms have to be produced""; and some employers have been known to get men to sign, for greater amounts than were paid to them. In two such cases employers have been fined, and one of the workmen concerned said he did not know what the award rate was. The Minister and the Court ought to be anxious to accept the proposed new clauses with a view to preventing such offences in the future, and protecting the honest employer.",43
139,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"I have promised the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blun[166] dell} that I shall have the matter looked into, and see what can be done. Proposed new clause negatived.",43
140,Unknown,CONCILIATION AND,Sitting suspended from 6.86 to 8 p.m.,43
141,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Hunter) '[8.0] - I move That the following new clause be added:"" IS. Clause 4S of the principal Act is amended by inserting after the word ' order' the words ' and the term "" party"" includes secretary, or any officer of an organization.' "" Section 48 provides that the Court may, on the application of any party to an award, make an order in the nature of a mandamus, or. an injunction, to compel compliance with the award, or to .restrain its breach. Industrial organizations complain that they have no power to deal with the breach or evasion of an award, and they desire the section amended so that the secretary, or other authorized person, may be able to - take action on behalf of the organisation. Breaches of awards take place, and there is ho one to draw attention to them. If the amendment be agreed to, the secretary, or some other officer appointed for the purpose, will be able to take action on every breach of an award.",43
142,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"The organization, as a party to an award, can make application.",43
143,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Does that apply to the secretary, or any other officer? . Mr GROOM - An officer must prove that he made application on behalf of the organization.",43
144,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"He would require to be instructed by the organization'. Apparently, greater power is desired, for one secretary - writes to me that the amendment is very necessary for the protection of the workers, and will be a great help to the unions. I am at a disadvantage in not knowing the actual difficulties which the organizations have experienced in the past in connection with breaches of awards. I am informed that the amendment would be a benefit to the unions, and the workers generally, because it would facilitate the laying of information against defaulting employers. I do not think the amendment would cause any danger, because the secretary or officer could not take action on his own volition; he would have to apply to the.Court, and the Judge would decide whether proceedings should be taken against the party complained of.",43
145,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [8.5] - I think the amendment would cover more than the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) has indicated. Under section 48, an organization, as a party to an award, is entitled to apply to the Court for an order to compel compliance with the award. Of course, the organization must apply through some officer, and the applicant would explain to the Court his authority for applying oh behalf of the organization. What the amendment means is that the secretary, or some other officer, should have power to apply to the CouTt of his own volition, and apart from the organization. In other words, the officer is to be allowed to police an award, and every time he thinks something is wrong lie may make application to the Court.",44
146,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,"If he only desires to do that at the instance of his organizaFederal tion, he has the power now..",44
147,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,Yes . The substance of what the honourable member for Hunter is seeking is already contained in the Act. We cannot give isolated individuals in a to (4) union power to make application apart from the organization itself.,44
148,Mr WEST,CONCILIATION AND,"A secretary, or officer, is a servant of the organization.",44
149,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , and the servant should only act at the instance of his organization. The amendment proposes that he may be independent of his organization. I urge the honourable member for Hunter not to press the amendment. Proposed new clause negatived.",44
150,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND,"Herbert) [8.8] - On the second reading, I called attention to the advisability of allowing the persons who were most seriously affected by the strike an opportunity to express their views before the strike was entered upon. .During an industrial trouble, contribu. tions are sent for thebenefit of the strikers from industrial organizations all over-the Commonwealth; and the men get their ' food, housing, clothing, tobacco, and even some luxuries, much as usual; but the women and children are deprived of many of the comforts to which they are entitled, and suffer a great deal. I desire that the voice of the women may be heard before a strike is declared, and I propose the repeal of section 21, with a view to inserting another provision in lieu thereof.. Section 21 providesA certificate by the Registrar that a specified industrial dispute exists, or is threatened, or impending, or probable, as an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State, shall be prvmA faoie evidence that the fact is as stated. Thus before a dispute, can come under the cognisance of the Arbitration Court, it must extend beyond the boundaries of any one State - T move That the following new clause be added:Section 21 of the principal Act is repealed, and the following is inserted in lieu thereof:."" 21. (1) In any case where an industrial dispute exists because of which a strike is suggested, contemplated, or threatened, it shall be competent for the President of the Arbitration Court to order that a secret ballot be taken at or in which every member of the organization affected shall be entitled to record a vote for or against a strike. (2) Whenever any such ballot is ordered, or State officers of? the respective Electoral Departments shall conduct and supervise the taking of the ballot. (3) Further it is hereby provided that the wife of every member of the organization , directly affected as before said shall be entitled record a vote. The wife of each and every member of the organization affected shall upon application, at any time within twenty-four hours before the opening of the ballot, have issued to her an elector's right qualifying her to record a vote at such ballot."" The new clause involves a new principle, but this is something which we should have done years ago. We should have given those - most deeply concerned some voice in these matters. Many of us have noted that recently the women of BrokenH ill themselves took action in connection with a strike. It resulted in nothing, but the very fact that they took action on their own account shows how deeply they were interested, and how very seriously they were affected by what has been going on at Broken Hill during the past fifteen or sixteen months. Whilst they have been suffering very much, we have seen from correspondence in the press that the men at Broken H i ll have been well fed and clothed, and, apparently, well housed. They seem to have been doing very well, whilst the women have been suffering very much. I believe that honourable' members opposite will be ready to support my proposal, because I am certain that they are as much opposed to strikes as are any other persons in the community. They realise that what I have said as to the interest of the women and children in these matters is absolutely true. Any honourable member representing a district in which strikes are prevalent knows perfectly well that those who suffer from them are the women and children rather than the men. Children look to their mothers rather than to their fathers during industrial take a ballot disturbances to relieve them of the evil consequences of a strike. I expect from honourable members opposite a great deal of sympathy and support for my prothat posal. . T hope that it will receive the approbation of honourable members genenexion rally and of the Minister in charge of the Bill. I am perfectly certain the members of the gentler sex, and cially those likely to be affected by strikes, will be in hearty sympathy with this proposal, and the man who votes against it will have rather a rough time when he goes home and tells his wife what he has done.",44
151,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Hunter) [8.20] All that the Minister in charge of this Bill (Mr Groom) need do is to accept proposed new clause if ' he desires arbitration should be a thing of the past. However much we may deplore strikes has never been held by the members this or any other legislative chamber that I know of that it is possible to pass legislation tion which will prevent strikes or lockouts. We have lockouts as well as strikes, but it is very strange that the honourable member in submitting his new clause dealt only with trade unionists and' strikes, and said nothing of employers who can lock men out at their own sweet will. Employers by locking out men may subject them and those dependent upon them to penalties and suffering, but the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford) will ask no questions in such cepted. eases.",45
152,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND,When has there been lockout? *,45
153,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"There have been many, but the. honourable member does propose to deal with lockouts. We all plore both strikes and lockouts, and that they could be put an end to; but whilst we endeavour to pass legislation avoid their consequences, we realise that it is absolutely impossible to prevent altogether. They will occur, in spite of all that we can do. We can only strive to lessen their number. [166]- 2 The proposed new clause would take out of the hands of trade unionists the management of their own affairs.",45
154,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND,Not at all.,45
155,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,-It would. Once we say that in connection with any industrial trouble a Judge of the Arbitration Court may appoint certain persons to,45
156,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND,A secret ballot.,45
157,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Once we provide he may appoint-certain Federal or State officials to take a ballot in conwith any industrial disturbance, we shall be removing the administration that of trade union organizations from the espehands of their members. There is no escape from that conclusion. The amendment does not require much argument to condemn it. We have only to consider what its effect will be. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that only organizations that are. registered shall come under it, and I ask the honourable member for Herbert and the Minister in charge of the Bill to say how many the organizations - would remain registered that under the Act if the new clause were agreed to. I venture to say that within it a fortnight of the passing of such of a provision every trade union in Australia would withdraw from the ArbitraCourt. If it be the desire of the Government to kill the present Act and the Arbitration Court, they will effectively carry out that desire by accepting the amendment. Honourable members opposite may say that the onus of withdrawing from the Court would be thrown upon the. trade union organizations, but I venture to say that no trade unionist would for a - moment advise his organization to continue registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act if this clause were acHowever much the h/morable member for Herbert may detest strikes a and may desire to do away with them, the clause he now proposes would, if accepted, bring about more strikes in this not community than we have had for years depast. Every trade union organization wish would be up in arms against it. They will not permit this Parliament to take to from them the right to manage their own affairs. We have recognised trade unions them and we made them legal some years ago.",45
158,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member not think that the people most deeply interested should have some say in the management of the affairs of an organization ?,45
159,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,^I say that the people most deeply interested are the people concerned..,46
160,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Who people concerned?,46
161,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"The employees, the employers, and the general public.",46
162,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Exactly .,46
163,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Who are those chiefly concerned in connection with an in dustrial organization? Are they not the members of the' organization, and should they not have the right to manage their own affairs?",46
164,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"They are the persons chiefly concerned. Mr Charlton' - Would the honourable member contend that similar legislation should apply in connection with any big company composed of numerous shareholders? He has not advocated that, and would not advocate it . It is intended that this provision shall apply only to working people in this country",46
165,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member has not quoted a parallel case.,46
166,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"It would be impossible to quote what the honourable member would regard as a parallel case, because he thinks this legislation should apply to one side only. However much the women may be interested in these matters, and I admit that they are in terested, because I have gone through strikes as other honourable members have done, and I know the extent to which women are interested, I venture to say that the womenfolk of the workers of this country would not thank the honourable member for Herbert for proposing this new clause, or this House for accepting it . ' The womenfolk of the workers of this country are amongst the best fighters we have in connection with industrial troubles. ,",46
167,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,They are biggest sufferers.,46
168,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"They suffer in silence, because they know that their bread-winners are doing the best they can to better their position, and in so doing to better the position of their wives and children. A r e we to be told at this time and in this enlightened age that it is necessary to incorporate a provision of this kind in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act? There is not one honourable member on the other side who can justify the acceptance of the amendment. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act has been in existence for years, and we only recently passed a Bill through this House are the to deal with industrial differences, which is now under consideration in another place, but we made no provision for this sort of thing in that measure a,t all. I do not know what the Minister proposes to do, but I wish to know whether he intends to accept the amendment or not. If he does accept i the can say good-bye to arbitration. If he desires to effectively k ill the present Act, the way to do that is to accept the amendment.",46
169,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Would the honnot orable member allow a ballot of the members of an organization to be taken by an electoral officer ?,46
170,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,I will never prevent a ballot being taken by their own officials. They can manage their own affairs.,46
171,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Apparentl y they could not do so at Broken Hill .,46
172,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"It is suggested that these ballots are not taken fairly , and I want to say that, so far as I know, they are always conducted fairly and above-board. In my own - district, it is safe to say that we have one of the most militant unions in Australia. We have 8,000 members, and whenever a ballot is taken it is taken at the pit's mouth. When the men come up from their work each is given a ballot-paper. There are scrutineers to see that no man gets more than one ballot-paper, and that only members of the organization are given papers. In that way the decision of the men is recorded on the matter referred to them. I ask whether anything could be fairer? We do not want any one to interfere with the management of our affairs.",46
173,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND,But the people concerned.,46
174,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"On e would think, the to listen to the arguments and interjections of honourable members, that the whole thought of trade unionists is to r.ieate trouble and have strikes, whereas, no one detests a strike more than do the members of trade union organizations and their officials.",46
175,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Some of them.,46
176,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Ver y often people are led to form a false impression by what appears in the press. They do not thoroughly understand - what the men are endeavouring to do. Statements are made with a view to bettering the condition of men, and at once people jump to the conclusion that those who make such statements are endeavouring to create trouble, and wish to stop a particular industry. That, however, is the thing farthest from their minds. They never think of it . What does a strike mean to them ? It means nothing but trouble for them. It means the most anxious time which men leading the trade union movement can have. I have had to go through it myself, and I know that the officials of trade unions detest strikes, but they have to protect the interests of the members of their organizations. The rules of these organizations can be seen; they are registered in the different States, and are recognised under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Now, the honourable member for Herbert comes along with a proposal to take away from the members of trade union organizations their rights in regard to certain matters, because, forsooth, s-ome members of the Committee do not approve of what they occasionally find it necessary to do. Whilst they are prepared to deal with employees in this way, they have not one word to say about treating employers in the same way. The employers may declare a lockout because of the changed conditions due to an award, but honourable members opposite have not a word to say about them. The working men are to be tied up, and I repeat that honourable members opposite can accept this proposal if they so desire, but if they do accept it there will be an end to arbitration. ' Mr GREGORY - Can the honourable member not see that if effect is given to the proposed new clause it will legalize an otherwise illegal act.",46
177,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not know what is intended, but I do know what will be the effect of passing such a provision. ""We have been doing certain things in connection with arbitration in this Chamber recently, and I confess I do not know what is behind what is being done. I did not think that there was anything behind it until I received a copy of this proposed new clause. If the Minister in charge of the Bill intends to accept the amendment I will know that it is his intention to k the Arbitration Act. Without consulting the industrial unions, I am confident that they will not accept this proposal, and I ask the Minister whether he intends to accept it or not.",47
178,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [8.26] - I am not in a position to accept the amendment. The honourable member who has moved it has said that strikes ought not to be lightly entered into, and I think that people, generally, will agree with him. He put that view forward and asked the .Committee to consider it . He believes that if the women who are so seriously affected by strikes were asked to record a vote for or against a strike it would be found, in many instances, that those who suffer most from strikes would be against them. I am more concerned, however, with the effect of the amendment upon the original Act, and on .that account I cannot see my way to accept it . The intention of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is to make lockouts and ""strikes illegal. There is a difficulty in enforcing that intention, but it is the spirit of the Act that there should be no strikes or lockouts, because there is machinery provided by the Act itself whereby the persons affected can secure a peaceful adjustment of their differences and redress of their grievances. The idea of the Act is to do away with the barbarous method of the strike and introduce the reign of law and OTder into the conduct of economic affairs.",47
179,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,It has been an awful failure.,47
180,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Not altogether; and I am rather inclined to take the view that when the history of industrial legislation in Australia is impartially written, it will show that our efforts have contributed helpful experiments in connection with industrial disputes. I do not say for a moment, that it has been the means of solving all our difficulties., but we have been groping after that which is right without precedent to guide us. Mistakes have been made in the past, and we are now endeavouring to correct some of them, both in this Bill and in a measure which is now before the other Chamber. It is our desire to seek some means by which we can substitute law and order and peaceful conditions for strikes and lockouts. . I am quite sure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. ill Charlton) will accept my assurance that the honourable member for Herbert (Mr . Bamford) had no intention of breaking up our industrial legislation when he moved his amendment. In the first place the difficulty is that strikes are illegal, and this amendment purports to give the President of the Arbitration Court, in the event of a strike, the power to order that a ballot shall be taken. Instead of ordering a ballot, he should order penalties on those responsible for encouraging a strike. The mover of . the amendment has not followed it up sufficiently .by showing what would be the result if those balloting were in favour of a strike.",47
181,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND,There would not be a strike.,48
182,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"But supposing there were, the Court would be sanctioning something which the Act declares i l legal. The wording of the amendment is against' the general tenor of the law, and for that reason I cannot see my way to accept it. The honourable member who moved the amendment must admit that it is contrary to the spirit of the Bill.",48
183,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"Dampier) '[8.34] We have to thank the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) for the amendment he has submitted, if only for the reason that the Committee has received a clear indication of what the value of such an amendment would be if it were embodied in the Bill. The Act is clear and definite that strikes are solutely illegal, and if such is the case, how can power be given to the President of the Arbitration Court to conduct a ballot in connection with an impending strike ?",48
184,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,It would not be recognised.,48
185,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"Of course. it would not. The amendment has given the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) an opportunity of making it clear to honourable members-and I hope to the public outside-ho w the workmen's wives feel in regard to strikes, and I do not remember the honourable member ever submitting a case more strongly than he has done on this occasion. It has been a revelation, and I believe he has clearly expressed the opinion of most of the wives of the men who strike. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says he speaks from experience, and if , as he suggests, the carrying of the amendment would mean the destruction of the Bill, I would be inclined to support it.  would get something worse.",48

187,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"I would like to see the Canadian system adopted, whereby if the men cannot get the award they desire, they can go on strike. What is the use of legislationwhen our experience shows that we will have strikes whatever we do? Why not admit that strikes cannot be prevented, and legislate for them ? Is it right to shackle one section and allow the other to do just as it likes?",48
188,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,How would the honourable member apply the amendment in the case of .a lockout ?,48
189,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"I read a little while ago, in connection with a strike, that the wives of the workmen decided to cease work, and left the strikers to look after the kitchen and the kiddies while they had a good time. We need only refer to Knibbs to see that during the year before last Â£2,800,000 was lost by strikers in wages, and if that amount were capitalized it would represent a loss of something like Â£10,000,000 to the people of Australia. Legislation of this character should not be. compulsory, but should be ab- on the Canadian system, and when a decision is arrived at which is unsatisfactory to the workmen and they desire to go out on strike, a strike ballot should be conducted, not by the officials representing the men, but by outside officers. It is generally admitted that it is the young men who have very few responsibilities who are eager for a fight.",48
190,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,"They are usually the ones who stay in, and it is the married men who stand by their principles who come out. I have been in a workshop, and know it.",48

192,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member has never been as closely associated with working men as I have.,48
193,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"If we could make this measure unworkable and could compel the Government to bring in another Bill, without the compulsory clauses, embodying something in the nature of the Canadian system, with proviso in regard to strike ballots, I besaid lieve labour organizations would support it. The leaders of industrial organizawalk tions are not as a rule responsible trouble, as it is generally the hot-headed members of industrial unions who are blame. If we adopted the Canadian tem, I believe our industrial laws would be more effective, and there would be better prospect of awards being observed than under present circumstances. As the proposed amendment is contrary to the spirit of the Bill I cannot support it .",48
194,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND,"Yarra) [8.40] --It was not my intention to speak to the amendployers ment, as the principle involved has already been ably dealt with by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). As a trade unionist of many years, not in Australia, but in other countries where ballots are taken, I am able to say that simple, then. on the question of striking the women always support their husbands. On a resimple cent occasion, at Broken Hill , in conwho run nexion with the present strike, the election of officers turned on the question of whether there should be a ballot in connection with the strike, and although the officers opposed it, they were ,returned by large majorities. In the felt-hat making in the dustry, in which I was employed in Great Britain, there are as many female as male workers, and in connection with one dustrial disturbance in particular that curred in that industry while I was workvernment ing there, the women were as keen on strikthe ing as were the men. Any one who has a foredoomed. knowledge of the conditions obtaining in the north of .England twenty or thirty years ago knows that married as well as single women work because they do not receive sufficient from other sources. On the occasion to which I have referred the women held a meeting the night fore the men and decided that as they had been locked out they would go without strike pay for the first month, and the men carried a similar resolution the next night.",49

196,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND,"I am surprised that the honourable member, for Herbert, who, believe, is an old trade unionist, should submit such an amendment. I know of an instance in the metropolitan' area of Melbourne, where women workers were dissatisfied' because a non-unionist had a been brought into a factory, and they that unless that non-unionist was dismissed they would walk out; and they did out, and they waited until they for were sent for. This clearly shows that the women are as good unionists as to the men, and if they are asked to sysvote they will always be in favour of. fighting for better conditions. It must a be remembered that there are lockouts as well as strikes, and the "" bosses "" will always take care to keep on inflicting pinpricks until the men or women are compelled to cease work. . It is not only a question of making a demand on the emfor improved conditions, because employers can find thousands of ways of aggravating men in spite of the law.",49

He remarked that, having returned home from his travels, he had been impressed with the fact that Australia is one of the best countries in which to invest money today. The printers in this State recently had a dispute, and the employees were out for three months. Then a conference was called, over which the Premier of VicI toria (Mr Lawson) presided. Among those who had been on strike were numbers of women and girls. As an outcome of the round-table conference, the men in the trade agreed to accept the conditions laid down, but those who stuck out still better conditions and were prepared to continue to fight for them, and main out of work until they were ceded, were the women. ,",49

203,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,"It is the women who put up the stoutest fight. When there was a strike of miners in New South Wales some time ago, the keenest were the coal-miners' wives. They told their men that if they went back they would not them as their husbands; and they were incensed against the ""blacklegs"" that numbers of. women actually pelted with lumps of coal.

The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr his family? Fenton) has just advanced the strongest possible arguments that no one in an industrial community is prepared to fight harder and longer under strike condiand tions than the women folk. It is for-tunate for the women of the Commonevent wealth that the honourable member for Hunter was not a member of this Parlialarge ment when the Franchise Act was passed, folk?

206,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND,"Of course not; the Democrats are all congregated behind the Government, and I hope they will presently endorse that statement by their attitude in division. Surely the women whom we gave the right to assist in the selection of members to this Parliament should be entitled to vote in industrial trouble, which is far more important and more closely concerned with their lives than a Federal election. have not the statistics at my hand, but ture. could furnish figures to prove that since the Arbitration Act came into force there have been more strikes in Australia for during any previous period of' equal length. The Act has been practically a to redead letter. What good has it accomconplished? Yet, when I endeavour to introduce a proposal to make the Act, in some respects, at any rate, serviceable, rethe Minister (Mr Groom), who is so optimistic about the Bill, indicates that he cannot accept it. He ought to know how matters are run in trade union circles nowadays. When there is trouble brewing in the part of Australia' from which I come, a meeting is called. The secretary own and the organizers are on the platfoTm, so and a motion, which has been framed beforehand, is put to the meeting. The them chairman says, ""Now, you 'dinkum to blokes,' get over to that side; and you ' bally scabs,' you get over to the other Of course, there are no "" scabs "" ; - e resolution is unanimously agreed to. the honourable member for Maribyrnon 'S refel ' s to the eagerness of girls to stand out m a strike, he forgets that they have no responsibilities; they are not the mothers of families.

212,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND,"No , for the reason that the fathers dominate the children, who would be afraid to vote other than at their parents' behest. I cannot help but admire the optimism of the M i ister ; he expects great' things of the Bill . I recall that the late Mr . Deakin delivered three magnificent speeches on the first Arbitration spoke in the same optimistic tone; but is there industrial peace today? Has the Arbitration Act achieved what Mr .

The motion may be laudable in its intention, but I suspect that its main objective is that it may gain for ber. the honourable member for Herbert a little personal advantage. From a practo tical point of view, his proposal will not bear investigation.

218,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,"I would not follow the honourable member blindly. He will have to prove the effectiveness of the proposal before I would support him. It is imposto apply to lockouts the condition that he wishes to apply to strikes. I am prepared to give all citizens a full opportunity to voice their opinions upon matters of public policy. Some members, however, desire to intrude and interfere in the trade or industrial union spheres. No such anxiety is manifested by these same gentlemen on behalf of our-womeni n controlling the employer by having a direct voice in his affairs. Where women but are directly employed they certainly I think I know the feeling of the womeni n this country in regard to these Whenever the betterment of in an industry is desired, they comare prepared to stand by their menfolk, and if the latter find it necessary to take the extreme step of striking none are more loyal to them than their wives. Mr RICHARD FOSTER.^-When they that think that the cause is just!",51
219,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,"They always think that cause is just when their husbands are driven to this extreme step because the nature of conditions arising there has demonstrated itself in their own homes. If wives are to vote in regard to the striking, why should not the mothers and sisters who depend on the workers also vote? The f u t i l it y of the amendment The gross inconsistency for of members who support the pronow before the Committee, and at I the same time would not give women the to vote for candidates of the Legislative Council in South Australia, places as their remarks at a discount. Mr RICHAB D FOSTEB - Is there any analogy between the two things ?",51
220,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,"Of course there is not, in the mind of the honourable memWe know that it would be impossible to apply the proposed conditions lockouts, and why. should we impose on one side conditions that cannot be applied to the other. Honourable bers opposite have repeatedly attributed the industrial unrest which prevails to working men of the country; but what about the employers who evade their responsibilities, and have it in their power to displace men at their pleasure, and by subterfuge deprive them of their work without having to answer to any tribunal for their behaviour ? Whenever men try to improve their conditions after failing to secure redress by constitutional means, members opposite place the whole responsibility for the unrest that occurs of single men. at the workers' door; but, generally, whenever the working class has had rebe course to direct action, there has been justification for it. 'Men do not revolt from just conditions.",51
221,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,On many occasions the Leader of the Labour party (Mr. Tudor) has said in this Chamber that men frequently strike against the advice of executives of their unions.,52
222,Mr MCGRATH,CONCILIATION AND,Bu the did not say that they were not suffering from grievworld. ances when they took that step.,52
223,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,"I am speaking in genshow eral terms, and what my Leader may have said does not orove that there was tains of industry. not justification for the action taken. Their leaders may have erred, and the men themselves may have taken a truer view of the question at issue - When the result of a secret ballot results in the declaration of a strike, there is ample justification for the action taken. I do not desire to see such action except when it is absoin lutely necessary, and every other medium for settlement has been exhausted. have never preached the doctrine of irresponsibility and going to extremes. I have held that the course taken should be justifiable to the comtrue. munity at large as well as to the body of workers concerned. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) said to it night that it is those who have little or no interest in the place where they employed who are most ready to take an independent stand, and are thus the cause of a great deal of industrial unrest, meanand in? that single men were largely instruand mental in precipitating strikes.",52
224,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"Generally , strikes are caused by the young hot heads of the unions.",52
225,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,"My experience is that memmany single men are more reluctant to take the. extreme step than men with large the families. I have seen that in workshops where I have been employed. Married men sometimes feel called upon, sooner than single men, to leave their employment to show their disgust and resentment at their conditions, and it is natural that they should, in view of the greater pressure on them in providing for the sustenance of their families. Certainly, on the average, strikes are precipitated as much by the action of married men as by that Whether there may be justification for it , extreme action should left to the decision of those responsible. It is a pity that the Government did not take the opportunity to come to an understanding with the trade unions as to legislation which would overcome the present difficulty, and assist in removing those anomalies which are the cause of disthe satisfaction, thus minimizing industrial unrest. Compared with other countries, Australia enjoys more peaceful industrial conditions than any other part of the Occasionally, however, through lack of constitutional means men have to their disapproval of injustice to conditions that are imposed by the cap",52

227,Mr LAVELLE,CONCILIATION AND,They know it to be,52
228,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"They know is the young hot heads who are responsible for the unjustifiable strikes in this are country. As I said here two or three weeks ago, only an infinitesimal proportion of the unionists of Broken Hill were, are today, responsible for the worse most unjustifiable strike that any country has ever known. It has been for the last twenty years the constant complaint of steady, responsible married men of Broken Hill that young irresponsibles cause all the trouble.",52
229,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,Would not the Broken Hill mines have been - working today if - the mine-owners had been prepared to adopt the conditions laid down by the conference ?,53
230,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"No ; because the strike was due, in the first place, to a dispute between unionists, and not between the men and the mine owners. The deplorable condition of Broken Hill today is a shocking example of the work of the young .irresponsibles who caused the strike now going on.",53
231,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,Has the honourable member been there lately?,53
232,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"I have not; but scores and scores of the best men that ever worked in Broken Hill have told me that as soon as a strike was declared they had either to leave there, or shut their mouths, and submit to any proposal that might be made until the strike was over. The mine-owners of Broken Hill deplore the fact that these men do not come back. If action were taken to clear out of Broken Hill about fifty men, a working man's paradise would be established there. Unionists there have the best employers in the world.",53
233,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member say that the mine-owners have all the virtues so far as the present strike is concerned ?,53
234,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"I do; and I am delighted to know that the statement is true._ As to. the workshops in which my honourable friend (Mr Makin) says he has been employed, the experience of the last twenty years is that the industrial disturbances created in it have not infrequently been due to young irresponsibles. I am not including my honourable friend in that category. Â«ertainly youthful in appearance, but he is the father of a family, and an excellent fellow. My only complaint against him is that he is wrongly informed. I could traverse all the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), and several other members of his party, but I do not wish to detain the Committee. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) has given utterance tonight to some splendid sentiments, the truth of which cannot be. gainsaid, but in order to avoid any waste of time let me say that the words of wisdom that have fallen from his lips have come at the wrong moment, since the purport of the Minister's proposals, if I understand them rightly, is that strikes shall be declared illegal. In these circumstances, I ask you, Mr Chairman, whether the debate is in order ?",53
235,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,"Angas) [9.20] - I oppose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford). I have not much fault to find with that part of it which provides that there shall be a secret ballot of the members of an organization involved in a dispute to determine whether or not a strike shall take place, because I , too, have had inside experience, and might bear out some of the statements which the honourable member has made. But I resent very strongly his proposal that the wives of the men should take part in the ballot. No doubt the honourable member thinks that if the women-folk had a right to vote, there would be no strike. In other words, he is casting a reflection on the wives of the unionists by suggesting that they would be such crawlers as to allow their husbands to put up with any industrial conditions rattier than risk the privations that attend a strike. The unionist, after all, is but the son of his mother; he is of the stock from which he has sprung, and . when it comes to making a sacrifice, or to standing up for a principle, no one is more ready to do so than a woman.",53
236,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND,Then let the women have an opportunity of expressing their opinion.,53
237,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,"We are not opposing this amendment because of any fear of the result of such a ballot as is suggested. We oppose it because it is a reflection on the wives of unionists. I have been wondering during this deHe is bate what has happened to cause the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Poster) to present bouquets to , the honourable member for Herbert. A few years ago one would not have dreamt of bouquets .being handed to him by either the honourable member or the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory). I have read somewhere that Herod and Pilate became friends over the crucifixion of the Nazarene; and here . we have a modern Herod and Pilate becoming friendly over the crucifixion of the principles and loyalty of the working women of this country. When the honourable member for Herbert was seeking to benefit, I will not say his industrial, but his financial, position, be did not ask that a ballot of the wives of members should be taken in regard to the salary grab; he was quite satisfied to trust to the wisdom of members themselves, so far as that matter was concerned. If it is good enough for us to deal with our own business, it is good enough for the unionists outside to settle their own business without calling upon their wives to settle it for them. Proposed new clause negatived.",53
238,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"Dampier) [9.25] - I move That the following new clause he added:"" 19. After section 58A of the principal Act the following section is inserted:58B. The rules of an organization under this Act and the officials of such .organization shall not, during the currency of an award in the industry concerned, prevent or impede any members of such organization from entering into written agreements in accordance with such award at any time prior to the commencement of service.'"" The amendment would prove useful in connection with not only the pastoral industry, but sugar-cane cutting, since it would enable members of an organization to make their arrangements or to enter into contracts with employers some time before the actual date of starting work. The special reasons supplied to me for this proposal are as follow:1. The signing of an agreement is the only way of binding an employer on the one hand to keep a pen for the man engaged, and, on the other hand, of binding an employee to commence his work on or about a given date. 2. In order to organize the supply of shearing labour for pastoral requirements., definite engagements must be made in advance and prior to roll-call; until the shearers, shedhands, and wool-spressers are engaged, it is impracticable to safely engage woolclasser, expert, overseer, and other men, required. 3. If agreements are not signed before * call the experience in the past has been that at some sheds there is an over-supply, and in others an under-supply, of the labour necessary for the shearing, and that, men make unnecessary trips to stations at a great distance without being sure of obtaining work when they get there. That should be obvious to honourable members generally. If it were possible for memibers of organizations to enter into an arrangement some time before the date fixed for commencing operations, there would be less likelihood of men travelling long. distances to reach a shearing shed, only to be disappointed on arriving at their destination. In these days of labour shortage particularly, this is a.very important consideration. The. Australian Workers Union until 1918had no objection to shearers signing on in advance of shearing operations. The men were in the habit of sending in their names or of entering into arrangements either with tihe contractor or the pastoralist to shear his sheep; but since 1918 the union has objected. It has a rule that members may forward their deposits, but must not sign agreements before roll-call. Since 1918, however, the rule has been suspended during each shearing season. That is not a good thing for the industry. So long as men work in. accordance with the award relating to the industry, I cannot understand why any objection should be made to these arrangements. The present system is very unfair. Where the members of the organization have not made any contract prior to the date fixed for starting operations, the pastoralists and .cane-growers are left absolutely in the hands of a few.men. That, I am sure, is quite contrary to the wishes of the Australian Workers Union. That union has always been anxious that its members shall carry out their obligations under the award of the Court. That is all we are asking for-that the rules of the organization shall not enable it to prevent men engaging in this class of work on contracts made some time before they actually commence operations. I hope the Minister (Mr Groom) will not' object to the amendment, for he knows the difficulties of the industry, and how irresponsible men are at times able to cause a great deal of trouble, especially in the back country, roll- by flouting an award. I am sure there is no desire to support men who do that kind of thing; and, under the circumstances, my proposal is to enable the shearer and the cane-cutter to be quite sure of employment, and employers to make arrangements for the entire season. In Western Australia, under the conditions I am advocating, continuous work is provided from about March to the end of November. I can assure the Minister and honourable members that those interested in this amendment have the highest authority for saying that it is quite constitutional.",54
239,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Hunter) [9.33] I regard this amendment as quite unnecessary, and I hope it will not be accepted by the Committee. The amendment asks that during the currency of an award nothing shall be done to prevent members of an organization from entering into written agreements, in accordance with the award, at any time prior to the commencement of service. I cannot understand why, if an award has been obtained by an association, there should be any necessity for members of that association to enter into private agreements. This agreement, it seems to me, is "" loaded."" Mr RICHA BD FOSTER - I can the honourable member that it is not.'",55
240,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I think from what we have heard that it is "" loaded,"" and I shall be very careful regarding it . The honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory) alluded to the Australian Workers Union.",55
241,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,I desired to put both' sides of the question.,55
242,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Quite so; but let me say at once that I do not think there is any union that has the same numerical strength as the Australian Workers Union, and, further, that since the A r b i tration A ct came into force, no union has, so far as I know, observed awards more closely^ as proved by the fact that there has been no upheaval in the pastoral industry. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) says that nothing has been gained by arbitration, but I submit that no one can tell what has been gained in consequence of the - operation of the Act. Workers Union has lqyally abided by the awards of the Court, and, after all, they represent one of the staple industries of the Commonwealth on which we depend.",55
243,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,The men have not always done so.,55
244,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"In spite of the record of the Australian Workers Union, the honourable member says that the men of the organizations have not always abided loyally by the awards. I take it that the honourable member is alluding to the present position, ' Mr RICHA BD FOSTER - He is",55
245,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I am putting my view qf the remarks of the honourable member. There is an award at present .current, but in Queensland a State award jgave better conditions than those pro-vided by the Commonwealth award. This led to a conference between the representatives of the pastoralists and the Australian Workers Union, and, at that conference, I should say three-fourths of the pastoralists agreed to observe the better terms of the State award. There were, however, somepastoralists who declined to enter into that arrangement; and, I take it , because of their declining we are asked to accept this amendment. The cost of living has gone up considerably during the last few years, while the price of wool has practically doubled, and there ought to be no objection to the employees getting assure a better price for shearing. Surely it is not claimed that the shearers in Australia generally shall work for less than has been awarded by the Queensland Judge? The question was thoroughly threshed out at the conference to which I have referred, but whether the settlement arrived at did or did not represent a compromise, I cannot say. Now, however, because a few pastoralists, probably the most wealthy of those engaged in the industry, have decided they will not abide by the Queensland terms, this amendment is proposed. As I have said, there is at the present time a Commonwealth award which covers the Australian Workers Union, and if this amendment is accepted the small section of pastoralists who decline to pay the terms arranged at the conference will be able to enter into private agreements, on the basis of an award that gives something less to shearers than they are entitled to. To pass The Australian such legislation is to "" look for trouble "" ; if we insert a provision for the purpose of assisting certain individuals to force Australian Workers Union members in certain parts of New South Wales to themselves shear for something less than the price paid in Queensland and other parts of Australia, we shall not be going in the right direction. I sincerely hope the amendment will not be accepted, because I feel convinced that it would mean a good deal of mischief to the Commonwealth. ' I warn the Minister (Mr . Groom) that it will be to the advannot. tage of no one if this amendment is accepted, for it will enable certain pastoralists to protect themselves by the. present award, and certain unionists will regard themselves as justified in working under it .",55
246,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"Wakefield) [9.39] - I bow readily and always to the knowledge and opinions of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) in coal-mining matters, respecting which he seldom goes astray, but he is entirely on the wrong track in what he conceives to be the intention of the amendment. .",56
247,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not know the intention, but the effect of such an amendment will be what I have said.",56
248,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member is also on the wrong track as to the effect. The honourable member has referred to a new arrangement made by possibly three-fourths of the pastoralists in .the Commonwealth; but that arrangement was made under pressure, because they knew that without it - they could not get the wool off back. This amendment does not concern that arrangement at all.",56
249,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"But it will concern it. Mr RICHARD FOSTER,-For , I suppose, from twenty to thirty years it has been the custom for station-owners, both in the settled areas and wayback, to arrange with certain men to do their shearing. These men enter into agreements and sign up to go from one station to another at award rates.",56
250,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,Could not all the sheep on the holdings referred to be sheared under such agreements?,56
251,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,I was going to say that that is the Teason this amendment is moved,56
252,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,It is the reason for my opposing it.,56

255,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,Jus t what you are telling us now.,56
256,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,How do you know what I am going to tell you ?,56
257,Mr GABB,CONCILIATION AND,You have already told us something.,56
258,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"I have not told you anything, .but if the honourable member will possess his soul in patience, I shall proceed to tell him.",56
259,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,What have you been doing up to now?,56
260,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"Simply telling some 'honourable members where they are wrong. As I was saying, for many years past, station-owners in the north of South Australia, right up to the Queensland border, have been in the habit of engaging their shearers in Adelaide, under agreements, to shear first one station and then another, right through the season.' Until very recently that has been done at award rates. Recently, however, for some reason or other, the union has forbidden men to enter into such agreements, and insists that they shall sign their agreements on the stations. Let me say here, that under the arrangements which have prevailed until quite recently, station-owners were able to employ the same men year after year; and this proved of great mutual advantage. ;",56
261,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,Coul d not the same be the sheep's done without signing?,56
262,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"Why should it be done without signing? The employer is responsible for the fares of the men, and if the agreements were not signed in the city there would be no obligation on the part of the - men to sign on when they arrived at the station. I may say ""that a good many of the stationowners in South Australia get on very well with the union's principal representative, and for years there has been no trouble, the shearing going on like music until completion. Why should' the men not be allowed to do as in the past, for, as the honourable member for H.unter 'must admit, it is a sound business proposition? That is proved by the success bf the system.",56
263,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,"If Â» there were a variation of the award covering the industry, would the persons who signed the agreement get the benefit of the variation?",56
264,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Undoubtedly. They would sign on in the terms of the award or any constitutional variation of ' it. My complaint is that men were not allowed to sign on under a recognised award.  ment would not allow them to do that.,56
265,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"It would; the agreement would be subject to the award existing up to the time of the engagement, or at the time of the shearing, if honourable members would prefer that. I am dealing with the complaint which has been in existence for the last year or two, and which has been a very great grievance. The men desired to sign on. They had worked on the same stations before, and knew that the owners were splendid employers.",56
266,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND,Does the honourable member think that even if the amendment were carried the men would sign on if the organization did not wish them to do so?,57
267,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , certainly; because it would be the law and the men would be protected thereby. We are trying to get rid of industrial unrest, and this embargo in regard to signing on is one of the most unjustifiable things in connection with industrial organization.",57
268,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,"What evidence of that has the honourable member? . Mr RICHARD FOSTER - I have the evidence of both station-owners and shearers, and I was delighted when the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), at the instance of those engaged in the pastoral industry in Western Australia, submitted his amendment. On the grounds of business and common sense, the proposal should commend itself to honourable members on both sides.  port the amendment. This will apply more particularly to shearing and canecutting and other seasonal industries. In Western Australia the custom has been from time immemorial for the squatters to sign on men at centres like Perth and Geraldton. The arrangement suits both sides, because the men desire to know the station to which they are going, and the squatters desire to know the complement of shearers. The object of the amendment is not trickery, but to insure that one of Australia's greatest industries shall be allowed to progress without undue molestation and interference. embargo on the signing on of the shearers disturbs the regular course of business in the industry.",57
269,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Does not the honorexception able member see what will be the effect it?

271,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"The Court has never had a chance to amend the award in the shearing industry, but the new rates have been agreed to by three-fourths of the pastoralists.  shearing in many parts of the Commonwealth has been held up simply because a new award has not been given, and the usual custom of signing on under the existing award has not been permitted. Some protection should be provided in those .States in which the custom of signing on has been followed for so many years.",57
272,Mr LAVELLE,CONCILIATION AND,"Calare) [9.55] - I oppose the amendment. It is clear, particularly after the speech to which we have just listened, that the object of the proposal is to counter the Australian Workers Union in its efforts to obtain better conditions in the pastoral industry.",57
273,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,That is not so.,57
274,Mr LAVELLE,CONCILIATION AND,"If the amendment is carried, even in the alteredform suggested by the honourable member for Swan  effect of nullifying the agreement which The has been entered into between most of the pastoralists and the shearers - In the pastoral industry, there is one award in existence in Queensland, and another award for the rest of Australia, with the of Western Australia and Tasof mania. The latter specifies rates of pay below those contained in the agreement entered into between the pasfor toralists and the Australian Workers Union. If the amendment were agreed to, it would prevent members of the orfrom obtaining . the. rates the pastoralists have agreed to pay in every State except Queensland, where there is a separate award, and Western Australia and Tasmania, where there are local agreements, and the central and eastern portions of New South Wales. The dispute in central and eastern New South Wales is confidently expected to terminate this week by the pastoralists agreeing to pay the new rates, and conceding the forty-four-hour week. Under the award, which is in operation in that State, the working week consists of fortyeight hours; the Queensland award prescribes forty-four hours. It is very necessary that the men should be prevented from signing on prior to commencing work. As a shearer, I know the conditions prevailing in the pastoral industry, and I say that men should not sign any agreement until they have reached the shed and seen the conditions under which they will have to work. On more than one occasion, I have attended the roll-call, and been .prepared to commence shearing, except that the conditions in the huts, and the kitchen, and the cooking conveniences, were so deplorable that no men would commence work until they were rectified. If the men have signed on, they have no option but. to commence work, and sue for a breach of the award. The shearing is finished, before the Court can be moved in regard to any breaches. The only way that men can enforce their legitimate claims is by insisting upon the conditions being satisfactory before they sign an agreement. The Arbitration - Court has fixed the rates for shearing and shed labour, and the working hours, but has not fixed the price at which meat is to be supplied to shearers. Honourable members know perfectly well that if some employers can only bulldoze their employees into signing the agreement before the roll-call, they will have no chance of getting their meat at a reasonable rate. If some employers have men bound hand and foot under an agreement, they will not give them anything that they have been depriving their employees of for so long. I say, as one who has been through the mill, that the employers will do nothing for their employees but what they are forced to do. If a man has not signed the agreement, and demands meat at a reasonable rate, in 99 cases out of 100 he will get what he demands. I claim to know as much about shearing conditions as does any other member of the ComMr Lavelle. mittee, and more than dd honourable members who sit in the Ministerial corner. That is proved by the statements which some of them have made to-night in this chamber. As one who understands everything connected with the pastoral industry, I say that the amendment, and the later amendment suggested by the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse) aim deliberate blows at the Australian Workers Union. It will not be in the best interests of that organization or of the pastoral industry if this amendment is carried. I oppose it, and I feel confident that the majority of honourable members will also oppose it.",57
275,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [10.4] - I desire to make a few observations on the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). It looks very much as if this Federal Parliament, whose !duty it is to legislate within the powers it possesses under the Constitution, is being asked in this case to give a decision upon a matter that has been a subject of .contention in the Arbitration Court. In 1917 the Australian Workers Union were claimants in the Court, They asked the Judge to decideThat all shed hands shall be signed on at the advertised time of roll-call, and all vacant positions shall be ballotted for. They asked that that condition should be inserted in the award by the Court. The Court turned down the application, and would not allow that condition to be put into the award. Then the organization made a rule of their own, which, as I am informed, is contained in the 1918 issue, to this effectMembers may forward deposits for pens, but shall not sign agreement prior to rollcall. Members employed in the pastoral industry must sign the award agreement before commencing work at any shed, a duplicate of which they must retain in their possession. Members failing to comply with this rule shall be fined Â£2. That is a rule which they agreed to amongst themselves, - binding the members of their organization. Organizations have perfect liberty under the law to make rules and regulations to control their affairs. An application was made on behalf of the pastoralists for the cancellation of the registration of the Australian Workers Union as an industrial organization. The pastoralists did not really desire the deregistration of the union, but they were anxious that the Judge of the Arbitration Court should order this rule, which they regarded as objectionable, to be struck out of the rules of the organization, or that otherwise the organization should be deregistered. The application was to deregister, so as to compel the organization that made the Tule to repeal it. The Judge refused that application on the ground that the rule was not contrary to law or to the requirements of the Act. That was an industrial dispute between two organizations to decide whether or not a particular thing should be done..",58
276,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"The Judge said to the organization, "" I will not give you what you ask."" And the organization then said, "" We will take it . """,59
277,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes ; but they took it in accordance with the powers they possessed under the law. They did nothing illegal in passing the rule objected to. This appears to have been an industrial dispute between two organizations, and now it seems to me that this Parliament is being appealed to to give a decision in this case. I have tried to look at the matter fairly, and from a non-party point of view. An appeal is made to this Parliament to do something which a Judge of the Arbitration Court refused to entertain. I say that this Parliament should not be made a Court of Appeal from an industrial tribunal.",59
278,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,And we ought not to amend the law?,59
279,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Thoug h we are doing it all the time.,59
280,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"We are being asked to do something which, notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, it is doubtful we possess the power to do. We have the power to pass laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of a State. But we have not the power in this Parliament, by direct legislation, to settle disputes.",59
281,Mr RODGERS,CONCILIATION AND,O r even to inquire into them. [167],59
282,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,O r even to inquire into them. That is the difficulty I see in connection with the amendment.,59
283,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,But we have power to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.,59
284,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"We have; but only within our powers under the Constitution. We have not the power, by an amendment of the Act,- to settle a dispute.",59
285,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Will the Minister say that Parliament could not do something to provide for a common-sense business agreement?,59
286,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"So long as we direct our attention to conciliation and arbitration, we are within our powers. We can constitute Courts for that purpose.",59
287,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,We have not the power to deal fairly with both sides.,59
288,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , we have, by setting up a tribunal for the purpose. It is the function and duty of the Arbitration Court to settle a dispute; but that is not the function of this Parliament. If honourable members desire that we should have the power of regulation in industrial matters, they must bring about an amendment of the Constitution.",59
289,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable gentleman does not contend that we have not the constitutional power to do what I ask?,59
290,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"I say that it is a matter of grave doubt whether we have that power. The honourable member must realise that the matter with which he desires to deal has been the subject of an industrial dispute in the Arbitration Court. He should know that, the Judge of the Court refused to insert in his award the condition to which I have referred, because he did not think it right to do so, and also refused to de-register the organization. That was distinctly f OT the whether Court to decide.",59
291,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) must have known that when he was speaking, and suppressed it .",59
292,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"I am sure the honourable member for Dampier did not know anything of the sort. From what I know of him, that would not be in accord with his methods or tactics. I listened to him carefully, and I am sure that he put hit case fairly. - Mr Ryan - Then he put it without a full Knowledge of the facts.",59
293,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member may not have known all the facts. I suggest to the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) that in this chamber we shall, get on very much better if we do. not impute motives to each other. - This appears to have been an industrial dispute in the Court, and the Court is the proper authority to decide it . We cannot do by legislation indirectly what we have not the power to do by a direct Act of this Parliament. That is the legal difficulty, which arises in connection with the amendment, and about which doubts have been expressed, and I therefore ask the honourable member for Dampier not to press it .",60
294,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"Then the honParliament. orable gentleman contends that, under the Constitution, this Parliament has nothing to do with what an industrial organizai tion does.",60
295,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"The honourable member must not put the matter in that way. I say that where it is a matter dustrial dispute which comes within the cognisance and the authority of a Judge of the Arbitration Court to decide, this Parliament should not be appealed to to make the decision. It is the intention the Constitution to give this Parliament the power to pass laws to enable such a matter to be the subject of conciliation and arbitration, and not to give us the power to give a decision which should given by a conciliation tribunal. Mr RICHARD FOSTER I hope that Minister will look into the matter full y , because a very important question is involved.",60
296,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"I shall look, into it carefully. Much that the honourable member for Dampier said appealed to me. I wai impressed by his suggestion that there should be as much freedom as possible given to men to take up employment so long as they do not violate an award. The shearing industry is a very important one, and as shearing is carried on in different places, it is very desirable that it should be possible to organize the labour available so as to secure the best results. But a consideration of the merits of any industrial matter in dispute between organizations is not a duty for this Parliament to undertake. In the circumstances, I ask' the honourable member not to press his amendment, as it seems to me that it is doubtful whether we have the power to 1 give it effect. The question has been looked into carefully by the law officers of the Commonwealth, but I give honourable members the assurance that I shall have it further considered.",60
297,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"Wakefield) [10.15] - I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Gro'om). I do not want to place my opinion against that of the Minister on constitutional questions, but it is absolutely inconceivable that a practical piece of common sense business which has been proceeding for the past twenty or thirty years or more should be outside the province of this If the Minister's statement is correct the sooner the Constitution is amended, if that is necessary, the better t will be, because it is simply an outrage.",60
298,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,We have no power to pass direct legislation on labour matters throughout the Commonwealth. We canof an in - not pass a common rule.,60
299,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Do I understand that the President of the Arbitration Court refused their request?,60
300,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , because they were of there on a question of conciliation and arbitration.. It is left to his discretion.",60
301,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,It is assumed that the President looked upon be it as unreason able and would not sanction 1 it.,60
302,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND,The honourable member's Â» the point is that if the Court has power this careParliament ought to have the power.,60
303,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,Yes .,60
304,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND,But it has not.,60
305,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"This is not a party question, and I am contending for a principle that is as much in the interests of the shearers as it is in the interests of the employers. It is based on ordinary business methods, arid if we are going to submit to another principle that is likelv to be a further impediment to industrial operations in this country it is time, in the public interest, that it was rectified.",60
306,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Will the honourable member explain how this amendment affects t h "" ivrint he is dealing with? .,, Mr RICHARD FOSTER - It provides that the shearers shall sign an ment and secure' continuous work, and that is what they have been doing for twenty years.",60
307,Mr IJAVELLE,CONCILIATION AND,It means that* they will be bound hand and foot before they go to a shed.,61
308,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONCILIATION AND,"Nothin g of the kind. I am merely repeating what the shearers have told me. They do not want to bo handed over to the tender mercies of some individuals at the sheds. The practice has been in vogue for twenty or thirty years, during which time the Australian Workers Union has grown' to the biggest thing of its kind in any part of the world. I am desirous of dispensing with that which is responsible for most of the industrial unrest in Australia, and I ask the Minister to allow this clause to be .postponed to enable honourable members to ascertain whether his statement as to the power of this Parliament' is correct or not. .. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. MEN OF THE ROYAI. AUSTRALIAN NAVAL BRIGADE. Motion (by Sir JOSEPH COOK) proposed. That the House do now adjourn. - Mr MAKIN (Hindmarsh) [10.21]- I desire to utter a word of protest concerning the. treatment meted out to some of the cx-membcrs of the Royal Australian JfavHl Brigade, "" M "" class, who were disbanded on the eve of the visit of the Prince of Wales to Adelaide. I have endeavoured to find an opportune time to bring this matter before the House, and I thought I would have an opportunity on grievance-day, but there was insufficient time. The, men.who were recently disbanded rendered valuable service to Australia as members of the Royal Australian Naval 'Brigade. Some had served from ten to thirty-three years, and notwithstanding this, were notified-by circular from the Navy Office that the force was being disbanded, and that they were to report themselves on-29th July to receive one year's retaining fee and their discharge. ri671- 2 I understand that no word of appreciaagree- tion of their work has come from the Navy Office, aud that the district naval officer was not in attendance when themen were disbanded. Whilst an apology was tendered on behalf of the district naval officer for his absence, there has been a lack of recognition of the valuable services rendered. They were ealled up in 1914 by proclamation, and performed very valuable work in guarding wireless stations, on various merchantmen, and on enemy vessels lying in our ports. They were subjected to many disabilities, and had to work excessively long hours, for which they received very little or nd recognition in the way of extra pay. I have in my possession a'statement which shows that on many occasions' they were required to work many more than eight hours/and that some of them were not in receipt' of more th.an an able seamen's pay of 5s. per day. The claim these men make that they should come under the provisions of the war-time measures that have been passed by this - House in recognition of services rendered is worthy of consideration. A .number of the men were .drafted overseas, and, of course, there were others in the same brigade who were compelled to remain in-Australia, although'they desired to ""go abroad. Naturally, they feel that they have as good a claim for consideration by the Government as some of those who rendered service abroad by taking work on transports, and who are allowed to participate in the benefits provided under the Repatriation Act, War Service Homes Act, War Gratuity. Act, and other measures. Some of the men wereemployed in isolated places such as Neptune Island and Oape St. Albans for months st a.time, and mauy of them were compelled Io give up permanent employment, which they could not regain on being disbanded. Honourable members will recognise that in consequence of the service they were compelled to render they had to make sacrifices in regard to seniority and in .oihpx ways. I trust the Government will give favourable consideration- - to my request, and see that the men will be able to receive benefits under the measures ' that have been passed to assist soldiers. There are-many details which.I could bring before the House, but in consideration for honourable members and the hours .they are required to sit, I shall content myself by eaying that there is every justification for giving the case of these men further consideration. I trust the Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) - will investigate the claims of men _ who have rendered such valuable service, not only during the war, but in times of peace, and who, on the outbreak of hostilities, were subject to compulsory service by proclamation. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.28 p.m.",61
