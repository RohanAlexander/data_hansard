If the statement is correct, what is the purpose of the visit, and will the outlay in connection with it be considered a war expenditure?",22
9,Mr GROOM,TO AUSTRALI A,"I have not seen the' statement to which the honourable member refers, but.T do not think any man would receive a more cordial welcome to Australia than would General Birdwood. in WAR LOANANDSHIPBUYING .",22
10,Mr BOYD,TO AUSTRALI A,"In view of the intention to of the Government, as announced in the press today, to float a loan of £25,000,000 for war purposes, I desire to ask the Minister in charge of the House whether he can give us an assurance that the Government is not going to speculate in the purchase of ships abroad without first consulting Parliament.",22
11,Mr GROOM,TO AUSTRALI A,In view of the promised statemeut on the subject. I would ask the honourable member' to postpone his question. ' SOLDIERS AND LANDLORDS.,22
12,Dr MALONEY,TO AUSTRALI A,"I desire to ask the Minister in charge of the House a question in regard to the treatment of a returned soldier. By way of explanation, for I may be permitted to state that the soldier in question received a pension for two years, but throughout his life will have to wear an iron frame for his leg. When his pension was stopped he endeavoured to work, but broke down. He is the father of six children, one of whom died last week. He has just received the following notice from an agent:Dear Sir,-As you have made no effort tq vacate the premises now in your occupation, or reduce. arrears of rent owing, we are handing warrant of ejectment to the police for execution.. To obviate the unpleasant proceeding of having your furniture put into the street, we would suggest you get some friends to take charge of same at the very earliest.

Mr GROOM - The proposal has not come before my Department, but I will have inquiries made to ascertain at what stage it stands. Naturally, if it can be done, we shall certainly, utilize tralian stone. * COPPER INDUSTRY .",23
15,Mr HIGGS,TO AUSTRALI A,Will the Minister charge of the House state what is the sent position with regard industry ?,23
16,Mr GROOM,TO AUSTRALI A,"I replied to a question ou this subject last week, when I stated that I had presided at a conference which had been held with the State Ministers of Mines. The whole question was cussed for two or three days, but u n opportunity has been given Ministers to whose responsibility it is. confer with their respective Governments, it is not possible to make a statement regard to it . WAR MEDALS AND RIBANDS.",23
17,Mr BURCHELL,TO AUSTRALI A,"Will the Assistant Minister for Defence state whether the Government are prepared to remove the present restriction against returned soldiers wearing the colours of the Allied and British war medals?

18,Mr WISE,TO AUSTRALI A,"The honourable member . was good enough to intimate to me that he intended to ask this question, and I have been furnished with the followiner reply:As soon as information is received from the War Office that the British Government have determined the question of medals and ribands to be worn, permission to wear the ribands will be given to soldiers. The information which has already appeared in the press cannot be accepted as authentic. When the matter is decided, the Department will be notified by cable, and instructions will immediately be issued authorizing the wearing of the riband or ribands which may be approved, and issues will be made as soon as they are available.

20,Mr GROOM,TO AUSTRALI A,"Speaking from memory, I believe that the Acting Prime Minister has already replied to the honourable member's question, pointing out . that, so far as the Wheat Pools in the disStates are concerned, their management t i l an is a matter for the State Governments, In the circumstances, it would not be fitting for with the Commonwealth Government to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into their activities. PROFITEERIN G.",23
21,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TO AUSTRALI A,"I ask the Minister in charge of the House whether he has noticed in the cables that in 1 France the profiteers have been obliged to reduce their prices on many commodities by 25 per cent., and in Italy profiteers have been obliged to reduce prices by 50 per cent. Will the Minister say when the people of the Commonwealth may expect similar' action to be taken here?",23
22,Mr GROOM,TO AUSTRALI A,"The question is somewhat complicated for au off-hand answer, but the honourable member must know that in Italy and in France the Governments have complete control of all the agencies of trade-and commerce. The Government of the Commonwealth, under our Constitution, do not possess that complete control.",24
23,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TO AUSTRALI A,"""When are Government going to take action; that is what I want to know ? Mr "" GROOM -- I am sure that the honourable member is well aware that it is impossible for us to take action in many directions owing to the form of our Constitution.",24
24,Mr TUDOR,TO AUSTRALI A,Excep t under the Commercial Activities Bill .,24
25,Mr GROQM,TO AUSTRALI A,"No, not even under that Bill . I am afraid if I dealt with that further I should be anticipating the discussion of a measure on the business paper. The question of dealing with profiteering within the extent of our powers is the subject of inquiry by Government.",24
26,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TO AUSTRALI A,"Is the Minister aware that profiteering has arrived at such a stage in the Comof monwealth today that, not only have people a difficulty in living, but' it is dangerous business to die, as undertakers in the capital cities are charging working people, and poor folk generally, as much as £ 2 5 for the plainest of plain coffins That is the worse kind of profiteering.",24

28,Mr HIGGS,TO AUSTRALI A,"I ask the Acting torney-General whether it is true the Chief Justice of the High Court' is about to retire, and whetlier the Government have under consideration appointment of his successor ?

32,Mr RODGERS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"^-It is now the practice that in all cases of illness of returned ""men, whether as 'the * result of the war injuries or illness, the Commonwealth defrays the whole of the expense of restoring them to health, whether in Commonwealth hospitals or after their discharge elsewhere upon any recurrence their illness. I ask the Assistant M in ister for Defence whether the Governa ment will make this practice'retrospective so that it may apply to many returned soldiers who,- before the present arrangement was made, spent every shilling they ? had, even of deferred pay, in trying to get back to health, and to whom th.° Government declined to make a refund of expenses so incurred on the ground that the payment of such expense by thr Commonwealth was not authorized at that stage.",24

34,Mr MATHEWS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,I ask the Minister the for Trade and Customs if he can inform Do the the House as to when the Government intend to carry into effect the award increasing for the of Justices at Commonwealth 1,24
35,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I should like the honourable member to give notice of his question for tomorrow, but I may 6ay that my impression is that the award of the Arbitration Court has already been given the consideration which it deserves, and the men referred to are getting the extra wages proposed by the award. WHEAT POOL. ADVANCES TO FARMERS.",24
36,Mr GREGORY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"In view of the recent large sales of wheat, will the Government advance to the farmers at least the - amount which has been guaranteed them?",25
37,Mr GROOM,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I am not in a position to give the honourable member an im mediate reply, but I shall inquire into the matter, and let him know how it stands.",25
38,Mr FENTON,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether it is true that the Government intend to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the whole of the facts in connection with the manufacture of sheep dip in Australia, and its importation from abroad ?",25
39,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,No . The matter has not had consideration. RELIEF OF DISTRESS.,25
40,Mr WATKINS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"In regard to the money that is being allotted for ""the relief of distress in , the various capitals and other places, is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that only £250 has been spent on the relief of distress at Newcastle and Maitland, whereas thousands of pounds have been spent in other places?

42,Mr SINCLAIR,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"H as the Leader of the House any official information as to when the declaration of peace will be made ? As the liberty of quite a number of Australian people is dependent upon it , will he communicate with the authorities to have the declaration expedited as much as possible? . Mr GROOM - The matter depends, to a great extent, on the Imperial authorities. We are keeping in touch with them so as to ascertain, as early as possible, the date fixed for the issue of the necessary proclamation. WAR PENSIONS. MOTHERS OF EX - NUPTI AL SONS.",25
43,Mr JOWETT,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer if the Government are in a position to make a definite statement to the effect that the mothers of soldiers killed in the war who were born ex-nuptial will be placed in exactly the same position as regards pensions as are the mothers of soldiers born in wedlock who were killed in the war ?,25
44,Mr GROOM,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"In the unavoidable abSHEEP DIP . sence of .the Treasurer I ask the honourable member to put his question on the notice-paper for tomorrow, when an answer will be supplied.",25
45,Dr MALONEY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I wish to ask the Assistant Minister for Defence a question, without notice, with reference to a case mentioned in the Herald of last evening. It is stated that a mother of an exnuptial.son was fined £ 5 4 for drawing a pension illegally, though her son was killed at the Front. I call attention to the matter as one who has appeared on recruiting platforms,' with others, and made promises as to what would be done for the parents of our soldiers. I ask the Minister whether he has noticed the statement made in connection with this case, that the mother of an ex-nuptial son had to borrow money from her master to pay the £ 5 4 she was called upon to refund ? If this is the faul t of any official of the Department, will the Minister see that he is punished for the cruelty he in flicted ?",25
46,Mr WISE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I have not heard of the ease referred to, but I shall make in quiries. ""FAKED"" BUTTER.  Minister for Trade and Customs been drawn to a paragraph in the Argus of today about an attempt made in South Australia to export some "" f a k e d "" butter? According to the newspaper, the Customs held up this butter; and I should like to know whether the Minister can inform the House what action his Department intends to take in regard to the firm concerned?",25
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I have not seen the paragraph referred to, but some little time ago similar circumstances were brought under my notice, and it is no doubt to these the honourable .member refers. In that case the State Government have taken action for breach of the State law, and proceedings are pending by the Commonwealth in respect of the same firm. GOVERNMENT INSURANCE ' LEGISLATION.",26
48,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,H as the Acting Attorney-General noticed in this morning's newspapers the reported of the Tasmanian Government regarding Government insurance legislation; and can the honourable gentleman tell us when we may expect similar action on the part of the Commonwealth Government?,26
49,Mr GROOM,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I have not seen' the paragraph referred to, and I ' am. not in a political prisoners, includiug position at present to make any definite announcement in regard to Commonwealth insurance legislation. POSTAL DELAYS.",26
50,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"In view of the sidered fact that it.has taken the postal authorisoners. ties twelve months to deliver a letter dressed to me- a letter which, though properly addressed, was received by Parliamentary Library through the Dead Letter Office-and in view of a probable change in my address very shortly, should like to know from the Postmasterof General whether he will see that my correspondence is properly delivered in the future?",26
51,Mr WEBSTER,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,I do not happen to be the postman concerned; but I shall enister - deavour to see that the honourable ber's letters are properly delivered i - future. MAIL CONTRACTORS. EOEAGB ALLOWANCE .,26
52,Mr BLAKELEY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Application s from mail contractors for a forage allowance, in view of the prevailing drought conditions, have been forwarded by me and other honourable members of the House to the Postmaster-General; and I should like to know whether that honourable gentleman will expedite the consideration of these applications, so that the contractors concerned may know exactly where they stand ? It is six months since I sent in applications to the Department.",26
53,Mr WEBSTER,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I have yet to reply to a question which, I think, the honourable member asked me last week.",26
54,Mr BLAKELEY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"That was in reference to mounted mailmen, not mail contractors.",26
55,Mr WEBSTER,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Mai l contractors were involved in that question, and I shall reply to the honourable member 'at the action earliest opportunity. RELEAS E OF "" POLITICA L PRISONERS.""",26
56,Dr MALONEY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I desire to ask the Acting Attorney-General whether, in view of the declaration of Peace,, the Cabinet will consider the freeing of all Messrs. Long, Seminoff, and Freeman ? Further, if the Cabinet do not agree to that suggestion, will the Australiari-born political prisoners be liberated ? ",26
57,Mr GROOM,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"The men to whom the honourable member refers are not conto be in any sense political p r i As regards Mr Long, there , has adalready been a reduction in his case on account of the Peace, and furthe r reprethe sentations on his behalf are being considered. As to Freeman, he is not regarded as a political prisoner at all. I I ask the honourable member to give notice the second part of his question. SCARCITYOF COAL. BUNKERING OF WARSHIPS.",26
58,Mr MATHEWS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Is the Acting M in for the Navy aware that, while there memare over 30,000 people out of work in n the Melbourne owing to the scarcity of coal, 500 tons are feeing placed on men-of-war today in order to send those vessels to Sydney? Why not allow the vessels to remain in Melbourne, and use the coal for industrial purposes?  what has been done, but I shall make inquiries,- and inform the honourable member later on. CUSTOMS PROSECUTION:. HONEY.",26
59,Mr TUDOR,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Is it correct that' a quantity of honey, which was the subject of a case before the Courts, and, by the decision, was forfeited to the Crown, has been handed back to the firm who endeavoured to illegally export it?",27
60,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"There was a case of the kind some time ago, and, no doubt, it is to that the honourable member refers. The guilty parties were fined, and the penalty carried with it the forfeiture of the goods, subject, of course, to Ministerial approval. I went into the case very thoroughly, and found that, after com plying with' the conditions imposed by the Customs, the gentleman who endeavoured to export the honey illegally had been mulcted in a. sum of about £2,000.",27
61,Mr TUDOR,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"If he had got his honey away he would have made about £10,000.",27
62,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I am speaking of what the case cost him. Under those conditions, it was considered that what he had suffered was a sufficient penalty, and the forfeiture of the honey was not insisted on. ARREST OE POSTAL EMPLOYEE - vance DEPARTMENTAL PUNISHMENT.",27
63,Mr BRENNAN,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Has the attention of the Postmaster-General been directed to the case of a very mild-mannered man named Linden, who, I am informed on good authority, was yesterday endeavourthere ing to get home to his wife and family quirements. from the centre of a very turbulent scene in one of the streets of Melbourne, when, without cause, he was arrested, brought before azealous justice of the peace, and fined £6 for resisting the police and obscene language? Has this case cOme under the notice of the Postmaster General departmentally, and, if so, or when it does, will he see that there is full inquiry before this man is subjected to departmental punishment in addition to a punishment which, I suggest, has already been wrongfully inflicted on him?",27
64,Mr WEBSTER,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I did' read in the press this morning a statement similar to that mentioned by the honourable member, and I assure him that, - while I am in charge of the Department, any officer against whom a charge may be levelled will receive justice. SOLDIERS' OVERCOATS. . Mr FINLAYSON - In view of the statement made in the House last week that returned soldiers would be allowed to retain their overcoats, and in view of the fact that a. soldier who applied to Victoria Barracks, in Brisbane, as per letter in the Daily Standard of 16th July, was informedthat the issue of greatcoats was not applicable to demobilized soldiers, will the Assistant Minister for Defence issue such instructions as will leave no further doubt that the issue does extend to deihobilized soldiers?",27
65,Mr WISE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,I shall see that that is done. PRICE OF BUTTER.,27
66,Mr MACKAY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs inform the House of the reason for the recent rise in the price of butter in New South Wales, at a period when the producers in all the States are equally deserving .of an adowing to the result of drought conditions ?",27
67,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"The reason why the "" price was advanced in New South Wales was that it was necessary to take a certain quantity of butter out of the winter pool, whereas in other States is a surplus of production over reFEDERAL TERRITORY. SETTLEMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS.",27
68,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,Will the using Minister for Home and Territories inform the House of what progress has been made towards the fulfilment of his promise to settle some returned soldiers in the Federal Territory?,27
69,Mr GLYNN,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I think the latest step taken ""in that direction was the visit of the secretary of the Repatriation Department to the Federal Territory, in company with Mr Goodwin. I have had an oral conference with one of those officers, but I have not yet received their fina l report. UNEMPLOYE D SOLDIERS.",28
70,Mr FENTON,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"H as the Minister presenting the Minister for Repatriation read the statement made by Sergeant MCKenzie at the conference of returned, soldiers in Adelaide, that there are S,000 soldiers in the Commonwealth out of employment? Will the Minister make in quiries regarding the correctness of that statement, and in for m the House of what stops are being taken to absorb those and other men who are unemployed?  statement referred to. A little time ago a statement was published that the number of returned soldiers who had applied for work, and had not yet been placed in employment, numbered 7,000; but they represented a very small percentage of the total number of soldiers who had been repatriated. Everything possible is being done to place those men in suitable employment.",28
71,Mr FENTON,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Does that mean the displacing of otlier good men, in order to find employment for the soldiers?  that course makes the work of finding employment more difficult. RELIEF FOR SAILOR'S DEPENDANTS.",28
72,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I ask the Minis- or ter in charge of the House whether any action has been taken to relieve the distress of the wif e of a sailor who had been employed in mine sweeping in the No r t h Sea, and whose case I referred to on Thursday last?",28
73,Mr GROOM,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"The letter which the honourable member gave to me was passed on to the Assistant Minister for Defence, who next morning communicated with the honourable member, with a view to getting the address of the lady/ I understand that, in the meantime, further in quiries are being made by the Department. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). SEAMEN'S STRIKE.",28
74,Mr SPEAKER,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED," The honourable member for Franklin has notified me of his re- intention to move the adjournment of the House, in order to call attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The present position of the producing, industrial, and commercial interests and of the social l if e of Australia and Tasmania caused by. the existing strike of the Seamen's U n i o n . "" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",28
75,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Franklin) [3.39]. - I make no apology. for asking the House to consider the serious position which has been caused by the existing strike. I hold that it is the duty of this - House to deal with these problems, and, no matter- .what happens outside, or what action may be taken iby others, this'Parliament can only hold itself and the M in istry responsible for the good government of the country. Whilst the executive of the Seamen's Union are primaril y responsible for the _ position today; for the state of affairs that has existed during the last eight weeks, for the conduct of affairs during the last eight weeks honourable members, and especially those sitting behind Ministers, must take the full responsibility. The majorit y here must either condone the administration of the Government during the present crisis, take the responsibility of discussing it , and even condemning it. The only way in which a matter of this kind can be determined is by permitting free and open discussion in the House. The people of Australia will condone any honest effort which is made, even mistakes in policy, errors of judgment, or blunders in administration, but it will neither forgive nor forget inaction, or callousness, or a surrender of the rights of this House and the Democracy of Australia to any party outside, to any class, creed, or faction, Capitalist or Labour union. But for the last eight weeks the National Government and the National Parliament of Australia have not been governing the trade and commerce of this continent. On the contrary, the Seamen's Union have succeeded in doing what the German submarines failed to do. have practically driven the coastal shipping of Australia off the seas.",28
76,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,And the ship-owners are going bankrupt.,29
77,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"The honourable member nged not worry about the shipowners. They are being paid all right. The Seamen's Union's executive have deliberately challenged the rights of the people. Tbey said that they would control the trade and commerce of Australia, and, so far, they have succeeded in doing so. The camouflage and pious aspirations uttered by the present Leader of the House (Mr Groom) carry us nowhere unless it be to just where we have stood for the past eight weeks. Meanwhile, because .of this strike, tens of thousands of people in Australia are out of employment, and many are short of the bare necessities of life. While there are millions of tons of coal in New South Wales, factories are closed all over Australia owing to a lack of fuel, and thousands of the poorer people are shivering in their homes during this winter because they have hot the fuel with which to warm them. Sugar, of which there should be a splendid supply in Australia, is being rationed out in the greater portion of the continent, and factories, whose main requirement it is, are clossd, throwing thousands and thousands of persons out of employment. Large quantities of f r u it are rotting in Tasmanian orchards, while the people of New South Wales and Queensland are short of fruits which grow in a temperate climate. Thousands of feet of timber are lyin<; on the Tasmanian wharfs, while saw-mills there are closed down, and men are thrown out of employment. What a satire it is on our system of government that all these things should occur, despite the fact that every man and every woman in this community is entitled 'to exercise the franchise !",29
78,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,How capable are our captains of industry !,29
79,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"If by ""captains of industry "" the honourable member means "" rulers of industry,"" I can. tell him that they are associated with him today. It was the duty of the GovernThey ment to man the ships in order to prevent this paralysis of the trade and commerce of Australia. Similar strikes have occurred before. In 1916 the then M i nister for the Navy (Mr Jensen), a Minister in a Labour Government, stopped an exactly similar strike in two hours. When the seamen and firemen were called off a transport by the executive of their union, the Minister gave them two hours to find a crew, and when they refused to do so, he manned the .vessel with naval reservists. His prompt action prevented a strike; but if he had done as has been done in the present crisis, the situation would probably have been just what faces us today. On the 14th June last the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) was offered from Tasmania a full crew if he would let the people of that State have a steamer. That telegram was repeated a week later. They were both urgent messages, but no reply has been . received to the representations made in them.",29
80,Dr MALONEY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Who is to blame for . that, the Government or Admira l Clarkson ?",29
81,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I sent a telegram to the Acting Prime Minister, but, receiving no reply, I repeated my wire a week later, saying, "" On the 14th I wired you as .follows . . . Please reoly for meeting to-night."" On the following day I received a wire to this effectKumala loading 50,000 cases at Hobart. I knew all about thisCoolnha, with a carrying capacity of 2,750 tons dead weight, we hope will lift fruit in three weeks. That is all the answer I have received up to date. On the occasion of the last strike we sent a crew from Tasmania to Sydney, manned the Yarra, and brought her down to Hobart. We offered to do the same again. The offer has made repeatedly. Since I left Tasmania the Government have been assured if they would let the people of Tasmania have a steamer a crew would be found the remedy is ? for it . - Mr MCWILLIAMS - I would have Mr Considine!-Does the honourable member suggest that the Government not wish to end the strike?",29

The ship-owners have hot a single voic© in what they pay their men, or in the freights, conditions, or running charges of those boats. Therefore, whatever the conditions are, ,the struggle today is between the Government of the Commonwealth and the strikers. The Government, so far as I can see, is sitting down been to see who can take the most punishment - the strikers on the one side, or the that ' public on the other. .

I was on the Yarra Bank on Sun- ' day. I think it is often a good thing for a public man to hear both sides of a ques t i o n ; but what struck me most there was a very eloquent attack on Mr Justice Higgins. One speaker asked, "" What chance have the seamen got from a fifty quid a week Judge? "" I could not help thinking of what a great, cynic once said - "" Hosanna yesterday; crucify him today ""-the palm leaf and the roses yesterday, the cross today. Mr Justice Higgins was at one time the idol, of men of whom the speaker I heard on Sunday was - the sentative. So long as the verdict ,of the Court went in their favour all was perfectly right. On Sunday, from practically every stand we went to, we heard the Arbitration Court condemned. It was said that the Court was "" done,'' and that no unionist should go to it . I believe the Arbitration Court has done more for the workers of Australia than has ever been done by all the other united actions on the part of the people of Australia put together.",30

I agree with those who favour the abolition of the Arbitration Court if its verdict is not to be accepted when it goes against those who appeal to it . that is not arbitration. If arbitration is to be maintained-and the Court is on its trial now-ther e must be a distinct understanding that when people go to the Court to have their claims arbitrated upon, they will loyally and honestlv accept the verdict, whether it is for or against them, and whether it is partial or complete.",31

If the Government is not prepared to take the necessary action, then the members of this Parliament, and especially those on this side of the House, must take the responsibility of their inaction, or of what they do.

100,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I would put a few strong men in the Government. I would immediately reconstruct the Shipping Board, since, as long as it consists solely of managers of shipping companies, it will never command the respect of the seamen or public of Australia. I would improve the men's accommodation on ship board, and proceed at once to man the ships. The workers who are out of employment, the business men who are being ruined, and the producers who, in some of the States, are especially suffering, will no longer tolerate the indifference and callousness that have been shown during the last few weeks.",31
101,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Wakefield) [ 4 . 1 ] - I was very glad to hear the statement, brief though it was, made by - the Acting Leader of the House (M f . 'Groom), to the effect that 'the . Government are hopeful that a satisfactory solution of the seamen's strike is near at hand. I intervene in this debate only because of the outlook In the State of which I am a representative, and with the conditions of which I am.most familiar. I fear that the almost entire silence of the Government and the National Parliament from the beginning of the dispute may be misconstrued by the people. Having regard to the occurrences of the last few days, it is only right that the people should hear in no uncertain way how the National Parliament regard the situation. The present strike is serious and reaching in its disastrous effects on phase of commercial and industrial life, and embraces every home in the land within the sweep of its destruction misery. It is absolutely and wickedly - unjustifiable while an open Arbitration Court is available to consider and adjust any tangible grievance. That Court was practically created at the instance of Labour Government. It has done much .for the seamen of Australia to date, and is prepared today to hear their further grievances. The principle of arbitration is part of the declared policy of Labour, and appears at this very moment on its platform. I consider, with the Minister, that there is hope even at this, the eleventh hour, because I believe that the great body of Labour in Australia will vigorously nounce the few wild irresponsibles who have led the seamen into this awful impasse. It is inconceivable that Government should submit to this flagrant rebellious defiance of constitutional rity, which is paraded with impunity under the very shadow' of the National Parliament. It is not a strike in the nary way. It is striking at the very vitals of our national existence, at the very heart of this Democracy, which French delegation said, on returning Paris, was the finest expression of true Democracy to be found in any part of - world. This strike is anything but demomeans cratic. It aims at the destruction of the - very temple that Labour, after thirty Afr. Hicliard. Foster. years of struggling, has set up, and I do not believe that Labour as a whole approves the way in which the seamen are being led. , Mr MATHEWS - Fanc y their being judged by the honourable member!",31
102,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I ask the honourable member's close attention to this matter, because it is most serious, and all Australia is looking on. This is au ill-conceived first instalment of direct action, and is not a strike in the ordinary sense of the term. It is a specimen of that Bolshevism which has devastated Russia, and has left a slimy,' damnable trail of despotism far worse than farthe most brutal despotism Czardom ever every knew. Will not the Government give the people of Australia a chance to throttle this hideous monster at its birth? I want and to know if government is supreme today? That is a pertinent question to ask. I want to know' if the dignity and power of the law are not equal to the suppression of this concealed disloyalty a in our midst? The great body of Labour has no time for this business. The people of Australia are watching the men on the Labour side who have any expression to offer in favour of the way in which everything in Australia is being held up today by a few rebels. It is a revolution, and nothing short of a revolution, that is taking place. It is gratifying to find today that there are a few conspicuous prominent leaders deof Labour who are prepared, in connection with this trouble, to call things by their right names. I desire particularly to the refer to the fine courageous statement by the President of the Trades and Labour authoCouncil in South Australia- a statement that, on the face of it, is marked with honesty of purpose-and to express my ordiadmiration of the courage that enables him at this time of turmoil to seek to lead the masses in the right direction. It is the to be deplored that there are not more to leaders of Labour in Australia like Mr. Birrell, who has the courage to say what the he knows is right, and to seek by every in his power to stem the tide of this rebellious leadership that would lead the community to destruction. It is a pity therearenot more Labour leaders following in the wake of Mr Birrell , and I certainly regret that we have not had in this House a statement by the Leader of the great Australian Labour party (Mr Tudor). We ought to be told how he views an action that is responsible for bringing wretchedness and misery to thousands of homes in every part of this continent. We have, day by day, hundreds of trams in the streets of Adelaide remaining idle from 9.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. The position of those who reside in the metropolis, ever, is not as bad as that of others. the metropolitan area, our people can get from their business places, to their by some means or other. But what is be said of the position of the wayback people in South Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland? What is to be said of these people, whose provisions have to be carried by rail, at enormous freightage, because there is no means of obtaining sea-borne goods. We are threatened with the possithough bility, in a very short time, of even present available transport being cut off altogether-and all this at the instigation of a few Yarra-bank rebels. I feel satisfied today that good will come out of this evil ; that Labour in Australia will be purged of these rebels, these disloyalists, these men for whom Australia ought not to have a place. I appreciate the difficulties that confront the Government. Their position is not an enviable one; but, i my opinion, they have delayed too long. The responsibility rests with them; but I are now passing. believe that, at this very moment, there is hope of saner counsels prevailing. they do prevail, every one in this munity will thank God for the possipress bility of industrial peace. If they not-if the seamen will not man the ships-the n the Government must man them, to take coal and provisions to every State in the Commonwealth. believe that the heart of the people is sound. There has been a lot of talk about rebellious soldiers. I believe that every maining silent. honest "" d i g g e r "" who has made good sound, and that, just as he made his name and the name of Australia famous by his loyalty and devotion on the battle-field, so he will be equally conspicuous in uphold-;: ing the laws and institutions of Australia,, where the freedom, of the people is equal; to, if not better than, that enjoyed in any other part of the world. I am not here to make inflammatory statements as to how the work should he ' done; but the people must be fed, and if the Government will do the right thing, then from every part of Australia there will be forthcoming men to uphold the right and to deliver us from the damnable how- - disloyalists that are growing all too In numerous in this country.",32

I think it is a. pity that a> debate of this character should be confined to honourable members on one side of the House, even there should be such an evident the desire on the part of a number of counter-revolutionaries, lik e the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr K e l l y ) , to have a word to say in it . I sympathize with a good deal that has been said by the honourable member who moved the motion. I concur heartily, with him in the statement that the affectation of strength on the part of this apparently impotent Government does not serve to convince people outside that they are really doing the best that could be n done in the interests of this country in. the very tryin g time through which we If I do not feel disposed to pay very much comattention to all that is said in the or elsewhere about the attitude of do the Labour party towards this industrial struggle, but, as one who has taken a good deal of interest in the policy of arbitration and its administration in this country, I think it right that I should, I in a debate of this character, make m y , position quite clear, lest it be suggested that I have any ulterior reason for reI am tickled a good is deal by the attitude of honourable members dn the other 6ide in their new-born zeal for the policy of arbitration. I have a lively recollection of the fact - that from 'that side of the House has.come most, if not' all,- of the criticism of arbitration as :itr. is carried on in this country. I am -.not forgetful of the fact that a movement was made from that side of the - House to remove the present honoured President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and that petitions from "" r i g h t - think i ng persons"" outside were directed to them, pointing out that thi6 policy of arbitration .was crippling the industries of the country. W it h the principle of arbitration I am in' complete concurrence. that arbitration has done a great deal of good for the workers of this country, as well as, possibly, directly or indirectly, for the employers of the country also.",33
104,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,More especially when the union had a punch behind it .,34
105,Mr BRENNAN,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"This policy of arbitration has imposed upon the employer the obligation that if he is desirous of entering upon a .particular kind of indus. try or undertaking, and of employing men to do a certain class of work, he is, under the law, compelled to comply with certain conditions and pay a certain wage to the men carrying on such operations for him. It imposes upon employees the obligation that if they desire to engage in a certain class of work they cannot look to the law for any support or assistance beyond, the conditions and wage3 'which have been prescribed by the Arbitration Court as, in all the circumstances, adequate. In this way the Arbitration Court has done much to regulate industry, and has., I think , done much to settle industrial disr putes, real and technical. Rut one thing that arbitration has net done is to compel any employer-as the honourable member for Barrier f Mr Considine) has suggested in an interjectionfc': carry on any class of work or to employ any man. It has not imposed any restriction upon his perfect liberty in that regard And the Arbitration Court, conversely, does not impose upon any in dividual in this community, professing to enjoy British liberty, the obligation to go to-, work for any employer at anv time. Therefore, when' the honourable member for-Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) speaks of (the' injurywhich Mr Justice Higsrins has - done' by. the declaration of nothing more than a' truism, which he made in the Court recently, it appears to me that he is misconceiving the fundamental principle of arbitration. I have only a limited time at my disposal, and I wish to come to the real .issue with which we are faced in connection with this most regrettable industrial trouble. Its effects have not been exaggerated. The suffering has been rather understated than overstated. It is far too great'and intense to be treated lightly by any member of this House. I recognise The position as I understand it is that the Government claim to be the controllers of the shipping. They claim that they are the employers of the men who may man the ships. Yet they sit today inactive in the face of the fact that in this, the greatest of all industries, they are not able to obtain men to carry on this work for the country.",34
106,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,They have not tried to do so.,34
107,Mr BRENNAN,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Whether they have tried or not, the fact remains that they have not done so, and the work is not going on. The Government seek to evade their re3ponsbilities. It is for them, as the employers of labour to be used on the ships, to say whether the claims of the men are or are not fair and reasonable. It is for the Government, responsible to this House, and this House, responsible to the country, to have information in their possession as to what the claims of the seamen are, and what the conditions are which prevent the wheels of industry going round, and which cause all the suffering that is being iinflicted on this country.",34
108,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,The honourable member forgets that the Government send all their servants to the Arbitration Court ,34
109,Mr BRENNAN,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"The Government cannot compel any man to go to the Arbitration Court. Let them put the notion of arbitration out of their heads. Let them not be taking refuge behind the Arbitration Court any-longer. The seamen will not so to the Arbitration Court, and they cannot be compelled to go to it . There is no law to compel them to go to the Court. Very well, what next? That is the question for us to consider. The next thing is to find out why the Government cannot get the men to man the ships. The reason is that the seamen say, "" This is the lowest wage for which we will work. These alone are the conditions, the bedrock, conditions, upon which we will work for you."" Very well, it is for the Government to see if they can offer conditions' to men in this country such as will induce them to work for them. Do they contend that the seamen have such a prejudice against them that they will not work for a fair thing, or under fair conditions? No; the truth is that the Government keep on referring to the matter of arbitration instead of getting at the crux of the question, and that is the conditions of labour and the wages which they are prepared to offer for the work. They have prosecuted a man because they say he broke the law, have fined him £300 or £ 4 0 0 , and have given him three months' gaol. That ought to satisfy them so far as that matter is concerned. If the Government cannot get men to work for them, if they offer terms so unattractive that not a single seaman will go down to the ships to work, let them have the courage of their opinions. Let them take their courage in both hands, as suggested by honourable members opposite, and bring men down to the waterside, and let them go into the forecastle, and attend to the donkey engines and work the ships, instead of the members of the Seamen's Union. Possibly, when some of those men had been at work for twenty minutes, they would have-a better appreciation of the situation of the seamen of the country, and they might, indeed, come out as propagandists on behalf of the union, and the cause for which it stands. If that were net so, let them man the ships and take them awav, and then, possibly, some members of the Seamen's Union would qualify for some of the easier jobs which the men who replaced them were carrying on outside.",34

In view of their responsibility, the .Government should report to this House, after obtaining the necessary information, what they think of the claims of the seamen. Let .us hear no more about the seamen going into a Court into which they will not go. Let the Government appoint a committee of honourable members from both sides of the House, or from one side if they choose, and furnish this House with a report as to whether or not the claims of the seamen are fair and reasonable, ' and as to whether the conditions for which they ask are reasonable. This is a responsibility which the Government has not dared to take up to the present, but this House should have first-hand information, as the body which must attend to this matter in the last resort.",35

Might I be allowed to say that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) spoke very warmly, as if he were the compendium of all that is wise, for the settlement of the strike. The honourable member's speech is a very good illustration of much of the criticism to which the Government have been subjected. The honourable member took up the whole of his allotted time; but I do not think that the strike is going to be altered one hair's breadth by any suggestion he was pleased to make! Not one single suggestion of a practicalcharacter did he make to assist in the solution of the difficulty. He had much to say in his .personal criticism of the Government; Ibuthis own opinion of the Government is a matter for himself, nnd he can answer for it to his constituents. We, as a Government, have had to face one of the most difficult problems in connection with industrial matters that any Government have had to face.",36

The question before us is a complex one, which has heen constantly under the consideration of the Government; and the House (will be satisfied, at a later stage, of the wisdom and justice of every step we have taken. I do not desire at this present time to repeat the whole history of the strike, step by step, and the efforts made by the Government to settle it. Honourable members who have studied the various stages of the trouble must know that the. Government have endeavoured in every, way possible, consistently .with their position and their duty, to have the matter peacefully . settled. We all know and realise the sufferings of innocent people, with whom we have, naturally every sympathy; but the Government are not responsible for that suffering. We have tried to find a peaceful solution,. or, at any rate, to prevent a spread of the suffering; and, under the circumstances, and in view of what is happening, I ask honourable members-not to press the matter now, but to allow the debate to lapse.",36

When the Seamen's Union in England, under Havelock Wilson, refused to allow vessels to carry men, some of whom were ex-Ministers, who had obtained passports from the British Government, every honourable member opposite, and every newspaper that hacks them, said that the seamen were right, although those seamen took the law into their own hands; but when the seamen here do the same thing, they are denounced. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) ought to remember that in his own State, at a responsible conference last week, a resolution was adopted in favour of 'wiping out the Arbitration Act. Now, however, we find honourable members apposite, and the honourable member himself, squealing for arbitration. The honourable member for Batman (- Mr Brennan) asked where \ the present opposition to arbitration was coming from.",36
122,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,Fro m your side now.,36
123,Mr TUDOR,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Mak e no mistake. The opponents of arbitration, and of factories legislation generally, are not on this side, but on the Government side. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in his pamphlet, on the occasion of the referendum, said that the .Commonwealth industrial powers were restricted; and just recently the High Court of Australia, in opposition to the arbitration Judges, held that no claim for improved conditions or increased wages can Ibe considered during the existence of an award. Thus, if an award be fixed for three years, no claims of the kind can be considered during that period. It is asked why the workers are dissatisfied. For three or fourweeks the Government have been in possession of the report of Mr Dethridge, who was appointed' a Royal Commission - to inquire into the condition of employment on the waterside front, and Honourable members have not seen it . It may-be said that the delay of the report does not much matter, seeing that the shipping is all hung up for the present; but whether the report contains anything good or anything bad, we ought to know what it does contain. If the Government have made up their minds in regard to the waterside workers, they, at any rate, could throw the report of the Royal Commission on the table, and state that they have no in tention to act upon it ",36

It would be far better to say that we, as a Parliament, realise that the Arbitration Court is hampered, for we know that the employers fight every decision on technicalities, and lionorable members opposite have asked that the Arbitration Court Judge be shifted from his position because he deals with the cases fairly . Further, it has been suggested that we revert fro'm arbitration to Wages Boards, on the ground that the members of the Wages Boards may he "" sacked;"" whereas the arbitration Judge cannot. I can assure honourable members opposite that that sort of talk is not going to settle this or any other dispute. Honourable members have to realise what has occurred in this city during the past forty-eight or seventy-two hourssince last Saturday or Sunday.

134,Mr TUDOR,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"We are not asking, and I have never heard one person say that the seamen are asking, for more than is fair and reasonable. It must be remembered, however, that it is only since the trouble began that honourable - members opposite, and many persons outside, have admitted that the demands of the seamen are fair and reasonable.",37

138,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,But it was hung up.,37
139,Mr TUDOR,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I have previously explained that it was hung, up at the request of the British Government. In any case, I have been out of office for three years. I have not blamed the Government for not proclaiming the Act until the war was finished; and during the whole time. I have been out of office I hav© not asked one question as to why it was not proclaimed.",37

142,Mr GROOM,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,That is so.,38
143,Mr TUDOR,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Now , however, the position is altered, and there is reason why the Act should be proclaimed, ""and a Director of Navigation appointed. was, I think, on a Supply Bill that, following the honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird 'Smith), I expressed the opinion that it was time action was taken in that direction. The honourable member ' for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) said that little boats, which were independent of Government control, were running today. Of course they are, and possibly on these boats the wages and conditions demanded by the Seamen's Union are observed. But what freights and fares are they charging? T was at an interview with the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) , along with Admiral Clarkson, Mr Walsh, and Mr O ' N e and Admiral Clarkson then stated that the improved conditions and increased wages could not be given without increasing freights and fares. Honourable members opposite, some of whom are fairly conversant with shipping matters, will admit that if the steamers were handed back to the owners tomorrow the latter would be prepared to grant the seamen's terms. of course, fares' and freights would go u for every £ 1 given in increased wages, owners would take from the public £ 4 £ 5 . That is the experience right tlirough. men.",38
144,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,-If that were true we have the employers agitating for increased Wages all the time.,38
145,Mr TUDOR,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I have never known employers do that, but I have heard employers saying that they did not in tend to fight against the demands beT cause they would merely pass th© expense on. That was the objection of Admiral Clarkson to granting the demands of the men-that he could not pay the increased wages unless freights and fares were in creased. Some newspapers denounce the workers at every season of the year; indeed,, they say that the workers have practically no right to live. If ' one mentions the names of some newspapers in Melbourne one needs an antiseptic mouthwash to clean his mouth out after mentioning their names. There is the Argus; which denounces the workers all the time. What did that newspaper do when the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) spoke at a meeting It soon after the trouble started ? It picked out such names as Brennan, Walsh, Reilly, and others. Such names may be all right for men who write for the Argus, but they are all wrong if they support the workers. If the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) had Veen at thatmeeting his name would probably have been picked out, though he is no more responsible for his name than I am for mine. The newspaper I refer to, which is supposed to lead public opinion, has-not said one word about th© living conditions, of the employees; there representatives have never bothered to go into the fo'castle and see how sailors live. It publishes the menus of the men, showing that they get ill; roast pork and tea; but let honourable members taste some of the provisions, and see the black pan that is carried for ' a r d ! The seamen are asking for fair living conditions, and it is up to every member to see that these living conditions are granted.",38
146,Mr KELLY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Wentworth) [4.43] - The But, honourable member for Franklin (Mr . p ; MCWilliams) made one point very clear in the his utterance to the House, and that was or that the Government required some strong By-the action the honourable member took I think he f©lt he might would make a number of short-sighted in dividuals in the country believe that he is a strong enough man to rethe place some gentlemen in the Governof ment. Having listened very carefully - and attentively to the honourable member, am very happy to think that his sins are not added to the sins of Ministers in* this or any other connection. I ask honourable members, especially on this sidewhere I do not think any effort will be - made to fan the bitter feeling that exists outside-whether , in their calm judgment, fchey do not realise that the difficulties in front of the Government are much greater than when the war was on - We are now faced with a period of reconstruction under the greatest difficulties of finance and interest, when any person who desires that law and order, shall be upheld must behave with patience, prudence, and loyalty. I ask honourable members whether they observe any of those qualities in the address of the honourable member for Franklin ? Some of his statements are on all-fours, and in true keeping, with the speeches made ftrom time to time by Mr Walsh, as if the two men had one object in view. We know they have not, for whilst the honourable member for Franklin (Mr . MCWilliams) may wish to displace one Minister, Walsh wishes to uproot all authority, law, and order-constitutiona l or otherwise.",38
147,Mr BRENNAN,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Why waste time with Walsh ? L et us get on with, the debate.",39
148,Mr KELLY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"^ - I am dealing with him because he is so infinitely more, important than the honourable member. There is behind this dispute something more than a grievance about conditionswhich I am quite ready to believe are bad-ther e is something more than a question of the application of the Navigation Act, which has been promised, or fair consideration by a tribunal presided over by a gentleman so highly eulogized as Mr Justice Higgins has been by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). Whether the ostensible cause be wages or conditions, I think honourable members realise that the underlying motive for the strike is something deeper and more sinister. In the absence of ' a defence by the' Government-and I say without hesitation that one of the best features about the Government's attitude in this business is that they are prepared to take all the blame if by so doing they can overcome the difficulty",39

152,Mr KELLY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Tliere-ar e many things which the honourable member does not believe. I say nothing against the members of the Seamen's Union; but, assuming that there are behind the management of the union qualities that are not shared, perhaps, by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan)-courag e and determination to carry through their revolutionary project at all risks- I ask myself how better we can help these men to sub-' vert all authority than by decrying, first the Court, then the Government, and afterwards this Parliament? Those are the means and methods of revolution all the world over. It is our duty to stand behind the constitutional authority which this House has established, and to treat with patience, prudence, and loyalty the Government who are responsible to us. Let us assume that the honourable member for Franklin had been in charge of the Government, and at the mo-' ment that the trouble occurred, he with that great strength which he would have us believe he possesses, had stepped into the limelight, and said, "" We shall-man these ships""- I tliink he said he would alter, them before he manned them-bu t if he had manned them at once for the benefit of the apple growers of Tasmania, is it not a manifest fact that immediately after he took that course, Mr Willis, who was recently expelled from the Labour movement in New South Wales, because he was too violent a revolutionist, would have been asking and cajoling his own union of coal miners to throw down their tools in sympathy with the oppressed seamen, and Australia from one end to the other would have been threatened with starvation for want of coal? The Government were not guilty of that folly, and what has happened as a result of their refusal to act so foolishly? A f t e r many appeals and supplications to be locked up, Walsh has been locked up ; bufc only after he has succeeded in completely exposing his hand and damaging himself in the eyes of every sane unionist in Australia; after he ""has been free to tell the people that he has received offers of financial support from Germany and Austria, and that he is not concerned so much in the merits of the present dispute as he is with the ambition to wipe out all constitutional authority; after he has threatened the law-abiding citizens that this city will be thrown into darkness; and after he, perhaps, had succeeded in dressing a few revolutionaries up in soldiers clothes and inducing them to throw bottles and bricks from a safe place behind the crowd. Was not the honourable member for Batman (Mr . .Brennan) interested today in the case of a postal employee, who, though not a soldier, was caught in one of these riots in full uniform ? Are not the Government worthy of some confidence and respect when,- after a period of great patience and tact, the people who control this revolutionary movement stand exposed from end to end of Australia for the men they are, thus making it possible for the wheels of industry to be set in motion again by law-abiding citizens ?",39

I sympathize with what has been said about the conditions in the forecastle, and compliment the Government if , through their efforts, men will soon cease to in the forecastle. I understand they are printed, but they were all lies. to have proper accommodation in the ships that are to be built, and I ask Government why they are not manly enough to say that every sailorman have the right to sit at table when taking his food. Do Ministers know that there are sailors who - do not have one sit-down meal on the voyage from London to Ausboat tralia and Australia, back to London 1 No honourable member on either side the House will support such conditions. Let the Ministry say that every man goes to sea shall h».ve the right to sit tab'e for his meals. I travelled from Fremantle. in that up-to-date ship the Osterley, and, as I always do, I i spected the forecastle. Never have a man whom I persuaded to go into the forecastle who has not declared that it is an infamy that human beings should have to live there. If the Ministry know order 119, of these conditions, why do they not make a regulation that every mail boat shall provide the seamen with a decent place in which to have their meals \",40
154,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"The Act passed ""by this Parliament provides for that.",40
155,Dr MALONEY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"What the deuce is the good of an A ct if it is not in operation ? Will any honourable member deny that the Plimsoll mark, which was the sailers' salvation, is disappearing from our ships ? There was a time when shipowners said, "" The best, market for us is the bottom of the sea."" They cared not how many men went to a watery grave. By bringing about the adoption of a load line, Samuel Plimsoll saved the lives of thousands of meu, but today that Plimsoll mark is disappearing or being ignored. What are we to do when shipowners will break the sacred regulations of the Board of Trade ? I suppose that 6ome official from Australia House in spected .the Osterley before it departed from England. No doubt everything about the vessel looked nice and fine. But I know that the company tried to crowd bea hundred seamen, into a space which General with Lassetter, of Sydney, who accompanied can me into the forecastle, will verify my statement. We saw stamped in a steel I girder in large letters, "" Accommodation for 32 seamen."" On the other side of sleep the forecastle the same words were, Forty seamen were crowded intp each place. the Even after the Osterley had been - examined by. a representative of Australia shall House, the company tried to crowd a hundred seamen into the accommodation provided for sixty-four.

156,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"He n t y ) [ 4 . 5 9 ] wish to attack either the Government or 1 the Seamen's Union. From my point of view, the present trouble ha6 been very clearly stated by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). The points of view of the honourable member and myself do not often coincide, but I agree with him that we cannot compel the seamen to go to the Arbitration Court if they do not wish to do so, any more than we can compel an employer, against his wish, to carry on his business. The shipowners are not a party to this dispute, no matter what is said to the contrary by honourable members opposite. whole of the fleet on the Australian coast is under the control of the Government, and ie managed by the Shipping Comptroller. The Government pay the shipowners for the time charter of their vessels, therefore they have become a party to the dispute. As I was saying, there is no power to compel the seamen to go to the Arbitration Court; but as the Government are a party to the dispute, just as the ship-owners would have been if they had been controlling their vessels, the responsibility rests upon them to man the ships. I have lived in a forecastle for years, and I know the uncomfortable conditions under which seamen work. realise that a vast improvement should be made in those conditions; but I know that, since the Navigation Act was passed, a considerable improvement has been made in the accommodation for the crews on all vessels recently built on the Australian coast. The seamen know as well as any one else how impossible it is to improve the accommodation on some of the vessels built years ago, and they are quite prepared to work on with the knowledge that the forecastle will be habitable on all vessels built in the future. To-day there are quite a number of vessels running on our coast which have had improvements effected as a result of an agreement arrived at hy a conference to which the seamen were a party, and the ship-owners have agreed to build all future vessels in .accordance with those conditions; but what is to happen to the vessels now running on the coast which cannot bep.m - altered, if the demand of the Seamen's Union, as represented by their spokesman - I do not today,- is conceded-that the whole of the conditions provided on modern ships must be given on all the vessels employed in our coastal trade? They must either be scrapped or sold abroad; and then the - position of the community at large would be worse than ever. I admit, with the Government, that the question is very delicate, ticklish, and complicated; but, as they, a party to the dispute, have offered to their employees, the seamen, through their Comptroller of Shipping (Admiral Clarkson), an arrangement by which they are prepared, to accept the decision of the The Arbitration Court, whatever it may be, and as the seamen have refused the invitation to go to the Court which was established for the settlement of disputes, I consider it is their duty to man the ships. Ministers know the consequences entailed on suffering humanity in Melbourne. It is not the rich nor the well-to-do who are suffering. I guarantee that every honourable member has fuel in his home, and can have his meals cooked and his rooms warmed. ""We are not the sufferers. It is those who are out of work, those who were forced out of work by the lack of coal, who are the sufferers. I Mr HECTOR LAMOND - That is the wickedness of it all.",41
157,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Exactly . There are very many innocent people suffering through this strike. The Government are a party to the dispute; they are not an independent body sitting apart and watching the ship-owners and seamen fight. They have taken the place of the ship-owners, and I find faul t with them for allowing the community to suffer by not taking steps to man their ships. That the great bulk of the seamen in Australia cannot approve of the course of conduct advocated by the man who has just gone into gaol is proved by the public action of South Australian representatives of the seamen, and, knowing the necessity there is to get coal into Melbourne, it is the bounden duty of the Government to ask for volunteers and man the ships, rather than see so many people brought to the verge of starvation. I am satisfied they could equip one ship after, the otlier without the slightest difficulty. A state of affairs in which people in this city have to go. cap in hand to the Coal Board to get sufficient fuel to warm.their houses when their families are suffering from influenza should not be permitted by any Government. I accept the assurance of the Minister (Mr Groom) that he has certain information that the matter may be settled, but he must remember the impatience of the community. The unseemly riots in our streets are all the result of, and have originated from, the strike.",41
158,Mr TUDOR,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,There are more seamen out in Sydney than there - are in Melbourne.,42
159,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"That may be the case. Lots of people may throw mud at each other if they choose to do so, but it is the working men who are causing these riots-the y are at work; it is not the soldiers as a body, although some of them have been blamed for it.",42
160,Mr FLEMING,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,If the honourable member had been at the meeting of soldiers this morning he would have realized it.,42

I have a good deal of sympathy for the police. They are doing the work of the community, and they ought to be* made to feel that they have behind them the solid support of all the best interests in the country as represented in the Government. They ought to be made to feel that the Government are defending them, and are not allowing statements as to what constables have said-obviou s lies on the face of them-to weigh with them in the consideration, of the question of how best to handle this trouble. Whatever is in the mind of the Government; and whatever information they have concerning this dispute, I feel that if it does not come to a head within a very few days Ministers must take some action to prevent the people of this community from being held up by any body of men who may seek to defy the law in any manner they choose.",42

His statement is not in accordance with the facts, because, outside Mr. Walsh, the general secretary of the Sea-men's Union, to my knowledge not .one man connected with the strike has been prosecuted for any offence since the commencement of the dispute.",42
165,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,I did not say that the strikers had caused the disturbances.,42
166,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,The honourable member said that the disturbances in Melbourne had arisen out of the strike.,42
167,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"That is true, but that is quite a different matter.",42
168,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"If they have arisen out of the strike, and have not been by the strikers, I fail to see the connection of the honourable menibgr's",42
169,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Mak e no mistake, some the strikers were in the disturbances. - Mr Considine - The strikers have had nothing to.do with the disturbances. The honourable member .made reference to men having been prosethe cuted for having been found in uniform, and said that they had not been to the war; but if the honourable member had read the newspapers he would have seen that the men who were charged with being illegally in uniform' had permission to wear uniform on Peace Saturday, and were unaware that they were not allowed to wear it on Peace Sunday. Honourable members opposite have now made it ' a crime, by their regulations, to wear the King's uniform. They say that a man who has come back from, the war, and happens to wear the King's uniform on the wrong day, must be prosecuted and fined. - Mr BOYD - That will not wash. numher of them have not been at the war.",42
170,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"If the honourable member will read last night's Herald, he will see that the two men who were arrested had permission from the military authorities to wear the uniform on the Saturday, and were prosecuted for wearing it illegally on the day after. The honourable member, who talks ahout masquerading in uniform, should acquaint himself with the facts. Let him produce one case of a man who has proved to be a masquerader in these disturbances. He talks about the duty of the Government in connection with the seamen's strike. If conditions. the community has no sense of feeling for the grievances under which the seamen are suffering, and refuses to remedy the conditions of these seamen, who, in the words of the ' honourable^ member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), are living in floating slums, it must accept the responsibility for perpetuating them. I useless to talk about the seamen holding the community by the throat. If the be. people are prepared to allow these conditions to continue, and are not prepared to force the Government to give the seamen decent living accommodation, they must submit to the consequences of their own inaction.",43
171,Mr CORSER,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,Why do not the men go to the Arbitration Court?,43
172,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Because they do not wish to do so. The Seamen's Union have exercised their right, as free men in this community, to say that they will please themselves as to whether they shall ask an Arbitration Court to determine the conditions under which they live and work.",43
173,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,Yes ; but they have no right to block other men from working.,43
174,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,The honourable member himself has just said that the seamen have as much right to refuse to work as the employer of labour has to shut down his plant and refuse to operate it if an award of the Court does not suit him. To-day the managers of the mines at Broken Hill have officially informed the unions that if the Arbitration Court A grants the claims of the men they will not work the mines. Vials of wrath and denunciation are poured forth upon the unions if they refuse to work under an award of the Arbitration Court when they consider that they do not get justice; yet the Broken Hill mines will not work under the award of any Court if it does not suit them.,43
175,Mr BOYD,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"But the men have no monopoly over the work. If others are prepared to work, let them be employed.",43
176,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,The honourable member can do what he likes. The seamen have done what they like. They say they will not work the ships under these,43

182,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"That is only the honourable member's opinion. An employer's recommendation of a "" scab "" is of no value to my mind.",43
183,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I am not an employer, and I say that some of the men on the boats now running are as good as any men you could get, at whatever you like to put them to.",43
184,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I thought the honourable member's complaint was that they could not get men. At any rate, I do not believe there are men in Australia low enough to "" scab "" on the seamen. Not one honourable member opposite dares to say that the seamen are not asking for decent conditions. Not a single word has been said against - their claims'. All that has been said has been about the method they have adopted to get their claims settled. Honourable members opposite say, "" Go to the Arbitration Court,"" but not a word is heard from them about the justice or equity of the claims of the seamen. The men are told, "" Unless you go about it in the way we tell you, you can go to-Tasmania , or somewhere else.''",43
185,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,Why did you sign the Labour platform in favour of arbitration ? Why do you not get o u t . of the party ?,44
186,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Because I am not like the honourable member. The honourable member knows full well why I signed the Labour party's platform. Make no mistake about it , I am in accord with the Labonr party's views now. Labour party does not stand for strike breaking. It does not stand for forcing men back or for manning the ships with "" scabs."" We have heard a great deal about an ex-Labour man, and the strong stand he took on a certain occasion. All I can say is that that strong stand has not been characteristic of the same gentleman in more recent events with which he has been connected.",44
187,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"He was in a Labour Government then, too, and the Labour Government stood behind him.",44
188,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Possibly ; but most of. the members of that Labour Government are on the opposite side of the House now, where the strong stand is noticeably absent.",44
189,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,You r Leader was one of them.,44
190,Mr CONSIDINE,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"That may be. Certain honourable members opposite are only sorry because the Labour movement has left them. The. Labour movement today is seeing more clearly, and sees less reason why it should arbitrate upon the wealth that it produces. The working classes of Australia have reached the stage that they are no longer going to allow the other side to treat them like machines, to put them in the witness-box, and estimate how much coal and oil they will consume, to average up how much it will take to keep a family in good working order, just as in the case of a draught horse. When the employers have estimated how much oats and chaff will keep a working horse going, they say, "" We will have that horse,"" and they allow for him accordingly. They want to treat the working men and women of this community in the same way, but the workers are determined not to be treated as machines of toil any longer.",44
191,Mr GREGORY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"What are you doing to the women and kiddies now? Mr C.ONSIDLN/E - I am doingnothing. While I am able to use my tongue on behalf of the class I claim to represent, I am going to stand to my class, irrespective of the consequences. The honourable member stands for his class, to whose, interest it is to keep the Arbitration Court in existence, to fool the workers, to insult their womenfolk by askThe ing them the most intimate details with regard to their clothing, before he will give them a decent living wage. At the same time, honourable members opposite tumble over themselves to rush a Bill through the House to give a pension of £35 a week to the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, who, along with other Judges, is always preaching t h r if t to the working-class community ",44
192,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"A r e you opposed to the Arbitration Court? Mr COlSrSIDINE - I do not believe in arbitration personally, and never have done so.",44
193,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Y o u just signed the platform to get in? present Mr CONSIDIJSTE - Like the honourable member. W it h a lot more working men and women in Australia, I believe that there is nothing to arbitrate about. I hold that the workers, who produce the wealth of the country, should own it ; and I am not going to use the position which the workers of this country have given me to dragoon them into going to a Court in whioh they do not believe, and allowing a Judge who has no knowledge of - the subject to determine the conditions under which men shall work. If this community want the transport industry to be run, they must give the men who operate that industry decent conditions. If they do not, they have only themselves to thank. It is their own f a u l t if they are content to allow the country to be ru n by a party who, despite tlieir crocodile tears of sympathy with the populace outside, care nothing fdr the sufferings of the people, so long as the dividends are paid by the companies which are behind the Government. about the shipping companies not being interested is'so much camouflage. shipping companies are simply using the Government to break the strike, and break down the industrial organizations. Honourable members opposite ask why the Government do not do this or that. The Government themselves know full well why they do not do it . The Government are not moving in this matter because they hope, in the interests of the sections whom they represent, to smash industrial organization in Australia. Then some of them get up and prate as if they were suffering fro m a nightmare about revolution being behind all this business.",44

196,Sir ROBERT BEST,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Kooyong) [5.24]. - I am in sympathy with the attitude of the Government on this important and delicate question. It is quite easy for some of us who have not the immediate responsibility to advocate strong and horoic measures; but the Government realise that the extension of the strike would be an unspeakable crime, and every effort must be made to avoid such a contingency. The position was such that if they had. acted with precipitation, and without a full knowledge of the conditions as they now exist, that extension would have been inevitable. I am prepared to think that the Government had better information on this subject than any honourable member in the House, and that, having regard to that information, they are acting in the best interests of the country in the circumstances. I realise that there must be a limit to their forebearance, and To talk that the time is approaching when that limi t will be reached. But when they The give the House the assurance that they have reason to think, on account of certain conferences sitting here, and certain other information which comes to their knowledge, that there is a ""possibility of a peaceful settlement, they are entitled to every consideration in their present attitude.",45
197,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,The same thing was said a fortnight ago.,45
198,Sir ROBERT BEST,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"It is easy for any of us to ask, "" Why not man the ships ?"" I am prepared to think that if volunteers were called for that purpose it could readily be achieved. But other and more serious questions are involved. you It must bu obvious to ftvery thoughtful readily resorted to, which would overwhelm any action which the Government took for good in that direction. I should be sorry for us to attempt to discuss the merits of the strike here. The Government bave invited the seamnn T,o r«snrt to a tribunal which, in the whole of its history, has shown the utmost sympathy with the workers. That tribunal was constituted at the instance of both sides of the House. Arbitration was secured by the co-operation of Liberal and Labour.",45
199,Mr SAMPSON,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,Mr Deakin was the first to take action.,45
200,Sir ROBERT BEST,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Mr Deakin in troduced the Bill , but the most strenuous representations in favour of arbitration . came from the other side of the House, and both sides united to pass it . It is part and parcel of the platform of my honourable friends opposite-and there are present in their ranks men of sane, moderate ideas, who would gladly see the strikers resort to arbitration for the purpose of settling this dispute. We should not discuss here the merits themselves We are not competent to do so. We are not the tribunal constituted for that purpose. In the interests of reconciliation between employer and employee, and the settlement of economic differences arising from time to time between capital and labour, the wisdom of .this House found enactment in the statute law providing for the constitution of arbitration t r i bunals throughout the length breadth of Australia. Those tribunals have resulted in hundreds of thousands of pounds being awarded to the workers, to which, no doubt, they were entitled, in improved conditions, and in the shortening of hours for all those who resorted to them. Now all that the Government ask, and rightly ask, is that the law shall be upheld. The law provides for the settlement of disputes in this way, as in the case of civil disputes between citizen and citizen. The law asks .these men to go to the tribunal to which they have hitherto resorted, and which has been a source, generally speaking, of very substantial advantage to the workers. It is only a fair and reasonable request, which the Government have a right to. insist ou,, without attempting to deal themselves with the merits of the dispute. I do not desire to express my own views on various features of the present strike. I shall content myself with ing, incidentally, that what is taking place now is an instance of certain desto peradoes who are using the strikers as .blind and subterfuge for ulterior purthat poses. Those desperadoes and degenerates have engineered the strike by, unfortunwise nately, misleading the seamen, who are naturally hpnest and fair-minded, but are being deluded at this juncture. A junta of reckless individuals is holding up community, defying law, order, and good government, and is using the strike for revolutionary purposes.",45

They are penalizing the its .unfortunate women and. children. sound common sense of the worker prevail, however. The worker has demanded arbitration in the past, speaking generally, is prepared to stand by arbitration today. I admit that there may be room for complaint, and that there are defects in our arbitration but the Arbitratio n Court is the' constituted tribunal for the remedying of those complaints. Moreover, where the experience of that Court has shown . that and room for improvement has become apparent, this sympathetic House is prepared to insist upon such i m provement as will make arbitration more effective and more' perfect. Labour and Liberal, Oppositionists and Ministerialists should join at this crucial period in the maintenance of law and order, and should endeavour to induce the men on strike to' resort to the tribunal which has dealt with them fair l y in the past. If we realized our responsibilities, and bent our energies in those directions, much might be achieved. I feel confident that honourable .members opposite could speak with influence and force, and could induce the men who are being deluded today to realise how grossly and unfairly they are being misled.",46

204,Sir ROBERT BEST,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"You r little game ought to be .up soon.

I hope nothing will be said further embarrass the Government. If a every effort fails', then I am bound to say if volunteers are called for throughout Australia to man the ships, and othercome to the rescue in this crisis, so as to relieve the women and children from starvation, and prevent the wheels of in dustry from being stopped, and to put an the end to this rebellion against law and order, then the people will not hesitate to respond.' But let us use every effort in the meantime. I feel assured that, with the knowledge that the Government possesses today, we would be justified in acits advice to hold off for a while.

It is surprising that he l a w ; and other honourable members opposite did not take more notice when the President of the'Arbitratio n Court said, in so many words, that the approaches to that Court were surrounded by a "" serbonian bog of technicalities."" Very littl e has been done', either by this or the previous Government, to try to reduce those difficulties whereby the workers, unless they spend enormous sums of money, are hindered in seeking justice through the Arbitration Court. It is rather astonishing that it should be only now, when we find ourselves in the midst of industrial turmoil, that the lionorable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) and' others who have spoken from that side of the House"" should stand up-perhap s with their tongues in their cheeks-and say that it is time we made the approaches to the Arbitratio n Court easier. . If those difficulties were removed-ari d it should be one of the first duties incumbent upon this Parliament-the n the working men and women of the community would certainly take more advantage of arbitration than they do today. But it is those very expensive difficulties which drain the coffers of our unions and permit legal gentlemen and others to take up undue time before the Arbitratio n Court. Even when an award has been given, what has been the frequent action of the employers ? They have appealed to the High Court, and argument over technical points has been dragged out for weeks and months. Such experiences have proved to the workers that arbitration does not confer nearly all the blessings once pictured for it by Mr Deakin.

207,Mr FENTON,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I feel sure that I will not be committing any breach of f a it h when I tell honourable members of one way in which peace can be brought about without all the terrible expense of arbitration proceedings. On one occasion Mr Glynn - (the honourable member for Angas), and a friend of mine, the secretary of the Engine-drivers and Firemen's Union, quickly settled wages and conditions by arriving at agreements in one of the. rooms of this House. The honourable member for Angas represented a large number of mining companies in Broken Hill and elsewhere, and, in conjunction with the representative of the union concerned, they drew up agreements which were afterwards ratified by the President of the Arbitratio n Court, with practically no expenditure at all on the part of the union. That is a reasonable procedure.",47

At the time of its passing, English opinion in some cases was that it .was a hundred years ahead of its time. Since then we have had the Titanic disaster, and we have passed through a great war, with the result that the Australian Navigation Act, which was thought to be a hundred years before its time, is now to be the text of navigation legislation in all other countries.",49
233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,49
234,Mr GREGORY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"Dampier) [5.48] Knowing that several honourable members still wish to speak to this question, and that the time set apart for its discussion has almost expired, I shall occupy the attention of the House for only a few minutes. It is amusing to listen to the objections which have been raised by the Labour party to the Conciliation and Arbi tration Act, the Navigation Act , and other measures. Quite a number of those who have been raising such objections and indulging in special pleading for the seamen have probably never been on board a ship, and some of them, at all events, took care not to travel by sea while the war was in progress. ' I am pleased that this motion has been submitted, since it affords us an opportunity to discuss a question that should have been dealt with in this House at least a month ago. There has been too much procrastination, and the Government should know, without further delay, whether or not the Parliament will stand behind them if they enforce the law and protect our industries. No matter what one section of the community may' think, there can be no question as to whether law and order should prevail. In connection with the seamen's strike it cannot be said that any question of Capital grinding Labour is involved. It cannot be urged that a number of shipping companies have combined to ride rough-shod over their employees, since the whole of our shipping is absolutely controlled by the Government. In these circumstances, I think it is time that the Government showed their hand, since we are all alive to the misery and suffering that the strike has brought upon the community. Both the Federal and State Parliaments have passed arbitration laws, and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court is open.to the seamen. The honourable member for M a r i byrnong (Mr Fenton),- who spoke of the Navigation Act as a magnificent measure, is amongst those who, from time to time, have lauded the principle of arbitration, and have pointed to its advantages. Surely it is his duty, and that of every member of the Labour party, to appeal to the seamen to abide by the laws of the country. Their appeal would have - far more weight with the men than any entreaty by us would be likely to have. They should urge the men to go to the Court, and should also point out in what direction the Conciliation and Arbitration Act needs to be amended.",49
235,Mr MATHEWS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,It would take too long.,49
236,Mr GREGORY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"I do not believe in the present Arbitration Court, but I support the principle of arbitration, and lieve it would be an easy matter so to amend the Act as to do away with the delays of the Court and the huge expenditure involved in bringing a claim before it. This, however, is not the time to discuss that question. The sole consideration for us today is whether or not law and order are to prevail. Are we.to'allow the present misery to continue? women and children to be allowed to starve? Are the producers to be ruined? Are our soldiers, after the sacrifices they have made, to return home only to find that aU progress is retarded and unemployment staring them in the face? MT. MATHEWS - They find, on returning home, that their fathers and mothers have been robbed while they have been away.",50
237,Mr GREGORY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"The seamen's dispute has nothing to do with the question of whether the fathers and mothers of our soldiers have been . robbed. What we want to know is whether these men are going to resume work, and, in the event of their refusal, whether the Government are going to do everything possible to see that the laws of the country are observed ? Unlike' the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), I am not one of those who would wait to see what others might do. If the policy of force is wanted in this country, then the sooner that is known the"" better. If honourable members opposite desire force rather than law and order to prevail, let them openly say so. If they make any such announcement, I am quite satisfied as to what the answer of the people will be. I ask the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) whether he agrees with the sort of domination now sought to be exercised?",50
238,Mr TUDOR,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,I was satisfied that law and order should prevail when British seamen refused to take Mr Henderson to to laugh a certain European port.,50
239,Mr GREGORY,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"The honourable member's influence, I am sure, will be quietly exerted towards the settlement thisdispute in the Arbitration Court; - I should like him to stand up courageously, and.to tell the seamen in the most be- outspoken way where their duty lies. It is his duty, and that of the Parliament as a whole, to tell the seamen that they should go to the Arbitration Court, or to some other tribunal designed to conserve law and order, and not to support them in the action they are how taking. _ I hope we shall have no further procrastination. The people in the far-back Are districts of Western Australia; whom I am representing, are practically starving .because of the refusal of the seamen to man our ships. Producers in the back parts of Australia are suffering severely, and many will probably be ruined, because of the strike. Wo person in the community is gaining by the action taken by the seamen. The workers themselves are the greatest losers, and I appeal to all sections of this House to do everything possible to induce the seamen to conform to the law. We should urge them to go to the Arbitration Court, and, at the same time, impress upon the Government the necessity of at once introducing amendments designed to get rid of many of the difficulties at present associated with our arbitration law.",50

248,Mr MATHEWS,MEDIC AL ATTENDANCE FOR RETURNED,"The seamen disapprove of that suggestion. It is admitted, even by the Acting Leader of the Government, that the seamen could hot obtain through the Arbitration Court at the present time the increase of wages desired by them. All that the Court can offer the in is a patchwork relief in the shape of a bonus. The workers know what the bonus system means, and will have none of it. Last year the lower-paidofficers of this House were granted a bonus, and since then we have been trying to have the amount of that bonus added to their regular wages, but have not been successful. What the workers want is not a bonus, but adequate payment for the work performed by them. The workers have gone to the Arbitration Court so often that they are just as familiar with its machinery as are the other side, and they know that they cannot secure in this case a redress of their grievances.

No instructions were given by the Government or its Ministers authorizing the sending of the letter referred to, which was sent out by the District authorities under a misapprehension. The attention of the officers responsible has been drawn to the error, and the matter has been rectified. In cases, however, where interncfis, or uninterned enemy aliens, have applied for repatriation, and where internees have been ordered to be deported, the wives have been communicated with by the District Commandant to ascertain whether they desired to accompany their husbands. 2. The most recent decisions of the Cabinet were authorizing the appointment of a'number of magistrates-draw n from various States because .of their local knowledge-to sit as an Aliens Board to deal with applications from internees for permission to remain in Australia, and the appointment of a Committee of Reference, consistingof Judge Williams, Brigadier General R.

Breakfast was served in the stream at 7.30 a.m.' Shortly after the vessel was moored, eight or ten invalids were taken on deck, most of the invalids dressed in pyjamas only; yet the weather was cold, a sharp wind blowing. Shortly after 11 a.m., cot cases were removed to the wharf, where they lay in the cold without sufficient covering. The Karoola then pulled out to the stream. insufficiency of motor ambulances, it was 3 p.m. before the last of the invalids arrived at Randwick Hospital. The invalids had no food or refreshments of any kind from 7.30. a.m. until 3 p.m., while the exposure to cold through want of sufficient clothing Tesulted in some of the invalids contracting Bevere colds. withstanding this, we read in the evening newspapers that the Governor General met the hospital ship, addressed words of welcome to the returned men, that a plentiful supply of cars were in waiting, and that everything went without a hitch.

Bill be now read a second tiine. 3,888 Mr FOWLER' (Perth) [6.15] - The 044. 288 Bill now und'er consideration is one' tt tt - - 640 whioh, a layman like myself naturally ap2,781 proaches - with considerable hesitation.. 90 When wehad listened to the speech of »- 550 the honourable and learned .gentleman - 727 tt ' ' ' : 97' who introduced the Bill , and he had in it- ' ' "" . . . 1,334 dicated to us the hesitation of the.

Nevertheless, I have a -- . . . 3,587 2,561 considered the Bill carefully, and, while . « 955 I am. in favour of the general principles,. -. 1,941 I have to complain that it does not go .. 2,448 far enough. . It is admittedly an extra128 - tt J u n e - J u ly * ... ordinary measure,, a result of conditions 2,308 created by the war; in fact, it is a heri44,169. tage of a - measure introduced""'entirely on account of the war, and is,' therefore, 1 .justified in that connection. I supported the War Precautions Act, and the only fault I have, to find with its administration by the Government is that it did not go far enough in some respects-the same objection I . have to the present measure. The Bill is quite satisfactory so far as it goes, but -1 contend that the circumstances and conditions in Australia today emphatically demand that, if 'constitutional, it should be expanded still further. "" Only today we had a most emph'atic illustration of the necessity for further Government supervision and control in the matter of prices. The statement of Mr Knibbs, published this morning, proves that, instead of prices falling since the end of the war, there has been a decided upward tendency, which I make bold to say is, in the great m a j o r it y of cases, without any justification whatever. It is noifching more than barefaced exploitation of the community; and I urge on - the Government that there is no duty more imperative on them at the present time than, to give careful consideration to the profiteering - which is going on, and - to meet it in the most drastic wav possible - It is suggested that this matter of controlling prices, and the prevention of the exploitation of the public, is one which ought to be left to the States. I held a view somewhat of that nature for a considerable time, but again I find . myself forced by circumstances to alter it.'",55
272,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Anothe r convert!  be m-ogressive enough to see the direction in which my dutyhes, and I hope that the House as a whole will also indicate that it is possessed of that highly necessary characteristic of all Legislatures. In my own State of Western Australia we are, undoubtedly, suffering from the im position of very heavy prices. tunately, State action in Western Australia would not be effective in controlling prices, because, in a great majority of 'cases, prices are determined before the goods reach the State, and the Government of the State would be forced into the position of altogether refusing those goods admission, or of endeavouring to bring prices down at a cost to the im' porters which would be quite unfair. It appears, (therefore, that in regard to commodities which pass from - one - State to another, nothing short of GOm-monwealth action will be effective.; and I shall do all in my power, so long as the present profiteering continues-ten d it is not likely to be abandoned until very di-astic action is taken-to encourage the Government to take whatever steps may be necessary to deal with the position. The constitutional aspect of the question is one which I confess is somewhat difficult for a layman to deal with. It is suggested-indeed , we are assured by the Government that in regard to price fixing we can go no further than the Bill indicates, but that, because we have been handling these matters in the form of contract, it is permissible to still f u r ther - legislate in the desired direction. I confess, as a layman, that I am quite unable to see why the contractual element gives the Government the power; and I should be glad to have some indication from legal gentlemen in the Chamber of wliere the justification arises. It appears to me that if the Government have the power to control the specific commodities mentioned in the Bill , whether under contract or not, they also have the power to deal with goods of a similar character.",57
273,Mr FENTON,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"That seems common sense, anyhow!",57
274,Mr FOWLER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"It is a layman's opinion, which may go for what it is worth; but I have looked up Quick amd Garran, and, againspeaking as a layman, I say that their interpretation of the Well-known section 51 of the Constitution, dealing with Trade and Commerce, justifies me in my contention. In Quick and Garran it is pointed outTrade means .the act or business of exchanging commodities' .by barter, or by buying or Unfor- selling for money; commerce;, traffic; barter. It comprehends every species of exchange or dealing, either in the produce of land, in manufacture, in bills, or in money, but it is chiefly used .to denote the barter or purchase and sale of goods, wares, and merchandise, either b'y wholesale or retail. Commerce means the exchange or buying and selling of commodities; especially the exchange' of merchandise on a large scale between different places or communities ; extended - trade or traffic. If that opinion be correct;-and we are bound to regard the authority with respect-the n I think we can proceed with perfeot safety to expand the Bill in the directi' n I am indicating. ' Curiously enough, I have before me a record uf the fact that some years ago in this Parliament the control of prices was not regarded as unconstitutional. . In 1906 this' House was invited to deal with an Australian Industries Preservation Bill , for the repression of .destructive monopolies. When that before us I submitted certain sub-clauses, to insure that the consumer got a fair deal in respect of th© goods to be protected. The principal amendment was as follows: If the unfairness in the competition is indicated in respect of prices, the ConiptrollerBoner,al shall specify what, in his opinion, are fair selling prices for the goods sought to be protected under this Act, or which may be imported, subject to any specified conditions or restrictions under thisoAct.",57
275,Unknown,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 7.45 p.m.  not proceeded .with, and whatever may have been the reasons in the minds of Ministers for putting the measure aside, there certainly was no suggestion that we were unable 'to fix prices because of limitation bf our powers by the Constitution.",58
276,Mr TUDOR,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"I think the late Mr G. B . Edwards supported the honourable member's proposal, and submitted a similar amendment.",58
277,Mr FOWLER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Yes . In view of those and other reasons, which. I need not specify, I have come .to the conclusion that we have the constitutional power to deal with prices under this or any other Bill ; at any rate, until the High Court bas ruled that we have no such power it is the duty of the Government to .deal with the prices problem, because there is no doubt that nothing short of very drastic legislation will meet all the circumstances of the case.",58
278,Mr SA MPSON,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,We tested our powers in connection with taxation.,58
279,Mr FOWLER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"They have tested in other ways, but still I think can fairly claim that under section 51, profiteering can be checked. with an ordinary common-sense interprevernment tation of "" trade and commerce,"" we have' some such power as I am contending for.",58
280,Mr SAMPSON,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,That will all depend upon the question of commerce within the States.,58
281,Mr FLEMING,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,Commo n sense interjJretation is against all legal precedent.,58
282,Mr FOWLER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"I ' regard the law as being, to a large extent, a crystallization of common sense, and, although it has its inconsistencies, I think, we are all proud Bill was to be livin g under the laws brought into existence by this .Parliament. I suggest that the proposed extension now before us, in the direction I am indicating, will add considerably in the well-being of the oeople, and enhance, the credit of - this Parliament amongst the people, if we can only carry our intention into effect."" The Inter-State Commission has left no doubt of the existence of profiteering in the community-at the present time. It 'has issued a series of exceedingly comprehensive and valuable reports, which amply justify the creation of that body, and which it is the duty of this Parliament to follow up with the necessary legislation.",58
283,Mr SAMPSON,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"That is an Inter-State, not an Intra-State, Commission ",58
284,Mr FOWLER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member is seeking to make a distinction which I cannot admit at the present time. If there is Inter-State trade in the commodities reported on by the Commission we have the power under the Constitution to deal with them. I shall be very glad to hear some of the legal members of the House enlarge upon that point. Is is our duty to at least test whether or not we have power under the present Constitution f o deal with prices. We can no longer afford to sit with hands folded and refer matters of price fixing aiid the checking of profiteering to the various States. This is work which can be more effectively carried out by the . Commonwealth; indeed, only by the Commonwealth can it be carried out in a way that will be satisfactory to the whole of been the people. Of course, the difficulty has we been to arrive at some method by which The Gohave ' adopted certain methods upon which even the most sanguine upholders of Government policy-cannot con-: gratulate themselves. In respect of a few articles, there has been restriction of a kind that has benefited the community, but the method by which the benefit been achieved has been both clumsy and expensive, and has not come as near to the necessities of the case as the people had a right to expect. It is necessary to trace the profiteering evils to their source, and I am bound to finger. say that there is very little, if any, evidence to connect the primary producers with profiteering. On the contrary, they have suffered, to a certain extent .from the evil, and if we can protect them and the consumers from the abuses that are being perpetrated, we need not hesitate as to the course ought to adopt - If the producers. and price today. the consumers are suffering, it ought to be easy to discover who are the offenders. I think they will be found generally amongst that large class of middlemen who stand between the producers and the price of cloth. consumers, and who too frequently levy toll of both. There is no question that they have been actively at work during course of the war, as the reports of Inter-State Commission ""have shown, and there is equally little doubt as to their still more objectionable .activities now that the war is over. From another stand-point, also, it is to be regretted that fiteering should have taken place. ""VVe have had in Australia, during the war years, magnifioent opportunities for de; veloping trade in certain directions. But war. the manufacturers do not appear to have teen content with a fair pro55 per centfit. They have taken-"" full advantage of the war situation, and the result will not tend to commend to the people goods of Australian manufacture in a way that would undoubtedly have been the case if only the manufacturers had been satisfied with reasonable prothe fits. There is no question as to the ability of Australian woollen manufacfiteers ' tures to hold their own, in quality, with any importations. During the last few years great advances have been made in the quality of various tain classes of locally-made goods. In tweeds for men's clothing, I have seen Australian productions almost equal in quality to very best that can be produced in Great Britain.",58
285,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"As a matter of fact, the Australian article is equal to the has imported. The Australian manufacturer is unable to introduce inferior material.",59
286,Mr FOWLER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,Some very inferior material has been introduced into Australian tweeds. I have seen some cloths through which one could poke his,59
287,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,That must have been on account of inferior weaving.,59
288,Mr FOWLER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"If the manufacturer uses wool of the proper quality, there is both no trouble whatever in the weaving. Whereas a suit made from these tweeds cost about 75s. or 80s. before the war, a we similar suit costs more than double that There is no justification whatever for that increase. The price of wool has risen to a certain extent, but not sufficient to justify such a jump in the As a simple proof of that, I have only to mention that a woollen singlet of Australian manufacture costs the today 15s., as compared with 7s. 6d. the before the war. I purchased such an article a little time ago, and when I commented on the increase in price I was told - that the price of wool had nearly doubled. That was a very .plausible reply to any proone who would not take the trouble .to investigate the circumstances. As a matter of fact, the woollen manufacturer does not pay double the price he paid before the",59
289,Mr JOWETT,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,The increase has been,59
290,Mr FOWLER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"But even assuming that the price had doubled, there is less than l i b . of wool in a singlet, so that there can be only.an increase of 2s. o r 3s. in that regard; instead of a jump from 7s. 6d. to 15s. Who is getting benefit of such advances ? I feel sure that, in the majority of oases, the proare not the retailers; they are the respect of bigger men in the trade.",59
291,Mr TIJDOR,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,They all do their share.,59
292,Mr FOWLER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"There may be a cerincrease in the profits of the retailers also; but the tronble is that they have to buy from the middleman, and often are the required to buy under conditions which compel them to ask a certain retail price, whether or not they desire to do so: In regard: to these particularclasses, of goods, thei'e is undoubtedly a very powerf u l combination of some kind, which it is the duty of this Parliamentto. cheGk. Is there anything to justify the tremendous increase in the .price of Iboots and shoes? The cost of the raw material, hides and leather, may have in creased to some extent; but the rise in the prices of boots and shoes is out of all proportion. Another matter in connection with these articles, to which strong exception ought to 'be taken, is that, although the prices have gone up so much, the quality has 'gone down, in some cases, beyond all tolerance. A Httle while ago I 'was speaking to a medical friend of mine on that .point. He agreed'with, me that large quantities of foot-gear, especially flbo'ots. and. shoes for children, soaked uip water like sponges, and made it almost impossible for any one abroad, in wet weather, for an hour or two to remain dry-footed; and. he expressed the opinion that, a great arapunt. of the sickness and a good - many of the deaths, in - Australia during the winter were due to nothing more nor less than the defective foot-gear that many of our people, especially the .poorer section, were compelled tp wear. fWTien I was in Western Australia, recently, a boot manufacturer to l d me that one of his greatest troubles, was to procure decent leather to - put into his shoes.

An y married, person with a family knows perfectly well that the cost of l i v inig in regard to nearly all articles has risen at least 50 per.cent. This redoubtedly mark applies to many articles undoubtthat edly of Australian production, which ought not to show any increase. long ago the honourable member for Capmore ricornia (Mr Higgs) indicated that during the war the price of olive oil, leading production of a neighbouring State, and an absolute necessary in cage of many weak children, rose, to nearly three or f o u r times its original Mr Fowler. value: Why should not the Government have interfered to. prevent that exploitation, for which, there was no justificationwhatever? There are many articleso f the same charactersubject to the same influences, yet nothing has been done tostop it . The grazier is getting a f airly good price for his raw material; but I am sure meat could be retailed at a much lower figure, and still give him the same return. When the working man's wife has. to pay 6d. for a mutton, shank, in order to make some broth for a sick child, there is something wrong that needs righting. I ' could give a formidable list of articles of daily consumption in the home, the cost of which has gone up beyond all reason. This is causing much anxiety and hardship in many homes in Australia. I do not know whether it"" would be constitutionally permissible for the Commonwealth to fixthe price of fish, but nothing indicates more thoroughly the stuoidity of parliamentaryaction than what I have learned' i h regard to .the control ^of the fish industry, so far as the "" Stateof Victoria* isconcerned. R'ecen-tlyan old gentlema-n. told' me-that when, he ar.riv.ed' in. Victoria aboutfifty years; ago therewasan in quiry in progress into the price of fish. Since then, at short intervals, therehave been other inquiries: upon the same subject--one - has just beenconcluded-and . certaiu recommendations have been made about the fish, monopoly and the price of' fish, but the controllers of the. trade-, a handfulof aliens, simply goon absolutely heedless of all these inquiries, which have apparently but one result, and that is ' nothing. There is a good deal of social unrest in of food the community, andmuch of it is undue to the profiteering is going on, and to the fact that in many cases breadwinners cannot earn enough- ""to keep their families Not . ih comfort. Nothing breeds revolution than does discontent with social conditions. It is a very significant coma mentary on the work of this and other parliaments that, after all we have done the during these years, theworking man is probably worse off today than he has ever been in the history of Australia. While privation is stalking through' the working-cla6s districts, it is' also t found in that portion of the community usually called the middle class - I beestablished lieve that there are many middle-class homes today where the struggle for exand istence is quite as severe as it is in homes of the working men, and I goods, remind Ministers that the middle class, which is suffering on account of this profiteering, perhaps relatively more than any other portion of the community, the great power that has always stood behind Liberal Governments. In the past it has consistently voted Liberal, but if it gets no relief from a Liberal or National Government, it will look for in other directions. Tf Ministers are wise in tlieir day and generation they will that these middle-class homes which are being exploited, are protected in a thorough fashion against the hardship which has broken into them during the last few years. I know men in fairly , or not. , good positions, as far as appearances go, living in fairly good homes, struggling desperately. and unsuccessfully to make ends meet. Their wives shed tears of bitterness over their inability to make the sums of money that come intothe house go as far as they want, and their children in many cases are' compelled to do without - necessaries of life and go short of. the clothing they need. These people are not going to stand by and support Governments that are indifferent to this kind of thing, and if no change is made before the next election, many of them, for the first time in their history, will be found voting for those who are most likely to afford them relief. At the outset of my remarks I said that the Government had not been very sucI cessful in regard to their control of When this control was being initiated, I ties. suggested to a Minister a method by which I thought better results. would be mission to deal with these matters. achieved} but no notice was taken of suggestion. I submit,now that there is very simple and effective way of dealing with this difficulty. It cannot met by waiting until, the evil is done and then setting clumsy machinery in motion in order to discover-what is a f and reasonable price for an article. one who is acquainted with Ordinary busio be ness' methodscan easily see a means by which a check of an effective kind can be at the very outset of the evil. There are recognised profits in all trades in all branches of trades.' There is the a recognised profit oil the manufacture of on the middleman's handling of those goods, and in the retailing of them. I clo not need to specify it , it is well is enough known. Let us say that 25 per cent, is ah all-round profit on soft goods for the retailer'. All that it is necessary for the Government"" to do in order a to regulate prices is to enact that only it the ordinary recognised trade profits and no others shall be legal during a certain see period. Attempts might be made by bogus transaction to transfer goods from one to very another as nominal sales, but common sense and experience of trade should be able to detect whether sales were genuine Mr .GREENE - Many commodities were who are regulated on those lines.",59
293,Mr FOWLER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"That may have been the intention, but the effect was not very obvious. At any rate, if the Government had established a general principle of that kind at the Outset there would have been , very little to complain of in regard to profiteering at the present time. The system I am suggesting would inflict no hardship uponanybody. It would give the importer, if he were importing, his ordinary profit. It would give the manufacturer, if the goods were manufact u r e d , , the profit he was entitled to. it would be the same with. the. wholesale house, and the same: with the, retailers, but it would undoubtedly protect, the consumer from the plundering, to which he is being subjected at the present time. quite admit that a Bill , of .that kind prices. would require somewhat drastic penalI t would require, also, that power should be given to the Inter-State ComI my believe the Commission is competent a to do it . and would carry out the work very well. If the Commission found that be an undue profit was being exacted in re*gard to any article, it would be its duty to report the case to the Attorney-General, a i r and it would be compulsory on the At Anytorney-General to prosecute. The penalty - . would have to be sufficient to prevent the average person . from taking the risk profiteering. There would be a fine, presume, but, in addition, the person persons found guilty should be sent gaol. A fine of any kind would hardly meet .the circumstances some cases that we know have arisen, and are likely to arise. A fine could profitably paid, and the profiteering on; but if we recognise that the persons gether. who are indulging in profiteering are neither more nor less than waging on the community, and becoming wealthy at the expense of those who are suffering, we are justified in dealing with all offences by means of imprisonment. If the Government cannot expand this meameasure sure in the way I have indicated, I want them to' assure the House before the second reading is passed that they will take the matter up in some other meaa sure, and in some other way. wise, I feel inclined to test the whole question by moving an amendment which would commit the Government to consethroughout quential amendments, bringing about what I desire to enact. I trust, ever, that before the second reading goes taken. through the Government will indicate their' intention to deal with the growing evil of profiteering; because and must be checked, and checked drastically.",61

The Government were assured that they had the power to do so. I was young and innocent at the time, and believed what I was told by the legal luminaries who then abounded in this Chamber. on Even those who were against the Bill agreed that it was constitutional, and effect was that of a thunderbolt when the MCKay harvester crowd took the Comare monwealth Government into Court, beat them by proving that we had not the power under our Constitution to fix pose to cure it? prices.",63

I believe that if we could not do it in time of peace we could not do it in time of war. However, the decision was accepted, and now there is a Bill before us which the Acting Attorney General, with the advice of high legal dignitaries, assures us is constitutional. As a layman, I am going to have the infernal damned cheek tp say that the Bill will be found to be unconstitutional if it",63

315,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"I apologize - Laymen are not supposed to have any opinions on these matters, but laymen learn by experience a great deal more than legal gentlemen do. Even if he has had' experience, a legal man will not admit it, he believes that lie will get clients who will go to law on his advice afterwards, and that he will be. able to make weremoney out of them. My opinion is that this Parliament has not these powers. Attorney-General says we have them so far as this Bill is concerned. ' I submit, as a layman, that if we canfixprices dairy produce, wool, sugar, fl-ax, and wheat, we canfixprices also for boots and woollen goods. It does not require any sage from the brick-court temple to assure the general public that that is common s sense. It is bad law to say that we can do the one thing and not the other. Those the Government side say that profiteering is a horror.

If .the remarks of honourable members constitute a true reflex of the opinions of the people whom they represent, there must be something very near to unanimity on the part of the general public in regard to suppressing profiteering; but if the Government and their supporters mean nothing at all , then no such Bill w i brought in . Possibly the Government intend to do something of the k in d ; but if that is so, is there any reason why they should not tell us? If the Government will not bring in such a measure, then they aiid their supporters are utterly in sincere when they prate about their desire to prevent profiteering Having had your permission to. address this House, Mr Speaker, may I ask the permission of the Argus to address myself to some questions which have - already been dealt with? The Argus protests against honourable members in this Chamber stressing those questions, and-show r ing how it hurts the Argus for us to do so - it abuses us when we do stress them. Nevertheless, I propose to .do so again. If the producer is to be considered in the fixing of prices, the consumer should certainly have a voice.",64
318,Mr JOWETT,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Hear , hear!",64
319,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Of course; but if the Government continues to appoint in dividuals to the various Committees in the same way as has been the practice, then the. consumer will not be either con-' sidered or represented at all. The basic idea in fixing prices is that the primary producer shall get a fair return for his product. He has as much right to get. full value for his product as has the labourer to receive full value for his hire. There seems to be a misunderstanding with respect to our producers. I do uot call an individual who makes profits out of wool a primary producer. [ call him a ""vampirate."" He is of the type that sucks the blood of the people. But if we"" consent to-place that class of individual in the list of primary producers, even the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) will admit that the man who has to purchase wool has as much right to be given representation as the man who produced it . If that is not the case, then, the Wool Pool, .so far as the people are concerned, is useless. It is only right that both producer and consumer should be represented in the Pool. I know that it goes hard for the "" boss "" to say that the man who works for him , and the customer l l be - who purchases fromh i m , shall have a right to any voice'in the running of his business. Yet both worker and consumer can rightly maintain that they have as much interest in. the production of a commodity as has the producer himself. It is unarguable that the consumer should be represented on the Committees. I would like to see an amendment moved, when this measure is in Committee, with the idea of giving direct representation to the consumer. If such a question came to a division, we would discover the real friends of the consumer in this House. Why are the representatives of the primary producer complacently agreeable to the fixation of prices for the commodities mentioned in the Bill? 'We have not heard a word of objection from country representatives. Why has there been no voice raised by those who are here m behalf-of. the producer? It is because the producer has done so well under the fixation of prices during the war that he desires to continue the system. And if that is a correct statement of the situation-as I believe it to be-the n all the howling against the fixation of prices has been a farce. Why are the representatives of the producer complacently permitting the system to be extended ? There is only one reason.",64
320,Mr FLEMING,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"They know that' the Government entered into certain contracts', and do not want to treat them as a scrap of paper.",64

323,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Honourable mem: bers make pretence about how they represent the primary producer, but they sneer at honourable members on this side, and, at the same time, utter no word against fixation of prices under this measure.

It is not fair to fix the price of butter if we do not, a.fc the same time, fix the price of the separator which must he used in the production, of butter. is not one word heard about fixing the prices of . commodities necessary primary production. The reason, of course, is that producers have done so able-member- - aware that the - several States well under the system of fixation, so far as it hasgone, that they are willing to see it perpetuated. And all the talk of their representatives in this chamber i howling down fixation has been so much tralia-. ""flapdoodle."" The fixation of prices recognised that fact. during the war proved a farce. Ask the Minister concerned how it has worked out; and, if ' he tells the whole truth will say that it was a very good thing for those who produced the commodities concerned. Prices were fixed so that the people happily affected thereby are now naturally keen to continue. wealth. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) has just stated that the that. reason for perpetuating the system is that certain contracts have been made which must be honoured.",65

Thafc being so, let honourable members wipe aside all the sham; and let the Government say straight out that they are satisfied to have, keep the system going because the pastpeople behind them are making' good, profits.

335,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"That is so. It is idle to-say that the task of dealing with profiteering should be leftto the States. The Commonwealth has power to prohibit the importation of any commodity detrimental to the health or morals of the people, but should such a commodity be made, say, in Victoria, this Parliament has no power to prevent it going into New South Wales. It is impossible for any State Parliament to deal effectively witli profiteering and the high cost of living. This Parliament represents flesh and blood, whereas in every State the power of veto is in the hands of the Upper House, which is either representative of broad acres alone or is merely a nominee chamber. Those who compare the capacity of this Parliament to legislate for the whole of the people with, that of any State Parliament, know that they are trying to put the position unfairly. We have heard a good deal of Bolshevism; and, having regard to the Commonwealth franchise, the man who talks of Bolshevism talks rot. But when a man says that a bit of Bolshevism is necessary to extend the power of this Parliament, h© is not far wrong. In every State a bit of Bolshevism is necessary to tear down the rotteu Upper House system.

341,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,Thos e figures relate to the increase in prices only during one month.,66
342,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"They show that during the month of May the cost Of livin g went up in every State, with the exception of Queensland. That was the position eight months after the armistice"", when - we expected that the' cost of commodities would immediately be reduced. On every hand men were advised when the armistice was signed not to lay in big stocks, since there was sure to be an immediate drop in prices. I have come to the conclusion that those who gave that advice either wanted to purchase large stocks for themselves, or had already done so, and that they have taken care not to allow prices to come down.. The whole situation today is governed by the high cost of living. Is it any wonder that we have turmoil and strife in Australia? The Ministerial party and their press supporters profess to be Victorian horrified at the (failure of the seamen to resort to constitutional methods to redress their grievances. They complain bitterly that the men have taken direct action. Do they not know that in practically every country the same course is being pursued, and that this is only hecause' of the increased cost of living, which has become unbearable? trouble today is that prices are so high that the ""working classes cannot hope to exist on the wages they are receiving. How does a working man support himself, his wife, aud a family of four on a wage of £3 per week? Thousands are contriving to do so on an even lower wage.",66

345,Mr MCGRATH,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,An incapacitated - soldier and his wife receive 45s. per week.,67
346,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Quite so. Honourable members opposite and the Conservative press which supports them, are aware of this fact, hut they will not place the real position fairly and squarely before the public. But for the high cost of living, I do not think the seamen's strike would have occurred. The great majority of the men found that, they could not support their wives and families on the wages they were receiving, and they were forced to take action. With my knowledge of the position of .those who return me to this ITouse, I am not surprised that there is trouble. As far back as November last I prophesied in this House that trouble would occur if action were not taken to reduce the cost of living. Honourable members then laughed at me, and nothing .was done. Is it not possible that the trouble in Melbourne during the last few days may spread? Do honourable members think there is no likelihood of its recurrence.? Do they not realise that if the dissatisfaction in regard to the high cost of living 'becomes deeper seated, it will be, not a few hundreds, hut tens of thousands, who will rise in indignation. The Government may say, ""We have the loyalist soldiers behind us, and will bring out machine gun's and shoot down the people if they rise."". Do they want an opportunity to shoot down the people who rise to maintain their rights ? I am sure they do not. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - What particular rights ?",67
347,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"The right to live. Having regard to the higher cost of comThe modities, the masses of the 'people find it practically impossible to exist on the wages they receive. Even a man in receipt of a salary of £500 a year complains that its purchasing power, as compared with what it was five years ago, has Ibeen reduced by one-half. The price of everything has gone up, and the people will no longer tolerate the situation. Government supporters say that the seamen are foolish to go out on strike, that by doing so they only accentuate the distress, and that they should avail themselves of the Arbitration Court. But the men were forced by dire necessity to take action. I could take honourable members to street after street in any electorate, where the position of residents would be had enough even if they were in regular work; ibut when aman is in work for a week, and out of work for a month, while the rent and the butcher's and baker's bills are running on all the time, is it any wonder that trouble occurs? Is it any wonder that men revolt, and avail themselves of methods which they think superior to those of the Arbitration Court, with its delays and its costs? The position in Australia today is very like that obtaining in Britain. Can any one read in today's press of the situation in Great Britain without realizing that it is most serious ? We all recognise its seriousness, and, I am sure, deeply regret it. We know that if it continues it must mean .""good-bye"" to the great power which Britain is supposed to wield.",67

356,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"I am endeavouring to deal with the Bill , and doing, it very well if I am to judge by the interjections of honourable members opposite. We have been having trouble lately because of the high cost of living, but the same thing, is taking place all over the world. The object of this Bill is to fix the prices of a few commodities in w h i c h ' I admit the wage-earning section of the community is interested. But if it is a good thing in the interests of the community that the prices of these commodities should be fixed, it is equally a good thing for the community that the prices of all commodities should! be fixed - in the same way, and the Government should endeavour t'o secure for this Parliament the powers necessary for that purpose. The need for the fixation of prices is greater now than it used to be in days gone by. At one time there were only a few profiteers. For instance, the squatter was a profiteer. He always has been, and always will be. The great manufacturers and large importers were profiteers. The success of their profiteering was so apparent that - today every one is trying to emulate them, and we are confronted' with quite an inordinate amount of profiteering. People who never handle, and only give advice concerning commodities expect now to be permitted to profiteer. The Government control sugar in this country. I have a letter here from the Federation of Retail Grocers Associations of Australia.' I shall not read the whole of it , but I make this quotation from, it Oil the 5th June] Senator. Russell, speaking on behalf of. the. Government in the Sena'te; 'said"" We admit that retailers of butter and - sugarare not . getting sufficient', but' Both these articlesare now und'er eon- - sidcratdon by the Prices Commissioner and the Minister in charge of the Department, and I hope that the grievance will be remedied' immediately. Neither oftliese lines has yet been placed! on a payable basis, and, as they constitute-about one-third of the average grocers' business, the effect on tin; trade has been serious."" The grocers want to be able to sell these commoditiesat higher prices. They say that the men who produce butter and sugar have the prices of those commodities fixed at a rate which pays them to produce them. In that the grocers are quite correct, because the producers of those commodities desire that the Government should continue to fix the prices. It is clear, that the producer of sugar and the producer of butter are satisfied, because not one of their representatives has raised a voice in this House against the fixing of their prices. The grocer says that if we fix the price of sugar and of butter at a certain rate which is a payable rate for the producers of those commodities, we should fix their retail prices at a. rate which, will make it payable for grocers to retail them.",68
357,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"The grocer makes a great deal less money,than does the honourable member.",69
358,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"I am advocating the cause of the poor little grocer, and the honourable member is attacking him - I doi not know what the fact that I get more than does the little grocer has to do with the matter. I do not get more than I am worth, but the honourable member does.",69
359,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,".The grocer gets a lot less, and does three times more work than does the honourable member.",69
360,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"/The grocer has put his case before members of this Parliament, and I candidly say that I think he is justified when he contends that the Government should allow him a fair profit upon the commodities he sells when they permit the producers of those commodities to make a fair profit. The trouble is that the retail grocer has no representative in this House. His vote is not so strong as that of the primary producers, or there would be some one taking his part in this chamber. There are men in Melbourne who are making a large amount of profit by selling sugar as mere intermediaries between the refining establishment and the retailgrocer.",69
361,Mr RICHAR DFOSTER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,I am certain that the honourable member cannot prove that. T challenge him to do so.,69
362,Mr CORSER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"I think that the honourable member is mistaken. Two and a half per cent, is as much as they make.",69
363,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"They do nothing - for the 2 i per cent. Their work is represented merely by a book entry. A grocer goes to a wholesale warehouse in Melbourne, and orders a ton of sugar. The wholesale grocer never handles the sugar, which is taken direct from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's stores to the retail grocer's shop. . There is a book entry made in the wholesale grocer's books, and for that he gets 2 \ per cent.",69
364,Mr CORSER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,That is not always the case.,69
365,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"That is the way in which the greater portion of the sugar is dealt with . We have a firm in Melbourne called Moran and Cato, which has an advantage over other grocers.' The' honor little knows a. man who gets 2-J per cent, on all the' sugar that goes into Rockhampton. Moran^and Cato get sugar direct from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, 'and thus save the 2 i per cent, which otlier retai l grocers have to pay. The Retail Grocers Association is' composed of a number of grocers who have banded themselves together to buy wholesale lines, so that they may be in a position to retail commodities to their customers as cheaply as do others who are given greater advantages in dealing in those commodities. Why were not these men permitted to purchase sugar at the same price .as that at which Moran and Cato could purchase it , and so save 2 \ per cent. ? . Mr CORSER - Co-operativ e companies can do .that.",69
366,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"They may be able to do it now, but they could not do it a few months ago. At last it has been agreed that this co-operative company may go to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and obtain their sugar direct, and so save the 2 \ per cent. If a cooperative company may do so, then every little grocer i i i Australia should have the same right, and should not be required to . pay 2 \ per cent, commission to a middleman.",69
367,Mr JOWETT,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,Quite so. Who prevents ' it?,69
368,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"The - Government prevent it , since they have the control of sugar..",69
369,Mr JOWETT,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,Surely not. What does the Minister say to this?,69
370,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"He may pass it on to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, who are bad enough for anything. I say that, throughout our trading concerns, there are secret commissions and rebates operating against the small trader. Why should not a draper, who wishes to purchase a dozen hats, be able to go to the manufacturer of hats and purchase them 1 Why should not a tailor be able to go to the manufacturer .of woollens and buy what he requires ? They are not allowed to do it . That is where the profiteering comes in . The middleman and intermediary establishes an office, without expense, with only a brass plate, a typewriter, and a messenger boy, and he makes money out of the passing of commodities from the manufacturer to the retailer.",69
371,Mr CORSER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,The honourable member is mistaken. Many of them carry very big stooks.,70
372,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member must know that some of these people never handle the goods thab they ,pass on from the manufacturer to the retailer.",70
373,Mr CORSER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,The honourable . member is absolutely wrong.,70
374,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"I know that what I am saying is true in respect of sugar, and of woollens, and of boots. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) the other day showed me a bundle of tweeds manufactured in Sydney. They were very gOD-d material. They were labelled with the prices which the manufacturer gets from the wholesale houses, and these ranged from 9s. 6d. to 12s. 6d. per yard. The material which was priced at 12s. 6d. per yard could not be purchased in any warehouse at under £ 1 per yard. A profit of 7s. 6d. on 12s. 6d. is altogether too much; but that cannot be prevented. The retailer cannot go to the manufacturer to buy. because if the manufacturer sells to him the wholesale houses beat the manufacturer. The man who had the tweeds I refer to admitted that the prices 'charged by the manufacturer were 40 per cent, in' advance of the pre-war prices. Bufc when they get into the warehouses, it is not a question of 40 per cent., but of from 150 per cent, fco 250 per cent, in advance of pre-war prices. One can go into some of ' the leading tailors' shops today and be' shown material that is priced at from £ 2 2s. 6d. to £ 2 5s. per yard. In the pre-war period, that material would be sold at about 17s. per yard. Between the local manufacturer and the warehouses, which deal in both imported and locallvimported stuff, the people are robbed. Why do not the Government try to settle some of those questions? If it Is legal to follow wool and arrange for its pooling, and to fix its ' price, why not do the same with the products of wool ? I would just as soon be robbed V-y the poor squatter as by the poor warehouseman, or the poor landlord; indeed, I would rather the producer, as against the middleman, gefc the extra profits; and in this view I ought to have the suooort of the producers' representatives.",70
375,Mr JOWETT,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,You know my views on that question.,70
376,Mr MATHEWS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"I do. The Government, although they know that this is the only Parliament that can deal with the matter effectively, have done nothing. It is a farce for the Government and their supporters to tell us they desire to settle the question unless they give some proof of their earnestness. There is, indeed, only one way in which the Government can achieve the desired end, and fchafc is to acquire the necessary powers, instead of placing before us a Bill which we know - is not constitutional, and will not stand the test of the High Court.« However, we know that the producers of dairy produce, wool, sugar, flax, and wheat have done so'well under the fixation of prices that they do not care how long it lasts; and so the Government go on, and the people are robbed without hope of redress.",70
377,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Wakefield) [9.181 - I should not have interposed in the debate but for some statements made here that are absolutely, though, no doubt, - unintentionally, inaccurate. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), I am sure unwittingly, quoted figures which are not accurate;, and .to one who, like myself, has had considerable experience in business, and is conversant with prices, ib .is distressing that such statements as to profiteering, or the exacting of undue profits, should so out to inflame the public mind. If honourable members desire to convey a true impression to the people as fcofchecost of living, it would* be advisable for them - ill the absence of individual knowledge of trading and current prices, to pin their faith to Mr Knibbs, for there is nothing more reliable than the statements issued from mouth to month by that gentleman. So far as the essential necessariesof life are concerned, the increase in the cost of living in^Australia, according to Mr Knibbs. is not much more than half what has >-een attributed toprofiteers by honourable members. Reference was made by one honourable member' to sugar and items in the produce trade, but except in the case of men who have an enormous turnover, there is no profiteering, and no big profits made in any part of Australia; in deed, the profits that the average man in this particular trade makes in a. year do not equal the parliamentary salary of honourable members. As to profiteering generally, I say, as 1I have said before, that T have ho sympathy with it , and I am no apologist for the profiteer. We must look at this question fairly, and if honourable members say there are profiteers, let them be nameddo not let us continue to have all these innuendoes.

While the honourable member was at the war it was held up, not by the tanners, but on their account; and was oh the wharfs of Australia for many months, or a year or two, together. All t'he capital involved was lying idle, because it was not possible to ship the leather to the Old Country. In the matter of clothing there has, no doubt, been profiteering, and the profiteers have very properly been made to pay 50 per cent, and 75 ner cent, into the Treasury. But to say there are warehouses filled from floor to ceiling is absolutely untrue, as every man familiar with trade knows.

I ask Ministers to take this suggestion into serious consideration. I desire to get from the Acting Attorney-General a legal opinion upon a point in respect of which I am in doubt.

We have made certain bargains which must be honoured. However much I doubt that Parliament has the power which the Government say it has, I trust for the honour of Australia and this Parliament that their contention, is correct. The Acting Attorney-General (Mr . Groom) in his explanation of the Bill , did not seem to be very emphatic. He stated that the war. would, end when ratifications were exchanged.. Ratifications, between whom ? Germany has ratified, the Peace agreement-;' Great B r it a in has yet to do that, but the K in g and' his Cabinet may do that without consulting Parliament.. There is another doubtful point: Haye the. ratifications, to be exchanged between all the>nations, that were at War., or is it sufficient for our purpose that they be exchanged between Great Britain and Germany?. Or, as we were also, at war. with Austria, Bulgaria,, and Turkey, must we wait until-peace negotiations aTe completed and ratified with those countries? If it-simply means-that we have only to wait u n t i l the state of war between Go-eat Britain and Germany ceases, the Government have cut things very fine, for as soon as Great B r it a in has ratified the Peace with Germany that will be the end of the war so far as Australia is concerned. In those circumstances, it seems, to me it is absolutely necessary to-get this Bill through immediately if the Commonwealth be constitutionally entitled to exercise the power vvhich it seeks to confer. There has been a good deal of talk during the course of this debate about profiteering. The other day I was very much struck by a speech delivered .by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr-. Yates), who quoted.statistics to show that, with 'a. smaller-number of sheep, the wool growers had earned more money for the wool groWm on the sheep'. The honourable; member, may be correct, but', at the same time, there may have been no profits on the sale of that wool> forduring the drought of 1914 many pastoralists lost three-quarters of their sheep, and others lost the whole of their flocks. I think it will be granted that in the year following the loss of three-quarters of his breeding ewes it would cost a pastoralist four times what it would cost in an ordinary year to produce the number of. lambs he would breed; from the balance of the ewes. H is station expenses would be just the same as in thenormal, years. H is interest on thecapital involved would go on just the same.",73
415,Mr YATES,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"The pastoralists did not lose a quarter of their sheep. It was a drop from ll-,000,000 to 10,000,000 sheep.",73
416,Mr LECKIE,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Some of the pastoralists lost three-quarters of their sheep, and the cost of growing, their wool and. breeding their lambs in. the year following was manifestly a great deaf.higher than it wasbefore the. drought,, so that, instead; of profiteering in regard to wool, they actually lost income, and inmanycases capital also. The men whot r y to create the impression that profiteering occurs,among primary-producers are-those whoi represent large city constituencies;, whoj from the very nature of theirl if e and training,, have no knowledge of the details of thegreat primary producing in terests. Before they make such statements as those made by the honourable member for Adelaide, it would be well for them to seek a little information from those who know something about the primaryproducers and the risks they take, and the methods they employ, in pro'dueing wool and other commodities.",73
417,Mr YATES,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,I did nothing but quote the figures given by the Inter-State Commission.,73
418,Mr LECKIE,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,But the unfortunate thing.is that the honourable member interpreted them in the wrong way.,73
419,Mr TUDOR,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,There are more sheep in Victoria at the present time than there have ever been; yet meat is dearer.,73
420,Mr LECKIE,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"I hope that the honourable member is hot like the honourable member for Melbourne Porta (Mr . Mathews), who, a few minutes ago, after declaiming against profiteering, UTged the Government to increase the price of sugar and butter on behalf of the small grocers. Since this Parliament has met ""there has been a good deal of facing both ways. A schedule to this Bill provides retail price of sugar shall not be more than 3£d. per lb. That is price fixing pure and simple, and honourable members opposite, seeing that schedule, may be forgiven forsaying that if the Government have the power to fix the retail price of sugar, surely they have the power to fix the price of other commodities. It seems to me that even if the legal opinion the Minister has received is in favour of the Commonwealth having the powers set forth in this Bill , the particular power sought in this respect is open to very grave doubt. The position in regard to sugar is likely to be very serious. At the beginning of the war raw sugar was sold at £14 per ton, but since the last agreement was entered into the growers have been getting £21 per ton for raw sugar. That is an advance of 50 per cent., and I think that the people of Australia have considerable reason for doubting that the cost of producing sugar has increased by as much as £ 7 per ton. The consumption of this commodity being about; 285,000 tons per annum, the consumers are called upon to pay nearly £2,000,000 by way of a bonus to the growers in Queensland and New South Wales. But those growers are not the only people concerned in the sugar industry, aud it is just as well for Ministers to look further abroad. Of course, it - is very easy out of public funds to in crease the price to be paid to any particular section of producers, but it is very hard to see the actual results achieved. So far, the actual result of the fixation of the price of sugar at a very high figure has not been as adverse as it might have been because of the heavy cost of freights aud the shortage of shipping during the war, but if it is proposed to continue the present high .price of sugar during the years to come, when commerce becomes normal again and freights are lower, the result will be disastrous to the f r u it growers and the jam-making industry in the southern States. Of late years the Mr Leckie. . fruit-growing industry has assumed large proportions in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and Western Australia, and great strides have been made by jam-makers aud the preserved f r u it industry.",73
421,Mr COBSEB,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,They are more highly that the protected than is the sugar industry.,74
422,Mr LECKIE,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Returne d soldiers are being encouraged to settle on irrigated land along the River Murray, and they are producing peaches, apricots', and other soft fruits for preserving. If the manufacturers are not to get sugar at a reasonable price compared with that which prevails in the outside world, then those industries that are growing up in Australia, and some of which the war has enabled to establish themselves, will be endangered. I shall not offer any objections to the Bill as it stands, although I have grave doubts whether the part dealing with sugar is legal. I hope the Government have the power they say they have, but we must be thankfu l that it is not this House, but an outside body, which has the' duty of deciding the point. I trust that-the Government have the power, because it will be disastrous to Australia if they find, after all,, that they do not possess it . In the meantime, until the term of this Bill runs out, I urge the Government to consider seriously the position of the sugar industry, coupled with the position of the jam and fruit-preserving industry. This great in dustry, which is growing up in the southern States is, after all, a white man's industry, and I hope it will not be obliterated for the sake of bolstering up, by artificial prices, the sugar-growers of the northern States. .",74
423,Mr CONSIDINE,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"B a r r i e r ) [9.52] --It appears to me that those concerned in the particular commodities enumerated in the Bil l are simply looking after their' own interests. It is the War-time Profits Bill over again, so far as I am concerned. If the powers which the Government claim under this Bill depend upon the War Precautions Act, or upon the existence of a state of war, it appears to me that they must cease once peace is declared. When the Acting Attorney-General was introducing the Bill I asked bim whether the Government possessed the power, .prior to the passing of the War Precautions' Act, to deal with the matters contained in this Bill. The honourable gentleman evaded that point. He said that the Government had certain advice that they were within their powers in passing this measure. The fact remains that if the Federal Parliament did not possess the power to deal with these matters prior to the passing of the War Precautions Act , they will not possess those powers when the War Precautions Act ceases to operate. The case of thp tanners tends to support that view. The Defence Department wanted them to supply their leather at a price fixed under the War Precautions Act. The tanners did not supply the boot manufacturers with leather at that price, but the Government did not prosecute them, although they threatened them with the penalties of the Act. am given to understand that the tanners told the Government that they were quite - willing to test that Act. If the Government had not the power to enforce the Act on the tanners, there does not seem to be much chance of their having the power to deal with the matters enumerated in this Bill . To me the whole business seems to be much on a par with the way the ship-owners are looking after their own interests at the present time. Apparently the wool and other industries mentioned in the measure are' looking after, their own interests, and the Bil l does not matter one iota to the general public, and particularly to the working-class community. As the honourable member for Indi (Mr Leckie) said, it is merely a"" wrangle between the so called primary - producers and the manufacturing industries, and the only question which the workers of the community are interested dn is which of the two is the profiteer. I am of opinion that both are, and the honourable gentlemen ' who represant the profiteering interests affected by the Bill are simply looking after the profiteers. ' So far as the general body of the pu.blic is concerned, it does not matter one iota whether the Bill is passed or lost.",74
424,Mr CORSER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,Wide Bay) [9.561 - It is necessary to answer a few statements that have been made to-night. The honourable member for Indi ' (Mr Leckie) spoke of the sugar industry and the effect of the protection of that industry upon the dried f r u it and jam industries. Perhaps the honourable member is not aware that the people of Australia are getting sugar grown in Queensland far cheaper than they could import it . Sugar could not be imported now under about £ 5 1 per ton.,75
425,Mr LECKIE,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,How long has that been so?,75
426,Mr CORSER,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Neve r mind how long it has been so. It is so now, and the honourable member was dealing with the present. It.comes with a very bad grace from membere who represent the f r u it districts to criticise adversely the protective duty upon sugar when their industries enjoy far greater protection. In the past my firm has imported dried fruit s I from Spain and Greece. These were landed in Australia at 2£d. per lb. The duty upon those fruits is now 3d. per l b . , or very nearly 110 per cent. All'that you could make out of the protection on sugar is about 28 per cent. The rise in the price of sugar was found absolutely essential on account of the higher cost, of living and the liigher wages that had to be paid by the producers. In view of the great losses thatthose engaged in the sugar industry have sustained through cyclones, drought, aiui frosts, there are very few industries in Australia that are giving less profit today than the sugar industry is. It is as well also to point out that the jam industry is protected to an enormous extent. These manufacturers have a protective duty of 2d. per lb., which is higher than the protection upon sugar. Those who.represent the jam and f r u it industries of the various States must have a very bad case to use arguments which can be so easily refuted. As a matter of fact, today they .are enjoying privileges which we in Queensland do notenjoy. Everv man who has the interests of the Commonwealth at heart should take care to see that we occupy effectively the north-eastern seaboard of Queensland. We can only do so by tropical and semi-tropical cultivation. If we do not do this, we may possibly have in this country the Indians, who, of course, belong to the Empire, and perhaps some of our AlHes who live not very far from us. I question very much whether those people who now make such a fuss about the protection of the sugar industry, more particularly the growers of fruit s and manufacturers of - measure jams and preserves, would find that stalte of things to their advantage. be wise for them to leave well alone. So fair as this Bill is concerned, the other ? Government have had ample power up 'to the present time to acquire the sugar they have acquired, and also other goods, under the War Precautions Act. simply seek, under this Bill , to extend that power until the existing contracts run out. That seems to be a fair thing, and good business as well, and I do not tinuedsee why objection should be raised to the Government carrying out their contracts has with the Queensland Government in reregard spect to sugar, or with any authority i regard to any .of the other commodities.",75
427,Mr GROOM,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Darling Downs-Minis - case ter for Works and Railways and Acting Attorney-General) [10.0] - On e or two Court points have been raised during the course of the debate which call for reply. I ' sire to devote some attention, to the legal aspect of the measure. The^question been raised, "" Why is it that, if the Government can exercise the powers of pricement fixing in connection with the products garded mentioned, they cannot take up a general measure of price fixiVig ?"" which the Government exercised under the War Precautions Act 'was a 'defence power. Certain regulations under Act were challenged in connection price fixing; and, in their judgments, the majority of the Justices of the High .part Court pointed out how very wide and 'extensive was the power of the CommonEmpire's wealth during the period of war. de'fence power was really the power of self-preservation, of the nation. Chief Justice remarked, in the course of his judgment in this case (Farcy v. B - veti, 21 C.L.R. 433, at"" page 441)I agree generally with Mr Mann's argument that the power to legislate with respect to defence .extends to any law which may tend to the conservation or development of the sources .of the Commonwealth - so far as they can he directed to success in war, or may 'to distress the enemy or diminish his rehand, sources, - as. for instance, 'by the prohibition 'trading with .'him or w-ifh persons associated with hirn. But this definition is .not exhaustive. The control of finance or trade may be the most potent weapon of all. One test, however, must always be applied, namely : Can the in question conduce to the efficiency of the forcesjof the Empire, or is the connection pf It would cause - and cll'ect between the measure and the desired efficiency so remote that the one cannot reasonably be regarded as affecting the Referring to the fact that in a Federation such as exists in. Australia there are two distinct powers in existence, namely, the They Federal power and the State power, and that there are questions constantly arising as to vvhich power particular legislat i o n falls 'under, the Chief Justice ConIt is-true that up to the present time no case decided that in answering that inquiry may be had to extrinsic temporary cirn cumstances of which the Court takes judicial notice. But,,in my judgment, the principle'is - the same in all cases. The inquiry in every is whether the Act impeached is or may be substantially an exercise of a power conierred on the Parliament. In making the inquiry the cannotshut its eyes to the fact that what could not rationally be regarded as a measure deof defence in - time of peace may be obviously a measure of defence in time ot war. has He stated at - a later stage-A law passed by the Commonwealth Parliain time 'of iprofound peace prohibiting the accumulating of foodstuffs, could not be reas substantially an exercise of. the defence power. In time of war the same act The power might well be made a capital offence. Then Mr Justice Barton, referring to the utilization .of our resources for Empire the purposes, and on behalf of the Allies, with said, at page 448To aid in .supplying the food-needs of any of the Empire outside Australia or of Australia herself, may greatly assist that defence, especially, but not only, when 1 Its ""that supply may be used for the feeding of armies of which 'at this moment Australia forms an active part. To .employ that resource The may be one of the many methods of contributing to success. u f - Still further, referring to the fixing of the price of bread, His Honour saidIf the object of this 'Order and the Regulation on .which it depends, and, indeed, of the portion of section 4 in dispute, is of either of two kinds, renamely, the augmentation of the 'food supplies at the - disposal of - the Mother Country, tend or of any of our Allies, or, on the other the augmentation of the food supplies of at the disposal of 'our Government and people's; eitherobject is; in my-'opinion, a legitimate means of defence in time of war; and whether these means, or eitlier of them, be necessary must be a question for our Parliament, or the authority validly delegated by it for the purpose, to determine. Mr Justice Isaacs pointed out how wide is this power, and he stated, at page 455AsI read the Constitution, the Commonwealth, when charged with the duty of defending Commonwealth and States, is armed as a self-governing portion of the British"" Dominion with a legislative power to do in relation to national defence al l that Parliament, as the legislative organ of the nation, may deem advisable to enact, in relation to the defence of Australia as a component part of the Empire, u power which is commensurate with the peril it is designed to encounter, or as that peril may appear to the Parliament itself; and, if need be, it is a power to command, control, organize, and regulate, for the 'purpose of guarding against that peril, the whole resources of the continent, living and inert, and the activities of everyinhabitant of the territory. I have called attention to those remarks of the High Court Justices to emphasize how wide is this power of defence in time of war. During the war the Commonwealth Government exercised its powers .to organize the resources of the country for the purposes of the Empire. ""We took control over wheat,'wool, butter, and'flax; and also, for our own local purposes; we took control over sugar. In ordinary circumstances-that is, in normal times- ' the Commonwealth has no power to enter into the domain of State legislation and enact general price-fixing measures, or to invade any of the reserved powers of the States; but during time of war those reserved powers must yield to national emergency, where necessary, for defence purposes. The view is upheld .by the High Court that during a period of war these powers can be invaded. To effectively exercise this wide power of control over our resources it must he. done for certain definite terms. In dealing with wool, it was necessary to make contracts extending over long periods; and the same applies to dairy and other products. I ask honourable members to look upon the exercise of these powers in this light, namely, that during the period of the war the Commonwealth had legal power to organize the resources concerned and enter"" into contracts which might extend beyond the actual period of hostilities.",76
428,Mr HIGQS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,You could abolish the States in that way. You took the powers during the war.,77
429,Mr GROOM,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"We could not do so, nor did the opinion of counsel bear out that we could do so. As regards the competence of Parliament i enact the Bill now before the . House, I have given the. opinion of the whole of the counsel who furnished advice on the matter. Those legal gentlemen spent much time in arriving at the conclusions indicated. I presided over the meetings held in Melbourne, and journeyed to Sydney on several occasions to preside over deliberations there. The opinions were most carefully arrived at, and they are confined to the actual activities included in the Bill. The circumstances and conditions which we placed before those gentlemen are set out in' the preamble of this measure. Take the matter of butter, for.in-stfanoe. There is a distinct contract made, by .the Commonwealth which extends over a period beyond the actual term of the war. In order, to effectively organize the resources of the Commonwealth, and to make thebutter industry useful for Imperial purposes, complete control had.to be exercised, for the period concerned, and it had to he organized in. order to secure the effective carrying"" - out of the - contract) while at - ' the ' - same time conserving the - interests of - the people of Australia. 'A Butter 'Committee had to ' be appointed and given definite powers. We had to take power'for the acquisition of the butter, and to fix the price qf it , to enable these conditions to be properly adjusted in the interests of, not only the Commonwealth, but the' Empire as a whole. The certificates given by counsel were-given after, the facts and circumstances' had been placed before them. It is essential to the carrying out of the arrangements so made that these powers should be continued up to the date of-the ' termination of the contract. - Mr FINLAYSON - Then all that was necessary was a Bill to validate' the contract.",77
430,Mr GROOM,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"It was necessary, not only tovalidate thecontract, but to give effect to it , and a certain executive agency was brought into being for that purpose. Power to acquire the butter and to fix the price of it was essential to the effective carrying out of the contract All this was an exercise of the Defence power. Again, when we came to carry out our sugar scheme, several different powers had to be exercised. Not only had we to make a contract with the Queensland Government, but, in order to secure an adequate supply of sugar for the people, we had to make contracts some time ahead. The honourable member will recognise the reasonableness of that position. '",77
431,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,There is no question as to that.,78
432,Mr GROOM,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"That was one of the foundation principles. In order to carry out the scheme which the Government had organized in regard to sugar, we had, first of all, to secure supplies for the people of Australia. That involved the making of a contract with the Queensland Government for the acquisition of the raw sugar, and so to secure a continuance of the growing of sugar cane. The local production being insuifieient to meet our own requirements, we had then by importations to secure the sugar necessary to make good the shortage. We had also to make contracts with, the refinery companies to secure the refining of the sugar; to arrange for its distribution amongst the people, and to fix the price so that excessive charges should not be made. The price fixing for which this Bill provides is merely that which was necessary to meet the conditions existing during the war, and which still continues, and it is an exercise of the power necessary to complete the scheme which was initiated and carried on by the Government during the period of the war.",78
433,Mr HIGGS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Hav e the Government consulted the Colonial Sugar Refining Oompany about the matter? - Mr GROOM - I am dealing with the constitutional position, and with that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has nothing to do. This is a scheme which the Government are carrying out in the in terests of, not only Australia, but the Empire, and at the honourable member's own request I am dealing with certain points raised, by him. I could, if desired, tell the House of the other agencies covered by this Bill , and show why it is absolutely essential in each case that such legislation should be passed. These commercial activities will probably be in operation at the termination of the war. They arose out of our war obligations from which we are not released by the mere ending of the war. We are exercising, the Defence power, and included in or incidental to that is the power to carry out and complete those contracts, that were entered into duriiig the war period. It may be said that the powers which we seek in this Bill are practically being exercised only to enable us to wind up all these commercial activities. The legal opinion given as to the competency of the Parliament to pass such a measure is no justification for the assertion of honourable members opposite that, since we have power to pass legislation to wind up these activities now that the war is over, we have power to invade the legislative domain of the States, and to take upon ourselves for all time the authority - to fix prices generally. We have no constitutional authority to do anything of thekind. The legal opinions as to the competence of the Parliament to pass this legislation were - based upon facts in a general way placed before counsel, which I have already submitted' to the House. I hope honourable members will recognise that, however desiraJble it may 'be that the Commonwealth should have wider powers, the position is that which I . have stated. As Acting Attorney General, I have to advise the House as to whether it is competent'for the Parliament to pass this Bill , and I have no hesitation in saying that there is no justification for suggesting that because, during the war, we exercised the power of price fixing, we are entitled to arrogate to ourselves unlimited authority tp fix prices generally for all time, and so, in effect, to vary the Constitution. I hope I have made myself clear.",78
434,Mr HIGGS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,The honourable gentleman's statement is perfectly clear ; but his views will be in opposition to the proposals to do away with profiteering which will be made Iby the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) when he returns.,78
435,Mr GROOM,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Not at all. Prime Minister will put before the House in his own way - whatever may !be his views with regard to profiteering. I am dealing only with our existing constitutional powers. It is hardly necessary to remind the House that we are working under a Federal Constitution, under which the Commonwealth Parliament has power to deal with trade and commerce between the States, and - with other countries, while to the State Parliaments is reserved f i d l .power to deal witli trade and oommerce within their respective State boundaries. I have no hesitation in expressing my own personal view that wider powers will have to be given to the Federal Parliament.",79
436,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,The sooner better.,79
437,Mr GROOM,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"A man naturally likes to have immediate effect given to his opinions. I repeat that wider powers or something like that. must inevitably be given to this Parliasirloin ment ; ibut that is no - reason why should provide in this Bill for legislative power which the Constitution itself gives no authority to bestow. There are other aspects of the measure with which I deal when we go. into Committee, and I sincerely hope that the motion for the second reading will be unanimously agreed to.

438,Mr HIGGS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Capricornia) [10.19] -^I move That it be an instruction to the Committee that the Committee have the power to provide for the making of arrangements for dealing with meat, hides, and other commodities ing the period covered iby the Bill . I shall not speak at any great length. I think that the majority of honourable that price. members are agreed that the Commonwealth Government should have power to deal with such commodities as meat and hides. The Acting Attorney-General. (Mr Groom) has admitted that the Comment at that price. monwealth Parliament should have wider powers, and I fail to understand why Government whichprofesses anxious to deal with profiteering, and to put a stop to the practice of charging extortionate piices, should object to such The an extension of power as that covered by my motion. It has been said by honourable members who follow the Government that the pastoralists, sheep farmers, and graziers generally have been accused of profiteering. I do not know of any honourable member on this side who has accused thepastoralists of profiteering. It is not the producer on the land who does the profiteering. The cattle grower in Queensland, I suppose, does not get more than 5d. or 6d. per'lb. at most for his stock;' but what are the prices which have to be paid by consumers in Queensland, where cattle are grown in such large numbers ? The retail price of sirloin in private shops in Queensland is lOd. per lb.",79
439,Mr MASSYGREENE,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"If the stock owner is get the ting 6d. per lb., the retail price of sirloin must be more than that.",79
440,Mr HIGGS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"That may be so; the own stock owner may be getting only 3fd., The price of in the State shops is 6£d. per l b. we I mention this to show what the Commonwealth Government might do for the people of Australia if they would take over the cattle industry and deal with it can as they are now dealing with wool.",79

449,Mr HIGGS,USE OF FOR EXPORTOFAUSTRALIA N,"Honourable members will see from that that the producer in Queensland is satisfied to obtain 4 | d . for his stock. That would enable the Government to sell meat retail to the general public in Australia at a very much lower price than they are now obliged to pay. The price of beefsteak in private shops i u Queensland is 13d. per l b . , and in the State shops 7£d. per lb.

It ence ? is a good many months now since the principal officer was appointed, and I do not consider that what has happened indicates that the Government have secured the services' of a very competent - organizer for the principal executive tion under the Act. The other day had occasion, to make an inquiry as when a soldier who had made an applilast cation under the .Act might expect his application 'would be dealt with : rang up the office of the Deputy Housing Commissioner' in Sydney at 10 o'clock the morning, but he was not there. I asked for the next officer in charge, and the gentleman who came was unable to tell me where the Deputy Commissioner lively 1 was, whether he intended to attend the function arranged by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank that day, or when he would be at the office. ' That example of the business methods adopted, and there has been the same experience fore .any others. from the beginning: The gentleman who be given in all cases to applications was discharged a little while ago no better.

The ' M in for Repatriation (Senator Millen) put into the hands of every man returning Australia a statement that the Governinto ment would help to finance him in the purchase of a home, and-on-that assurance .I am given to understand. that in New South Wales alone 10,000 applications have been lodged, a considerable number by soldiers who' have entered into arrangesavings ments to purchase houses already erected.

But I received a most curt reply to the effect that no forms would be available for New South Wales until an officer had been appointed to that State, that the appointment had not yet been considered, and that, when it was, application would have to be made in Sydney. I was astonished about a month afterwards to find that those who had called on the officer appointed could get forms, but that there were none generally - available for soldiers; and that finished the gentleman, in my estimation, as an organizer. A man with any capacity would know that the first thing was to have such a supply of forms that every .man could start off a fair mark, and that the friends of members of Repatriation Committees or of officers should not have any advantage over other soldiers. As it happens, it is the men in the easy jobs who get the tip as to what is going on, while the man who has done his bit in the trenches is usually the last to hear.  Walker was appointed ? Mr HECT OR LAMOND - It was Colonel Walker who made the announcemenfc as to the forms. I believe some applications were"" in before that gentleman was appointed, and those 'cute ones who sent them ih are likely to get preference. The Minister should endeavour to make an arrangement by which immediate attention can be given to the claims of those men who require assistance to purchase homes already existing. While the gentleman at the Central Office was telephoning me, or within an hour afterwards-, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, speaking on behalf of the Government, was announcing that preference was to be given to men who desired to build houses over those who were taking over homes already built. Ifthat is the policy of the Government, it is not only bad business, but brutally unjust to the soldiers who have been induced to Adjournment. sign agreements for the purchase of It houses. Most of these men desire to marry, and have a right to assistance to purchase their homes, and it is not for those in authority to seek to carry out their ownlittle fads. Their duty is to. help thesoldier to do what he himself wishes to do. The men ought to be helped as quickly as possible to marry and settle down, and provide the population we so much need. M a j o r Evans talked about beautiful "" dream cities."" That is all right for the future, but what is wanted first is to assist those who are prepared tb buy houses already built. A very small staff could handle the applications.",81

458,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ADMINISTR A TION OF WAR SERVICE,"I understood that the Commissioner in New South Wales had practically a free hand. I wrote on behalf of one or two returned men who wanted positions in the office, and was told that those positions would be advertised in due course, though, first as a matter of fact, there aresome men in the office now in positions which were not advertised. I do not think, therefore, that the centralization excuse is available for the man in charge in New South Wales. What I desire is 'a scheme for the prompt examination and classification of applications, and for this work I am sure sufficient volunteers could be got within a week.  for the N a v y ) [10.40] - Replyin g to the complaint of the honourable member regarding applications for assistance to purchase houses already built, I assure him that a large number of such houses have been inspected by the Department and their purchase approved.",82

We have found, in respect to a large number of houses upon which the deposit had been paid, that the agreed-upon purchase price was much in excess of the true value', and in some cases the Department has been obliged to refuse to advance the money required.",82
461,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ADMINISTR A TION OF WAR SERVICE,"Why ? The soldier is spending his own money.  the maximum amount that can be spent on any one house. If a man buys a house at a price £150 or £200 above the maximum, the Department cannot advance the money.",83
462,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ADMINISTR A TION OF WAR SERVICE,But the soldier may add to the-departmental advance any inoney of his own.  and in many cases that has been done; but the trouble occurs in cases in which the applicant has no inoney of his' own to supplement the departmental advance.,83
463,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ADMINISTR A TION OF WAR SERVICE,"Then the nouncement by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank was unauthorized?  stand that announcement, because only at the latter end of. last week I saw a list of houses, the purchase of which had been approved, and another list of building sites, purchased by applicants; they were supplying their own specifications, and we were calling for tenders for the buildings. It is only within the last two weeks that arrangements for financing the whole scheme have been finalized. There have been a number of deputations with a view to insuring a 'supply of building materials at such prioes as would enable us to build cheap houses. In New South Wales, the private brick-making companies are asking 51s. 6d. per 1,000 for bricks, whereas the State Brickworks are supplying them at 40s. per 1,000. The same sort of thing is happening in connection with timber and other materials. We hope to enter into some arrangement for the purchase of material on such terms as will insure that the soldier's house is constructed at a reasonable price. We are trying to make the same arrangement in Victoria, because, [407] owing to' the operations of the Timber Combine, it is almost impossible to erect a house within the financial limits prescribed by the Act.",83
464,Mr GIBSON,ADMINISTR A TION OF WAR SERVICE,"Star t a saw-mill with the soldiers.  at once. In answer to a questidn asked today by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson), I stated that I hoped to be able at an early date to make a full statement of what had been' done in regard to the war-service homes scheme. I assure the House that the Minister is doing his best to hurry the scheme along.",83
465,Mr BDBCKXLL,ADMINISTR A TION OF WAR SERVICE,"What about Colonel Walker? Do you approve of his centralization policy?  sioner appointed under the Act, which does not provide for a Commissioner in each' State.",83
466,Mr BUROHELL,ADMINISTR A TION OF WAR SERVICE,"There is a Deputy an- Commissioner in each State; but Colonel Walker will not allow his deputies to appoint even a typist without getting approval from Melbourne.  the centralization policy was carried to that extreme. But we have had evidence recently that we must be careful regard- . ing the powers we give to the Deputy Commissioners. One Deputy sought to . enter into an arrangement for the purchase of land for £25,000, which, when valued, was found to be worth less than £8,000. No Deputy has power to purchase land at a price in excess of £1,000. But I cannot conceive it possible that a Deputy Commissioner who has power to purchase laud .to the value of £1,000 has not authority to appoint a typist in his office. However, if the honourable member for Illawarra will send me a copy of his remarks this evening, I shall place them before the Minister for Repatriation, and furnish the honourable member' with a full reply to the allegations he has made. Question resolved in the affirmative. . House adjourned at 10.47 p.m.",83
