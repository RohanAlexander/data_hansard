2,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH," by leave-Toward s the end of last year a special Constitution Convention was summoned at Canberra to deal with proposals to extend the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth in order to enable the problems of post-war reconstruction to be dealt with effectively. Those who attended comprised representatives of both Houses in the Commonwealth Parliament, including the party leaders in each House. The States were represented by the Premiers and the Leaders of the Opposition. It was unanimously agreed that additional powers in relation to post-war reconstruction were lequired by the Commonwealth. However, it was considered more practicable, in order to avoid a referendum during the war, that the additional powers should be conferred upon the Parliament of the Commonwealth by reference from the State legislatures under section 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution. Accordingly, fourteen heads of power were defined and agreed to by representatives of the Commonwealth and by the Premiers of the six States. In order to give effect to the arrangement, a draft bill was also agreed upon. The present position of the draft bill is as follows: The State legislatures of New South Wales and Queensland have passed the bill. South Australia and Western Australia have passed bills, but in each case the powers granted are less than those agreed upon at Canberra. Victoria has passed the bill, but has imposed the condition that it shall not operate unless the other five States have previously passed a bill in substantially the same form as the Canberra draft bill. In the State of Tasmania the Upper House has shelved the bill. All State governments had their legal Premiers. advisers at the Canberra convention, and the point was not then raised that it was not constitutionally competent for the State legislatures to refer the matters to the Parliament of the Commonwealth for the time agreed upon, namely, a period to terminate five years after the cessation of hostilities in the present war. However, legal opinions were subsespecial quently obtained by several State Goamine vernments, to the effect that, tion 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution any references of matters by the State legisconsisting latures must be made without limit of time. This opinion is by no means accepted by the Commonwealth, and deavours will be made to obtain an authoritative ruling from the courts as to whether or not the method of reference provided for in the draft bill is permissible under the Constitution. The Comadvisory monwealth Government is of the opinion that the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is. It might, of course, possible for the Commonwealth to pass legislation on post-war reconstruction to operate only in those States that have passed the Commonwealth Powers Bill. This would probably be detrimental to the interests of those States which, not having passed the bill, would necessarily be excluded from the scope of Commonwealth legislation on certain aspects of post-war reconstruction. However, such Commonwealth legislation could not be regarded as satisfactory from an Australian point of view. For these reasons, I am in agreement with the Attorney-Oeneral that, unless the substance of the Canberra arrangement be carried into effect in all six States, it will be necessary to submit proposals for the alteration of the Constitution to the electors of the Commonwealth by referendum. Admittedly, additional powers are required by the Commonwealth Parliament for post-war reconstruction purposes. The present intention of the Government is to deal with these important matters of Constitution alteration at the next session of the Parliament. By that time we should be acquainted with the final decision of the State legislatures as to whether or not they intend to carry into effect the arrangements made at the Canberra convention by all six State PAY-AS-YOU-EARN TAXATION .",12
3,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH," by leave-Adoptin g the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), the Government will appoint, in collaboration with him, a parliamentary committee to exthe pay-as-you-earn taxation plan under secand alternative proposals. The Taxation Advisory .Committee, of Messrs. J. A. L. Gunn and H. W. Buckley, with Mr H . H . Treblico, Deputy Commissioner of the Taxation enCentral Office, as chairman, has been examining and reporting upon various taxation matters that have been referred to from time to time by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley). At the present time this committee is examining, at the Treasurer's request, several of the most important aspects of this problem. This be particular inquiry is directed specifically to the problem arising from cases of hardship upon retirement, death, or where there are violent fluctuations of income from one year to another - whic h is the crux of the whole matter. I understand that the solution is not proving easy. If the report, which is expected this month, puts forward a solution to meet cases of these types a much simpler reform in taxation administration will be evolved than would be the case if u full pay-asyou-earn plan of taxation were adopted. Quite apart from this taxation advisory committee's report, however, the Commissioner of Taxation has had the payas-you-earn proposals examined and reported upon by a panel of his own expert officers. When the advisory committee's report is to hand, the Government will refer both reports to the proposed parliamentary committee for examination and report to the House. Should the House be in recess when the report becomes available, by arrangement with the leaders of the Opposition parties, T propose to nominate the parliamentary committee and allow it to function until the House re-assembles, When it may be formally constituted by resolution of the House. EGG PRODUCTION.",13
4,Mr BARNARD,COMMONWEALTH,For some time. I have been making representations to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in regard to what are known as backyard poultry flocks. Has the honourable gentleman yet been able to make a decision in the matter?,14
5,Mr SCULLY,COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member has requested that householders be permitted to keep more than a maximum of twenty birds without being obliged to submit to registration. A similar request has been received from many portions of the Commonwealth, and one has come from the Department of Agriculture of a leading State. As there is an acute shortage of eggs, I shall readily acquiesce in the taking of whatever action may result in an increase of egg productionor of food supplies generally. I have requested the Egg Control Board to consent to the variation of the existing arrangement in order that individual householders may keep a maximum of 40 birds without being obliged to register. NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND.",14
6,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH,Is the Treasurer yet in a position to supply an answer to the 1 question that I asked recently concerning matters associated with the report of the National Debt Sinking Fund Commission?,14
7,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH,"The Attorney-General was ill when the right honourable gentleman requested that I should table certain legal opinions that had been obtained. I considered that the matter should be discussed with him; consequently, I deferred consideration of it until he had resumed duty. I shall now take it up, and furnish a full reply as early as possible. ALLIED WORKS COUNCIL.",14
8,Mr CONELAN,COMMONWEALTH,".Has the attention of the Attorney-General been directed to the decision of Mr Aitken, Police Magistrate, Brisbane, that the Allied Works Council has not power to direct the disposition of labour? Does the right honourable gentleman agree with that decision?",14
9,Dr EVATT,COMMONWEALTH,"I have just seen the decision, but have not had an opportunity to consider it in detail. I shall do so, and then communicate with the honourable gentleman. WAR DAMAGE INSURANCE. , Mr Holt - In the first week of the present session I placed on the notice paper a question seeking certain information in connection with the War Damage Insurance Commission, and was informed that the information would be supplied. Can the Treasurer state when it will be available?",14
10,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH,"I had hoped to have an opportunity to make recommendations to Cabinet in regard to certain matters affecting the War Damage Insurance Commission, but pressure of more urgent business has prevented, me from doing so.",14
11,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH,My question relates merely to details of administration.,14
12,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH,I am having those details prepared for the honourable member. ELECTRICAL SERVICES.,14
13,Sir EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH,"Because , of rationing on account of the shortage of coal, will the Prime Minister endeavour to have stated as early as possible the conditions that may be imposed on electrical services dependent upon the generation of electricity by means of water power or the use of brown coal, in order that users may know exactly where they stand?",14
14,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH,"The Fuel Co-ordination Committee has the matter under its care, and, I am quite sure, will make an early announcement. NA PRODUCERS .",15
15,Mr ANTHONY,MATERIALS FOR PRIMAR Y,"Can the Minister for Munitions give' the assurance that supplies of galvanized iron and barbed wire, which are vitally needed in connection with primary production, will be speeded, up, in view of the fact that reserves upon which we have been drawing for a couple of years are now exhausted and the lack of further supplies immediately may prevent an increase of many lines of primary production?",15
16,Mr MAKIN,MATERIALS FOR PRIMAR Y,I promise to give to the matter the most sympathetic attention. MEAT INDUSTRY. RATIONING.,15
17,Mr FADDEN,MATERIALS FOR PRIMAR Y,"Can the Prime Minister say Avhether meat rationing was considered yesterday by the Production Executive of the Cabinet? In view of the widespread confusion in the public mind caused by conflicting statements of Ministers and by press speculation, will the Prime Minister inform the House in specific terms what is the Government's intention in regard to meat rationing?",15
18,Mr CURTIN,MATERIALS FOR PRIMAR Y,The matter will be considered by the full Cabinet as soon as u meeting can be bald. NA WORKER S.,15
19,Mr SHEEHAN,TRANSFER OF MUNITIONS,"If it is proposed to transfer surplus munitions workers to other occupations, will the Minister for Labour and National Service take steps to ensure that those first transferred shall be men with the least number of dependants, and that those with established homes in the metropolitan area shall, as far as possible, be found occupations in their own districts?",15
20,Mr HOLLOWAY,TRANSFER OF MUNITIONS,"It will be necessary for me to consult with the Minister for Munitions on this subject. It is hoped that the Munitions Department will be able to transfer men from one branch of its own activities to another where they may be needed. If there are surplus men in the Munitions Department, the man-power authorities will certainly try to place them in the city or town in which they are now residing. TYRES FOR MOTOR VEHICLES .",15
21,Mr ANTHONY,TRANSFER OF MUNITIONS,"Committee s have been set up to advise the Controller of Rubber regarding priority in the issue of rubber tyres for motor vehicles. Although these committees are working the well, it sometimes happens that no tyres are available at a particular place when they are urgently required for the carrying on of essential services. Will the Minister for Supply and Shipping establish in important country towns small stocks of tyres which can be released by the local committee in an emergency?",15
22,Mr BEASLEY,TRANSFER OF MUNITIONS,"I remind the honourable member that the position in regard to rubber is desperate in. this country, as, indeed, it is in all countries engaged in the war on our side. It is not necessary for me to stress that point - it is obvious to every one. For that reason, we have had to exercise extraordinarily strict control over the use of rubber. However, the honourable member's suggestion is worthy of sympathetic consideration in order to meet those cases in which it is absolutely necessary to provide transport for the maintenance of essential services. I. shall look into the matter. AUSTRALIAN ARMY. LIEUTENANT-COLONEL N . L . FLEAY RELEASE OF PEBSONNEL.",15
23,Mr FORDE,TRANSFER OF MUNITIONS,"On the 13th October, the honourable member for Lang (Mr . Mulcahy) asked certain questions in regard to the exploits of LieutenantColonel Fleay, who was recently awarded the Distinguished .Service Order. The honourable member referred to certain press statements about this officer, and asked whether a full and complete investigation could be made to determine the truth of the statements which he is purported to have made in regard to his service in the front line in New Guinea. I have made inquiries, and now desire to inform the honourable member that it is not proposed to make any investigation of the nature suggested by him, as there is no evidence to indicate that Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay made any such statements. Allegations have been made that the award of the Distinguished Service Order to this officer was associated with such press statements, and in order to assure the honourable member that such was not the case, I quote from the citation of his General Officer Commanding at the time he was recommended for this awardLieutenant-Colonel Fleay was in charge of Kanga Force when I assumed command of New Guinea Force. Up to that stage his commando operations had been distinguished by vision, enthusiasm and the utmost determination to hamper the enemy to the greatest extent possible in the Lae and Salamaua areas. Although it was not possible to reinforce Kanga Force before fresh enemy troops arrived towards the end of August, LieutenantColonel Fleay continued his offensive tactics with such force as was available. As a result little, if any, fresh penetration was made by the enemy. Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay'6 general outlook, his personal gallantry and his powers of leadership combine to make him an inspiration to the troops who have kept going in spite of very great difficulties. The award of the Distinguished vice Order to a commanding officer of a unit is regarded as a mark of commendation, not of the commanding officer alone, but also of the valuable and gallant services rendered by the whole unit. To those who are aware of the outstanding performances of the individual bers of the special force which was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel there can be no doubt that the award in this instance was a well-deserved recognition of the unit as a whole. Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces, with whom I have consulted, has confirmed this view, and, in addition, has stated that he was in constant touch with Lieu tenant-Colonel Fleay during the period that he was in New Guinea, that he was visited quently by senior officers, and that he commanded a small detached force with Mr Forde. gallantry, enterprise and vigour, and proved himself a first-rate leader in tactics of this kind. Lieutenant-General Blarney added: "" I am. satisfied that Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay is a very gallant and enduring officer, and that he is the last person who would attempt to take away credit from other persons"". Prior to his service in New Guinea Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay, who, in 1939, joined up in the ranks, had a record of excellent service with the Australian Imperial Force overseas. He went to the Middle East with the 6th Division, fought in the ""Was tern Desert and in Greece, was wounded in Crete, and returned to Australia with his division, and subsequently served in New Guinea. The honourable member referred to the service of members of the 5th Independent Company. This was only one of the companies under Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay during the period to which he refers.",15
24,Mr MULCAHY,TRANSFER OF MUNITIONS,"I rise to a personal explanation. For some time. I refrained from making any reference to this matter, but in view of correspondence which I had received from officers attached to the same unit, I decided to ask a question in the House. If the Minister is convinced that the report from General Blarney is satisfactory, I have nothing more to say. My only desire was to have the matter cleared up. Ser",16
25,Sir EARLEPAGE,TRANSFER OF MUNITIONS,"In view of the confusion existing in the public mind, and especially in the minds of soldiers who desire to be released from the Army, w i ll the Minister for Labour and National Service have a statement pubmem- lished indicating the proper way in which to make applications for release? Fleay, Mr Holloway - I shall be pleased to confer with the Minister for the Army in order to see whether a statement can The be issued as the right honourable member has suggested. Naturally, when considering which men should be released, the authorities must have regard to the kind of work they will be called upon to do. The right honourable member is interested in getting more rural labour, freparticularly for the sugar industry. The A r m y authorities would not release blacksmiths or clerks for, say, cane cutting. NA STOCK BILL 1943. Bill presented by Mr Chifley, read a first time. SECOND READING .",16
26,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Macquarie-Treasurer ) [10.57] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of this bill is to provide for the issue of national savings stamps in connection with the raising of Commonwealth war loans. It has been found that the most convenient method for wage-earners to subscribe to loans by instalments is by means of deductions from wages. Where employees remain continuously on the one pay-roll, this presents no difficulty, and deductions are made regularly until the payment for bonds has been completed. There are, however, people whose employment is constantly changing, and in these cases it, is not practicable to make deductions from wages in this way. In order to provide for such subscribers, and also for those who wish to set aside small amounts as they become available, it has been decided to introduce the 5s. national savings stamp. Folders containing 40 stamps will be provided, the face value of which will amount to £10, and these may be accepted in payment for treasury bonds. Alternately, stamps to the face value of £2, or multiples thereof, may be accepted in payment of instalments for bonds. National savings stamps may be paid to the credit of depositors' accounts with all savings banks. The banks will, in turn, exchange the stamps for war loan securities. The stamps will be on sale at all savings banks, money order post offices, and such other selling points as are decided on from time to time. This measure makes provision for the protection of war savings stamps and national savings stamps against forgery and uttering, similar to that made in regard to treasury-bills in the Treasury Bills Act.",17
27,Mr FRANCIS,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Moreton) [11.0] - The Opposition enthusiastically supports this suggested. measure for the issue of national savings stamps, by which the Treasurer . (Mr. Chifley) hopes to widen the field of I investment in liberty loans. No effort should be spared to ensure that people whose earnings have risen as the result and of the war shall contribute a part of those earnings to the national war fund by means of investment in loans. I believe the issue of 5s. war savings stamps will attract many more subscribers than might otherwise have been the case. It if essential that the loans be filled if we are to conduct the wa<r to our full capacity.",17
28,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"New England) [11.2]. - I support this measure, but I regretthat the bill does not go farther and contain an amendment of the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, to provide that treasury bonds shall be converted to inscribed stock. Time and again during the budget debate honourable members stressed the fact that one of the most fruitfu l methods of evasion of income tax is investment in treasury bonds. No record is made of the owners or of people to whom interest is paid. In effect, treasury bonds are another form of currency at a time when the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) himself admits that the slightest slackening of controls on the monetary system may lead to heavy inflation, with disastrous results. The Treasurer, as a member of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, should know that when all the resources of the nation are fully employed, when it is impossible to produce more goods, and when treasury-bill finance is being used, there is great danger of inflation of the currency, with a steep rise of prices, unless all the necessary controls are maintained. One of the most effective controls would be the conversion of bonds to inscribed stock. That would enable the Treasurer to know exactly who are the holders of the stock issued in return for moneys lent to the Government. He would then be able to watch closely the holders of the inscribed stock, with a view to preventing evasion of taxation. It is probably too late to insert in this measure such a provision as I have in mind, but the Treasurer should take early action to do as I have",17
29,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Richmond) [11.5] again urge the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) to reconsider my proposal made on a previous occasion that Commonwealth bonds be accepted by the Treasury as payment of probate duty. I have been in touch with many people - who would be willing to invest more heavily in liberty loans and other loans but for the fact that they are compelled to keep in reserve money in some form more easily negotiable than bonds, lest their estate should be suddenly called upon to pay heavy probate duties. I believe the objection to this proposal in the past was that executors of estates of deceased persons would be able to buy on the market at a discount, bonds which would be tendered at their face value in payment of probate duty, but now that the prices of bonds are pegged that objection no longer holds good.",17
30,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"""What is there to prevent the executors of deceased persons from selling bonds on the stock exchange in the ordinary way in order to obtain the money necessary to pay the probate duty?",18
31,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"It is not always possible to find a buyer in time, and the Taxation Department is not prone to wait. Therefore, people are apt to take the prudent course of holding reserves against probate duty in some more easily negotiable form than treasury bonds or inscribed stock. Any abuses could be quickly rectified. The objections to the change no longer exis :. The granting of the concession would, I believe, result in very many more subscriptions to war loans.",18
32,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Macquarie-Trea surer) [11.8] - m reply-There is something to be said for the proposal made by the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott), and it will be examined, but I point out that the general public, as a rule, prefers bonds to inscribed",18
33,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Many things the people do not like have to be accepted by them.,18
34,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Yes , but it must not be forgotten that we are asking people to iuvest in loans and we have to take their desires into consideration. My recollection of the matter raised by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) is that the Loan Council discussed the proposal that probate duties should be payable with bonds, but the objection taken was that executors of deceased persons would perhaps be able to buy bonds at a discount. I concede that the pegging of the prices of bonds has changed the circumstances. I think that bonds issued before 1934 are accepted in payment of probate duty. At any rate, r agree with the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) that bonds can always be sold to either the general public or the National Debt Sinking Fund Com-, mission. Payments into the sinking fund are increasing in proportion to the increase of the national debt, and next, year it is expected that the commission Will be on the market for £20,000,000 worth of bonds. However, the honourable member's suggestion will be re-examined by the Treasury and further discussed by the Loan Council. Question resolved in the affirmative.

35,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED," That the following paper be printed: 1 -' Alleged missing document relating to defence plans-Repor t of Royal Commission "".",18
36,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Fawkner) [11.12] - On the 28th September the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) tabled the report of the royal commission on the alleged missing document relating to defence plans. He made no comment, but simply moved that the paper be printed. The Opposition considers that this important matter stock. cannot be allowed to rest at that point. We have no wish to revive the controversy over "" the Brisbane line""; we believe that that has been dealt with fully by the royal commissioner in his report and the Prime Minister in statements from time to time. That particular canard has been disposed of, but there are issues affecting the responsibility of Parliament upon which Parliament must be expected to have a definite view. A part of my purpose will b - to record in Hansard the developments r since Parliament, last met. I regret that the P r i m e Minister is n ot present because w h at I shall say on behalf of the Opposit i on has a direct bearing on w h at we consider his r e s p o n s i b i l it y to be as a custodian of the prestige of P a r l i a m e n t . I hope that he will be able to make some comment, at n later stage of this debate, on the representations w h i c h will be made to him as' to his d u t y . A good deal of my speech will consist of the r e a d in g of documents relevant which the O p p o s it i on place on record. In order to r e f r e s h the minds of honourable members on the subject, I take them back to the statement made in the House on the 22nd J u n e by the then Minister for L a b o u r and National Service. It readsWe want to know what plan was submitted to the government of the day following that submission to War Cabinet. Is it not a fact that there was an earlier plan than the proposal of the 4th February, 1942? I am not contradicting or denying that the available records disclose that the first plan was dated the 4th February, 1942, but I am most reli-' ably informed that one important report is now missing from the official files. If honourable members opposite have nothing to hide, they should be able to indicate why no plan was submitted to the War Cabinet from the 10th June, .1941, to the 4th. February, 1942. I am also reliably informed that this earlier plan was submitted while the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) wa6 Minister for Defence. F o l l o w in g that statement, the P r i m e Minister reported to the House on the 24th June , as f o l l o w s : The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) has given notice of his intention to submit a motion for the purpose of seeking a certain inquiry, and I have decided to adopt towards it the attitude which I believe any Prime Minister would adopt to a representative request from the Opposition on a matter affecting a Minister or the administration of a Minister. Such an inquiry the head of the Government would .immediately consent to institute. Therefore, I have already informed the Leader of the Opposition that I am ready to constitute a royal commission to inquire into certain matters. I have informed the l ight honourable gentleman also that I am quite ready, in accordance with practice, to consult him respecting the terras of reference to be given, to the royal commission for the purpose of conducting the inquiry. ready, too, as I believe any other Prime Minister would be, to consult with the right honourable gentleman on the selection of the person or persons who shall constitute the commission. As the inquiry of the royal commission will affect the position of a Minister in my Cabinet, I have adopted the normal procedure of relieving him of his administrative duties until such time as the report of the royal commission is tabled in Parliament. On the following day, the P r i m e M in is ter was reported in the press as h a v in g saidU n t i l the royal, commission has completed its inquiry and reported to the Government, the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) will , at my request, refrain from carrying out the duties attaching to the administration of his office. During that period, to t h is matter , arrangements have been made for the Minister desires to for Health and Minister for Social Services (Mr Holloway) also to. act for and on behalf of the Minister for Labour and National Service. The next document to w h i c h I desire to r e f e r is the r o y a l commission itself . I shall o m it the for m a l text, and read onl y the relevant portions . The r o y a l commissioner was appointe d and was given power to in q u i r e in to and report up on the following matter s : 1. The statement "" I am most reliably informed that one important report is now missing from the official files"" made by the Minister of State for Labour and National Service in the House of Representatives on the 22nd June. 1943, in the course of the debate in that House concerning the matter known as ""The Brisbane L in e "" . 2. The question whether that Minister was informed in the terms or to the effect specified in the statement set out above. : i . If that Minister was so informed(a.) the particulars of the information given to that Minister and referred to in the statement set out above; and (6) the questions as to the person by whom, the circumstances under which, and the reason why, that information was given to that Minister. 4. The question whether any document concerning the matter known its "" The Brisbane L in e "" is missing from the official files specified in the statement set out above, and, if so, the particulars of the document. The r o y a l commissioner conducted his investigations. H o n o r a b l e members will recollect the circumstances, but I ask the i r indulgence to quote extensively from H is H o n o u r ' s report . It does not appear elsewhere i u H a n s a r d , and I desire to place it o n record as being relevant to I am the subject under discussion. On the 14th J u l y , the P r i m e Minister released the report of Mr Justice Lowe. The document reads"" I have the honour to forward my findings of fact in relation tp the questions about which I was asked to inquire and report in the Letters Patent, dated the 28th June, 1943, appointing me a Commissioner. "" The commission sat in Melbourne on 5th, bth and 7th July, 1943, the first and sittings being held in public, while that held on the (1th instant took place wholly in camera. Mr Eric Miller, K . C , and Mr W. J. Dignam, both of the Sydney Bar, appeared as counsel to assist the commission - Mr Barry, K . and Mr Fraser, of the Melbourne Bar, reprereliably informed'. sented the Honourable E. J. Ward, Minister of State for Labour and National Service. Mr. Villeneuve Smith, K . C , of Adelaide, and P. D. Phillips, of Melbourne, asked leave appear to represent the Menzies and Fadden administrations. This application I did not accede to, but allowed counsel to attend and watch the proceedings on behalf of these adthat ministrations, both in public and in camera, and reserved leave to them to apply at any stage to take part in the proceedings. such application was made, save that at conclusion of the final sitting Mr Villeneuve Smith made a written submission to me as the findings which I should make and report. "" Fifteen witnesses were called and examined before the commission, of whom only one, Frederick Shedden, gave evidence in public. His evidence is recorded in the transcript of the proceedings. The proceedings in camera were not recorded by the shorthand writers and of them no transcript is available. I personally took such notes as appeared to me to be necessary to guide me in making my report. "" At the outset of the proceedings Barry submitted to me that the whole of the questions which I was asked to report were beyond the power of the commission to deal with, on the ground that they arose out of and necessarily depended upon a statement made by Mr Ward in Parliament, namely, the House of Representatives, on 22nd June, 1943. The first question, he contended, showed on its face that such was the position, and the remaining questions were mere appendages to the first question and their fate must be determined by the fate of the first question. asked Mr Villeneuve Smith whether he wished to address me on the question so raised. replied that he was instructed to make no submission on the point. After hearing Miller, I ruled that, even assuming Barry's submission to be correct in regard to the first three questions, the fourth stood on a different plane, and required me to report in any event on an independent of fact. Thereafter, I proceeded to take evidence mainly in relation to the fourth question, reserving for further consideration decision as to the correctness or otherwise of Mr Barry's contention in relation to the first three questions. Ultimately, on the final day - of the sittings, I ruled, for Teasons which are set out in the transcript, that Mr Barry's submission must be given effect to in relation to Mr Ward himself and that Mr Ward could not he compelled by the commission to attend or to give evidence in regard to his stateanswer ment, the subject matter of the first question. I ruled, however, that the privilege which deby Mr Holt. barred the commission from examining Mr. Ward himself did not debar it from investigating the truth or otherwise of any aspersion the contained in the statement which reflected last upon persons who were not members of Parliament, or officers of either House of Parliament. This ruling necessarily involved my putting a construction upon the statement itself, and in particular determining what C , were the implications of the phrase ' most I thought that these words would convey to any reasonable reader or hearer of them that information had been Mr given to Mr Ward out of Parliament and to otherwise than in the course of his or their duty by a person or persons whose position was such that he or they would in all probability have access to accurate information, and his or their credibility was such that there was no reason to doubt his or their statements. I interpreted the statement as meaning No that the information was given out of Parliathe ment and otherwise than in the course of duty, for these reasons: If the information to had been given in Parliament, it would have been recorded in Hansard, and, if given to the Minister in the course of the duty of the informant, or informants, I could see no Sir reason why the Minister would not have so stated. I then asked myself what persons came within such a category. I thought that .the proper custodians of 'official files' an1 such other officers as properly had access to those files certainly came within it . If any of such officers had divulged information to the Minister that a document was missing from the official files as alleged, it seemed to Mr me that such officer might be subject to criminal prosecution either under section 73A upon of the Defence Act which provides"" ' Any member of the Defence Force or officer in the Public Service of the Commonwealth who communicates to any person otherwise than in the course of his official duty any plan, document or information relating to any fort, battery, field work, fortification or defence work or to any of the defences of the CommonI wealth or to any factory or air force aerodrome or establishment or any other He naval, military or air force information shall be guilty of an offence,'"" Mr or under section 70 of the Commonwealth Mr Crimes Act, which provides that"" ' An y person who, being a Commonquestion wealth officer, publishes or communicates any fact which comes to his knowledge question by virtue of his office and which it is his duty to keep secret, or any document which comes to his possession by virtue my of his office and which it is his duty to keep secret, except to some person to whom he is authorized to publish or communicate it , shall be guilty of an offence'"". "" I think I should state specifically that I had evidence from members of the Defence Committee before whom plans would come and from the Chief of Staffs Committee. In order to the questions put to me it was necessary for me to determine what was meant the expression ' official files ' and ' Brisbane Lino'. To take the latter first. I informed my mind hy reading the debate of 22nd June, 1943, as recorded in Hansard of the sense in which the expression was used, and witnesses were also questioned as to their knowledge of the expression. No officer either of the Australian M i l it a r y Forces, the Royal Australian Navy or the Royal Australian A i r Force knew of any plan which related to a 'Brisbane L in e ' so called and all stated that their only knowledge of such an expression was derived from press reports or like sources. They did have knowledge, however, of what was called an 'appreciation' submitted 1 Sir Iven Mackay in February, 1.942. appreciation, Sir Iven Mackay stated in evidence before me, was submitted by him voluntarily of his own motion to the Government of the day. No officer who gave evidence before me was aware of any plan other than this in relation to the matters Sir Iven Mackay dealt with. I . sought from witnesses evidence as to all the files which related to matters which were the subject-matter of Sir Iven Mackay's report, and I was given precise information as to those files. There was called before me every officer whose duty it was to have the custody of any of those files, and also every officer who had the right of access to any of them. Each of those officers, without exception, swore that he or she had given no information to Mr Ward in relation to any document, and most of those officers did not even know Mr Ward. I accept the testimony of all these officers. "" It occurred to me that, apart from the officers I have referred to, the words ' most reliably informed' might point to members of the War Cabinet or of the Advisory War Council to whom copies of documents are, in the usual routine of procedure, distributed. I considered whether I should cause to be called before me all or any of such persons in order to question them in relation to any aspersion which might rest upon them by reason of the implication of the words. I assumed (without determining) that my ruling on the question of privilege would not affect such members, but on consideration I came to the conclusion that I should not have them called. Some of those in this particular class are Ministers of the Crown, all are members of Parliament, and those who are not Ministers of the Crown, are all or almost all persons who have been Ministers of the Crown. It is inconceivable to me that if any honourable member had given information to Mr Ward, he would not, after hearing Mr Ward's assertion, have made some statement himself in regard to the allegation. If he had given the information, I should suppose he would have stated so, and Hansard fails to disclose that any of them did. It also occurred to me that it was possible that some officer not within the category of those I have already mentioned might have had temporary access without authority to official files, and might have surreptitiously obtained information from the files, and communicated it to Mr Ward. I considered whether I should make any inquiry calculated to investigate this possibility. I determined that I should not, because I thought that no [24] Minister of the Crown receiving information from such a source would consider the person giving it a most reliable informant within the implication which I have attached to the words ' Most reliably informed'. I hope that these two assumptions will do no injustice to any one. It is of course possible that Mr . Ward has attached some meaning to the words ' Most reliably informed ' other than that which 1I have indicated above but, as Mr Ward's evidence was not available on this commission, this possibility is one that I have been unable to investigate. "" The whole of the evidence, without excepThi9 tion, was to the effect that the official files were intact and that no document relating to the ' Brisbane L in e ' had been or was missing from them. I should add that, beyond satisfying myself as to the method of recording documents, and that the system was adequate to keep trace of the fate of a document, and would disclose whether or not a document was missing, I did not personally investigate the files. To have done so would have been a herculean task incapable of accomplishment within any reasonable time, and one which I felt to be unnecessary in view of the fact that I thought the evidence of the witnesses who spoke to the completeness of the files entirely trustworthy, and, moreover, no challenge was made of it by cross-examination. "" I now address myself to the particular questions asked in the commission:"" 1. I am unable to answer this question, for the reasons which I have already stated. "" 2. I can give only a limited answer to this question, namely, that the Minister was not informed by any officer who hud the custody of the official files or by any officer who had access thereto, or by any member of the Defence Committee or by any of the Chiefs of Staffs Committee. "" 3. In view of the above answers, no answer is required to this question. "" 4. No document concerning the matter known as the ' Brisbane L in e ' was on 22nd June, 1943, or is now, missing from the official files."" The next document is a letter, dated the 14th J u l y , 1943, w h i c h the P r i m e Minister sent to the then Minister for L a b o u r and National Service. It readsI have forwarded to you, under separate cover, a copy of the report of the Royal Commissioner in the matter of an inquiry into a statement that there was a document missing from the official files. I will not release the report to the press until you intimate that you have received the report. You will note that, because of the plea advanced by your counsel, vital questions in the terms of reference were beyond the power of the Commissioner to deal with, the Commissioner ruling that counsel's submission must be given effect. As a result, question No. 1 was not answered, question No. 2 was given only a limited answer, and question No. 3 was unanswered because of the manner in which questions Nos. 1 and 2 were treated. On euuaideruig the report of the Royal Commissioner, the Government decided that it was clear that the raising of the issue of the rights and privileges of members of the rmliaineiit precluded a determination substance of the questions involved in the terms of reference! Tliese matters, have not heen decided and the Government has directed that, as the question of the rights and privileges of. members of the Parliament is involved, the matter is one which cannot be completed until a submission has been made to Parliament of the - matters that haw arisen. The Governinent has directed that, this submission be made at the earliest opportunity. Therefore, the substance of questions Nos. 1.. 2 and .3 in the terms of reference are in effect still nub jwMoe. The reasons which caused me to direct you to abstain from the administration of your oflieu, therefore, continue and wil l continue until the Parliament has dealt with the matters involved. For these reasons, I now repeat my direction to you to abstain from performing any of the duties of your office and have arranged for the Honourable E. J. Holloway, M.P.. to continue to act for and in your place. I desire to make certain comments on the facts which the documents disclose. First, I am sure that honourable members will be glad to have confirmation of their belief that no senior officer of the defence administration was implicated in any way in this matter. The report of the royal commission, limited though it was in -.cope, owing to the attitude adopted by counsel for the Minister then under suspension, was quite emphatic on that point. No senior officer connected with our defence administration has any cloud of suspicion hanging over him. The House will welcome that exoneration. Secondly, the commission was equally emphatic that no document was missing at the date at which the statements were made in this House by the then Minister. Thirdly, the commission found, as a fact, that no military appreciation was submitted to any government before February, 1942, which was four or five months after the Curtin Administration assumed office. Therefore, no "" Brisbane line "" had been drawn prior to February, 1942, by the Curtin Administration, or by any previous administration. Fourthly-and this returns the matter to the purview of this Parliament-J. come to the circumstances in vhich the then Minister claimed privilege as a member of the Parliament in Mr Holt. order to refrain from answering the first three questions .submitted to the royal commission. Those questions were: of the first, whether the Minister was .most reliably informed on a certain matter; therefore, secondly, whether he was informed in the terms, or to the effect, specified in the statement which he had made; and, thirdly, if the information was given to him, by whom, in what circumstances, and for what reason it was given. The commissioner was prevented from making any inquiry into these circumstances by the plea made by counsel on behalf of the Minister that to do so would amount to a breach of hi3 privilege as a member of this Parliament. The privileges of members of Parliament are traditional and long-standing, and I agree that the members of this House must jealously guard them. But, on behalf of the Opposition, I ask the Prime Minister to consider whether Parliament did not waive its privilege in order to secure the desired information. I submit that the claim to privilege was waived, in effect, if not specifically, when the right honourable gentleman reported to the House that a royal commission had been appointed to make its inquiries and the House took no objection to that procedure. I believe that it can be truthfully claimed that the action of appointing the commission was endorsed by all honourable members except the .honourable gentleman who was under suspension, and the then honourable member for Bourke, Mr. Blackburn. I have no doubt whatever that if the Parliament had been asked to intimate that it waived the claim of privilege in order that the desired inquiries could be made it would have done so and would have given the royal commission complete authority to make the investigation. Because the claim of privilege was made before the commission, the inquiry was balked, and this is the first time that the matter has since come before the Parliament foT us to express our view as to whether investigation should have proceeded and the plea of privilege waived. My next comment is that, although the then Minister was suspended from his office pending the answering of the questions by the royal commission, the important questions remain unanswered. The Prime Minister regards the issues raised as being important, for in his letter to. his colleague be said that, because of the plea advanced by the honourable gentleman's counsel, vital questions in the - terms of reference were beyond the power of the commissioner to deal with, and the commission.' had not dealt with them. The Government had decided that, because the issue of the rights and privilege of members of the Parliament had been raised a submission should be made to the Parliament. The Government had, therefore, directed that such a submission should be made at the earliest possible moment, and that until that was done the matter was stillsub judice, and the Minister would continue to abstain from, the performance of his duties. The only question which was answered wits the one in regard to which there was no dispute, for bothtbe Prime Minister and the then Minister for Labour and National Service had already stated publicly that they did not believe that any document was missing. So far as the Parliament was concerned, therefore, the only question which the royal commission answered was the question which the Parliament considered had already been answered. If there was adequate reason for the Prime Minister to continue the suspension of his colleague after the report of the royal commission was submitted, and until the unanswered questions had been resolved, there is still adequate reason continue such suspension, for the matters are still unresolved. The Prime Minister said that the Government had decided that a submission should be made to the House at the earliest possible opportunity. I claim that he is, therefore, called upon to make such a submission. As he has not done so, the House is entitled to know the reason why. Although these questions have remained unanswered, the suspended Minister has been given a portfolio in the new Government in a new capacity. The Opposition considers that an obligation rests upon the Prime Minister, as the custodian of. the prestige and authority of the Parliament, to clear this matter up at the earliest possible moment, and to take all necessary steps to protect parliamentarytraditions and maintain the high standard of conduct that is expected from ministries and Cabinet Ministers. As the right honourable gentleman considered it necessary to relieve his colleague of his duties while these matters remained, undetermined, he should take steps to have them determined at the earliest possible moment, and make a submission to the House in regard to them. The House cannot be satisfied with the present attitude of the Government on this subject. If there was good cause to suspend a Minister in order to hold an inquiry, and if , as I believe to be the fact, the House waived the. plea of privilege in order to have thematters investigated, the Opposition considers that the Minister involved should not be allowed to take refuge in the technical plea of privilege. Wo feel that an obligation rests upon the Government and the House to reach finality on these issues. We therefore press the Prime Minister to make a submission to the House in the terms of his letter of the 14th July, and fo indicate the attitude of the Government on the subject. Wc surely cannot allow the highly important issues to which T have referred to remain, undetermined.",18
37,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"East Sydney-Minister for Transport and Minister for External Territories) [11.48] - I am astounded that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), who is said fo be an eminent legal practitioner, and who previously to considered this subject to be of so much importance as to demand the appointment of a royal commission to investigate it, should now apparently consider it to be so unimportant that he is not in attendance when it is being dealt with by the House. I am astounded, that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), wbo also had a great deal to say on this subject when it wa3 previously before the House, should now also have deserted the Opposition. The brief has been left to a junior member, if not the office boy. of the firm. I recognize that, under very difficult circumstances, that honourable gentleman has been called upon to make a. face-saving speech for the Opposition. He has rend copies of several documents, the contents of which were already well known, and' on these he has made certain submissions. He began by saying that he had no wish to revive the subject because the canard had been exploded. There has been an explosion, but all of the casualties have been among Opposition members. On the last occasion on which I addressed the House on this subject the Opposition benches were fairly A decision in the matter has been given by the highest authority in the land, an authority higher than the Parliament or a royal commission, namely, the people; hence the many casualties in the ranks of the Opposition parties. To the honourable member for Fawkner has been entrusted today the task of submitting a case on behalf of the Opposition. remind him that when the terms of reference of the royal commission were mentioned, I told this House that the inquiry would prove abortive, because the terms were so limited as to make impossible an investigation of the charges I had made against the Menzies and Fadden administrations.' honourable member now wants to place on the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) responsibility for the result. At the time of the appointment of the royal commission the Labour party did not have a majority in this House; consequently, because of pressure by certain honourable members the Prime Minister was compelled to submit to the royal commissioner distinctly limited terms of reference, which prevented that gentleman from making an inquiry into my charges. Those terras had the approval of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) who was then the Leader of the Opposition; he was consulted continuously before they were announced. Surely he was advised by the legal men on his side as to what the powers of the royal commission would be! The honourable member for Fawkner now talks about the privileges of members, and claims that they must be protected. Surely he and - other members of the Opposition must have known that the royal commission would not have the power to compel me to give evidence concerning any utterance I had made in this House! In any event, parliamentary privilege is not held by every member individually, but is the privilege of the Parliament as such; in other words, the If r . Ward. privilege of the people. It would be fundamentally wrong, and a blow at the basis of democracy itself, if any member of Parliament could be subjected to interrogation outside in respect of statements he had made inside this legislature. I have never balked an inquiry; full. I would have welcomed the most complete investigation of my charges. But that was not desired by members of the Opposition. They were not anxious that I should be given the opportunity to have a complete investigation. They knew that they were approaching a general election, and they wanted a ""facesaver"". They wished to be able to say I to the people, "" A royal commission was appointed to investigate the matter, and it has found nothing "". The royal commission could not find anything, because the terms of reference were so limited that it could not inquire into the charges 1 had made. Being most vitally affected, I considered that I should have had a The voice in the framing of the terms of reference. Certain suggestions and recommendations were made by me for their extension, but when the terms were announced they were found to be identical with those requested by the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for Fawkner has conceded that before the Parliament had been prorogued one of the questions into which the royal commissioner was appointed to inquire had been answered in this House. A great deal was made of mystatement of the 22nd June concerning a document. The Opposition seized upon that statement. Honourable members opposite believed that they would be able to divert attention from the merit of my charges, to some argument in relation to my statement concerning a document which, I had been informed, had been missing. My charges were not based upon that document. I had received this information after I had made charges against the Menzies and Fadden administrations in Victoria, and during my visit to Tasmania. What the public wanted to know was, whether or not there was any truth in those charges. The honourable member for Fawkner now asks why the Prime Minister, having suspended the Minister for Labour and National Service, does not take positive action. The Prime Minister was impelled to the action he took, because members of the Opposition demanded it, and were able to enforce their demand. Never on any occasion did my colleagues doubt my integrity. The Prime Minister has presented the report of the royal commission for which the Opposition asked. The honourable member for Fawkner says that the right honourable gentleman has not taken positive action. The motion for the printing of the report has the effect of submitting the matter to the House. If the Opposition wants further action to be taken, it can move in that direction. AU the legal luminaries opposite are absent from their places today, and it has been left to a junior member to make the best case of which he is capable. I have not, been advised that the Leader of the Opposition has met with an accident, that he is ill , or he has been called away on urgent national business. He knew that this matter was to be debated. The motion in regard to it has appeared on the notice-paper for some time, and only a few days ago the Prime Minister stated that an opportunity to debate it would be afforded. If those members of the Opposition who are absent consider that it is important, why are they not in their places, prepared to debate it? The honourable member for Fawkner has quoted extensively the report of the royal commissioner. It can readily be imagined that by the limited terms of reference the commissioner was seriously hampered. In his report, he has stated that certain officers of the department were not those who had advised or informed me. I agree with that, and am prepared to say that, on the evidence that the commissioner had before him, he has reported correctly. When the announcement of the appointment of the royal commission was made in this House I said that, having had a consultation with the Prime Minister, I was satisfied that at that stage no document was missing from the official files. If honourable members care to engage in a lengthy debate as to what constitutes official files, and how many persons have access to them at one time or another, I can easily show them that, because of the limited scope of the inquiry, it would be quite impossible to say that every person had been interrogated who at one time or another may have had access to what are known as official files. Official files need not necessarily mean files in the possession of the administrative head of the Department of Defence. That was never suggested. There are all sorts of reports and recommendations in respect of defence matters on innumerable files, and numerous persons have access to them. From the outset there was never any doubt in my mind that there was no need for a royal commission if the terms of reference were to be framed to prevent a full inquiry into my charges concerning "" the Brisbane line"" strategy. Members of the Opposition now have the opportunity, if they so desire, to take positive action to ensure, as the honourable member for Fawkner has said, that the will of Parliament shall not that be balked. Of the way in which the will of the Parliament has been balked, as he implies, I am unaware. The people have expressed their view. My electors have shown clearly their attitude in regard to the charges that I made; they returned me with the largest majority that any man had ever received in the East Sydney electorate-a n absolute majority of more than 20,000 votes over the votes of four other candidates. I am satisfied that the Opposition has never desired a full inquiry into my charges. The honourable member for Fawkner may consider that, because of the stand taken by my counsel, I balked an inquiry. I had not to determine whether or not the point that he took should be put to the royal commissioner. Mr Barry, K . C , my counsel, advised me that it was his duty as a legal man to draw the commissioner's attention to the law, and said that if I wished to act contrary to his advice I should have to arrange for other counsel to appear on my behalf. The Menzies and Fadden administrations were legally represented before the commission by Mr Frank Villeneuve-o r villainous; I am not certain of the correct pronunciationSmith. When Mr Barry raised the point, Mr Justice Lowe asked Mr. Villeneuve Smith whether or not he wished to make any comment. The right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) was present. Mr Smith conferred' with hiin,,. and then said to commissionar, "" I am advised not to offer any objerfiioir "". Why did. the honourable member for Fawkner not quote that'portion of the commissioner's report? Mr Holt. - I quoted every word in the report.",23
38,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"The honourable member for Fawkner, with the subtlety which characterizes most legal gentlemen, abstracted from, the report and the evidence placed before the royal commissioneronly those portions that suit the purpose of the Opposition.",26
39,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,I rise to order. I have given the documents to Hansard. They will show that I quoted every word of the report of the royal commissioner. I ask that the Minister be required to withdraw what is a deliberate misstatement.,26
40,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - There is. no point of order. Mr Ward. - I bav,e. no wish to misrepresent. If the honourable gentleman, objects to what I have said, I shall amend it by saying that he carefully selected po-rtiona of theevidenee submitted to the royal commission in order to make out soma sort, of case on behalf of the Opposition.",26
41,Mr HOJLT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I did not quote any evidence, but I did read the whole of the report"" presented to this Parliament. Mr Ward' - Mr Villeneuve Smith, who appeared for the Menzies and Fadden administrations, had no objection to offer when the matter of privilege was raised which prevented the royal commissioner from requiring, me to give evidence. The present Leader of the Opposition' and his followers wanted lightly to dismiss my charges when the royal commissioner had made his report and it was received by the Government and released for publication. They said, "" That is the end of ' the Brisbane line' "". It may have been the wish of the Opposition to consider that the end of ""the Brisbane' line"" controversy, but I had other views about it. The honourable member for Fawkner said that he wanted to place on record the report of the royal commissioner. I , too, am anxious to place an record certain matters that; relate to this subject. Shortly after I bad made the my charges, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) saidIt was, a false picture, scaiulitttras in its content, and intended to deceive. - When the Fadden Governinent fell in October, 1941, Japan was not in the war, and Australia was not actually or directly threatened with attack: Of one thing the right honourable gentleman evidently was not aware-o r probably he thought that others were not aware of it : On record were other statements he had made, which showed clearly that months before Labour took office, and long before Japan actually struck, he knew that that countrywas a potential enemy of and danger to Australia. In December, 19,40, during another discussion, he said'Any one who believes that Australia's war iltiifgc.iits any less than Britain's is living in n. fool's paradise, which can in a few days become a fool's hell. In this House, on the 16th December, 1941, when replying to criticism by the present Attorney-General (Dr Evatt), tie saidHearing some of the thingsthat have been said today one would think that war with - Japan literally came like a thief in the night. He would have been a very complacent fool who did not think that at any time vn the last two years war withi Japan was u dLsti.nct possibility. The basis of my charge was that the Opposition, knew, wheiai it was in; power, otf this! danger that was; impending, yet did nothing ta meet it. On the 10th June, 1941, at submission wasi made by. the then Prime Minister (Mr Menzies,) to the War Cabinet just after he* returned from abroad. He said that he had been advised by theChiefs' of Staff of the possibility of the early entry of Japan Lato thewar, and the threat of early invasions; yet honourable members opposite say that, the first they heard of the Bris(e bane line "" was on the Ah February, 194-2. It is obvious that if Mr Menzies was able tcwarn his colleagues on the 10th June, the Chiefsof Staff must have evolved some plan to meet the threat-o r does the honourable member suggest that; from the loth June, 1941,. to the 4th February. 1942, there was no plan, in existence to meet the possible threat from Japan?",26
42,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,We are considering now the jSTOceednigs before the royal commission.,26
43,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Now tke honourable member is beginning to protest. There is no shadow of doubt regarding the truth of th* charges Which I made against the Menzies and Fadden administrations. They allowed the country to remain in a defenceless condition. They knew of the Area* from Japan. Members of ithe Opposition tried, during the recent election campaign, ito create the impression that I slood alone in making these charges, that none of my colleagues was with me, and that J. was making charges which nobody believed. 3. propose to quote - statements made, not by irresponsible persons, but by those of some .standing and integrity. Mr HaaiJon, Minister for Health and Home Affairs in the - Queensland <SownuiiEiit. said on the 7th February. :ii!)42Right up tn and until Ja^pan caano into the waithe northern defence line was right here, just north of Brisbane. The same gentle man was sr.eported later as having said that the statement which he had made in 193$ to the effect that there had been no intention to defend Queensland in the .event of an invasion in f»j'ce still stood. The added, "" Subsequent developments proved the correctness of that .statement"". Mr Wise, a Minister in the Government of Western Australia, is reported in ,a Sydney newspaper of the 2.9th June, 1943, as having said that Western Australian defences were chaotic, and that there was aio chance of defendiijag any part of the State north of Berth. Mr Dwyer-Oruy, Treasura* in the Government of Tasmania, gave me some very iniportaaxt inforanatioaa. Im June, 1939, fust after the death of the then Premier - of Tasmania, Mr Ogilvie, a meeting of the Loan Council was beid in Canberra. .Mil-. Dwyer-Gray attended it . In going through Ma . Ogilvie's papers, Mr DwyerGJray discovered some very important and - confidential military documents which disclosed the inteutioai of at least cooi;sideringithe defence of Tasmania, 'Queensland and some other parts of Australia .sis of only secondary importance. Mr . Dwyer-Gray demanded that the defence wf those outposts - shoulfl be considered by the council. MT . R. G. Casey was Commonwealth Treasurer at the time, and chairman of the Loan Council. Every - Member of the council was supplied with a memorandum setting out the information contained in .the documents referred to by Mr Dwyer-Gray, and there was a discussion on the subject. Mr Forgan Smith, the Premier off Queensland, saidTlie Queensland strategy,, contemplated :by the military authorities, a,ppear.ed to .be the evacuation .of its north. Mr Dwyie.r-Gr.ay, as late .as the 1st July, 1943, made this statement! n-iii quite satisfied that tftie Brishaiie liii-u originated three nuonths at least before the war. It is a sirojjlc statement of .fact te add that, for a very long period after the outbreak of war no proper preparations, and no really definite plans, had been made for the adequate defenee of Western Australia and Tasmania, while - the military strategy long remained the evacuation of the whole of the north of Australia. Three - are the very things t h a i I Jrad been saying. Mr Dwyer-Gray continuedTo 'suppose that the Minister for Labour and National Service ihad lied about the - Brisbane line is absurd. Mr Cooper, the Premier of Queensland, in a .speech at Dalby, spoke of "" the Bris' hame line "" as follows:When ithe enemy .was very iclose to Australia, Queensland had been practically without defence. Inquiries into the strategy of the day showed that Queensland had been left nut of the defemoe plans. Now Jet us see what one of the members of the Opposition had to say. The ex-Minister for A i r , the honourable member for Indi (Mr M « E w e n ) , saidTlie honourable member 'for Bourke \ Mr. Blackburn), whose integrity no man will challenge, when this controversy was raging, wrote to .the Melbourne papers as follows:"" I believed, with 'Government supporters generally, that before - the iGnr't'in Ministry took office there had been laid before the Advisory War Council, military opinion that, in the event of war with Japan, we should be - unable to defend Queensland north of the Tropic of Capricorn. I do not remember when I was told, but I was told by mom than .oae Labour member that this advice had been given to the War 'Council wihile the Labour party - was still in Opposition. I did .not at first believe this, but I was so often and so strongly assured of it that 1 could not Tielp believing tfcitt such advice thad been given. It was freely discussed by - Government supporters."" The present Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions (Mr M a k in ) , speaking in this House on the 23rd June of this year, saidLike drowning 'men clutching at straws, tliey are desperately trying - to mate it appear that the Minister for Labour and National Service has misrepresented the Brisbane line strategy and all its implications. No mattei what technical points the Opposition niay raise in trying to elude responsibility for the condition of Australia's defences, which was the precedent necessary to the formulation of that plan, it will not be able to avoid the bald fact that the Brisbane line did exist. Records prove it. I challenge the Opposition to show that tliere was one anti-aircraft giui north of Brisbane at that time. In the light of that statement, how can honourable members opposite argue that it was intended to defend those areas? How can they deny that it was proposed tc. leave them to the mercy of the Japanese? I come now to what the present Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) had to say on the subjectl had heard previously in this House the statement by a responsible Minister of a former Government, that one Japanese division could have walked through Australia.",27
44,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"The statement was not made in those terms. Mr ""WARD - I have been accused of lying, but surely the honourable member is not now accusing the Prime Minister also of having lied. The statement referred to was made in this House by the then Minister for the Army, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender). It clearly indicated the condition of the defences of Australia, shortly before the Labour Government came into office. Now honourable members opposite try to deny that it was proposed to desert large territories in the north and west of Australia, thus allowing the Japanese to walk through. What, I ask, was to stop the Japanese from walking through? The Prime Minister continuedThat WJIS the position when the present Governinent came into office. So dire was the threat, and so limited our resources, that the Commander of the Home Forces and the Chief of the General Staff felt impelled to point out to the Government that their resources were sufficient only to admit of a concentration for the defence of the vital areas extending from Brisbane to Melbourne. That is even worse than I charged them with - I spoke of a line north of Brisbane. It is clear that the defences of the country were in a shocking condition ae the result of neglect by the previous Administration. The Prime Minister said furtherBefoTe the war with Japan the primary consideration of the other governments had been co-operation overseas, with the result that the home defence plans had been defeatist in outlook and preparation.",28
45,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,This is merely a smoke screen.,28
46,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I am quoting what was said by the Prime Minister at a conference in Sydney. The honourable member for Fawkner, who a little while ago was making such insistent demands for information, is now getting more than he wants. I continue to quote the Prime MinisterWith the forces then at his disposal, and the absence of aerodromes, road communications and workable harbours in the northern parts of Australia, Sir Iven Mackay had the soundest military reasons for avoiding a wide dispersal of an inadequate force. We have never blamed Si r Iven Mackay. Obviously, he had to do the best he could with the inadequate forces provided by the last Government. The statement, goes onTo provide the strength for the defence of Australia is the responsibility of the Government. To use the provided strength to the best advantage is - all military commanders can do. The basic facts are undeniableAustralia's trained and equipped military forces were away from the Commonwealth. We had no fighting air power here, and the enemy was moving towards Australian areas in which no preparations had been made for military operations. The works services, and the fighting strength of air and land forces in the north had to be provided after Japan had struck. The Labour Government had to provide defences in the north after Japan had struck, because the anti-Labour administrations had neglected to provide them. h i order that honourable members may not believe that I am making charges that cannot be substantiated it is necessary that I cite my authorities as to the state of the defences when Labour took office. According to the Brisbane Telegraph of the 9th September, 1942, the Minister for Health and Home Affairs in the Queensland Government pointed out in the State Legislative Assembly on the 6th May, 1939, that there was no anti-aircraft defence in North Australia, and that again and again the Queensland Government had asked the Commonwealth for an air base in the northern part of the State, but the invariable reply had been that the work did not justify the expense. That was when the anti-Labour forces were less in control. The work did not justify the expense! The honourable member the for Herbert (Mr Martens) said in House of Representatives on the 24th June, 1943In the electorate that I represent there wure aerodromes, if they can be so described, mi which even a small Douglas machine could no.t land and from which it could not take off. Aeroplanes were compelled to pass daily over a number of towns, because of the lack of accommodation on the aerodrome and shortness of the runway. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie atorpedo (Mr Johnson) also said on the 23rd June, 1943Wlhen American fighting planes landed at Broome on the afternoon preceding an attack on that town, they warned the citizens that if the Japanese were to launch a raid, the Allied planes would not be able .to leave ground, because of the uusuitability of aerodrome. When the Japanese raided Broome, these aircraft were destroyed the ground. 'rhe Opposition parties had had the member opportunity for many years to provide facilities for modern aircraft to be thing operated. The Attorney-General (Evatt) said in this House on the 16th December, 1941But what of the defence of these shores? 'Che Government has been stock-taking. has inherited a situation in which .the defence of our country has been treated as a subordinate and subsidiary part of a distant war. 'the honourable member for Henty (Mr use the term ""Brisbane l in e "" . Ooles), who is not a member of the Labour party, said on the 23rd June last, referring to the Labour GovernmentIts achievements in the construction of roads, aerodromes and buildings, etc., enabled the defence of the north .to be undertaken. It is logical to argue that, if the honorlaid able member for Henty admits that only the works constructed by the Labour Government enabled the northern part threatened of Australia to be defended, the Opposiand tion left the north in a state in which it could not be defended. The Minister brought into action. for the A r m y (Mr Forde) said I propose now to give to the House particulars regarding the appalling position of Australia's defences when this Government took office. There was not one modern tighter aeroplane in the Commonwealth. You could count on one hand the number of tanks had when the Menzies Government was in office. We had only about fifteen rounds forces of anti-tank ammunition per gun. We had than one week's supply of field artillery ammunition for fighting on a very moderate scale. We had only about (50 per cent, of rifles required to equip our forces. We the had only about 20 per cent, of the number of light, automatic tommy guns required and there was a very serious shortage of the machine guns we needed, with hopelessly inadequate supplies of spare parts. We had had in this country for many years a large number of .31 caiihre rifles, but when we took office there was no ammunition whatever in Australia for them. The last Government stood idly by and watched our petrol reserves the dwindling from week to week until, when this Governinent took office, they had reached perilously low level. There were no aerial bombs. There was only one radiodirectional finding equipment .set. [Extension of time granted. \ enemy That was the state of the defences of this country when this Government took the office. If honourable gentlemen opposite the want any further authority, I will quote the statement made by General Douglas on MACArthur on the anniversary of his arrival in Australia. The honourable for Fawkner (Mr Holt ) , in trying to make out that there was no such as "" the Brisbane l in e "" , declared Dr that witnesses before the royal commission had said that they had never heard of "" the Brisbane l in e "" . I do not dispute that. It only goes to show It that probably some of the members of the forces are not so alert as they should be. General Douglas MACArthur knew about it , because he was the first to The Christian Science Monitor published on the ISth March, 1943, the report of an interview with General MACArthur, from which the following is an excerpt:Disclosure that Australia was so defenceless a year ago that its defence plans were for a defence line as far south as Brisbane was made today by General Douglas MACArthur. Airfields in this vast country were few and far between, while in the part of the country, strategic roads railways did not exist. At that time the role of Port Moresby was to hold the enemy to enable mainland defences to be I quote that particularly because memsome bers of the Opposition on previous occasions have said, "" If we had intended to abandon sections of Australia, why did we have troops at the we outposts?"" But they were only holding consisting of a handful of M i l it i a and a few native troops at Port. Moresby. The position isdifferent today. The Brisbane Telegraph on the 18th March, 1943, saidiAm we had was a handful of Militia at Port Moresby, a few native troops and nothing else. Port Moresby, the key to the air sfhiadion, had a broken-downport with little snipping facilities. Its airfield was merely a stopping-off. field usctf by air transport. I am very thorough in ray investigations, ashonorable gentlemen no doubt, realise, and I went togreat trouble to ascertain whether General MACArthur gave a personal interview; I found that he did., li understand that it was one of the very few occasions on which he has given a personal interview to war correspondents. Finally, I quote the .Sydney Daily Telegraph, which the honourable member would not say was well disposed towards the Government, or me personally. On the 29th December, 1941, that newspaper said about the first Curtin MinistryThey are starting behind scratch with country unprepared for war, a. country that man saideven after two and a half years of war still facke essential weapons and supplies. I askmembers of the Opposition of whether, when we took over^ Australia did not lack weapons and materials and He also saidHad' no aerodromes or strategical road's prepared' for defence of the north ? How could they expect that the north were would be adequately defended-simpl by their saying from time fo time that mey intended that the north would be defended? Let us hear what, the then the Leader of the Opposition said on the 31st August, 1939'- .For the first time in history, Australia IBIS SO> thoroughly prepared for eventualities Australian territory. that, it has complete plans, fully documented for talcrog all those steps' which would toi be taken after an actual declaration war. The Army is prepared. The B..A.A.F. is in a very good state of preparation. On the 22nd July,, 1940, he said'the local defences of Australia, had bcem as strong; at any. previous time: history. Who is lying? What a lot of bunk to give to the people of this country!",28
47,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,That is what the Prime Minister said when he took office.,30
48,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"That is true, but what then. choice did he have?- Could he advertise fo fine world at that time that' this country was defenceless ? We had to play for We had to bluff the Japanese' while we prepared to meet Chem. Would honourable gentlemen opposite say that he should have broadcast to the world that we had practically no defences ? I do not deny the amazing ability of leading members' of the Opposition tofcwisf words and distort facts. Opposition members believe that an allrin war effort consists in going, from function' to function and making speeches'. The Leader' of the Opposition went to a little celebration of. the delivery of the 100th two-pounder 1 anti-tank: gun, manufactured in Australia, and said'More than 400,000 men have been trained and equipped fhr tins fighting services in Australia. But he did not say that although the 100th' anti-tamk gum had been manufactured, no ammunition for those guns was being or had. been produced in this country. Such things were not told to a the public. The right honourable gentleWhen we. went out of office, .this country had n local defence force and iocal materials war such as had never before been dreamed of in its: history. What is the use of sayinjr to me that tliere were some troops,, without guns? Of course there, were! If I am told' that flier'.' some troops without rifles,, my answer y is, ""Of course there were"". That was the position when, we took office-. I said in this Parliament that Opposition had left, this country absolutely defenceless, and that the Japanese had been practically given an invitation to walk in and overrun large sections of TheOpposition need had been so panic-stricken that it had of run away. We had become the Government,, not as the result of a general election, but because the Menzies and Fadden Ministries had fallen to pieces. never They had been incapable of governing. in our Aware of the defenceless state of this country,, they had panicked and left it to the Labour party to take over. I shall, before concluding, give some facts to show that the Opposition has. not. disposed of the points-1 raised when I spoke The honourable member for Fawkner said that dates were, important. I shall give him some.. In October, 1941, time. Labour took office. In March, 1942', tMicral MACArthur came to Australia. - In October, 1942, I first publicly made my charges. In October, 1942, the right honourable member for Kooyong and the right honourable 'member for North Sydney - denied the charges. They said rhere was no basis for them and that they were figments of my imagination. On the 17th March, 1943, General MACArthur's statement was published in the Australian press. If the Leader if ,tfoe Opposition knew of 'Our defenceless state and heard for the first time ion the 4th February, 1942, of the existence of "" the .Brisbane line"", why did he deny in October, 1942, that there was any base for the charges I have made? He said then that the charges were a figment of my 'imagination. Honourable members opposite were daily appealing to the Ir'rime Minister. 'They wanted Ward shut up and prevented from making the charges which were proving very damaging to them in the electorate. In order to divert attention from the real charges to something that was of relatively less importance, they demanded a royal commission. They had it . It proved as abortive as I predicted it would. I said that it would not clear up this matter, and. it did not. Even after rhe report became known, they said, "" This does not dispose of it. The questions have not been answered. The lloyal Commissioner was unable to conclude his inquiry, and therefore the matter is one for the Parliament.'"" Although the Royal .Commissioner's report found absolutely nothing in regard to the charges that I made, honourable members opposite still demanded the continuance of my suspension. The Prime Minister agreed that the Opposition might desire .an inquiry for the purpose of finding out whether there was any basis for my charges. So I remained in suspension. Then, in August, T was returned to the House of Representatives with a record majority, and later my - colleagues expressed their confidence in me by restoring me to Cabinet. But members of the Opposition are still dissatisfied. They contend that the matter has not been disposed - of, - amd demand to know what ifibe Government proposes to do. Their lack of sincerity is indicated 683 by the Eact that only six members of tke United Australia party, and most .of them junior members, are listening to this debate. All the prominent members of the United Australia party have ""gome iitto smoke "", becanrsc they wene afraid to face a thorough debate of my charges. Tire Royal 'CommissioRer found nothing. He was obliged to come to the finding that he did. I was never afraid of a proper inquiry into my charges, aeS the majority of the Australian people are quite satisfied that the greatest tragedy which could have befallen this country would have been the return to offiee of the bunglers - and ""worse, who comprised 'the anti-Labour Government. As the B-ovity Telegraph said, the Labour - GovemareHlt started from 'behind scratch. When Iflie Curtin Government took office Australia had been at war for two years, but the Labour party required 'only a relatively short period in which to put the defences of the oountry in .such a healthy .condition that the Prime Minister was able to announce on behalf of the - Go.vernmemlt that the threat to this continent feacl passed. I am now 'completely satisfied that the charges which I made against the Menzies-Eadden Administration have been fully justified by the revelation of the facts.",30
49,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Barker) [12.33] - I am very happy to have this opportunity to follow in debate the Minister for Transport and Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward). In his speech, he covered a good deal of ground, and I propose to. follow .his example. The absence from this chamber to-^lay of 'certain members of the party to which I belong is absolutely inexcusable.",31
50,Mr CONTSLAN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,It was to be a fighting Opposition!,31
51,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I am a member of that section of the 'Opposition which does believe hi fighting. Every one of those dreadful statftment-s which were the subject of bitter debate in the last Parliament has been repeated today by the Minister. EveTy insult which was heaped upon my colleagues-of the Opposition, every brand and 'Stigma that has been put on them, has been renewed, anfl I should 5ike to know whether they propose to continue their association with Che Australian Advisory War Council, out of - which this controversy arose. Probably, they will retain their association with body, because they willingly carry every insult which the Minister heaps upon them. That is my view, and it is for publication. I propose to examine the defence position of Australia, and to remind ""FieldMarshal"" Ward of a few things that he has said in the past. No doubt the Minister desires to be promoted to the rank to which the leader of the Russians elevated himself not long ago. I recommend to honourable members a book entitled The Day of the Saxon. I have not read it for twenty years, but the Parliamentary Library has a copy of it. Published in 1910, the book contains maps of Australia and of the Pacific generally, and honourable members will find clearly laid down in those pages by one of the greatest military minds that the United States of America has produced, the areas that Australia would be able to defend in the event of a war with Japan. For nearly nine years, I have been a member of this chamber and in that period I have beard many debates on external affairs and the defence of Australia. Often I have heard the Minister declare that defensive preparations in Australia were not necessary. His colleague, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), even after this war broke out, asked, ""Who is this enemy against which the Government proposes to defend Australia? "" In 1937, the Lyons Government decided to increase the Militia forces from 35,000 to 70,000 men. I challenge any honourable member opposite, and I include the new vintage, to say that he assisted the Lyons Government in that matter.",31
52,Mr CONELAH,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,I did.,32
53,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Prob ably in Adelaide where the honourable member is not known. I invite any Minister to admit, as the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan) has done, that he rendered any assistance to the Government of the day in that matter. What did the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Makin) do? How often has the Minister for Transport and Minister for External Territories spoken in favour of increasing the strength of the Militia?",32
54,Mr FBOST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,When I spoke on the subject of universal training I did not have that the support of the honourable member.,32
55,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Eve r since I entered public life I have 3tood for complete, absolute and unqualified conscription. I cannot be more definite than that. The Minister for Repatriation (Mr Frost) would not have advocated universal training when he did if it had not been for the action of the then Premier of Tasmania in leading the Tasmanian Labour party along that line. The honourable gentleman will advocate conscription, calathumpianism, or anything else which the Australian Labour conference instructs him to advocate.",32
56,Mr FBOST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,W h at is wrong with that ?,32
57,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"There is everything wrong with it. The point which I make is that the Lyons Government received scant assistance from the Australian Labour party in its efforts to strengthen the defences of Australia. When hostilities began in 1939, the Labour party declared the struggle to .be a. capitalist or imperialist war. When, in December, 1939, the Prime Minister of the day (Mr Menzies) sought from Parliament authority to despatch units of the Australian Imperial Force overseas, every member of the Australian Labour party opposed the motion. Worse still, when the then Minister for the Army, Mr Street, introduced a bill to empower the Government to employ units of the Militia in Papua, New Guinea and the islands, which are now in the tender care of the Minister for Transport and External Territories, the honourable gentleman opposed the measure in one of the most vigorous speeches that I have ever heard him make. If he will refer to Hansard, he will see that his words were in this strain: "" If New Guinea and Papua have to be defended at all, they should be defended by the people who are foolish enough to live there. It is none of my business"".",32
58,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,That is not true.,32
59,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Word s to that effect appear in Hansard, unless they were expunged, as other statements have been. The Minister voted against the despatch of the Militia to New Guinea. Before the outbreak of war, the Mjenzies Government decided to compile a register of man-power, and the Labour party prevailed upon the right honourable gentleman to delete from the bill the provision that empowered the authorities to seek from each male person information regarding his military service. Instead of talking about having defended Australia, the Minister is one of the last who should refer to the subject. He has done absolutely nothing to support even the most elementary defence precautions. He has only attempted to divide the country on "" the Brisbane - line"" controversy. On various occasions I have assisted in the preparation of certain plans. Although I have not worked on "" the Brisbane line"" plan, I have no doubt that two or three different lines have been proposed .for the defence of Brisbane. I am sure that there is a line for the defence of Townsville, and other lines for the defence of Coff's Harbour, Port Stephens, Newcastle, Sydney, and PoTt Kembla. I know personally something about the plans for the defence of the southern parts of this continent. For instance, there are plans for the defence of Melbourne from attack from either the east or the west. It may surprise the Minister to learn that I was associated on one occasion with the preparation of plans for the defence of Adelaide. Therefore, on his reasoning, if it be reasoning Mr Clark interjecting,",32
60,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"The honourable member would be quite safe west of the Darling. One of the things which "" tickled me pink"" was the way in which certain honourable members opposite found it convenient to reside in Canberra after Japan entered the war. Before Pearl Harbour, you could not have kept them here with a battleship's anchor tied to each hand. They used to be on the train regularly on Friday afternoon, regardless of what was happening. These little things cause me great amusement. I watch my fellow men go by, and, still possessing a sense of humour, I can afford now and then to have a good laugh at some of the new-born patriotism of honourable members opposite.",33
61,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Sitting suspended from l.£5 to 2.15 p.m.,33
62,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"We should study carefully this rather momentous piece of political jugglery known as "" the Brisbane line"". The Minister for Transport was at great pains this morning to quote the views of a great number of people on the subject. Among others, he quoted the opinion of Mr Hanlon, a Minister of men the Government of Queensland. I have just met that honourable gentleman, and I have come to the conclusion that he is not at all a dangerous man. The Minister also used the name of Mr DwyerGray, the Treasurer of Tasmania. I know him moderately well. He has never struck me as a gentleman who knows very much about military problems in Australia or elsewhere. If he had to conduct military operations I believe the weapons would be feather dusters. I was not impressed by the remarks of the Minister in that regard. I do not wish to speak at great length on this subject, for some honourable members much more important than I may want to say something on it. Not one authority mentioned by the Minister this moruing could be considered, by any stretch of the imagination, as being qualified to express a weighty opinion on this subject. So far as I know, the Minister himself was the first person to make a reference to "" the Brisbane line "".",33
63,Mr BARNARD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Tell us what General MACArthur said.,33
64,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I am sorry that the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard) has mentioned General MACArthur's name. It is unfortunate that he has done so. I have an effective reply to the honourable member's interjection if I choose to use it. As one who has some understanding of military matters, I would say to the honourable member for Bass, who always becomes vocal on Friday afternoons, that I , also, have some knowledge of international relations and the customs and courtesies inevitably linked with the successful conduct of international affairs. For that reason, I regret that the Minister for Transport imported into this debate the name of any person who is not one of our own citizens. Some time after the Minister had first mentioned "" the Brisbane line "" in the kindly and friendly way for which he is so distinguished, he reiterated hi3 statements. 'The right honourable member for Darling Downs { Mr Fadden), who was then Leader of the Opposition, quite rightly took violent exception-well , perhaps not violent exception, but exception - to the .statements of the Minister, and insisted that the Prime Minister (Mr.. Curtin) should clarify the position, because if the right honourable member for Darling Downs and certain other honourable gentlemen who now sit on L'hi3 side of the House are guilty of the things that were charged against Miem before the elections, and that have been charged against them again this morning in a most emphatic .and violent way, they should be impeached for what could only be fittingly described as - treason. Certainly, tke conduct .alleged against them amounts to criminal negligence. From his place at the table in - this House, not long before the elections, in the presence of myself and a number of his henchmen the Prime Minister in his wisdom-and he has quite a lot of jjolitical wisdom-repudiate d everything that the then Minister for Labour and National Service had said. So strong were the Prime Minister's convictions om that occasion that he suspended the Minister, who thereupon took a seat on the back bench beside the honourable member for Melbourne { Mr Calwell). The question of an inquiry then arose. I am not one of the legal gentry of this place, but I well remember discussing the subject with the .then honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn). As soon as the question was raised I naturally took it for granted that leading King's Counsel who, at times, adorn the benches on this side of the chamber, would have taken into consideration the effect that parliamentary privilege would have on this issue. Any honourable gentleman who gave thought to the subject at that time should have recognized that .that issue was likely to arise. I do not desire to :say very much about the inquiry. Mr.^ Hou - Does not the honourable gentleman think that Parliament waived any question of privilege when it endorsed the action of the Prime Minister in appointing - a royal commission ? 31 r. Archie Gamer on.",33
65,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Th-.r e way be something in that contention. I ana only a 'common "" cocky"" and cowpuncher. On rural subjects I am always ready to talk "" turkey"", though I do - not wish to mix the flavours. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) was, in my view, entitled to adranee that argument. I take the - opportunity to say that he put the case very well this morning from the Opposition point of view, but we have to - recognize that it is not what the honourable member for Fawkner or I think; it is what the royal commission has dene. That is the all-important thing. The .next most important thing is the action of the Prime Minister after the royal commission had reported to the Governor General. At that time the Prime Minister said publicly that the then Minister for Labour and National Service would remain under suspension until Parliament had met and dealt with him. That is the crux and kernel of the whole question, and, in my opinion, it was not the Minister for 'Transport but the Prime Minister who should have answered at the table this morning. That responsibility is now more weighty and deadly than ever, seeing that the Minister for ""Transport reiterated his charges this morning. . Are we to accept the statements of the Minister for Transport or those of the Prime Minister? Are we to accept the view that in order to deceive Japan, :the Prime Minister had to put up .a bluff or a smoke screen? This morning the Minister for Transport conveyed the .impression to the House, on behalf of the Prime Minister, that because of the fine political balance in this chamber before the elections the Prime Minister, in a Machiavellian sort of way, was entitled to tell honourable members and the country that if the noyal commission reported in a certain way he would do something which he did not really' intend to do. The Opposition is entitled to be satisfied on these points. In my view, there should be some drastic action on this subject. I do not consider that this debate should terminate today, because the Minister for Transport has imported two or three aiew factors into the discussion. He has impugned the reputation of men who should be here today, and who should be given an opportunity to answer for the attitude they have adopted. I . am not one who considers himself to be his brother's, keeper",34
66,Mr FROST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Why are thay not here? Mr Archie CAMERON"" - They must answer that question for themselves. Why is the Prime Minister not here?",35
67,Mr FROST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"He is here. Mr AROHIE CAMERON"" - He is not in the chamber. After all, the Prime Minister is the Leader of the Government, just as the right honourable member for Kooyongis the Leader of the Opposition. Mr CoN.Ei.Aiv.:-The Prime Minister has more important things to do than to listen to this sort of "" tripe "". - Mr Archie CAMERON - The honourable member for Griffith need not listen unless he is fascinated by ""tripe"". The Minister for Transport made, a lot of quotations this morning-about the state of the defences of this country when the Ourtin Government assumed office. I took theopportunity during the luncheon recess to consult a volume of Hansard. I shall direct attention to a debate which occurred in this House on external affairs, in 1938, after the Munich crisis. On that occasion the present Prime Minister - this great champion of Australian defence, this gentleman whose, picture, with that of an eminent leader overseas was posted in many parts of my electorate during the election campaign-said I conclude by saying that a practical of economic progress in Australia:-the development of our industries, the payment of. today. decent wages, and the ensuring of good conditions so as to attract here citizens of the best type from other parts of theworldwill in itself be an enormous contributor our security. Shortly afterwards, the Estimates were discussed. I shall not quote the remarks of .the right honourable gentleman about collective security during the discussion of the Defence Estimates, though I feel strongly on the subject, because I was that time .a Minister in the Government which is. now beingcharged with the neglect of Australia's defence. But that occasion one of the first things that happened was that, the honourable ber for Dalley-the gentleman with whom yow, Mr Speaker, are well acquaintedmoved that the proposed vote for the Department of Defence be reduced by £1 as a protest against .the action, of the Lyons Government in providing for the establishment of the munitions annexes in which so much work is now being done in connection with the munitions production of Australia. In speaking to that amendment the present Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition, said1 We, as an Opposition, are opposed to the principle of incubating private vested interests in Australia in connection with the defence needs. Under the old feudal system,, in return for certain baronial rights which the King gave to his favorites, thosefa.vorites undercook to raise armies on. his behalf. We can say that that was a period in which defence was established on the basis of private enterprise. At the present time-, however, front the viewpoint of the. community, it is made in srtbstance: a communal obligation. I shall not quote at greater length from the right honourable gentleman's remarks because I have more important things to say, and honourable gentlemen opposite may read the speech for themselves. I remind them, however, that, many years ago, Jonathan Dymond, a noted English essayist, wrote an essay entitled, "" On a man's writing memoirs of himself "". Such records - are available concerning many honourable gentlemen opposite, and, if we were so minded, we could employ some industrious minions, as the Minister for-Transport has done, to collect extracts which could be hung, like a string of pearls, round the necks of some of the honourable policy gentlemen wbo adorn the treasury bench",35
68,Mr BBEEIT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Such a collection of extract's concerning the honourable memto ber would be like a. crown of thorns on his head. .,35
69,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I am quite prepared to stand up to anything that I have said. Long before the war occurred, as far back as 1935, I informed this House that the next, time a world w:ar at occurred and we bad France as an ally, France would let us down and crash. Men who were very friendly to me at on that time took violent exception to my remarks. If honourable, gentlemen oppomemsite care to examine the volumes of Hansard they will find also that long. before this war occurred I prophesied the boundaries in which a second Australian Imperial Force would serve. I said that they would lie well within the Cape, Cairo and New Zealand. Our Australian Imperial Force has not yet shifted beyond those boundaries. I said, too, on that occasion that a second Australian Imperial Force would never fight in France. No doubt some honourable gentlemen who were then sitting opposite me said things, though not quite loud enough for me to hear them!",35
70,Mr LAZZARINI,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Le t the honourable member tell us what he said about Russia.,36
71,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"What I said about Russia is well known, and do not qualify one word of it. I say to honourable gentlemen that, in any negotiations, Russia will be firm regard to its frontiers in Western Europe. I am quite sure that Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Esthonia will not be able to make any representations against the aggressive, imperialistic republic which has its seat of government in Moscow. Only a few days ago, a Newcastle newsachieved paper published the information that seven of ten American bombers that were missing from a raid on Paraninshur in Militia forces. the Kurile Islands had escaped in the wrong direction and landed on Russian soil. Their crews were interned, as were conscripts. other American crews after the raid on Tokyo. Honourable gentlemen opposite would be well advised to have little to say about Russia for some time to come, because big moves are ahead and big should send. contests are going on behind the scenes, of which, I presume, they know nothing and, I feel sure, would understand less if they were told anything about them. All had to say in regard to Russia in August, 1941, still stands; there is nothing that have yet to qualify. At the moment, however, we are on "" the Brisbane line Mr Calwell interjecting,",36

My electors were told in most emphatic language, pictorially and in other ways, "" These two men saved Australia"". Listening to the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) this morning, one would think he had done it almost off his own bat. I expect him to come here one of these days with a motion declaring that he was responsible for digging the river Murray channel and Sydney Harbour. He would I require parliamentary approval of that now statement; and no doubt, with the peace House as at present constituted, he in would get, it without much debate. In the matter of the salvation of this country, I quite frankly allow a little to Providence and a little to the mistakes of human enemies. Honourable gentlemen opposite must recognize that whatever measure of salvation we have has been due to the introduction into this country of the conscript forces of other countries, to back up our own",36
75,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,We did not ask for,36

The that I Dutch forces, the Free French, the British forces, the American forces, the I New Zealand forces-ever y man jack of them in Australia is a conscript. If the "". voluntary principle be involved, let me say that I went through the first World War as a volunteer, and that I have been for the last sixteen years. I volunteered for the second Australian exImperial Force, but the powers that be would not let me leave Australia, doubtless because they held the view that I would be missed too greatly by my friends opposite and there would be casualties among them due to heart failure, whilst others would die of remorse. I put this to those honourable members opposite wbo bave been such unqualified champions of the voluntary principle when it did not look as though volunteers would be needed: At the outbreak of the war, the volunteers had thundering little for which to thank the Commomvealth.",36

80,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"If can be said of this country at the outbreak of the war with Japan, let me tell the honourable member for Calare (Mr. Breen) that I was partly responsible for it. After the evacuation of Dunkirk, the Menzies Government, of which I was a member, packed up guns, ammunition and everything else that could be spared, and sent it to the defence of the United Kingdom. I dare any man in the Labour party-I would dare even the devil himself-to say that we were wrong. In the history of the British race, there never was a grander moment than that which followed the evacuation of Dunkirk. Had Winston Churchill been brought out here during the last three or four years, he would have been condemned as a nitwit in this Parliament, the simple reason being that* Winston Churchill, like certain men in this Parliament, in his day and generation was fool enough to go on active service. Eor too long throughout this war, in parliamentary and political circles, has active service and a knowledge of his subject by any member of this Parliament been regarded as a disqualification.

What, above all else, we want imported into this Parliament, is greater respect for political truth and honesty. I am not one who would stand with the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) and say that, just because it happened to suit us, we had put up an excellent big bluff. I have a counter for that sort of method. When one cannot afford to tell the truth in political or military matters, the safe and honest course is to say nothing at all.",37
83,Mr LAZZARINI,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,The honourable gentleman could not do that.,37
84,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"My capacity to hold my tongue on matters that ought to be kept secret will bear comparison with that of any honourable member of this House. Perhaps I am guilty of having said in this chamber, even during the course of this debate today, what not many other honourable members would say. It seems to be the view of too many honourable members that that the great body of our fellow citizens, who have not graced and adorned these green benches, do not understand what is happening here. Most of us are average men, and realise that the generality of mankind is not altogether foolish, but can judge the motives of other men. When putting out a smoke-screen, do not run away with the idea that the people outside are not able to judge what is happening behind it. They may not be able to detail happenings. They may not be able to lay a finger on this one and that one, and say that he has done this, that or the other; nevertheless they are keenly conscious of what is going on. The statement of Abraham Lincoln that ""you cannot fool all the people all the time "" still holds good.",37

Some day, when I shall still be here, my distinguished friend from Griffith will be once more working somewhere in the neighbourhood of ""the Brisbane line "". You cannot fool all the people all the time. There has been too much of a tendency to import into the controversy on "" the Brisbane line"" a political insinuation which the facts do not justify. No member opposite other than the Minister for Transport would do that, and none has attempted to do it. I hope that there will be some clarification of the position by the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin). Perhaps, having gained the most remarkable victory ever achieved by any leader at an election in Australia, he considers that matters of this sort are beneath his notice. He has not looked a very happy man since he came back here; f have seen only one smile on his face during the sittings of this Parliament. The Brisbane Line.""

Before a year has passed, the people outside who selected most of my friends on the government side will have a clear appreciation of what they did on the 2.t.st August. This issue is one of the worse-in fact, it is one of the foulestever imported into Australian politics. I do not care what the Minister for Transport says. We have a country of 3,000,000 square miles, with a coast-line of 12,000 miles, and a population of 7,000,000, of whom 50 per cent, are congregated in three or four big capital cities.",37

There were not many who, like myself, said in this place that he did believe in the League of Nations. I have never believed in it.

But for the work of the Menzies Government before this Government took office, honourable gentlemen would not today have anything to put north of ""the Brisbane, line"". Munitions are not produced in a hurry. I was a member of the Menzies Government for eight months in 1940,. and I know what was done towards putting this country on a sound munitions footing. F. also know the obstacles which some of us had to surmount. The Prime Minister was too wise to fake office until he knew that the Australian munitions factories founded by his predecessors were about to come into full production. The right honourable gentleman is a shrewd politician. He is, I should say, the shrewdest party tactician I have met in my seventeen years in politics. I have no time, for party tactics.

91,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Darling Downs-Leade r of the Australian Country party) [2.4S]. - The reason for this debate is obvious. who The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) has,, with his usual clarity, put the case on behalf of the Opposition. The matter is now bafore the House, I understand,, the Leader of the MinisOpposition (Mr Menzies) asked the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) to move the report of the royal commission be printed, thus affording an opportunity for it to be debated. Therefore, as one whose name has been associated with this Therefore, unsavoury matter, I am naturally dis2 appointed to find today, when on for debate, that only six or seven members of the Opposition' .are in their places. The public can be excused f o not treating the matter with the seriousmatters ness it deserves when some of those directly concerned in the allegations evince so little interest. I compliment the honourable member for Fawkner upon in your place. his 'speech. He possesses qualificaWhat tions which flliO'uld have received greater recognition from members of his own party on a recent occasion. An important principle is involved., ment. namely, the privilege enjoyed by members of Parliament. As for the tions themselves, they are on record in Hansard_, and also in the report of the royal - commissioner.. Honourable members must have been impressed by the fact that, although the Prime Minister had i previously .repudiated the statements the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward,), as is recorded in correspondence between the Prime Minister and myself, the M i ster in his .speech today re-opened whole subject .and repeated his allegathe tions. On the 14tb July last, the Prime Minister wrote the following letter the Minister for 'Transport:I have - forwarded to you, under separate cover a copy of the report of the royal eomin issioner in the matter of an inquiry a statement that there - was a document ing from the official files. I will not release the report to the press until you intimate that you have received the report. You will note that, because advanced by your counsel, vital questions in the terms of reference were beyond the power of ..the commissioner to deal with, the missioner ruling that counsel's submission must ha given effect. As a result, question Xo. 1 was not answered, .question No. 2 was given only^ a limited answer, and question 3 was unanswered because of the manner which question Nos. 1 and 2 were treated. On considering tihe report of the royal commissioner, the 'Government decided .that it was clear that, the raising of the issue the rights and .privileges of members of Parliament precluded a determination of substance of the questions involved in the terms of reference. These - matters, therefore, have not been decided, and the Government has directed that, as the question of the and privileges 'of - members of the T?arl'iaTnent is involved, the matter is - one which cannot he completed until a submission has been made to Parliament of the matters that have 'arisen. The Government has directed that this submission be made at the earliest opportunity. the substance of questions Nos. I, and 3 in the terms of reference are in it is called effect still sub judiee. The reasons which caused mc to direct you (o abstain from the administration of your office, therefore, continue and will continue r until the Parliament has dealt with - the involved. For these reasons, I now repeat my direction to you to abstain from performing any of the duties of your office, 'and have arranged for the Honourable B. J. liolloway, M.P., to continue to act for and is the position now? 'The Minister was certainly suspended, but the suspensaon did not continue u n t i l such time as the matter was submitted to Parlia",38
92,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,The Prime Minister has allegamade no submission to Parliament.,39
93,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"That is true. Nothing has happened since the writin g of - that latter to justify thu Prime Minister n lift in g the suspension. I repeat that of it is regrettable that the Opposition has not taken more seriously its position as the watchdog of the people. I recall n i - that the Leader of the Opposition said the only a little while ago that what Opposition lacked in numbers it - would make up in the vigour of its to debating. Obviously, he said, because - of its numerical weakness, the Opposition could not ensure that its policy would be implemented. It would have to into depend on vigorous debate to rouse the miss- - Government to an appreciation of its point of view. As a matter of fact, this is not a party matter-it concerns the of the plea Parliament as a whole. The Minister for Transport, capable comdebater that he is, slrillfully evaded the real issue. He brought the fight to our corner with ihis allegations that Australia No. was defenceless at fte time the Labour in Government assumed office. He has placed on record many statements in .support of I113 case, and so I can be excused of for quoting from speeches and statements the in order to show what was the defence the policy of the previous administration, and - what was the attitude of responsible members of the present Government to rights - proposals for strengthening Australia's defences. T i e Minister for Transport said that the defences of Australia were in a deplorable condition when the Labour party assumed office on the 7th October, 1941. At the time of the election in 1940, the war had been in progress for twelve months. It broke out in September, 1939, and Australia, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, automatically became a belligerent. Our Government went to the country in 1940 with a twelve months' record of war administration, and the people gave us a mandate to carry on, and confirmed our defence policy. Admittedly, the mandate was not a very effective one. Because of the relative strength of the parties, it was difficult to make of Parliament an effective instrument for legislation. ""What happened? En October, 1940, by arrangement with the then Opposition, we formed the Advisory War Council on which the Government and the Opposition had equal representation with four members each. The Labour party's representatives were the Leader (Mr Curtin), the Deputy Leader (Mr Forde), the present Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley) and the present Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin). Something akin to an all-party government to conduct the supreme direction of the war was set up within a month of the 1940 general elections.",39
94,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,It was not an all-party government.,40
95,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,It was an all-party administration.,40
96,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,It was merely an advisory council.,40
97,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"It was set up to consider and give advice upon all defence matters-matter s involving the strategic direction of the war. The Labour party representatives were most active. They attended meetings of the council armed with volumes of advice and complaints and the results of their inspection of munitions factories and annexes. Were the Labour party representatives dissatisfied ? Did they think that Australia was in a defenceless position? Did they believe that our policy was to throw Australia, particularly Queensland, to the wolves? If the answer to those questions is "" Yes "", they failed in their duty to their party and to the people as a whole by remaining silent and by remaining members of the council. But the answer is not "" Yes "" ; it is a decided negative. They were so satisfied with the condition of Australia that their leader asked me when I was Acting Prime Minister during the absence abroad of the right honourable member for Kooyong, to increase the membership of the council, which I readily consented to do. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) was added from the Labour party's side, and the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) from our side, so preserving the balance. If all the claims made today by the Minister for Transport were true and Australia was in an utterly defenceless position when Labour took office, instead of asking for the appointment of the right honourable member for Barton to the council, the right honourable member for Fremantle and his colleagues should have resigned and protested to Parliament and the country that the then Government was not doing the right thing by Australia. A further _ denial of the charges made by the Minister for Transport is contained in a statement made by the right honourable member for Fremantle on the 18th October, 1941, only eleven days after he became Prime Minister. The Minister for Transport today admitted that the Prime Minister bad made the statement, but offered as an excuse that it was necessary to bluff the Japanese.",40
98,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,The Prime Minister made that statement before the Japanese entered the war.,40
99,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Yes , six weeks before. This is what he saidThrough their membership of the Advisory War Council, most Ministers of the War Cabinet were familia r with Australia's war effort, and, since assuming office, the Government had made a broad review of the situation with the Chiefs of Staff and the Commander-in-Chief Far East. The Navy was at the highest pitch of efficiency, as demonstrated by the notable exploits of some of its ships overseas. The Home Defence Army was well trained and its equipment had been greatly improved. The strength of the A i r Force had been largely increased,' both in respect of home defence squadrons and the training resources of the Empire A i r Scheme. The equipment of the Air Force had also been - much improved. Finally, munitions production and the development of production capacity over a wide range of classes, including aircraft, was growing weekly. That is a clear and unequivocal statement by a sincere man entrusted with the destinies of the country. Who would cast douibt on the sincerity of that statement? The Prime Minister, when he made it , had been a member of the Advisory War Council for more than twelve months and knew the facts. If that statement is not suflicient to convince honourable members that the facts are not as the Minister for Transport would have them believe, I point out that the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde), who had also attended meetings of the Advisory War Council, was equally emphatic about our preparedness, because on the 20th October, 1941, less than a fortnight after Labour bad taken office he saidOur Army, Navy and Air Force are at a high standard of efficiency and are improving daily. On page 25 of Volume 167 of Hansard, the right honourable member for Fremantle, five months before he became Prime Minister, is reported as having said I claim that the war has been prosecuted the maximum of Australia's capacity. "" Maximum"" can mean else but maximum. That statement was made by a man with a full sense of his responsibilities and an intimate knowledge of the facts. At a Labour rally at the Sydney Town H all , on the 12th October, 1942', the Prime Minister said I have to pay tribute to the governments which preceded my own for the constructive work they have done in defence and the foundations they have laid. If those statements are not true and are not sincere, it is hard for any one to assess what the responsibilities of a public man are. A f t e r Labour took office, the Advisory War Council was not only continued, but also expanded and given enlarged powers. Therefore, the claim by the Minister for Transport that the Menzies and Fadden administrations had no regard for the need to defend Australia is completely refuted. But in case some honourable members yet remain to be convinced, I produce further evidence of the falsity of the allegations made by the Minister for Transport. It is contained in a publication The Job Australia is Doing issued on behalf of the Commonwealth Government by the Department of Information in March, 1943Before this war, Australia had not even built a motor car. But when Australia came in she had already supplied a wide range of war equipment to allied countries, including Great Britain, Egypt, South Africa, New Zealand, Fiji, the Netherlands East Indies, Hong Kong, Malta, Malaya, Burma, India and the Fighting French in the Pacific. Who supplied that equipment-this Government or that which preceded it? Will any responsible' member of this House doubt that it was our Government that, by its acceptance of the global strategy, enabled this country, when it was threatened with invasion, to claim and receive strong aid fro m its Allies, notably the United States of America? The isolationist policy which would have been applied in this country had the Labour party occupied the treasury bench in September, 1939, when war broke out, would have disqualified us fro m ever being able to ask for, let alone receive, the aid which has conferred on Australia its preto sent degree of safety. Australia became entitled to the aid it received because it nothing raised, equipped and despatched overseas the Australian Imperial Force, men of the Royal Australian A i r Force, ships and men of the Royal Australian Navy, and stripped itself of armaments in order to help Great B r it a in when it stood with its back to the wall after the withdrawal from Dunkirk. We paid for our right to ask for help in the battle to retain our title to this country. That aid came. It included American conscripts, men enlisted to serve wherever sent- a contrast with the limitations of service we have placed on our conscripts. The Minister for Transport cited as an authority in support of his claims as to the defenceless position of Queensland in 18j39, Mr Hanlon, the Minister for Health and Home Affairs in that State. It is well, therefore, that I should place on record a statement made by Mr . Hanlon on the Sth March, 1936The Minister for Health and Home Affairs, Mr Hanlon, indicated yesterday that he favoured the return of its war-lost colonies to Germany. Mr Hanlon was discussing a cable message which stated that the possible return of New Guinea or any of the former German colonies had never been contemplated in British Government quarters. it was obviously to the advantage of the A ustratiaii people, Mr Hanlon said, to have jiti-ong European nations interested in t'he I'acific, and possibly Australians would not feel so lonely if they had such a neighbour. A nation like Germany - with an ever growing population must geek colonial expansion That was M i . Hanlon's classic contribution to the basic defence of Australia, and the security of Queensland. When relations with Japan became very grave in February, 1941, I was Actiiug Prime Minister. the result of a decision of the Advisory War Council, the then Leader of the Opposition (Mr C u r t in ), the Leader of the Non-Communist Group of the Australian Labour party (Mr - committee Beasley) and I sounded .a joint note of warning to the Australian public. We pointed out - that the gravity of the .situation and the imminence of war with Japan. When and where hostilillM vould break out was a matter that we could noit .gauge. Shortly afterwards, the Parliament assembled, and on the 13th March, the present Minister for Transport and External Territories saidThe Acting Prime Minister knows that the Government issued the warning in an endeavour to hoax the public. When I protested a-gainst the use of that expression, he withdrew it and substituted the phrase ""unwarranted scare"". He declared that the warning had been issued for political purposes to frighten the workers, so that they would discontinue strikes. Subsequent events proved that the warning was justified. The Minister's attitude on that occasion was consistent with many of his public utterances. For example, oh the 5-th November, 1936, he statedSurely no one imagines for one moment that if Australia were unfortunate enough to conic under the heel of some foreign country, the whole of the 'existing population would be wiped out of existence, or that the material conditions of the {people relatively would be much worse than they are at present. Speaking on the Estimates on the 8th September, 1937, he said I .again ask the Minister for Defence - that any warlike equipment at .present in the East iSydney electorate is removed. I am not satisfied, therefore, that there any necessity for this cxitTeine haste on the part of this Government to arm Australia to the teeth in order that we might fight an imaginary foe. il/>. Fadden. On the 2nd November, .1.938, he spoke these wordsI t is amusing to hear people say that we shall not give up New Guinea. To these people I would say that if it should .become - necessacTy to defend our Mandated Territory, they should defend it themselves. 'On the 5th November, 19 36, when speaking on the Estimates be declared1 should not be prepared to take up arms against the workers of any country whether As they he German or of any other nationality. As a matter of fact, because I am not prepared to do that, I am not iprepared to tell others to do so. I believe, and judging .by statements made by honourable members on 'both sides of the it seems to be generally agreed, that Australia would find at very difficult, :iif not impossible, to defend itself against an aggressor. On the 17th November, 1936, he said-I am dealing with a particular item-the Minister himself has mentioned it-the proposal .to construct a naval vessel. I oppose .such a proposal on the ;gro.und that a naval vessel is not an arm of defence but is one of offence; and I suggest that if this Government were concerned purely with the defence of Australia, it would !be providing .only arms of defence and would not be huilding up .a - navy having a range extending far beyond the coast of Australia with the object of using it in the wars of other .peoples. The Australian Labour party .should not support suclr a policy. When the Loan Bill was being debated on the 28th A p r i l, 193S, and the defence of Darwin was receiving attention, the honourable 'gentleman saidThe Schedule to the bill sets out that £20.000 is to he expended upon defence works at Darwin. Can any of the military experts sitting behind the Government tell the House iin wJiat way the strengthening of the defences at Darwin can affect the - defence of Australia V The reason for the proposed expenditure at Darwin is that it is desired to establish an auxiliary base there, 'so tJhat, in the event nif Ithe British Fleet being driven from Singapore, it would .have another base to retire to in order that it might continue to defend Britain's possessions in the East. He would have left New .Guinea in a defenceless condition-a n easy prey to an to see aggressor-and he resisted the expenditure on defence works at Darwin. This is matter should - be clarified. The Minister has reiterated his charges regarding "" the - Brisbane line "". On a previous occasion, the Prime Minister repudiated them isi no wnef-'/vain manner; and I ask the right honourable gentleman' again to repudiate these unfair, unwarranted and 1 malicious allegations. If , as alleged, Australia had been in a defenceless condition when the Ourtin Government took office, the Australian Labour party can not, escape its share of the responsibility because of its partnership with the United Australia party and. the United Country party in the Advisory War Council.

I point out, Mr Speaker, that the Government Whip (Mr Sheehan) asked me to move the adjournment of the debate, and I api^eal to the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) to honour that arrangement.",43
102,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Order ! The Chair is not aware of any such arrangement.,43
103,Sir EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"The Minister for Transport and External Territories (Mr Ward), who has spoken in his own defence, has endeavoured to obscure the three simple points at issue in this The first is the important question of parliamentary privilege, the second concerns a matter of opinion or political judgment.,, and the third relates, to a matter of fact. On the question of parliamentary privilege, the House was. entitled to a declaration by the Prime Minister early in the debate regarding the position of the Minister whom he suspended. He made a definite statement when that gentleman had appealed .through his barrister for the maintenance of his privileges as a member of Parliament. He said that the Parliament should be the judge in this matter, and added that, in the meantime, the honourable member would be suspended from his ministerial duties. Yet before the Parliament has dealt with the matter, the Minister is again in his place, and is actively carrying out his functions as a Minister. The whole subject of parliamentary privilege is also involved in another aspect, it would be intolerable, indeed, if an honourable member should be able to make statements in this Parliament regarding matters or persons without regard to the interests of people outfide who might desire an inquiry into the truth of the. statements. This matter of resting behind parliamentary privilege should not be dealt with in the off-hand manner which the Government is adopting. We are entitled to a statement by PAGE) the Prime Minister before the debate is concluded. As the Leader of the Houst/ he must guard its traditions. I consider that it should have been made at the beginning of the debate. The other two matters raised are of vital importance, and they should have been dealt with by the head of the Government, and not by the Minister who has spoken. What will be the position if, as soon as an inquiry is desired as to the truth of certain statements, the sittings of the House are brought to n conclusion? In this particular instance, f am discussing a political issue which could be determined by the electors. Apparently they have given a verdict upon, it and I do not. cavil at it, but I am concerned about the preservation of the privileges of this Parliament and about the redress of just grievances of individuals. Erom the first meeting of the British Parliament the practice has been, and the Standing Orders have matter. been framed accordingly, to ensure freedom of debate, so that any legitimate grievance may be ventilated. A defmifv obligation rests on the Parliament to ensure a fair deal to the public. I am gravely concerned at the off-hand way in which this matter has been treated at a time when the whole of the members of the Opposition are not in attendance. So much for the question of privilege. The matter of opinion that remains to be decided is whether the retention in the Cabinet of a Minister, who has practically given to the Prime Minister and to his colleagues the lie direct and ths 1 lie indirect, will lead to a negation of responsible government and the destruction of Cabinet authority. For 240 years, parliaments have been building up the tradition of Cabinet responsibility with regard to the control of the Executive. Having done so much in that direction we should be most careful that we do not break down that principle. The electors of East Sydney and a majority of the Labour caucus have expressed the opinion that the retention of a Minister in the circumstances to which I have referred is not a negation of responsible government.

SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.,44
105,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Fremantle-Prim Minister) [3.37] - I move That the House, at its rising adjourn a date and hour to be fixed by Mr Speaker, which time of meeting shall be notified by Speaker to each member by telegram or letter. The Government needs time to deliberate upon important, matters now engaging its attention. In the event of an emerto gency or any matter arising which warfor rants the calling together of honourable members, the Parliament will be sumTo-day moned forthwith.",44
106,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Barker) [3.38] - I cannot allow this motion to be agreed to without protest. I am mindtrate ful of other days, when the country already at war, and when the Prime Mintime ister (Mr Curtin), as Leader of the Opposition, was most emphatic as necessity for a monthly meeting of the House of Representatives. I recall that later, on a Friday morning he agreed on behalf of the Government to a proposal to that effect. During the last Parliament the general practice, when an adjournment of the nature now proposed was granted, was to place a maximum, time limit on the power* of Mr Speaker to keep the should be kept House in recess. As the present motion is worded there is no such time limit. It has been customary in times gone by for the Minister submitting such a motion to acquaint the House of the maximum period for which he proposed that the House should remain in recess.",44
107,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"We shall meet again early in the New Year, unless an emergency arises in the meantime.",44
108,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I look upon that as a long recess. When the new regulations with regard to coal are promulgated, and the citizens of Sydney are told that they cannot have so many tram-cars as in the past to take from them to the beaches, there will probably be some interesting developments. I agree wholeheartedly with vvhat the Prime Minister said from the Opposition benches over three and a half years ago, when he declared that in time of war it was the duty of the Parliament to keep a close watc'h on the actions of the Executive. For all the information we have received during the present sittings regarding the intentions of the e Government, this Parliament need not have met at all. We are no better into formed today regarding what is in the air than we were when we adjourned last Mr June. In view of the present position with regard to the coal-mining industry, and bearing in mind other developments that may occur, it is of the utmost importance place a time limit upon the period which you, Mr Speaker, are to be permitted to keep the House in recess. is the 15th of October, and there is still a period of over two months to Christmas. A lot of Cabinet work can be done in a month if Ministers concenon their work and are of one mind was and heart. The suggestion that a long is required for the preparation of legislation leads me to believe that things to the may not be just what they seem.",44
109,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party) [3.41] - The Australian Country party is of the opinion that the Parliament should not go into recess for any long period. Many important problems, both internal and external confront us, and the representatives of the people in close touch with what is happening in the world. The only means by which that can clone is for the Parliament to meet fredragged quently with as short recesses as possible. i have no desire to embarrass the GovernPrevious ment in its administration, because I have some appreciation of the difficulties with which it is faced. It has just come back from the electors and must have time to prepare its legislative programme. ever, having regard to the gravity of world conditions, I urge that every opportunity be given to the representament; tives of the people to meet so that may be kept in touch with developments in international affairs. The Opposition wishes to co-operate with the Governassurance ment in assisting to solve the problems called together. facing this country by meeting as frequently as possible.",44
110,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Fremantle-Prime Minister) [3.43] - in reply- I agree with the views which have been expressed, f would have put in the motion Minister) [is.45] - I movea date limiting the period for which the Parliament should remain member in recess but for the dangers in the determination herent in such a motion; we may a date a week or a fortnight too early. The statement that I made yesterday relation to the coal-mining industry relates to a matter concerning which Parliament is entitled to explanations should the Government's proposals not productive of good results. I say that frankly. I shall ask you, Mr Speaker, to summon the Parliament immediately the Cabinet is in a position to place legislation before it, or, in the event of some development, either within or outside Australia, which would of itself provide adequate justification for our assembling here. I do not know what period will be required to prepare the legislative programme for our next sittings, nor do I know the nature of all the legislation that will then be brought forward. Some of it will be of a highly technical character and may take longer to prepare than we expect.",45

112,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"On other occasions I suggested that course, only to discover that honourable members, who come from all parts of Australia, have be expressed great resentment at being to Canberra to attend a sitting lasting only a week or a fortnight. governments experienced the same difficulty, but having regard to what has been said today and to the fact that the views expressed reflect my own mind on this subject, I shall arrange for the HowParliament to be summoned immediately the Government's legislative programme is ready for submission to the Parliaor if prior to that time, there is they any development, either internal or external, which would of itself justify the summoning of Parliament, I give an that honourable members will be Question resolved in the affirmative.

114,Mr CALWELL,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO ALL,"Melbourne-Minister for Information) [3.46] - On the 13th October, 1943, the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) asked me a question relating to the Digest of Decisions and Announcements. This publication was commenced by the present Government in October, 1941, and is issued on the authority of the Prime Minister here (Mr Curtin). The purpose of the publication is to provide honourable members and members of the Senate, Commonwealth and State ments, the press, and a large number of organizations in Australia, with an authentic and factual digest of decisions .and announcements made by the Commonwealth Government. It is also distributed overseas; where it has been found to be of great value to our representatives in other countries. I believe that the majority of honourable members find this publication of value in their work, and «u!y today the honourable member for Fawkner himself quoted extensively from it during the debate on ""the Brisbane line "". Issue No. 62 of the Digest did contain the verbatim text of the Prime Minister's policy speech at the general election. It was included because it was thought desirable that it should be permanently on record. Tbat, issue was not published until after polling day.",45
115,Mr HOLT,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO ALL,"What about the policy speeches of the leaders of the Opposition parties ? Mr CALWKLI . - It will be quite petent for any future government to conyour tinue publication of the Digest, which is not a political publication but coloured record of decisions announcements. On the 12th October, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Chambers) addressed to me a question concerning the broadcasting of records of sporting events. The Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley) has submitted the following reply:The Australian Broadcasting Commission advises that arrangements are already in force for broadcasting through the short-wave transmitters on Saturday evenings for the inforbility, mation of the fighting forces in New Guinea and other areas a programme summarizing results of, and oom.nien.ting on, sporting events.

119,Mr CURTIN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO ALL,"Fremantle - Prime Minister) [3.50] - in reply-Ha d I been conscious of any expectation by honourable members that the House would not again meet before Christmas, I should most certainly have availed myself earlier of the opportunity to convey to you, Mr .

125,Mr BEASLEY,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO ALL,"The answers to the honourable, member's questions are as follows::aaid 1 and 2. No moneys have yet been paid. The circumstances are that about six week? ago, the owner ceased operations at this mine, and intimated that lie would not re-open unless he received au increased price of approximately 3s. Cd. a ton. The Coal Commission directed that the mine he immediately re-opened, and simultaneously gave an undertaking that it would investigate the finances of the mine and pay such subsidy as was reasonably justified. This undertaking was limited to a period of six weeks, as in that time it was thought that a complete investigation would be concluded. It was found, however, that no proper books of account were kept, and consequently the investigation was more prolonged than anticipated. A report, 'which will be referred to the Prices Stabilization Committee, is now being made to the Commission. 3. Implementation of the recommendations referred to would require the expenditure of capital in addition to the subsidy found to he payable. The fact is that the mine is not an economical producer. It employs 24 men for a.n output of 20 tons per day, and the Commission feels that it would not be justified in spending Commonwealth funds on its further development-at least until a boring programme, which has now been undertaken on this field by the Victorian Mines Department, has been concluded.

WOMEN'S LANDABMY .",49
136,Mr HOLLOWAY,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO ALL,"On the 7th October a question, without notice, was asked by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis) of , the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in relation to the Women's Land Army. It must be pointed out; that the Australian Women's Land Army is not an enlisted service as are the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force and the Australian Women's Army Service, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service and the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, and therefore has not been, granted exactly the same privileges, as have been accorded to the services. Cabinet did approve of the Women's Land Army being granted a status akin to that, of the women's service auxiliaries, and pursuant to this decision similar privileges have been granted as far as possible. For example, members of the Women's Land Army are granted free railway travel to their homes for the purpose of enjoying their paid annual holiday leave of twelve working days. The question of extending travel concessions to enable members of the Land Army to visit their homes more frequently is at present under consideration by the Director-General of Land Transport. Members of the Women's Land Army are also admitted to a number of clubs and hostels on equal footing with members of the women's service auxiliaries. Recently the uniform and clothing issue has been increased, so that today the issue compares very favourably with that made to members of the services. The question of granting special post and telegraph concessions was taken up with the Postmaster-General's Department. However, there are certain technical difficulties in the way of granting such concessions, as correspondence to members of the Land Army would be addressed to private addresses and there could be no suitable check on correspondence sent by members. Moreover, it was considered that if post and telegraph concessions were granted to meinbers of the Land Army similar claims would probably be made by other nonservice organizations, such as the Civil Constructional Corps. So far as attendance at special picture programmes for the services is concerned, this is a matter entirely for negotiation with the appropriate bodies, and there for I am asking my deputies in the various States to approach such persons with a view to obtaining for members of the Australian Women's. Land Army the same privileges as are extended to the women's services.
